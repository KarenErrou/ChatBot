	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie and own a copy of it. It's what I would call a melodrama but has great characters good pacing and a tightlywritten script. In addition George Duning's music score is beautiful and haunting. Joan Crawford dominates the movie and her performance is over the top at times but I think the other actors hold their own very well  Ms. Crawford does not overpower them. The other characters  Wendell Corey as the naive and deluded husband Lucile Watson as the boss's shrewd but likable wife and Viola Roach I think as the Craigs' housekeeper are all wellfleshedout characters and the performances are excellent. I don't think there's an actor in the whole movie who isn't memorable.The lengths to which Harriet goes to insure the perfection of her home are comical at times. She scolds Mrs. Harold sp? the housekeeper for not remembering to close the drapes after 1100 every morning. When she and Clare her cousin are out of town visiting Harriet's mother Harriet has Clare calling everybody under the sun in her neighborhood to find out why there's nobody home. Clare tells Harriet that when she got no answer at the Craig number she even had the operator check the number to be sure the phone wasn't out of order! There are many memorable scenes in this film but some that I thought were particularly good were the scenes where Harriet visits her mentally ill mother in a sanitarium. Harriet simply cannot penetrate the state of oblivion that her mother dwells in to block out the world and she's at a loss to know what to do or how to communicate with her mother. Ms. Crawford does a good job of conveying her sadness and frustration. It is a poignant scene serving to humanize Harriet and point up the fact that she does have genuine feelings for someone. Afterward she confides her worries to the doctor played by Katherine Warren and the conversation between the two women is very revealing. I also enjoyed the scene where she and Mrs. Harold lock horns about the running of the house  Mrs. Harold isn't intimidated by Harriet and gives as good as she gets.This is a great vehicle for Joan Crawford Wendell Corey and in fact everybody in the movie. Give it a look!".

I have an issue with reviewers who are constantly comparing characters on the screen with the actors who portray them. Harriet Craig was a character and that is all. There are parallels between the lives of the character and Joan Crawford herself but one should not go so far as to say they are the same! Joan Crawford is a woman of many mysteries. Every account you could possibly read about her life is full of contradictions was she good or was she bad was the ruthless and cruel or was she generous and kind? She was probably all of these things and like Harriet Craig a complicated nonconventional and independent woman at war with the world.This is where the comparison ends. The character in the film is a compulsive liar and manipulator. Harriet Craig lies about anything and everything in the spider's web she builds around her. Joan Crawford's performance is fierce and chilling in its complexity. This is a woman of astounding talent playing a character worthy of that talent. This is one of only a handful of roles Crawford ever played that allowed her to really act which she does so well you will forget all about those other great actresses which usually claim all the credit.If 1950 was not such a tough year I'm convinced Joan would have received an Oscar nomination for the performance. The film itself was worthy of a nomination and as the advertising art claimed was one of the five best pictures of the year. I think it is comparable in quality to ALL ABOUT EVE and SUNSET BLVD. and certainly Crawford's performance is on par with the leads in those films and one of the best of her career! One last final note a feminist take on HARRIET CRAIG may emphasize that Harriet was just a woman trying to survive the sexist times...but Wendell Corey was such a good and nice husband believing in their equality that I don't buy it. Harriet was a woman hurt by her times and unfortunately taking out her mistrust of men on her innocent and good husband as well as others around her. Harriet was in the end a victim of her own prejudice and selfish compulsive lies.".

Remade in 1950 with Joan Crawford commandeering the part of the domestic despot the movie takes on a dimension that helped define camp.  It also offers an unadulterated middleperiod glimpse of the controlling monsters she had begun Mildred Pierce Humoresque and continued Torch Song Johnny Guitar Queen Bee to play on film.  And if there is a sliver of verity in her adopted daughter Cristina's report from the front lines such roles paralleled her offscreen personality.It's a parable about the dangers of social ascendancy an illustration of Thorstein Veblen's view of the affluent wife as agent of conspicuous consumption.  Joan Crawford's Harriet Craig has it all a husband in a grey flannel suit on his way up the corporate ladder Wendell Corey and so can buy her what she most desires property and position.  She's obsessed with who does and does not fit in with what she refers to as our set' as she strikes poses in her perfect and perfectly dull uppermiddleclass abode.That her only interest in her husband is as a meal ticket is revealed by her avoiding her wifely obligations under the pretext that bearing children would be dangerous.  But she's not content to leave him be maybe to enjoy a little action on the side what might the other members of their set' think?  She craves total control.  When he's about to go out of town on a business trip thus slithering out at least temporarily from under her oppressive thumb she intervenes lying to his boss that he's a compulsive gambler.   Finally of course the worm turns....  But in the closing shot when Crawford regally ascends her curved staircase alone among the splendor of her possessions you wonder who's really won after all.This soapish melodrama remains surprisingly riveting.  Perhaps it's the extra touch of authenticity Crawford brings to her portrayal Mary Tyler Moore played a later version of this upscale shrew in Ordinary People then of course there's always Martha Stewart.  The movie preserves an uncanny sense of upward mobility in America circa midcentury a lugubrious selfimportance that has not alas vanished from the land.".

Joan Crawford in FULL authority matched only by her even more imperious turn in the later Queen Bee runs her ideal house and the people in it as though she were a puppeteer and her husband and servants are nothing more than marionettes at her disposal. The fun begins right off the bat as the staff trudges up and down her magnificent staircase and flutter about tending to her every whim. None of this is good enough for her though. She takes turns knocking the wind out of each of their sails for things like taking too long using the wrong steps and allowing unwanted flowers to enter her home. Her attention to detail and monstrous obsession with order HAD to influence the makers of the characterassassinating but uproariously funny Mommie Dearest. Every move Crawford makes in this film is calculated and played for maximum impact. Her expressions are tight and telling. It's impossible to take one's eyes off her...especially with her array of stylishly scary outfits and severely unflattering hair. There's a perverse thrill in watching Crawford browbeat Grandma Walton Corby! Battered husband Corey often cast as dull or menacing men is a perfect counterpart here with a rare chance to show off some of his charm and appeal. Watson adds some sly wisdom to the proceedings as Corey's boss's wife and McKinney stands up to Joan very well as a longterm maid. At 94 minutes the film is PERFECT entertainment when one is in the mood for some campy classic fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Casting Joan Crawford as Harriet Craig was the perfect decision.  She stars in this gloomy melodrama as a woman whose compulsion for cleanliness and complete control ultimately destroys her.  I have heard before that this movie was written as a comedy which is quite evident in the original version Craig's Wife starring Rosalind Russell but due to Crawford's coldness in playing Harriet the tone of the movie completely changed. Don't get me wrong it does have its amusing moments as unintentional as they might be.  We see Crawford act completely condescending towards everyone she comes in contact with.  It is made quite obvious that Harriet manipulates her husband Walter who believes Harriet is the perfect wife by keeping him happy in the bedroom. Some rather suggestive dialogue even for 1950. The absolute best is when Harriet holds a dinner party for Walter's boss. She seems completely rude to her guests who all coincidentally happen to be over 50 making Harriet look like a glamour girl. Much of what makes this movie so amusing is the way in which the dialogue is presented as well as Crawford's ridiculous gestures. My that's a lovely vase.' exclaims one of the guests pointing towards Harriet's most prized possession. It's MingDynasty replies Harriet proudly displaying her vase like some prizegirl on a gameshow. Harriet seems not to feel compassion for anyone and tolerates no mistakes. I was wondering if you ever intended on serving the coffee my guests have been waiting for quite some time! Harriet shouts at her maids causing one of them to drop a teacup. Harriet's looks as if she is about to explode as the cup shatters on the floor. I'm so sorry Mrs. Craig! Yes of course your sorry but sorry won't mend my broken tea set! sneers Harriet as she fires the maid. The movies seems to keep building just to show us how wicked Harriet is including a visit to her husband's boss which is completely unforgettable.  She interferes with her cousin's love life almost causes her husband to lose his job fires all of her staff and to top it off is mean to the little boy next door. What was Harriet Craig's Lie? proclaimed the posters and advertisements for this movie. The answer Her entire existence. The lies just continue to pour out one after the other until everyone is so far driven by it they leave. But does Harriet learn her lesson? Of course not even the final line in the movie is a lie. So in the end all we see is Harriet with the only companion to whom she's stayed true...her house. This movie is by far one of my favorite Joan Crawford movies and what's really coincidental about it Harriet Craig the character almost foreshadows Joan's persona in Christina Crawford's trash novel Mommie Dearest.  Perhaps Christina saw this movie too many times and confused the facts.  If you liked this movie you'll LOVE Joan Crawford in Queen Bee. It's like Harriet Craig but set in the south! Mark Thomas".

Don't get me wrong it does have its amusing moments as unintentional as they might be.  We see Crawford act completely condescending towards everyone she comes in contact with.  It is made quite obvious that Harriet manipulates her husband Walter who believes Harriet is the perfect wife by keeping him happy in the bedroom. Some rather suggestive dialogue even for 1950. The absolute best is when Harriet holds a dinner party for Walter's boss. She seems completely rude to her guests who all coincidentally happen to be over 50 making Harriet look like a glamour girl. Much of what makes this movie so amusing is the way in which the dialogue is presented as well as Crawford's ridiculous gestures. My that's a lovely vase.' exclaims one of the guests pointing towards Harriet's most prized possession. It's MingDynasty replies Harriet proudly displaying her vase like some prizegirl on a gameshow. Harriet seems not to feel compassion for anyone and tolerates no mistakes. I was wondering if you ever intended on serving the coffee my guests have been waiting for quite some time! Harriet shouts at her maids causing one of them to drop a teacup. Harriet's looks as if she is about to explode as the cup shatters on the floor. I'm so sorry Mrs. Craig! Yes of course your sorry but sorry won't mend my broken tea set! sneers Harriet as she fires the maid. The movies seems to keep building just to show us how wicked Harriet is including a visit to her husband's boss which is completely unforgettable.  She interferes with her cousin's love life almost causes her husband to lose his job fires all of her staff and to top it off is mean to the little boy next door. What was Harriet Craig's Lie? proclaimed the posters and advertisements for this movie. The answer Her entire existence. The lies just continue to pour out one after the other until everyone is so far driven by it they leave. But does Harriet learn her lesson? Of course not even the final line in the movie is a lie. So in the end all we see is Harriet with the only companion to whom she's stayed true...her house. This movie is by far one of my favorite Joan Crawford movies and what's really coincidental about it Harriet Craig the character almost foreshadows Joan's persona in Christina Crawford's trash novel Mommie Dearest.  Perhaps Christina saw this movie too many times and confused the facts.  If you liked this movie you'll LOVE Joan Crawford in Queen Bee. It's like Harriet Craig but set in the south! Mark Thomas";

STEVENS whose romance she breaks up by telling lies.Hubby WENDELL COREY remains completely unaware of her machinations until twothirds of the story when he starts to realize that Harriet has not been telling him the truth. Her biggest mistake is giving his employer the false notion that he's careless with money and heavy responsibilities. Corey gets wind of her little talk and then bit by bit he begins to strip away all the deceit and deception she's been practicing on him and his friends.It's a well crafted study of a woman driven to possess someone but unable to trust any man because of her discovery as a child that her father was a twotimer cheating at the office with another woman. The character is very much like the one that Ben Ames Williams created in Leave Her to HeavenEllenconsumed by the need to possess someone and willing to lie at all costs to keep him at her side.Crawford is effective in the role only occasionally rising to moments of theatrical hysteriacoldfaced with eyes glaring in dramatic closeupsbut director Vincent Sherman keeps the performance well controlled throughout most of the film.WENDELL COREY is excellent as the bamboozled husband effectively underplaying in his usual style but with such a direct gaze that his sincerity counteracts Crawford's well played deceptions. Their final confrontation after a series of lies have been uncovered gives the film a strong ending.

The scene where Walter confronts Harriet about her lies was brilliantly played by both Crawford and Wendell Corey. Scenes like this are often melodramatic or just not believable.

He was able to convey anger disappointment and even love all at the same time. The moment when he found out that Harriet had lied about not being able to have children was just heartbreaking.

Wendell Corey was still getting work wherever mahogany was called for and he did about as well as anyone with the thankless part of Craig who is there merely as something  as opposed to someONE  for Harriet to fool foil and manipulate. Inevitably of course she gets her comeuppance although she was never a magnificent Amberson so much as an insignificant Craig.";

	schema:headline " A powerful performance by Joan Crawford";
	schema:reviewBody "Joan Crawford is Harriet Craig a manipulative insecure woman who has to control everything around her in this 1950 film also starring Wendell Corey K.T. Stevens Lucile Watson Allyn Joslyn and Viola Roche.The director Vincent Sherman knew how to get a good performance out of Crawford and did so several times in Goodbye My Fancy and The Damned Don't Cry. He described her as a very bright knowledgeable woman when it came to every aspect of filming. Here Crawford is a cold manipulative bitch married to hapless Walter Corey and as is implied the sex is great. Pretty soon he forgets that he's uncomfortable in his own house and that Harriet has isolated him from his friends and things he used to enjoy and also that she can't have children  so she says. Harriet is unfortunately stuck with the old Craig family housekeeper Mrs. Howard who continues to be a burr in her saddle. Mrs. Howard sees through Harriet as does the boss' wife Watson. She recommends a promotion which will require Walter to spend some time away from dear Harriet in China. When Harriet finds out she has a fit and makes sure the boss decides against sending him. Wouldn't want Walter gambling away the company money while drunk now would we? Harriet's niece Clare Stevens is made to feel extremely grateful by Harriet so she works for Harriet for free. When Harriet finds out a worker at Walter's lab is interested in Clare she tells Clare he's a womanizer who brags about it. Harriet is a piece of work.The saddest part of all of this is that I know someone like Harriet and believe me this portrait is only slightly exaggerated! They are sad cases. They make the lives of everyone around them miserable. And they aren't happy people.Crawford is great in the role and has been said she plays this type of part very well. She has the regal looks the voice and the requisite chilly delivery. For those who say this was the real Crawford no one knows for sure. I don't think anyone deals with the woman herself at this point only a plastic persona. She had to have been a lot more charming than Harriet and also unlike Harriet capable of letting down her hair once in a while and having a good time. Crawford the actress had many more sides to her than the Queen Bee and Harriet Craig persona. I think she was at her best in A Woman's Face and Possessed the second one which show what she could really do. I never felt she was great in comedy but she was a hard worker who could do drama well.Wendell Corey does a good job as a man who loves his wife his work and his friends and has to walk a thin line. The rest of the cast is uniformly very good and the Craig house is gorgeous if you like living in a museum. I'm really talking about the layout.As a spoiler I think it would have been a riot if after what we see in the film Walter ended up with the widow next door. Who knows? Maybe he did.".

A lot has been said about the similarities between the character of Harriet Craig and Joan herself. Perhaps that's why Joan's performance is so superb. She plays the character of Harriet so effortlessly. Wendell Corey is terrific as her husband. Through most of the movie he's a pushover but when he finally realizes who his wife really is and what she's capable of look out! It's a very good drama but also some funny parts. Moves along at a crisp pace. Unlike most dramas from the period and today really it doesn't overstay its welcome and pad the length for another twenty minutes. Definitely recommended.".

	schema:headline " Another Wonderful Performance from Crawford";
	schema:reviewBody "Harriet Craig 1950  out of 4Forgotten Columbia film about a wife Joan Crawford who cares only about her possessions her way of life and anything that involves her. Her blind husband Wendell Corey soon starts to realize that he's not married to the type of woman he thought he was. HARRIET CRAIG is a film that doesn't get talked about too often when it comes to Crawford but when you step back and look at the work she did starting with MILDRED PIERCE you can't help but call this another winner. As I go through these postMGM Crawford films I must say that my respect for her continues to grow because she took on all sorts of roles and did a wonderful job at all of them. There's just something so evil and cold about her character here and it's something that perhaps lived inside of the actress. If MOMMIE DEAREST had been written like this film it would have been a masterpiece. If Faye Dunaway's performance was as great as what Crawford delivers here then I think she would have been willing to talk about it. I mention that film because the type of character that film portrays Crawford as is pretty much the type she's playing here. The coldness of this character is something that you'll certainly hate but the constantly lying and the way she puts herself before anything else just makes this one of the most memorable characters out there. What I loved about Crawford's performance is this bubbling evilness that you can feel with her character and you just get the feeling at any second she's willing to make something worse just to benefit herself. Corey also deserves a lot of credit as the husband as he makes for a very sympathetic character. The sequence when everything finally breaks and the two go at it is rather priceless in regards to the brilliance of the acting. The supporting cast includes good performances by Lucile Watson K.T. Stevens William Bishop Ellen Corby and Viola Roache. HARRIET CRAIG is a film that's not often talked about which is a real shame because Crawford's performance certainly deserves more attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "That is how maid Ellen Corby describes her boss Mrs. Craig in this third version of George Kelly's Pulitzer Prize Winning Play. Rosalind Russell's Harriett was a young woman with definite mental problems in the 1936 version. But she at least had youth on her side so with psychological treatment it is obvious she could have made necessary alterations to change her into a better person. But Joan Crawford's middleaged Harriet is really beyond help. She's deliberately cruel treating servants with the condensation of Leona Helmsley and rubbing her power over them and everybody else in the house she worships with glee. Only housekeeper Viola Roache and maid Ellen Corby see her for who she truly is although a few of husband Walter's friends see right through her and are blatantly uncomfortable when in her presence.In probably his best performance bland Wendell Corey adds life to Walter who slowly wakes up to his wife's evil manipulations which include lies not in Russell's version. Where Crawford succeeds in this performance is making Harriett's sexuality more blatant verbalized as her part of the bargain. K.T. Stevens seems a bit too worldly to be presented as a naive young woman. Watch her in the previous year's The Port of New York to see her as a film noir femme fatal role. She would later enter daytime soap immortality as the initially veiled mother from hell Vanessa Prentiss on The Young and the Restless passiveaggressively using her own death to try and destroy her hated daughterinlaw's life. Amusing performances by Allyn Joslyn as a playboy friend of Corey's and Lucille Watson as Corey's boss's lifeloving wife add humor. I wanted to see a scene with Watson getting the truth from her husband Raymond Greenleaf playing Walter's boss. Her presence is ironic considering that she played the wise mother of Crawford's rival Norma Shearer in the classic movie version of The Women. The business aspect of Harriet's manipulations add a new dimension to her character which leads to the revelation of one of the most malicious lies a wife can tell a husband. Fans of Mommie Dearest will take great pleasure in making comparisons to this and Crawford's 1955 melodrama Queen Bee. When I first saw this as a teenager I did not pick up on the psychological aspects of Crawford's character truly a master at manipulation and using sexuality to get what she wanted yet declining it when it didn't suit her purpose. Her mannish hairstyle makes her Harriett much more intimidating than Russell's kindergentler and thus more dangerous version. Crawford chews the scenery including that oh so precious vase yet you feel the pain inside her when she breaks down and reveals all the truths and feel sorry for her when it all comes crashing down on her. She's a model not only for the manhating realm of certain kind of feminists but for anybody who puts social propriety and their own needs above those they claim to love. I wouldn't want a relative or friend like Harriet Craig but she's somebody who is fascinating to watch rise then crash and burn. You really can envision Harriet telling maid Corby When you clean the floor you have to move the tree!".

That poor thing would not have survived in our family. You know how poor white trash do everything on a sofa except sit on it!! LOL I really thought it was a bit much how when Harriet goes to visit her mother in that nursing home it was so spacious!! Man I wish I had a bedroom that large!! LOL And how sweet of Harriet to bring her mother washcloths as a gifthow thoughtful a gift for mama!! LOL I know I am making fun of this movie but I do love this film very much. I only wish that someone would show Craig's Wife with Rosalind Russell as I have heard that this version is superior to Joan's version and I would like to make my own choice as to which is better. I give this film a 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody " Wives may be a little extra trouble now and then but they're mighty handy gadgets to have around the house. This movie is like a time capsule of the late 1940's and 50's. There are definite stereotypes about the roles of men and women from that period  like a woman's place is in the home etc. Some will find this very dated and annoying  but I often enjoy seeing glimpses into past periods in American history even if I don't necessarily agree with it.There is not a lot of depth to this movie in the classic soap tradition. But there is good character development in the sense that you know everyone's personalities. Joan is the controlling manipulative wife trying to climb the social ladder. Correy plays the wimpy husband who lets his wife control him and everything in his life... Until she finally goes to far. Its good to see Mrs. Craig get what's coming to her in the end.Joan's costumes are beautiful and extravagant. But I hated the hairdo she has in most of the picture  very much like helmethair. Its all stuck very close to her head and gives her profile shots an unflattering shape. Perhaps they're trying to give her an overly masculine look to match her domineering personality. I'm not a huge fan Of Crawford. I find most of her work overly theatric and stiff. This carries over here as well. There is one exception when she relives the day her father left the family. She shows natural and genuine human emotion and pain in that scene without all the campiness for which she is known.If you don't like melodrama or soap opera style films stay away from this one. If you want a glimpse into 1950's stereotypes watch this. Also for those familiar with Crawford personal life and Mommie Dearest this role perhaps best captures that side of Joan  controlling manipulative unforgiving and without an ounce of warmth in her whole body.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching it. It's been several years since I saw it last time. I worried that I may not like it as much as I used to...I should not have worried  I love it even more now if that is at all possible. I've seen it at different times of my life  first as a college student many years ago in Moscow I keep returning to it all my life.When Tarkovsky's Zerkalo The Mirror was first released it divided the audience completely. I remember how my friends were passionately discussing it. One girl was complaining that she did not understand anything the movie was confusing for her dark disturbing the children characters  sad pale poorly dressed. I remember her asking Why did they show a boy in the opening scene that had an awful stutter and they never showed that boy again? What did it mean when the dying man in bed was setting a bird free? How did he get the bird on the first place? Another friend of mine a guy tried to explain the things to her. He suggested that she thought about the times Zerkalo was showing he tried to explain to her Tarkovsky's symbolism where the bird could be representing life and soul of the main character and the boy with the stutter could mean that it was most difficult for people to communicate and understand each other. I only listened to their argument and did not participate because I had not seen the film yet. When it finally happened Andrei Arsenievich Tarkovsky was presented at the screening and he talked to the audience before the show. I remember him repeating over and over that there were no tricks no puzzles and no tongueincheeks in the film that every symbol image dialog and sound was there because they belonged there. He asked us if we had questions. Someone from the audience suggested that we saw the film first and then asked questions. Tarkovsky replied that from his experience not many viewers would sit through the film and who ever would usually leave in silence not asking anything. And then he told us a story. After Zerkalo was completed it was first shown to the group of the famous critics. After watching it critics started to argue about it trying to find the hidden meaning and make sense of what they just saw. It went on and on until the cleaning lady who came to the screening room and had been waiting for the end of discussion to do her job asked them for how long they would stay? Someone said to her that they were discussing a very complicated film and they needed time to understand it. Cleaning lady asked What is that you do not understand in this film? I saw it also and I understood everything. Critics were silenced for a moment and then one of them asked the woman to share her thoughts on Zerkalo. She answered It is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. Now he is dying and he is trying to ask them for forgiveness but he does not know how. After the pause Tarkovsky said that he had nothing else to add about his film to what the cleaning lady had to say.I never understood complains that Zerkalo is a very confusing difficult and dark film. No it is clear and deep as a mirror. Tarkovsky said so himself and I believe him. Every time you look at the mirror it will show you new depth and reflections. Past presence future memory love guilt forgiveness beauty sadness nostalgia and sacrifice  the mirror reflects it all just watch closely. This is the film about his family his country and his times. Childhood memory and the memory of the past generations glued together. The film is a look back in time and sad realization that children reflect destiny of fathers as in a mirror. Destinies reflected one in another. Zerkalo is not just good cinema it is pure cinema. Like architecture is music in stone Zerkalo is poetry on screen. My verdict  The Best Film ever made the top of my list tie with Andrei Rublyov.".

	schema:reviewBody "To many Mirror is possibly Tarkovsky's most inhibitive and uninviting work be as it may not a story in the traditional sense but rather an assemblage of images scenes and thoughts which at first sight seem to have very little in common and just drift back and forth with no obvious literal explanation. It's only after repeated viewings and the realisation of what it actually was that Tarkovsky tried to achieve that it dawns that this is more than just a bunch of random scenes but a timeless and highly important masterpiece which defies explanation. But I'll try anyway.I personally hold Tarkovsky in very high esteem. There are many directors I would regard as good or very good for instance Kubrick Kieslowski Ozu or Miyazaki but there are only two directors I regard as absolute geniuses Akira Kurosawa and yep Andrei Tarkovsky. Interestingly this is for two solely different reasons  whereas I admire Kurosawa for the manner in which he managed to perfect the art of cinematic storytelling Tarkovsky deserves praise for wanting to shake cinema out of its complacent acceptance that films should simply tell a story and little else. Mirror is further proof that Tarkovsky's body of work which is limited in quantity  a mere eight films  but rich in scope establishes that the Hollywood mode of narrative is not the only way in which film can create an emotional response from an audience. Of course Tarkovsky is not alone in having done so Marker and Greenaway immediately spring to mind but what distinguishes him from other art house directors is that he has managed to take this style of film making and drive it to a stage that can be described as almost perfect.I personally interpret Mirror as a man's life flashing before his eyes before he dies his relationship with his wife and mother both played by the same person in an ingenious move on Tarkovsky's behalf his children his friends the history of his home land his own childhood. However Mirror is deliberately structured in such a way that it can and will be interpreted differently by different people depending on how they inscribe their own personal thoughts and feelings into the narrative. This is where Tarkovsky's genius comes to fore  to create a film which does not dictate to an audience how to feel by manipulating them via music or miseenscene but to make it the other way around. In the case of Mirror we the audience dictate the emotional response created by the images on screen and that ultimately is that makes it such a wonderful work and a true rarity. This is possibly another way the title of the film can be interpreted in that it illustrates a wholly reflective style of cinema.Those not accustomed to a slightly more disjunctive cinematic style are likely to dismiss Mirror as boring or dull because it may not necessarily correspond to their expectations of film. However it is still something I would regard as required viewing for everyone since it shows that cinema can be beautiful without necessarily following the rules Hollywood has imposed on the rest of the film making community and that ultimately rules are there to be broken. A masterpiece no less.".

Its presentation in its last shots of the totality of the human experience combined with the Bach's St John Passion crushes me every time. And I'm not even Russian.

Its presentation in its last shots of the totality of the human experience combined with the Bach's St John Passion crushes me every time. And I'm not even Russian. Nor am I religiousthis is the closest I get to religion. You just have to be human to understand MIRROR. This is the way of all Tarkovsky.";

You need an appreciation of a silent room and what it previously held and of nature. You will need a sense of living in a turbulent and dangerous world where all beauty is transient and sad. You will need to understand how small moments in life can become the most precious.The film is tragic because like memories it lingers. It shows us details beneath the surface and how they can affect us. It shows life in the context of death nature the times and places we have passed through. The camera ponders and paints all this in beautiful detail.Of course real life is never so rich nor so intense  only momentarily so.

The fact that the same actors are used to portray different characters of different time levels MariaAlexei's mother and NatalyaAlexei's wife Alexei as a child and IgnatAlexei's son underlines the idea of deliberateness in addition. But the interconnection of times is also made visible by the recurrent theme of the so called 'djvuphenomenon' A character perceives a new situation or action as if it has already occurred before. In fact he or she gets a notion of the predetermination of everything that happens in his or her life  a horrid thought because then you can't change anything and have to accept willingly whatever an obscure determinating force has planned for you.Let's concentrate on the last sequences in which the significance and the combination of these themes become obvious. First there is the scene where Alexei who lives in separation from Natalya lies in agony overcome by an unknown disease. He just has the energy to make a last statement for posterity I simply wanted to be happy! then he retires from the world asking to be left in peace.But while he is on the brink of death he still succeeds in wondrously stirring up life. He takes into his hand a moribund bird which is lying on his bedside table squeezes it and then lets it go so that it can fly up into freedom.Is it the same bird that breaks through a window glass in another scene or that places itself on the head of that orphan boy whose parents have perished in the Leningrad blockade as if he wanted to protect him?The birds of Zerkalo seem to take up a symbolic function similar to the dogs in other Tarkovsky movies i.e. Nostalghia Solyaris They represent some kind of link between Man and Nature they are frontier guards at the gates of the unknown.Tarkovsky sees Man and Nature as two opposing incompatible powers. This becomes evident again and again for instance when a vigorous wind repeatedly runs through grass and trees or when drumming rain drenches the landscape. Here Man can only watch in amazement being unable to set something of equal value against the inscrutable elemental forces.In the closing sequence Man appears at first as if he was embedded in the womb of Nature. Maria the future mother of Alexei is lying dreamily in the grass when she is asked by her husband whether she prefers a boy or a girl. But instead of answering his question she is gazing into the distance and suddenly she sees herself as grandmother walking across woods and meadows having little Alexei Ignat? and his sister by the hand. Then a juvenile Maria appears again and tears are running along her cheek but she is smiling at the same time. It seems as if the knowledge of the unstoppable progression of human existence into a single direction towards old age and death makes her sad and happy at the same time. She feels grief because of the inevitable loss of youth but she also rejoices in happy relaxation for she has made out the rules of life as such and has accepted them.At the end the camera follows the way of the grandmother and her grandchildren for quite a while. But again and again trees interfere and obstruct the view on the humans like gloomy barricades. Until finally both ways separate irredeemably The humans have disappeared somewhere in the distance whereas the camera shot pans into the dark impenetrability of the forest.".

Russians who did see it sent many letters to the director saying how much it affected them and mirrored their own childhood experiences. Tarkovsky himself had difficulty in 'finding' his film during production and originally worried that it would not work. Many critics questioned whether the images were symbolic in some way but Tarkovsky dismissed symbolism as decadent. He sited Japanese writers of the middle ages rejecting such things. He had no time for surrealism either pointing out that Dali himself had rejected the concept as facile. And yet the pull of dreams are unmistakable in this work. Tarkovsky stated that the artist himself does not necessarily know the meaning of an image but is compelled to express his vision.Despite some of the problems in viewing this film there are plenty of moving and mysterious moments not least the wistful and melancholic look on the face of the mother as she lays in the grass contemplating her children's future.".

I was ready to give it 310 for the cinematography and Margarita Terekhova's performance but then I read some reviews where I saw comments like masterpiece best film of all time my favorite film perfect. I figured that there must be something to this film that I missed so I thought it was worth a second try. I was helped by some reviewers who pointed out that the scenes occur in one of three time periods in the 1930s prior to WWII during the war with footage from the Spanish Civil War and in the 1960s. There is no story as such but the memories dreams and current real life of Aleksei a man in his 40s who is dying. Mixed in are documentary footage sequences and poetry readings. Things are complicated by Terekhova's playing two parts Aleksei's wife Maria and Maria's mother. Also Ignat Daniltsev plays two parts the young Aleksei and Aleksei's son. Oh and at random intervals the film moves between black and white and color.Armed with some background there was a reward for watching the second time. For one thing I was not so focused on the subtitles so that I could better appreciate the cinematographythe sensual quality of the wind on the fields and bushes the lush countryside the lighting and the long tracking shots for example. Even though I appreciated Terekhova's performance on first viewing I was more impressed with her on second viewing when I was not struggling so hard to make sense out of things. There are some great scenes like the extended one that has the young Aleksei looking into a mirror in contemplation. The future Aleksei is remembering an incident where his young self is contemplating what his future will be.Some scenes are still mysterious like the scene with Maria in a charred room with the ceiling falling in. Other scenes struck me as puzzlingly long like Maria's trek to the printing office where we follow her from her house into the rain into the building and through doors and down a corridor until she finally winds up at her desk. Why such a detailing of her trip to the office?I like the concept of the film in its trying to capture how life is as lived in our minds in the real world in dreams in fantasies and in memoriesall jumbled together. To come across as so authentic I figure that this film must be autobiographical to a great extent. In concept I would compare this to Fellini's 8 12 and Malick's The Tree of Life. Both of these latter films were more successful for me partly since they were easier to follow but most importantly because they involved me emotionally at a deep level. The Mirror remained at a distance for me emotionally.I have a problem with films that require research to appreciate. Maybe a third viewing would be in order sometime when I have the patience.".

	schema:headline " My Favorite movie of all time.";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene in Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror where a young child looks through a book of art. The camera is close showing only the pages of the book and the child's hand as he flips from picture to picture. Occasionally he will stop and linger on a favorite drawing. It is obvious that the book is a treasured possession whose pictures have yet to lose their magic for the young boy. At one point a leaf pressed between the pages comes into view only to be swallowed up again.This seemingly innocuous scene halfway through the movie is just one small example of why The Mirror is unquestionably my favorite movie ever. The film is the pure essence of nostalgia and each viewing is a revelation of memories I had long thought lost. I too had certain favorite books that I would turn to over and over again flipping through their pages and taking comfort in the familiar pictures. I too would often press flowers and leaves between the pages of books with my parents.Watching this movie feels like memories of the past flooding back from some forgotten abyss. The grey rainy skies the kittens licking up cream the flickering kerosene lantern the sledding on the hill the small junk pile in the forest the snow covered trees the wooden floors and furniture the windswept fields the log fence all of these things are important images from my childhood. And yet there is far more to The Mirror than that.Tarkovsky reaches beyond mere concrete memories. Many moments in the film have an almost mystical appeal. The slow static shot of the disappearing hand print on the table mesmerizes the eye until the final trace has gone. The bottle that inexplicably rolls off the table seems to act of its own volition. The man walking away in a great field of grass who turns to the camera just as one mighty gust of wind sweeps across the field towards the viewer and is gone. Scenes such as these are joined seamlessly with the movie and serve to reinforce the almost dreamlike reality we are presented with.The music selected from Pergolesi Purcell and J.S. Bach is amazingly equal to the images. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the superlative final scene set to Bach's monumental opening chorus from St. John's Passion. It is the single most moving scene I have ever viewed on film its central images consisting of little more than a woman biting her lip and a child shouting a great life affirming cry to the skies while Bach's painfully beautiful music builds to an epic climax. The perfect union of film and music found in this scene is staggering in its power.I suspect I am not the only one who considers himself a kindred spirit to The Mirror. Growing up in rural Kansas without a great deal of money surely helps but the images are more universal than the tone of these passages lets on. Perhaps that is part of The Mirror's appeal to those who identify with it it seems as though the movie was made only for them.This theory gains a great deal of credence when I think of the parts of The Mirror I don't feel such a strong connection to. I had no lack of a father figure as a child yet that dominant plot point somehow doesn't stand in the way of my identification with the movie. I obviously didn't grow up in the middle of a war and have no connection with Russian politics and history but again it makes no difference. Oddly enough these two central ideas in the movie don't even seem to register when I look back on it.So just what is the mirror about? The Time Out film guide sums it up quite well saying Tarkovsky goes for the great white whale of politicized art  no less than a history of his country in this century seen in terms of the personal  and succeeds. That is a rather broad description and not a particularly exciting one. Of course if that were all that the movie was about I would not be writing this review.When it comes down to it The Mirror is an elusive film to classify. I've seen it over and over and still have a hard time getting a firm grip on its structure. Powerful images with their own internal logic flit by skittering at the edges of our consciousness like the memories of a lost day from our childhood. Complex narratives follow children and adults past and present. Powerful documentary footage is interspersed along with slow motion dream sequences. The closest description I can come up with is that The Mirror is a collection of images all related and all central to the human experience.The Mirror is Tarkovsky's finest film and for certain kindred souls it truly will be a mirror. A mirror to every memory long thought lost it will show each person who looks a different reflection.".

It's the old I'll pretend I understood it so as not to appear dumb movieviewing phenomenon coupled with the I'll gain respect from my peers by showing appreciation for 'deep' movies inferiority complex. Just how deeply ingrained this fear  this disease  is in the human mind is best illustrated by this Tarkovsky himself once said that most people leave the theater in silence after they'd finished watching Zerkalo. Tarkovsky must have said this with a touch of pride hoping Zerkalo affected people deeply emotionally on a subconscious level leaving them speechless and immersed in intellectual musing. However the reality as so often is quite different from wishful thinking. Why did these people leave the theater in silence? Because they didn't DARE complain. Because they were utterly confused. Nearly everyone is afraid of not having understood the symbolism. Always keep in mind the vast majority of humanoids have a powerful FEAR of being exposed as morons or cowards in society. One of the many ways this can occur is by saying you didn't understand a movie. If you failed to understand Bambi then you truly are a moron. On the other hand by not admitting you were confused by pretentious European cinema you may think you have succeeded in hiding your supposed lack of intelligence but all you've achieved is to show that you're a coward  unable to tear apart a movie like this with the frankness that it frankly deserves.I'm told this film is about a dying man recouping his life childhood divorce... I've never even noticed that the narrator was dying! Where was this mentioned? Perhaps I just dozed off Unfortunately the narration here is done through poetry i.e. basic info is convoluted through riddles and other garbage which basically means that Zerkalo becomes a puzzle to solve  like so many dumb European films  instead of a story to enjoy. Who says a movie has to be riddled with puzzles and symbolism in order to be artistically valid? Just exactly where is this written? I am not saying a film should spell everything out i.e. require no amount of thought but going to the other extreme can be just as stupidpointless. Zerkalo means almost nothing. The thin premise of a dying man and his reminiscing not only does not constitute a story but is very DULL as well. I did not care about his life because his life was not nearly eventful and interesting enough to validate its being put on the big screen.So what does one get when poetry i.e. rhythmicsemantic puzzles is layered on top of a bunch of meaningless often unrelated scenes? You get a wonderful stew of nonsense leaving the viewer free to interpret it IN ANY WAY he chooses. Whatever meaning you find in this malarkey is totally individual and can be easily supported by a plethora of invented arguments. It's like a Picasso painting abstract enough crap to elicit any kind of meaning. Picasso and Tarkovsky's Zerkalo have that one thing in common both are feared greatly by people who lack the guts to admit to others and sometimes even to themselves! that they do not understand it. Besides what's there to understand? Whenever a movie requires a road map you know it has failed  at least in the story department. What does all that documentary footage mean? Tarkovsky pretentiously shoves various newsreels into Ogledalo most probably because he likes the way they look. Maybe HE saw a meaning i.e. a link between those scenes and the story but I believe that movies can be approached as food in restaurants the customer is always right. Or at least the director ISN'T always right. Tarkovsky can talk about how all the scenes here have a purpose until he's blue in the face and I still won't take him seriously. It isn't difficult to link the unlinkable all you need is some imagination and an even healthier amount of selfdelusion. What Tarkovsky and Zerkalo's fans see in this film will only make sense in their confused deluded hallucinatory little minds. On the other hand Ogledalce has some very good photography especially the scenes in colour. The documentary footage if nothing is a welcome refreshment amidst all the confusing nonsense some of which is quite dull as well.Symbolism? A man holding a bird in his hand while the narrator emits incomprehensible poetry at the poor viewer? Yeah the bird symbolizes life whatever. The stuttering boy from the first scene probably symbolizes the difficulty of communication in society. Whatever. There is a problem with communication amongst humans?? Really??? Why thank you Mr.Tarkovsky for letting us in on that great secret! I never EVER would have realized this were it not for Zerkalo. The point I'm making is that below all these clouds of verbal and visual riddles there often hides a message IF there is one that is banal anything but deep. Sometimes the message in such movies is merely life is hard. How veeeery deepGoing back to the stuttering boy scene the great irony of course is that movies such as these don't exactly help in the area of communication do they? The viewer leaves the theater silent wondering what the hell he just spend 100 minutes of his life on. Tarkovsky failed to communicate his ohso deep thoughts even worse than the stutterer...The Mirror is like a magic trick without the use of mirrors you're fooled if you're gullible enough into believing that what you've just witnessed was something deeply profound. It's a scam.Email me if you want my totally altered subtitles for awful Bergman movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mirror is a disconcerting film. There is no plot at least in the traditional sense of the word and much of what happens is steeped in heavy symbolism. And yet Andrei Tarkovsky weaves the hard truths and brutal realities of everyday life into Mirror's surrealist tapestry with an effortlessness that makes the film utterly compelling. Not only do the real and surreal collide time shifts randomly and the natural world becomes a character in its own right. I hate to think how unbearably pretentious this film could have been in the wrong hands. Tarkovsky however walks the fine line between art and facade with supreme skill. Mirror is an experience to be savoured.Few films are as open to interpretation as this one. The beauty of Mirror is that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions without being intentionally baffling or obtuse. The film is told in a nonlinear fashion with events occurring in the present past and quite possibly the future  depending on your interpretation. Pieces of a central narrative slowly begin to emerge and take shape. Mirror casts light upon the various stages of Alexei's life. However this film is about more than one man. Alexei is a representation of humanity itself  at least that is how I interpret the film. Tarkovsky uses Alexei's story as a vehicle for exploring the transcendent nature of human relationships. This may sound heavy going but it's not. Mirror has a dreamlike quality that washes over rather than overwhelms the viewer.Tarkovsky was one of cinema's true originals. Many directors have played around with colour changes and time shifts but very few of them did it with Tarkovsky's sense of purpose. Small details in Mirror take on symbolic meanings which further the story  this is not an exercise in empty symbolism. For example Tarkovsky uses the natural world to link scenes and depict the passing of time. The startling use of rain and wind also contributes to the film's surreal tone. One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the director's ability to marry the real with the surreal. For every fire burning in the rain there is the bleak image of a child sleeping in a box. Tarkovsky takes excerpts from one person's life and builds a commentary on humanity itself.Volumes could be and possibly have been written about Mirror's multitude of layers and meanings. This film is so incredibly rich in ideas and artistry that it is almost impossible to process everything in one viewing. However after the first viewing you will know if Mirror is for you. The film if nothing else is a polarising experience. I expected to hate it given my general aversion to arthouse movies but was overcome by the film's humility. Unlike the majority of his colleagues I never get the feeling that Tarkovsky is grandstanding or trying to show off his mastery. He films Alexei's story in a straightforward manner with simple angles and long shots. For a film that incorporates documentary footage of atomic explosions bullfighting and Chinese demonstrations Mirror remains masterfully subtle.Tarkovsky's striking eye for composition and his ability to combine eclectic elements is without comparison. However the film offers more than a series of captivating and confounding images. Mirror's greatest achievement is to capture a sense of what it is to be human in a manner that is neither pompous nor pretentious. This is a hauntingly beautiful film.".

Unlike the majority of his colleagues I never get the feeling that Tarkovsky is grandstanding or trying to show off his mastery. He films Alexei's story in a straightforward manner with simple angles and long shots. For a film that incorporates documentary footage of atomic explosions bullfighting and Chinese demonstrations Mirror remains masterfully subtle.Tarkovsky's striking eye for composition and his ability to combine eclectic elements is without comparison. However the film offers more than a series of captivating and confounding images. Mirror's greatest achievement is to capture a sense of what it is to be human in a manner that is neither pompous nor pretentious. This is a hauntingly beautiful film.";

This is not Tarkovsky offering content  clues or players. This is simply a key selection of the manner in which he will go on to present a very personal reflection on a Russian life such as his might have been. The wind is like a the tidal penumbra of memory threatening to wash away each freshly precipitated thought. As such the film continues in honest scenes and sequences where the transitions tracking shots longeurs and peripheral figures are as much content as the drifting narrative and characters. Within 20 minutes I'd made the decision to watch the film a second time without subtitles which are only intrusive. I'm not even convinced by Arseny Tarkovsky's poetic voiceover or some of the music the choral Bach mainly.It is unquestionably cinematographic balm with a focused central performance from Margarita Terekhova.

If I personally had grown up in the Russian countryside and if this movie's reputed dreamy poetic nonlinear recollections were those of my own grandfather I'm afraid I still would have found this movie to be on the slow boring and underwhelming side of things. I'm really confused as to how it has scored such a high rating seriously. If this movie is an 8 then Siberiade and Come and See should be about a 16 and even Dr. Zhivago would have to be about a 14. I don't usually post negative comments and probably wouldn't have bothered if this movie's IMDb average rating was a 6 or maybe even a 7 but as it was an 8 when I decided to watch this movie well I just can't figure how that is possible unless there is some committee appointed by the Russian communist party politburo that is charged with just logging onto IMDb and voting for this movie. I just don't see how it possibly ever got a rating so high. I'll give it a 4 just because there were a few spliced in documentary clips that were interesting but there were no extraordinary scenes of the countryside the narrative poetry was not overwhelmingly great no particular plot no drama wow nothing really but a slow tedious movie without any real payoff unless you can really just thrive on music Purcell and such that occasionally breaks the monotony but then again hopefully your refrigerator will make some entertaining noises while you are slogging through this movie.".

However it soon become clear to me that I should have had a notebook to follow the plot with all flashbacks and dreamlike sections. Additionally there are clearly so many metaphors and symbols in the film that it further complicates following of the plot. In consequence the watching experience was mostly to just look at nice visual elements and follow dialog that made no sense for great part. There is no bad word to say about acting per se.Someone wrote in the message boards that the film started to make sense only after watching 2 to 3 times. I can agree with that. However as this was my first and probably the only time to watch I can't give very high rating since two important elements of any film were absolutely too unclear the plot and the storytelling. I can easily understand that this film is a great subject for film student or art historian and as such can be rated high.

In other hands this may have invoked a simple perhaps intelligent nostalgia. It is then stupendous that from this seemingly disjointed puzzle of images and motions a life rearranged Tarkovsky is able to facilitate a meditation through which emerges a single vision whereby consciousness and sensation are unified contact feeling perception past and present melded into a single narrative free of the burden and anxiety of time.And it's even more potent that this vision having been received at the doorstep of death before the great fear it is filled with reassurance and equanimity a cessation of hope and fear alike. In this state the reality of the mind which is what we swim through in the film though perceived to be lacking in logic and apparent meaning and filled with internal anxieties has no power to bend us. Now and then shadow plays are enacted on this vast canvas a divorce a child a hayloft barn ablaze to which we are spectators or characters but they will come to pass. The only thing that remains then is reality and light and this emptiness of a grander design instead of distressing the soul soothes and reassures it so that death's grip upon it is released.A great testament then to the power of Tarkovsky's intuition is this that out of this fluid world both inside the film as the surrogate Tarkovsky on his deathbed and out of it as the filmmaker who frames it the film emerges mindful and lucid. There is no hallucination in this stream of consciousness here for the mind is at peace.With Antonioni I wanted to see how he meditates on forms how the facets of consciousness appear or disappear as we go through his cinema. Tarkovsky by contrast meditates on the reflections and shadows these forms cast around us or inside of us. Their difference is that whereas Antonioni wishes first to see how these reflections manifest in the mind then eventually having recognized them as barriers to our awareness seen them to be mere illusions he transcends them to know the world as is Tarkovksy believes here that those impressions are all we can know of the world perhaps what ultimately matters.Yet at one time he was looking into these reflections to see is the face of god to be found somewhere in them to hear back from the beyond. Here the desire to be in communion with these worlds beyond is finally resigned from and he accepts what is. That for better or worse a life was lived.".

As the boy approaches the table seemingly aware of the sudden change the ring of steam slowly evaporates indicating that what had once existed is now gone. This image is reminiscent of the film's thematic undertone since it is can be read as a metaphor for memories something that once was real that leaves only an imprint of itself before slowly fading out of sight and eventually mind.

To be fair I am not sure if I understand the plot. Joke to make this review more appealing my favorite drink is a cocktail of carrot juice and whiskey. I'm always drunk but I can see for miles. Evidently Mirror is a Russian story. Apparently a middleaged man looks back on his past. He is born in the countryside on a farm near the woods in the decade before the outbreak of the Second Word War. He is fascinated by the primitive life of the peasants by the mystery of the natural environment and by the solitude. It turns him into an introvert person  which reminds me of these two snowmen in the field. One says Can you smell a carrot? In his early youth his father leaves the family and as he results he develops a strong bond with his mother. After the war she works in a printingoffice. He marries a woman who resembles his mother. Although they get a son the marriage is not a success. By the way if Dolly Parton married Salvador Dali she would be Dolly Dali. Isn't that silly? Anyway it seems that he can no longer cope with life. But perhaps my interpretation is totally wrong. Halfway the film contains some real recordings of the war the atomic bombs and the Russian conflict with China in black and white. Indeed the Russian history is filled with misery and tragedy. As a whole I find Mirror dissatisfying. Due to the virtual absence of a storyline the film is essentially void. You are waiting for the events to unfold but they don't. It can be said that the film actually is a mirror but the points of contact are too random to stimulate or guide the fantasy of the observer. But perhaps at the time the Russians were simply pleased to watch a loaf of bread a sausage and a bottle of wine joke. Personally I prefer films with a more realistic plot and therefore I can not recommend Mirror. If you are impressed by the atmosphere of the Russian wilderness you may appreciate Sibiriade. It is in my list of reviews together with many other films of Russia and Eastern Europe. Don't hesitate to leave a comment. I love it.".

Of course he's been in the Scorcese's previous hit Raging Bull but didn't get a hell of a lot of recognition at the time.  Joe Pesci's character of Vincent LaGuardia Gambini is a landmark character in comedy history.  When his New Yauker street smarts collide with Southern hospitalitybrilliant fishoutofwater humor ensues! Of course Pesci should've be given all the credit.  Marisa Tomei who RIGHTFULLY won the Supporting Oscar for her excellent performance please don't believe that urban myth about Jack Palance calling out the wrong name!! is hilarious as Pesci's fiance with a foul mouth a smart a the heaviest Brooklyn accent and an incredible expertise in automobiles.  This was also the movie that made Marisa a star and a performance I commend to this day.What can I say?  This movie has some of the most priceless bits of comedy. One of course involves Pesci's pronunciation of the word youth which sounds like yute.  One underrated bit is the one where Pesci first meets his cousin's friend Mitchell Whitfield in the jail cell.  His cousin Ralph Macchio is asleep and Pesci suddenly pays the friend a visit.  He doesn't know Pesci is the lawyer and assumes he's some guy who...wants to make him his bch.  The comic dialogue in that scene is so perfectly executed and I feel it's one of the funniest in the movie.  I'm not going to give away any more of the film's slick intelligent humorYou have to see it for yourself!!!If you're in the mood for a smart wellwritten wellacted comedy that will have you on the floorlook no further!  My Cousin Vinny doesn't disappoint in any of those aspects.  This is a truly memorable piece of comedy and though it was released in 1992 I'm sure comedy lovers will pay homage to this movie in the present day.My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Underrated.";
	schema:reviewBody "Underrated. I won't belabor relating and describing the plot because that's been recited nicely by numerous others. I'll simply return to my one word point. Underrated. Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance an award she earned and much deserved I still say underrated. This film really never got on the public's radar the way it should have probably because there are no bigname actors featured as box office draw. Joe Pesci was as good as it gets that way. In 1991 he was the hottest name in the cast. But has Joes Pesci ever established himself as a leading man who could carry a movie by himself? I ask that in openended wonderment and certainly not disparagingly. Just asking is it fair has it ever been fair to expect Joe Pesci to carry a film?Regardless of Joe Pesci's latent starpower this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave not only in their interactions with one another but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts beyond any of their individual levels of genius certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them. Competent though they may have been these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants. You ever wonder why this singular performance 15 years ago and counting remains Marisa Tomei's magnum opus? That might be one big reason why. The Germans have a word for this. It's called gestalt. My inclination is to give most of the credit for this winning final product to director Jonathan Lynn. It seems obviously to be his creation. Who else singularly deserves it? Along the way it would have been such a cheap trick and easy thing to surrender to the obvious but Lynn didn't do it. This is a story built around stereotypes. New Yorkers. Ethnic Italian New Yorkers. Southerners. Small town southerners. Southern justice. Southern small town justice with New York Italians in the dock. It would have been so easy to traffic in those stereotypes to overthetop cash in on them to submerge the movie in them and to exploit them for all they were worth. These people could have been made into cardboard cartoons of themselves. Surely the Englishman Lynn was thusly tempted but it was a temptation he mainly resisted. Oh almost obligatorily he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction indeed in an uplifting direction. Just as there are no cheap tricks in this movie there are no cheap shots either. People are not ridiculed for who they are or where they are from. It rises above that. Lynn raises it above that. Yes the regional differences that exist are juxtaposed. And yes we get the fact that cultural differences divide these characters. But the beauty of it is that no one is treated unfairly. In fact the viewer comes away with the feeling that these are all good people. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are given a broad canvas to create great humorous art bouncing one two three liners or more off of each other at the other's expense. It's the game they play with each other the nature of their characters' relationship and it's fun to watch. And this must be said not only does Marisa give an exquisite performance she is an utterly delightful feminine creature to watch here. As for the southerners in not taking the bait to exploit the southerners as dumb hicks Lynne actually captures part of the true but rarely portrayed essence of the south polite gentility. Lane Smith embodies that essence. And Fred Gwynne? He practically steals the show and would have were it not for Marisa Tomei.What has been going through Joe Pesci's and Marisa Tomei's heads for the last 15 years? What is wrong with their agents? These two needed a sequel. If not a sequel then more films together. The dynamic between them was too good to just be abandoned. We should have been treated to much more of them together.As a trial lawyer let me say that the portrayal of courtroom events while certainly not perfect is more than adequate and passable. One thing that is accurately captured is the fishoutofwater experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a farflung rural county. This depicton conveys the essence of what that's like.This movie deserves more recognition. It is clever funny and fun. I recommend it. If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and indulge yourself.".

	onyx:emotionText "Underrated. I won't belabor relating and describing the plot because that's been recited nicely by numerous others. I'll simply return to my one word point. Underrated. Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance an award she earned and much deserved I still say underrated. This film really never got on the public's radar the way it should have probably because there are no bigname actors featured as box office draw. Joe Pesci was as good as it gets that way. In 1991 he was the hottest name in the cast. But has Joes Pesci ever established himself as a leading man who could carry a movie by himself? I ask that in openended wonderment and certainly not disparagingly. Just asking is it fair has it ever been fair to expect Joe Pesci to carry a film?Regardless of Joe Pesci's latent starpower this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave not only in their interactions with one another but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts beyond any of their individual levels of genius certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them. Competent though they may have been these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants. You ever wonder why this singular performance 15 years ago and counting remains Marisa Tomei's magnum opus? That might be one big reason why. The Germans have a word for this. It's called gestalt. My inclination is to give most of the credit for this winning final product to director Jonathan Lynn. It seems obviously to be his creation. Who else singularly deserves it? Along the way it would have been such a cheap trick and easy thing to surrender to the obvious but Lynn didn't do it. This is a story built around stereotypes. New Yorkers. Ethnic Italian New Yorkers. Southerners. Small town southerners. Southern justice. Southern small town justice with New York Italians in the dock. It would have been so easy to traffic in those stereotypes to overthetop cash in on them to submerge the movie in them and to exploit them for all they were worth. These people could have been made into cardboard cartoons of themselves. Surely the Englishman Lynn was thusly tempted but it was a temptation he mainly resisted. Oh almost obligatorily he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction indeed in an uplifting direction. Just as there are no cheap tricks in this movie there are no cheap shots either. People are not ridiculed for who they are or where they are from. It rises above that. Lynn raises it above that. Yes the regional differences that exist are juxtaposed. And yes we get the fact that cultural differences divide these characters. But the beauty of it is that no one is treated unfairly. In fact the viewer comes away with the feeling that these are all good people. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are given a broad canvas to create great humorous art bouncing one two three liners or more off of each other at the other's expense.

	schema:reviewBody "This was the best way for Joe Pesci to follow up GOODFELLAS and JFK.  Those two were ultraserious roles for him and to forray into comedy was perfect. It was a perfect role perfect timing and a perfect opportunity to show people that he could play something other than the heavy or the bad guy. MY COUSIN VINNY is really just a distant cousin of his character in Goodfellas anyway.  Just imagine one of the guys in Goodfellas that didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the gangsters and this is him. Vinny is a foul mouthed sometime violent insecure but smart man.  He went to law school but took six attempts before he passed the bar.  They are definitely similar characters.  The difference is that Goodfellas was a serious film with a funny side and My Cousin Vinny is an absolutely hilarious film with a somewhat serious side.What makes the film work as well as it does is many things.  First of all you have the fish out of water scenario with Vinny and his fiancee Lisa wearing leather jackets and cowboy boots down in the south where it seems everyone is wearing overalls and they hang out in establishments where their best selling feature is chicken and pool.You also have a great supporting cast that features Lane Smith as a very animated D.A. that has to hammer home every point to his jury like they were morons.  He says the word truth is a word that comes down from England where all of our ancestors come and looking at him incredulously is some of the black jury members.  Fred Gwynne supplies some of the best comedy for the film with his constant badgering of Vinny.  Everything from his suit to his enunciation of words like youts to his court room impropriety to his just plain dislike of him.  Gwynne and Pesci are so opposite as people. Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy baby looking face.  They are complete opposites and much of the hilarity comes from their inability to see eye to eye on many things.It also has to said that Marisa Tomei is brilliant in this film.  There are people out there that try to demean her Oscar triumph that year because the favourite did not win like anticipated.  But her performance here is nothing short of Oscar worthy.  She is a gifted actress and her comedic timing in this film is bang on or as she would say  dead on balls accurate. This is one of the funnier films to come out in the 90's and it is well worth seeing again.9 out of 10".

The rest of us will find at least some genuine funny moments. In my case I found several. My Cousin Vinny is a movie that I will play to cheer me up because it's hard to feel down while watching it.Joe Pesci who scared the hell out of us as Tommy Devito in Goodfellas takes on the role of wise cracking inexperienced attorney Vincent Gambini. He is wonderfully matched with the nagging street smart and charming Maria Tomei as his girlfriend Mona. The two hard core New Yorkers wind up in rural Alabama to defend Vincent's cousin Ralph Macchio and friend on robbery and murder charges. There are plenty of funny moments created from the culture clash between the yankees and the southerners ranging from the fascination with grits to the colorful colloquialisms used by each. Some of the best moments involve the exchanges between no nonsense Judge Haller Fred Gwynne and Vincent who he can't understand due to his New York accent. However this film does not rely on stereotypical southern slapstick comedy. It is actually smart and there's a real plot involving a court case that all but looks clear cut until Vincent and his girlfriend begin looking at the evidence. I love all the court room scenes and Pesci and Tomei have great chemistry.This movie is truly underrated although Tomei did earn an Academy Award for her role in this film. I highly recommend it to those of us with a funny bone!".

They are one of the best on screen couples I have seen. They act like a old married couple. They just work so well together and have the right chemistry. They make me laugh more than anyone else in this picture the scenes I particularly laugh the hardest at is when Vinny has been invited by the prosecuting attorney to go hunting and he doesn't know what to wear and Lisa goes into a tirade about the deer being shot and his brain lying on the floor and not caring what the son of a bitch who shot him was wearing. Another is when Vinny is trying to prepare for a case and she heaps on more pressure by talking about her biological clock it is a lot more funny in the film and you should watch it for just those scenes alone.What I find entertaining about Vinny's character is that he is not a practised lawyer he hasn't had any cases and doesn't really know what he is doing. He doesn't even know about disclosure till Lisa tells him. He also has to convince his cousin the cousin's friend and the judge that he knows what he is doing. On top of this he hasn't had a good night's sleep because it keeps getting interrupted by loud noises throughout the night the judge doesn't like him and keeps putting him in jail for contempt a local idiot who wants to fight him for 200 that he owes Vinny so there is a lot of factors working against him. You cheer for him when he starts to do the right things in court and will him on to find evidence that will prove his cousin and friend innocent of murder.I have to say one of the scenes that has me falling about laughing is the scene where there is a stuttering lawyer who is trying to do his opening statement but keeps stuttering through it and the jury's face is a picture and really it is their expressions I am laughing at.I like that the film is unpredictable. You don't know how it will be resolved you are in a way in the same boat as Stan and Bill as you watched them leave the Sac o' suds without killing the clerk and you wonder who could have done it and how the witnesses are so convinced that Stan and Bill did it and at least at the end you have a satisfying conclusion when you find out they have caught the bad guys in another state.It was good to see Ralph Macchio in something else other than The Karate Kid. I hardly recognised Fred Gwynne without the makeup of Herman Munster. He was such a treat especially when he couldn't understand what Vinny was saying when he said yutes and couldn't understand some of the other words Vinny said with his thick Brooklyn accent.10 for the actors 10 for the directing and 10 for the writing which makes this film a joy to watch.".

I had heard a lot about My Cousin Vinny I know this was the movie that won Marissa's Oscar and not to mention I heard how funny it was. My Cousin Vinny turned into a very intelligent and great comedic story.It's about two boys who have been accused of murder with a lot of pressing evidence against them that can get them executed but one of the boy's cousins Vinny is a lawyer well just graduated and starting his first six weeks. Not to mention he's never fought a trial or murder case. Vinny has also brought along his Brooklyn talking fiance Mona Lisa Vito. With little experience and getting into a web of lies Vinny must learn that good arguing is not just what will help but he also has to learn how to be a lawyer.Joe and Marissa absolutely steal the show. I think my favorite part was when Mona Lisa was on the stand talking about which cars were involved in the murder case she just got into a fight with Vinny and she refuses to help him but she does and he kisses her hand and you can tell they made up but it's just their looks that are just plain priceless! Everything about this film could make anyone laugh and make them fall in love with Joe Pecsi he's just so awesome! 910".

This is one of Pesci's rare movies where he has the lead role and is perfect playing it.  It's a shame he didn't even get a nomination because he deserved one.  However I would consider this to be Marisa Tomei's breakthrough movie.  She is excellent as Pesci's flamboyant girlfriend and totally deserved the Oscar she got for best supportingactress in it.  Bill Ralph Macchio and his friend Stan Mitchell Whitfield are going to UCLA and decide to go through Alabama to get there. But they get arrested down there.  The only problem is that they don't have any money and don't know any lawyers.  But Bill learns that he has a lawyer in his family.  His cousin Vinny.  Now I don't want to spoil the fun of watching this movie for the first time so I won't tell you much about what happens but there are some classic scenes in this movie.  Great performances great directing and the funniest script ever are the three elements that make this one a sure winner for anyone who watches it. Everything in this movie is funny and yet it's all helpful for Pesci. Jonathan Lynn May not be the most known director around and he may not have directed that many movies but My cousin Vinny is a winner.  Marisa Tomei's costumes should have won the movie another Oscar for best costumes. So for those of you who haven't seen it and are wondering if its any good quit wondering watch it and laugh your head off.".

Ostensibly it is a fish out of water comedy but there's more to it than that.Director Lynn known for his penning the Yes Minister series in Britain does an excellent job here. Casting is impeccable. The actors too. Who but Pesci could have done this? And Tomei who won an Oscar for her performance here is almost always spot on.One thing that's always intrigued me how Lynn could have left the bite with the mention of the Corvette in and not redone it. Caught up in the impact of the scene Tomei completely loses her accent. It's a jarring experience.Lynn being British is severely critical of capital punishment and tosses in the occasional barb against it although most viewers might not realise what he's up to.And Smith McGill and the ever welcome Chaykin do their bit  and as Lynn himself says there are no real bad guys in this one it's about a lot of people thinking they're doing the right thing  and about how screwed up things can get about how innocent people can get convicted  and what having capital punishment therefore means in that context.The 'skits' are precious. The dripping tap the biological clock and Tomei's final foray before the end are such classics that people keep coming back to the movie to see these segments. The interplay between Pesci and Tomei is nothing short of fantastic.This movie is as close to perfect as it can be without really touching there. There is no '9.5' for the reviewer to give and so because everyone on this project did such a top drawer job they get the final '0.5' for pure effort and intentions alone.Normally the comments on the DVD version by the director are a total bore but in this case they're a refreshing exception to that rule.The DVD is a definite keeper. You'll never tire of this one. Never. Beware of yutes.".

This is one of my three all time favorite English language comedies along with Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and A Fish Called Wanda. When I think of it all three share the same concept  playing the differences between the cultures mentalities ways of living talking doing things even cooking  Europeans versus Americans particularly British and Americans or New Yorkers versus Southerners in My Cousin Vinny. They also have in common a flawless witty script with all pieces falling into right place all guns firing all characters developed and interesting. As with Scoundrels and Wanda performances in My Cousin Vinny are simply terrific. Joe Pesci as a lawyer with no legal experience from Brooklyn whose first case just happened to be defending two youtes in a first degree murder trial and Marissa Tomei in the dresses that are so magnificently out of place in the muddy Wahzoo City Alabama but so deliciously fit her like a glove make one of the best screen couples ever but I like the supporting characters and small cameos too. Everyone shines in this delightful comedy. I remember three witnesses for prosecution  grits loving Sam Tipton Maury Chaykin the guy with seven bushes Raynor Scheine and sweet Mrs. Riley who just may need a thicker pair of glasses. Austin Pendleton as a stuttering public attorney was hilarious. Fred Gwynne sadly in his last performance as Judge Chamberlain Halle made his every scene each of which he shared with Pesci the double delight. Ten years after the film was released Film critic and historian Mick LaSalle wrote in his article Half of what made Joe Pesci funny in this comedy was the stream of reactions of Gwynne as the Southern Judge a Great Dane to Joe Pesci's yapping terrier. The film made me root for Vinny wishing him victory in his first case and he won gloriously with the help of a lovely lovely expert in the general automobile knowledge in this lovely lovely comedy.".

While other Hollywood films shamelessly elaborate on many different things for the sake of a good story that is not lost in this movie. In fact this movie is used as a teaching tool for people studying law still to this day for its proper portrayal of the many different things that can go on in a courtroom all without losing its fun.

	schema:reviewBody "In contributing to the IMDb review database I wanted to include a comedy that worked that was funny that was interesting that made the viewer actually look forward to the next line or setup. And ran into a problem. Part of the problem is how broad the word comedy has become. It can include for example a Romantic Comedy of the type was pretty much standard in the 1930s and 1940s. It can include the insanity of a Jackass movie. It can include fanboy films that are starcentric like the Jerry Lewis films I did review NUTTY PROFESSOR but not as a comedy or the mostlyjunk they have produced around exSNL stars it can include endless riffs of the same theme like the SCARY MOVIE series it can be merely a crude attempt to jam as many names into the same film as possible like trying to stuff coeds into a phone booth MAD MAD MAD WORLD or it can be almost exclusively situational as opposed to characterdriven like the Bachelor Party series. And this is not an exhaustive list! Anyway after a lot of diddling with the database I kept coming back to this film as perhaps the purest iteration of the original 1930s screwball comedy. Simple story. Only one or two leads with a good supporting cast Fred Gwynne as the judge. A beginning a middle and an end I have written before about the many many filmmakers who have forgotten this most basic fact about telling a story  you need all three elements!. A breakout performance by a prior unknown to take it up a notch Tomei. And here we are folks one of the best comedies of the era and arguably one of the best of all times. The fact the the other ratings don't see to agree only reinforces my argument  we have over the years lost track of what is funny and what is not.".

	onyx:emotionText "In contributing to the IMDb review database I wanted to include a comedy that worked that was funny that was interesting that made the viewer actually look forward to the next line or setup. And ran into a problem. Part of the problem is how broad the word comedy has become. It can include for example a Romantic Comedy of the type was pretty much standard in the 1930s and 1940s. It can include the insanity of a Jackass movie. It can include fanboy films that are starcentric like the Jerry Lewis films I did review NUTTY PROFESSOR but not as a comedy or the mostlyjunk they have produced around exSNL stars it can include endless riffs of the same theme like the SCARY MOVIE series it can be merely a crude attempt to jam as many names into the same film as possible like trying to stuff coeds into a phone booth MAD MAD MAD WORLD or it can be almost exclusively situational as opposed to characterdriven like the Bachelor Party series.

Bill accidentally pockets a can of tuna into his jacket and forgets to pay the clerk at the counter. As he and Stan are driving down the road Bill realizes his mistake and tells Stan. Although both of them are somewhat concerned they continue driving down the road. They are then stopped by the police and taken to the local police station. Figuring that honesty is the best policy Bill makes a blanket confession. What he doesn't realize is that he has inadvertently pleaded guilty to the murder of the store clerk. When he realizes his mistake he panics and turns to a lawyer in the familyhis cousin Vinny Gambini Joe Pesci who is only too happy to drive down from Brooklyn with his fianc Mona Lisa Vito Marisa Tomei to contest his very first trial. Ever. Anyway rather than disclose the entire story I will just say that this is a film that is one of the best comedies of the modern era. I really enjoyed the performances of Joe Pesci and Fred Gwynne Judge Chamberlain Haller as both of them were hilarious. In addition to that Marisa Tomei also put on quite a show and ended up winning an Academy Award for her performance. Now having said all of that I must warn viewers that some of the language may not be suitable for younger audiences.

A superlative example of pacing a script . Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on . Not only that but Launer has written a script with gags that are both credible and funny  even the skit involving possible sexual abuse in prison  They'd have to be one of course  isn't as silly as it could have been The cast are pretty good too with Joe Pesci showing that he's just as good as a comedy leading man as he is at playing Italian American wiseguys . Let's see you in another movie sometime quick Joe . I'm not sure if Marisa Tomei really deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role here but if the choice was between her and Vanessa Redgrave I'm glad the Oscar voters made the choice .

In this film she is perfect in a part that could have been written for her. As the sassy unemployed hairdresser and former mechanic her testimony for the defense proves the two boys could not have committed the murder. That's a billhit question. No one can answer that question. The car did not have that type of engine until 1964. I saw My Cousin Vinnny on a DVD my neighbor Ron loaned me.

On the other hand I found the movie a LOT more entertaining than expected! I had normal expectations for the movie thinking that I would have sat having a decent time for a couple of hours. Instead I found myself laughing out loud most of the time! Eddie Murphy proved to be in great shape as just his facial expressions were enough to set the audience on fire! The movie was also carried on in a smart way without turning boring or too obvious. This is STRONGLY suggested if you have kids!".

However I have a problem with some people who seem to take a snobbish attitude to films and culture in general and seem to discount a film's credibility beforeafter they've seen it often due to the actors or even the audience that it is aimed at. If you don't like silly films with dubious reality then why go and see an Eddie Murphy film in the first place?!In my opinion each film should be rated on it's individual merits and how it compares to the genre. Why not go and see a film with an open mind and then rate it on the reaction that it provokes? This is a film for children and adults alike not meant to be taken seriously but is a Hilarious film! There is not one person in the cinema who was not creasing themselves...I was sat next to a man in his fifties who enjoyed it just as much as I did!I am normally a bit undecided when it comes to Eddie Murphy but this is by far the best film I have seen him in. His physical comedy and facial expressions are comic genius and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. Yes it is definitely a silly comedy and the plot deteriorates vastly in the last third and is swamped in sentimentality. However isn't that what you expect from Eddie Murphy and a Hollywood film?! If you fancy 90 minutes of fun and pure laughter then this is the film for you...however if you are not a fan of Eddie Murphy or silly comedy elf galaxy quest etc then give it a wide berth!".

However after he is damaged in a collision with a vehicle he decides to attempt to learn more about these earth people spending time with Gina who ran him over and her son Josh who worries that he isn't a hero like his late father. As you can tell from what's been written so far this is no kitchen sink drama but a lighthearted Disneyesquire comedy.Meet Dave is a fun family film that doesn't challenge us too much and has it's heart in the right place. There is plenty of toilet humour which kids always love and some genuinely funny moments throughout I laughed the audience laughed. We did not pelt the screen in outrage and nor did we sit there in silence for 2 hours as we did with the film I mentioned to start with. The film is like a cross between Galaxy Quest and Doctor Dolittle and while the humour is more akin to the latter Dolittle this is still a fun family film. So why three or less? I think that for many film reviewers that sit through and be nice to the usual tripe that passes for entertainment over this season there has to be a villain a film that they slate that then bombs as a result and sadly this is that film. I also suspect that there is also an element of compromise movie on a date disappointment and maybe even a few The film I wanted to see was full and I have to sit through this resentments going on. Having seen some truly terrible mediocre films that critics rave about like Charlie's Angels and Forty days and forty nights these films that no critic has the blls to slag off for fear they won't be invited to more screenings well boo hoo! I have no cross to bear in that department and this is a film that is funny when it wants to be it means well and whilst it is a tad predictable the same age group of kids that liked Dr Dolittle will certainly like this especially appropriate for younger children who may find WALLE hard going bearing in mind it is great for adults and older children but not necessarily very young kids. PCritics are just jumping on the bandwagon to attack this film it really isn't as bad as the examples I've mentioned. The only drawback in this film is that the effects aren't particularly great at a number of points but better to have a film that's okay with poor effects than poor with okay effects. If your family enjoyed Firehouse Dog and the silly humour of that chances are they'll like this.Family Fun".

He made comedy after comedy after comedy of non stop laughs and nothing seemed like it could stop him then the world of the 1990's came as much as we hoped for Eddie it seemed like he had more mediocre comedies then the new millennium oh boy his world has shattered since then. He was very lucky to have an Oscar nomination with Dream Girls yet continued to release bad movies such as Daddy Day Care and the disaster that was Norbit now we have Meet Dave which would've been a good bad movie with unknown actors but since we have well known actors you can't help but feel bad for them but Eddie Murphy just keeps making mistakes after mistakes and I'm just wondering what the heck was he on to think this was the script that will save his career because I want whatever he's taking since he's in a LaLa land right now.I feel silly telling you the plot but I'm going to try to make it work. Dave is an alien who has crashed into Planet Earth he has little people inside him who control his movements and voice. Dave is on a mission to gather all of the Earth's water and bring it back to his home planet. But when he meets a single mother Gina she shows him a good time in New York City and all of a sudden the little people wanna stay on Planet Earth. But one little alien named Agent number 2 is planning on succeeding at the mission and take over yeah that's the plot.I work at a movie theater so I get to see movies for free the way I figure it is even if a movie looks bad just give it a shot it may not be as bad as it seems. Now granted this movie is one step above Norbit that's the relief but the major problem here is this movie isn't even good for the kids it insults everyone's intelligence. Now I love movies I also have an extremely open mind and will say if a movie was fun and to give it a shot but Eddie Murphy we need to save him if he can't save himself his intervention must be the biggest movie flop in the world well I think he's succeeding with Meet Dave. Meet Dave has 2 funny moments then the rest of the script could have been written by 5 year old. I wouldn't recommend this the only thing it wasted was my time.210".

Based on the trailer I was expecting the worst. The film especially in the first half is a spot on spoof of normal human behavior. The film has a lot to say about consumer culture the homogenization of people racism etc. All done via elements that owe a lot to INNERSPACE STAR TREK even CRIMSON TIDE. Eddie gives a fantastic performance and certain elements of his turn as the Large Dave actually were an homage to Steve Martin Buster Keaton and other slapstick comedians. One particular sequence will make you never hear the employee greeting Welcome to Old Navy the same way ever again. Things do get watered down in the last third which is a real shame. I still think it's worth checking out though....all the adults were laughing the hardest so it totally doesn't appeal to the target audience. I think that's what will make this more of a cult classic over time as people discover it....anytime you make a film that is judgmental about modern society and its values people seem to ignore it a la IDIOCRACY.

The audience I saw it with thoroughly enjoyed the movie and there was plenty of laughter throughout the movie.Mini Eddie was much more looser than Spaceship Eddie.Please tel you friends to go see this before it is snatched from theaters.";

Not sure what else to write but for a family movie you cannot go wrong. I tried to find a Eddie Murphy fan page to share my review but it seems you have to pay money with all the so called fan pages on the net. Anyway thanks to the writers cast and crew for a great movie!! 'd love to get a autographed photo of Eddie Murphy for my two boys they are young and think he is hilarious!

The audience meets him first as a huge manshaped spaceship that crashes into Earth in search of a long lost device that might save the planet Nill a faraway world that inhabits extremely small earthlings. Inside Starship Murphy there's a whole crew of Nilleans led by their captain portrayed by  surprise surprise  Eddie Murphy and several main officers the most prominent of which is a compassionate cultural officer referred to only as No.3 portrayed by Gabrielle Union from Bad Boys II and Daddy's Little Girl. The whole crew of this Star Trekie spaceship must navigate the vessel throughout the hazardous streets of New York while searching for the device. Numerous comic situations ensue as the gang tries to adopt human characteristics to their ship which finds it quite difficult to smile speak in a normal tone at first it's so high pitched I laughed myself silly for well over a minute or shake hands properly.The plot moves quickly and has an interesting anthropological approach towards humanity as seen from the eyes of the aliens living inside the Starship Dave while each of the crew members in turn also adopt human emotions. The core of the movie evolves however through Dave's encounters with local widower Gina Morrison and her son Josh who evoke the human core within the Captain and his crew. However the action only starts here as there are countless dangers that face this odd relationship  both from the world outside as well as from inside the spaceship.All in all I found Meet Dave formerly known as Starship Dave to be a nice and refreshing summer matine I had the pleasure of watching a sneak preview of the film on July 6th in Ramat Gan Israel. After suffering through Murphy's crude humor and rather tasteless jokes in the awful Norbit Meet Dave  with it's inoffensive humor clever premise and universal values  redeemed Murphy in my eyes. So yeah it does borrow freely from films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids and television series such as Herman's Head  but in a world full of rehashed ideas and themes used over and over again it still earns points for originality in my book.Surprisingly this was a nice little cinematic treat that actually made me smile and feel good about myself! I gave it a strong 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's very easy to understand why people hate this movie.Blindness is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Fernando Meirelles with a story based on a novel by awardwinning writer Jose Saramago. It stars Julianne Moore and Gael Garcia Bernal. What could go wrong? Well this is one the most depressing movies I've seen in recent years. Don't be fooled the genre of this movie is Horror albeit done in an ultrarealistic way much like the Brazilian movie wave of the 7080's  gritty violent dirty and ultimately hopeless. However it's not a horror movie in the common sense. It's not scary because it has ugly monsters. It's not frightening because there is a lot of gore and blood. What freaks me and others out over this movie is that it tells a story that could happen and actually is happening. If one can't see that then one is as blind as the characters in the film.The movie is technically brilliant with great acting and topnotch effects. The story takes place in a nonspecific city but some of it was clearly filmed in So Paulo. The movie poses the question what if suddenly everyone in the world became blind? This is a practical question as much as a metaphorical one.I don't think this movie can be enjoyed. The violence is suggested rather than seen which IMHO makes it scarier. It can however be appreciated as its shocking nature is nothing more than a wakeup call for humanity.Having said that Meirelles took a huge risk the novel was considered to be unfilmable with this film and the result was a lynchmob reaction from both critics and audiences. I wonder how this will impact Meirelles' future works.I will dare to suggest that if this had been filmed in Spanish or Portuguese it might have been hailed as a cult movie. As it is it's too alienating for audiences that are used to happy endings and fakeviolence or people who watch movies solely to pass the time.This one is for 'hardcore' movie fans  don't watch it if you're depressed or sad. And it offers the viewers very little in the way of comfort. However it's so wellexecuted and disturbing that you can't help but agree that their goal was reached. Unfortunately the marketing and the names involved with 'Blindness' misled many viewers who otherwise would never dream of watching this.It's not a perfect film by any means though. The music specially in one crucial scene just feels out of place sometimes. And If you can't picture yourself as a blind person some things may not make a lot of sense too. There is a scene however in which one of the characters sings a very popular song in a slightly different way  one you are not likely to forget anytime soon.Approach with caution and preferrably alone. You don't want to lose any friends or potential dates. But I also think that to miss out on this movie is like losing a chance to watch one of the most thoughtprovoking films of this year.710".

Sure we usually sacrifice depth in the process but that's a small enough occasional price for the joy of laughing with a crowd. It is no small part of the experience that shared dark room with no remote control. So when I see a movie like this I wonder why it doesn't fit the niche. It is extraordinarily well done. The eye is used to convey not only narrative movement  as usually is desired  but situated group emotion as well. It does this in a straightforward effective way. It is high cinema but not requiring deciphering. Some visual episodes here simply took my breath away. They worked all of them that I got because Julianne understood what they were and how to support them. The story has allegorical elements about society and family humanness and knowing. I would have preferred that they be more subtle more Chinese. But they worked. You could see the balance the perfect weighing of values the texture from a Nobellevel writer. So this should have been embraced by everyone. High visual art with accessible vocabulary and visceral effect. Obvious allegory but with rich immediate motion. Several unexpected turns. But for some reason it wasn't. As I knew this going in it became a sort of parallel context that was carried along. This was absolutely pummeled by the newspaper writers not critics really just reporters of a supposed banal zeitgeist. Viewers on IMDb were not so savage but this like Children of Men did not get the exposure it deserved. The business about goodness grown from being forced to live on the periphery of dangerous tribe simply did not carry from City of God to here though the similarities are striking.So I wonder whether it is me that is blind here in celebrating this or the other way.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

The point of the flick was the human element and not the action. It was great.Having said that I should have waited to rent it. The audience sitting around me was not intelligent enough to appreciate it  nor intelligent enough to shut up during the movie. Their chattiness seemed to be born out of boredom. Shame.I wondered how the movie would end. And at 2 hours long I had plenty of time to think about it. I could not guess it. Perhaps someone smarter or who thinks in more obvious terms could have guessed it. But I was surprised by it. And it really leaves you thinking. That is if you were thinking during the movie up to that point.This movie is dirty to watch and will leave you feeling dirty. In a very adult intelligent thoughtprovoking manner. I write few reviews. This movie moved me to write a review.".

	schema:headline " A reality break from the ratrace  society going blind.";
	schema:reviewBody "This one gets a 10 out of 10. The very title and premise of this movie was intriguing to me. While we are caught up in the rat race. Wondering how to pay the bills make the next dollar worrying about recession etc... what happens if we all suddenly just go blind. It is true that some of the most basic things that we take for granted that we should be thankful for  gets lost in a ratrace called life. I knew I would enjoy the very premise of this movie as it shows that depth of how a first world country can go if one of the most basic gifts of sight were deprived. It wouldn't take a very long time for things to become anarchic.I've been reading through all the comments because I didn't want to say something that wasn't said before. However I want to defend this movie against some criticisms.First of all people are saying that Julian Moore's character waited a bit too late to use her weapon or do something. I think that this actually makes the movie more realistic and is a strength. A character that has never killed before and is killing for the first time has to be taken beyond a breakingpoint in order to cross that boundary. This makes sense with me and I do not understand why people are criticizing this element.Second complaint common is demanding of goods or valuables if the place is already quarantined. I defend this movie in this respect because I think that to be appreciated you have to give it latitude by trying to connect with it's overall message even if it may be metaphorical at the expense of realism. You cant take a movie like this too literal  you simply have to understand what it is saying  which is the downward spiral when the rules of society collapse  and learning to be thankful for some of the things that get lost that's really important in the ratrace we are all called up in.Thirdly the complaints of the gore violence and rape  it was rated a restricted movie  you are viewing at your own risk.This movie has touched me and I'm glad that I have rented. If for not anything else but at least helping me to see life beyond the ratrace that we are all glued to and imagining what could happen if one of the most precious gifts that we are all blessed with  that of vision  were deprived of everyone for just a length of time what would happen.THAT  in itself has got me thinking. There is no higher rating than 1010  so that's the best I can do. I feel happy that something woke me out of the ratrace and see the blue sky  it was this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an admirer of Saramago's masterpiece and Fernando Meirelles's exciting talent I went to see Blindness with a pure heart but modest expectations we all know how movie adaptations of great literature can be disappointing. But I wasn't prepared for the formal and philosophical nada that is Blindness  it could very well be entitled Blandness instead.The problems start from the opening credits after the names of a dozen international production companies comes the hype tag A Very Independent Production. Following this tongueincheek manifesto the opening scene  of the first man turning blind inside his car  belies it all it looks alarmingly like an ad for the new Fiat Punto Fiat is one of the film's backers. It's a shameless piece of merchandise placement that immediately distracts you from what's supposed to be a harrowing scene you pay attention to the car not the man excruciatingly played by Yusuke Iseya in the film's worst performance. The very independent production has more than a share of compromises including the terribly contrived Japanese couple who seem to belong to another film and who are there to satisfy the Japanese coproducers and market. Or the timid squeezedin action flashes cars crashing planes exploding to satisfy action lovers NOT the public for Blindness. Or the debatable decision to film in English an author who brought new heights to Portugueselanguage prose in order to employ American stars and accommodate the international market. Worst of all we know now that Meirelles decided to recut the film six times since Cannes after test audiences were disgusted with graphic scenes. Now how can you keep your vision oops trying to please everybody? Can't. The film never finds a tone wavering between the novel's apocalyptic sarcastic allegory of society's prejudices cruelty ridicule and flawed power systems and clumsy attempts to insert scifi thriller touches and invest on plot. Well Saramago's novel is a masterpiece NOT because of the plot but for the exquisite prose and caustic politicophilosophical insights.It would be easy to blame the film's failure solely on Don McKellar's schematic adaptation that resembles a first draft riddled with bad dialog and pedestrian ideas plus a narrator Danny Glover's character that confusingly comes in halfway into the film. But the problems are all around Csar Charlone's visual gimmicks soon get tiresome the blurring white blindness ultimately drains the film of all life it takes away the visual as well as the emotional edge Marco Antonio Guimares's music is abysmally bland Daniel Rezende the superb editor of City of God never finds a compelling rhythm alternating chopped scenes with unnecessary longueurs e.g.the embarrassing cute dog sequence. Art director Tul Peak nails the claustrophobic squalor of the quarantine facility but the garbagefilled streets often look suspiciously composed.The actors seem lost and that's a shock considering Meirelles's former films remember how City of God had allaround brilliant performances?. Though they're supposed to play stereotypes doctor wife whore etc they lack the transformations that are the crux of the novel  how they work out their humanity in extreme mondo cane conditions. Mark Ruffalo of whining voice and gutless face looks like a boy who's lost his mommy rather than a dedicated ophthalmologist who slowly sinks into depression because he's impotent to help others or himself. Danny Glover plays a weatherbeaten oneeyed old man incongruously sporting a supermegawhite Beverly Hills dental job that renders him impossible to believe in. The Japanese couple struggle with ludicrous scenes and dialog. Alice Braga is strong and sexy but her character's complexities never surface especially the nature of her relationships with the young boy and the doctor. Maury Chaykin's repellent character is underwritten and underexplored and he turns to overacting for attention. Don McKellar's thief is an embarrassment and Sandra Oh's cameo is a waste.Julianne Moore spends the first half hour repeating her role of the depressedmisunderstood wife in The Hours cakebaking included. She fails to convey the bewilderment as to the why she's the only one to keep her eyesight but she's good when she gets into action though she could take a break from her de rigueur slowmotion crying scene with that weird thing she does curling her mouth upside down my friend said Oh no it's coming!. The best performance comes from Gael Garca Bernal playing the amoral jackass opportunist he makes the most unbelievable character how about his rise to power? And gun? And ammo? come to life  in his scenes we recognize Meirelles's naughty unPC sense of humor.Above all it's Meirelles director coproducer and responsible for the final cut who disappoints his customary assertive filmmaking flounders in hesitation here. Perhaps he felt the burden of trying to remain too faithful to the novel of a Nobelwinner who's still alive. Perhaps he felt crushed by the brooding material Meirelles is best when he can let irony and humor show as in Domsticas and City of God. Though some people complain about the graphic sexrape scenes they're actually almost bashful at least after the recuts. The novel's corrosiveness asked for an uncompromising irrepressible director of Buuel's lineage  if there was one  to do it full justice the characters' passivenessimpotence recall Exterminating Angel. In this our time Bla Tarr could've made it gloriously bleak Lars von Trier could've turned it into a shattering sardonic horror if he got back into his splendid KingdomZentropa shape.Blindness is not bad at all  it's just insipid and frustrating. Maybe Meirelles should do next a Portuguesespeaking Brazilian film again and refuel his soul with his own culture language and themes. Brazilian cinema needs him badly abroad he's just one more talented competent foreign director and these multinational ventures often turn out muddled or impersonal think Kassovitz Susanne Bier Hirschbiegel.... He can do much better and we deserve much better from him.".

	schema:reviewBody "An adaptation of the allegorical eponymous novel by Jose Saramago. It tells the story of a group of people who are confined in an old abandoned asylum by the Government after the spread of a global pandemic of a strange contagious white blindness.The movie follows well the book story but completely forgets the human and social critique and the philosophical and political questions embedded in it. In fact the original title of the book is Essay on Blindness and it is part of a series of philosophicalliterary essays on different themes related to humanity social and political structures. In other words the soul and insight of the book are lost in translation.The book is confronting shocking and much harder and darker than the movie. The movie is a succession of weird shocking events that have no point a confrontation between good and evil in an apocalyptic world... Wrong and simplistic. This is so because the scriptwriter and the director missed the most important elements of the book or simply thought that the viewer would not want or understand more complexity.Part of my disappointment has to do with the acting. Most of the actors are uninspired and badly directed and some of them miscast. I did not believe them at all in their roles especially Ruffalo and Moore who seem not to believe the roles they are playing or the circumstances in which they are placed. I found stereotypical and offensive the use a Hispanic played by Gael Garcia Bernal as the bad guy I mean that's typical of mainstream stupid Hollywood movies and it was not in Saramago's book.It is great that we can experience the white textured involving blindness that the characters suffer which is beautifully portrayed in the movie. However there is too much clarity and whiteness in the movie which is overwhelmingly white and onpurpose blinding so we the viewers become a little blind too. I did not thing that was necessary. I think the director could have shown the white blindness from the point of view of the people getting blind so the viewer can imagine what it is like and then make the movie darker and moodier. The viewer is going to watch the movie but cannot be part of it.Miralles shows his savoirfaire in some of the most difficult scenes the ones involving the women going to ward 3 shot with great sensitivity they are raw and disturbing in the book more suggesting than showing creating and atmosphere that shows the drama but not the raw facts. It works perfectly. I also found great the depiction of the desolated city the chaos and dirtiness the city unnamed is reduced to and the life of the gangs of blind people and dogs in the streets. The music is beautiful a mix of ethereal quirky strange and delicate elements and serves the story very well. To add another positive element Saramago's book is not easy to read among other things because of his literary style so the movie is an easier approach to the story and it is still interesting.Saramago who never agreed to sell the rights of any of his books to any film producer did so in this case and after a long negotiation. Miralles directed the movie always having Saramago in mind and what he would think about his cinematographic options while adapting the novel. Saramago attended side by side with Miralles the premier of the movie. A video in Youtube watch?v7XzBkMLdAk shows the end of the movie in which Saramago is visibly moved and says that he feels as happy at watching the movie as he did when he finished his book. Well as a reader I can't disagree more.The movie has bad reviews in general and in this case I think they are deserved. To me is the lack of depth and soul the mediocre acting and the poor direction in major subjects ruins the interesting premises and storyline. Not all viewers are morons and it is up to the director to direct and edit the movie and lead the actors to the point in which they become the characters they are playing. Don't expect the viewer to fill the gaps and inconsistencies of any movie and make an essay on blindness from a bunch of apocalyptic events.".

	schema:headline " Fair adaptation of a complex novel";
	schema:reviewBody "If it can be written or thought it can be filmed said the great Stanley Kubrick who adapted most of his films from novels and turned them into his own films rather than being too literal or faithful if you prefer to the source material and often turning authors and fans of the adapted novels crazy  Stephen King anyone?. I agree with his statement. No literary work is unfilmable  which doesn't necessarily mean any literary work good or bad can be turned into a good movie. However in spite of a few flaws Blindness is a very efficient adaptation of a brilliant and very complex novel by Portuguese author Jos Saramago Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira literally Essay About Blindness and doesn't deserve all the bad reviews it's been getting.The negative reaction towards the film doesn't surprise me at all though. Fernando Meirelles after getting world acclaim with his neoclassic City of God made a very successful transition to an international project with the beautiful The Constant Gardener. His sophomore English project is very daring and dark uneasy to watch at times but also compelling and thoughtprovoking.Csar Charlone's exquisite cinematography sets the tone for the story of an unexplained white blindness epidemic. It's also a huge asset to have such a phenomenal actress like Julianne Moore to play the film's heroine as always she has a strong presence and is extremely expressive making everyone believe and feel for her character's cross of being the only one who can see in a chaotic quarantine where people have to submit to violence and rape in order to survive.My only major complaint is about the uneven first 20 minutes or so some sequences seem a little disjointed and the acting somewhat amateurish but once the first act is done the film finds its own pace and strength. Roger Ebert called it one of the most unpleasant not to say unendurable films he's ever seen. For a start it would be stupid to assume a film with such a dark premise would be uplifting and if Ebert had the slightest knowledge about the material it's based on he'd realize what he was up for so his comment is unintelligent and atrocious like the majority of everything he's ever written but he's a widely popular Pulitzerwinning film critic so unfortunately lots of people trust his opinion before going to see a movie. Even though I still prefer the outstanding novel to the film I admire director Fernando Meirelles and writer Don McKellar's adaptation for what it is smart daring and respectful to its source material without being overtly faithful or afraid of taking risks. And Saramago himself approved the film so who are we to criticize? The man knows what he's talking about if you want to see it for yourself read his novel now and then compare it to this film appreciating it not as a literary work but as the good piece of cinema it is. 810.".

However in spite of a few flaws Blindness is a very efficient adaptation of a brilliant and very complex novel by Portuguese author Jos Saramago Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira literally Essay About Blindness and doesn't deserve all the bad reviews it's been getting.The negative reaction towards the film doesn't surprise me at all though. Fernando Meirelles after getting world acclaim with his neoclassic City of God made a very successful transition to an international project with the beautiful The Constant Gardener. His sophomore English project is very daring and dark uneasy to watch at times but also compelling and thoughtprovoking.Csar Charlone's exquisite cinematography sets the tone for the story of an unexplained white blindness epidemic. It's also a huge asset to have such a phenomenal actress like Julianne Moore to play the film's heroine as always she has a strong presence and is extremely expressive making everyone believe and feel for her character's cross of being the only one who can see in a chaotic quarantine where people have to submit to violence and rape in order to survive.My only major complaint is about the uneven first 20 minutes or so some sequences seem a little disjointed and the acting somewhat amateurish but once the first act is done the film finds its own pace and strength. Roger Ebert called it one of the most unpleasant not to say unendurable films he's ever seen. For a start it would be stupid to assume a film with such a dark premise would be uplifting and if Ebert had the slightest knowledge about the material it's based on he'd realize what he was up for so his comment is unintelligent and atrocious like the majority of everything he's ever written but he's a widely popular Pulitzerwinning film critic so unfortunately lots of people trust his opinion before going to see a movie. Even though I still prefer the outstanding novel to the film I admire director Fernando Meirelles and writer Don McKellar's adaptation for what it is smart daring and respectful to its source material without being overtly faithful or afraid of taking risks. And Saramago himself approved the film so who are we to criticize? The man knows what he's talking about if you want to see it for yourself read his novel now and then compare it to this film appreciating it not as a literary work but as the good piece of cinema it is. 810.";

It was gritty well filmed but I expected more way more. The movie felt somewhat censored to me for lack of a better term. I do give credit to the director for the clever way his characters go blind and his plays on light. The plot is interesting and mysterious making you wonder what is happening and how you would react to certain situations. Julianne Moore gave a restrained quality performance and the rest of the international cast was OK but not outstanding. I think it's another case where I should have watched the film before reading the book. Rating 7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the few outstanding pictures of late 'Blindness' is hard to watch hard to stomach and hard to deal with. As other comments mention this movie leaves you somewhat disgusted at being human because the consequences of a nonexplained epidemic of white blindness appear extremely realistic.It's also perfectly understandable that some people hate this movie as it definitely vilifies everybody affected to a certain extent the only exception being the stillseeing heroine. However in the profitdriven film industry which so frequently torments our brains with just too much triviality such a wellpaced provocative thoughtinspiring piece should be appreciated more for its dare than criticized for its shortcomings.If you don't want to learn too much about the plot read no further. I give a concise summary because some of you may want to know why this film is so controversial.An unnamed city though easily recognizable as Toronto. A busy traffic intersection. A Japanese man suddenly turns blind. Unnerved drivers honking need to be appeased by a passersby. Another one offers to give the Japanese man a lift home. Once there he makes off with his car. The Japanese man waits for his wife who then takes him to an optician. The optician cannot establish his condition and refers him to a hospital. The optician heads home has dinner with his wife absolutely brilliant Julianne Moore and wakes up next morning to find that he has lost his sight as well. So has the car thief and various other patients of his clinic. It becomes apparent that the blindness is an epidemic. The optician is being transported to an isolation facility accompanied by his wife who pretends to have turned blind as well. Once there they try to set up a code of behavior for the everincreasing numbers of arrivals since they are completely left to their own devices with no direct contact to the outside world. The facility is guarded by triggerhappy soldiers who offer no assistance whatsoever and resort to violence in order to keep the affected indoors. Among them power struggles ensue. With limited food supplies a group of crooks takes control of them and coerce the others to exchange their valuables and then their women for food. Their means of authority are a gun and the instincts of a blind accountant chilling Maury Chaykin. After one of the women dies of abuse the optician's wife kills the leader of the crooks effectively ruthless Gael Garcia Bernal. A revolt ensues during which the building catches fire. The wife dares to ask the guards for help and finds the facility deserted. She takes a small group of the liberated blind across a collapsed Toronto eventually making it home. A joyful dinner with what has become her family of sorts follows. Next morning the Japanese man who was the first one affected and is still among them can see once more to the joy of everyone except a naturally blind man who had hoped to go on living with everybody wonderful Danny Glover. The optician's wife walks out on the terrace and looks up to the white sky  has she now lost her sight as it returns to the others? The criticism this story attracts from naturally blind people may stem from the accomplice of the villains. Of all the bad guys he appears to be the worst because he knows exactly how vulnerable and extorted the affected victims feel. He jumps at the chance to wield authority for once instead of feeling compassion. However this doesn't seem unrealistic and isn't presented in a discriminatory way.The meaning of the white blindness appears to be some religious castigation in the novel though this isn't pointed out explicitly. What makes this movie so fantastic in my opinion is that no explanation is offered at all. It's all about how people react upon a common affliction and the chain of degradation that ensues is so logical that I am hardpressed to remember any other dystopian film with such a clear message.And then there is Julianne Moore who makes her screen persona absolutely unforgettable  both angelic and vulnerable both forgiving and vengeful and always credible even though it is such a mystery why she is the only one not affected by the disease.In conclusion this is one of those rare movies that give you a lot more than you might have wished for.".

Her walking up to the dictator with a metal pipe and smashing him in the head would have been the obvious move. He has a gun. So? And the idea that just because the dictator had a man who was already blind on his team they had a great advantage is absurd as well. I work with blind people daily. Their blindness does not give them magical powers. They have a degree of increased sensitivity with other senses but still walk into walls and head the wrong way pretty often so while they would have an advantage in that they had no adjustments to make when the affliction hit the world that's about all.In the end I was reminded of Children of Men another film which had great promise but ultimately disappointed. At least that movie started out great however. Blindness just meandered around and did so for a long long time as well.

	schema:reviewBody "Blindness managed to slip past me without me even noticing it when it came out recently and when it was selected by others to be my Saturday night viewing in favour of another film which was not really a Saturday night thing I assumed that Blindness must be a thrillerhorror where disease threatens mankind. I figured I knew where it would go and what it would do  I was wrong. The film opens with the first man going blind and causing traffic problems and introduces us via him to an eyedoctor and his suburban cheerfully comfortable wife. When he goes blind he is collected by the military and taken into quarantine along with his wife who pretends to have gone blind. From here we find inside the camp shut off from the rest of the world and the various wards go quickly from a handful of people up to the place filled to capacity.The meaning is obvious as our focus on this world is very much meant to be a microcosm of the rest of the world and a look at what happens to daytoday humanity and morals when the senses of society and control are stripped away. It is no surprise that the only way is down from this point and the film shows us humanity stripped away to be replaced by mob rule selfinterest exploitation murder rape and so on  it is a brutal and unrelenting experience but one that is sadly quite convincing. This makes up the vast majority of the film and it is hard going. In terms of message there is only one point but it is not one that is made and then moved on from but rather a descent that has to be experienced and it is here that the film works really well. The downwards spiral is gripping even though the feel of the film is one of a quiet slow pace.In a reverse of most films like this Blindness starts with a tight focus and saves the bigger picture for the end. I liked this approach because it allowed me to get caught up in the smaller group without worrying too much about the rest of the world only to show me later  doing it the other way makes for a good opening but then also feels a bit of a step backwards to then focus on a small group. The effects of the wider world are impressive even if they are quite as convincing as the despair we had just witnessed inside the camp but personally I found the visual delivery within the camp to be of much more interest. Here we have some great cinematography which helps to make the film feel fresh and engaging as it prevents the viewer sitting back and watching from afar but rather makes our eyes part of the presentation rather than a passive part of it. The visual style is particularly important in some of the harder scenes as we are not actually shown that much but simply left to squirm as we see enough to make the rest happen in our heads. It is not unfair to say that the visual style does rather cover some weaknesses in the material by aiding the sense of engagement with the viewer.The cast are mixed because of the material but mostly are good. Moore is impressive with an unlikely character who doesn't totally make logical sense but who doesn't allow you to think about that too much. The change in her character is well done and she does well as literally our eyes in the film. Ruffalo is perhaps less striking as a performance because he does his character well  his character being weaker and more liberal within the context that changes Moore so much. Braga is also good in her part and fits in well with smaller turns from Bernal and several others who I did not know. Ironically I found two of the more famous faces to be distracting. I didn't see the point of Sandra Oh being here but she is not as distracting as Danny Glover although this is not really his fault. His material has interest and his performance is OK but he is almost an afterthought and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film ending up as more of a distraction than anything else.Blindness is far from a fun experience and I can understand why some have hated it. Nor is it a brilliantly complex film since it is essentially a journey into one point with other threads not really that well done Glover's stuff in particular. However it is intense and engaging with a great visual style to it. Watch it as an experience and when choosing who you see it with please bear in mind that it is a grim and uncomfortable affair throughout.".

He also demands currency in exchange for food and no one thinks to bring up the fact that they are confined to an unstaffed quarantined building and that the collection of material possessions is futile and useless. Or more importantly that they could easily fight back being on a level playing field...oh no wait one of them CAN SEE. But they wait until the antihero and his disgusting cohorts rape the women of the other wards albeit they are voluntary victims including their farcical heroine before she decides to use against him the weapon she has been hoarding from the beginning. And NOT ONE man objects to the women giving themselves to the repugnant legion in exchange for food though they really don't have to see above aside from the husband who is merely afraid of his own loss of dignity as a result. I guess chivalry really is dead. So is common sense. The premise is ridiculous and it is laughable to suppose that this dreck represents a coherent diatribe on human behavior as it gives way to indifference and chaos. I have had to suspend disbelief for movies before but my psyche was ready to implode from all the lingering I did during this stupendously dreadful flick. What a waste of good actors too. For shame that they presumably saw this finished product and did not subsequently withdraw themselves from public life for all eternity.

Julianne Moore pretends to be blind so she can stay with her husband. There's wonderful character development in the beginning but the middle spirals downhill.

I sat cringing through not 1 but 2 very long brutal rapeorgy scenes which could have been prevented. In the first scene one of the women is beaten to death and continually raped. These scenes are very traumatic. Even if you cover your eyes you can hear a man's graphic verbal description of how he's raping a women. If I had been warned about them I would not have chosen to watch this film. Julianne Moore has a weapon can see but goes along with being raped stands by her husband after he has sex with another women in the cafeteria and just wonders around powerless for 23 of the film as bullies horde the food. It's completely ridiculous. There's no discussion about the affair so Moore's forgiveness to her husband makes no sense. In fact she just hugs the other woman after watching them have sex.There's also a lot of feces trash and naked people scattered around some having graphic sex. I get the message that things are bad but the film just lingers in this state for an hour so I found myself getting very bored. I don't need to stare at close ups of dogs devouring people for several minutes or people's pets starving or dead in their arms.The ending is treated like a fairy tale complete with Moore's blind husband coming in like the knight in shining armor. He somehow finds Moore in a mob and rescues her. People get their sight back and Julianne Moore has sex with her husband again like nothing bad just happened. Everyone's happy. There's a scene with 3 women showering that seems thrown in to show more nudity.Blindness focuses little on the process of how society outside the quarantine area collapses and rebuilds itself. That's what I was hoping to see but it didn't happen.The film left me feeling empty. The acting was fine but I didn't learn anything new. Watching Blindness is a journey that I would not want take again. You also never learn what actually caused the blindness.".

	schema:reviewBody "n the land of the blind only Julianne Moore can see. A weird malady has spread across an unnamed city that causes white blindness in the afflicted. Moore plays the wife of an eye doctor Mark Ruffalo who fakes having the disease so that she be quarantined with her husband and the other early sufferers. The patients quickly learn that theyre on their own and that any attempts to leave the facility will result in their being shot to death. As the only sighted person Moore literally sees the inmatespatients devolve into misery and must somehow lead a small band of them to the presumed safety of the outside world.The movie begins rather strongly as a young man is suddenly blinded while driving on a busy city street. Disoriented he is helped by a passerby who takes him home but steals his car. Meanwhile an ophthalmologists office begins to fill up with people experiencing this odd blindness not one of inky blackness but of complete whiteness. The following morning the doctor wakes up with the same blindness and the only way Mrs. Eye Doctor can go with him is by pretending she too has the apparently infectious disease.The patients are kept in maximumsecurity barracks and are given sparse amounts of food that they must dole out to each other. But thats the extent of their outside help armed guards surround the buildings and shoot to kill anyone who tries to leave. Lest they you know infect normal people. So its not long before the denizens of one section ward decide they want more than their share and anarchy ensues which is compounded by nearly everyones lack of sight. The doctors wife  everyones unnamed  keeps her own condition a secret from everyone except her husband. The movie is a metaphor for the hatred within human beings for one another it seeks to show that when the chips are down we are just animals even if we suffer the same indignities because each of us wishes to be better than the next to dominate. We are not the movie argues a society built solely on equality. It also seeks to show that there are different kinds of blindness physical blindness and the blindness of man to the suffering of his fellows.Although the film is exquisitely well shot  from desolate city streets to the unencumbered chaos within the compounds walls  its alternately slow moving and predictable. Its easy to see what will happen once the victims are quarantined and its even easier to see that the doctors wife will be the one to lead some of them out of the morass. Although Moore is excellent as always as are Ruffalo Danny Glover as an eyepatchwearer and Alice Braga as a blind hooker her character seems to be less a victim and accidental leader than a chosen heroine which runs contrary to the theme of everyday people simply trying to survive without sight. Moores character the only character with sight is presented as being a good person but she is very slow to stop what are obviously Very Bad Things being done to the blind.Aside from the blindness angle there isnt much here to separate this film from other personaldisaster films to differentiate them from naturaldisaster films which would include earthquakes tidal waves and tornados such as movies about plagues 28 Days Later zombies Dawn of the Dead or infectious diseases Outbreak. The idea that people would turn on each other even though they suffer together is not new neither is the idea of a society in this case an entire city abandoning those who all have some sort of disease. And because these ideas arent new Blindness isnt as compelling as it ought to be the characters are generally one dimensional and unlikeable so this isnt even much of a feelgood movie. To tell the truth its a bit of a lifeless downer although the ending makes up for it a little.A final note The American Council of the Blind said in deploring the movie that blind people do not behave like uncivilized animalized creatures. Thats simply a silly statement. Anyone can behave as an uncivilized animalized creature particularly if they are treated as animals and quarantined from normal society which was the point of the director Fernando Meirelles to believe that blind people are not susceptible to anger despair and revenge is to believe that blindness somehow connotes angelic heroism which is unfair toward blind people as well.".

	schema:headline " A mess of a film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Another large disappointment of '08 for me. What looked like it could have been a visceral original and extraordinarily acted story of human decay ended up being a clichd and relatively typical story of...well human decay. As a study of how we deteriorate as a study given a pandemic that disables one of our vital senses it works on quite a few levels. It shows how quick we are to snap and break apart from our normal routine of living and fall into our basic needs for survival in terms of both those infected and those who aren't. Then within the quarantine building set up for those infected we see how some work hard to keep things in order and preserve the living conditions for the group as a whole while others resort to absolute anarchy in their own greedy quest for a better living for themselves with no concern for anyone else. I also thought that seeing how the marriage between the uninfected Julianne Moore and the infected Mark Ruffalo progressed throughout the course of the film was quite interesting.That's about where it stops working for me though. The film takes far too long to really get going with needless scenes showing various people discovering that they have gone blind and then the final act drags on for what seemed like an eternity. Ultimately everything is just too obvious for me to be impressed and not wait for the next typical scene to happen. Everyone starts to go blind people don't understand chaos ensues more people are infected they're quarantined and treated poorly madness breaks out within the quarantined etc. It's like they just took out the pandemic movie handbook changed the disease to blindness and played out every step like they were just reading out of the book. It was depressing really.Another thing the film did that annoyed me quite a bit was how they left so many things unanswered. How was the infection started? Why were some particularly Moore's character immune? Why was Moore the only immune person with the decency to stay with the blind while everyone else in the world abandoned them? Surely there were other husbands and wives that were immune and would have stayed with their lover? Why couldn't Moore have taken the gun from Bernal's character the second he got it? Why did they just go along with him being in charge just because he had a gun when they had someone who could see? And the most infuriating question that was unanswered and served as the basic reason for all of the chaos that broke down within the quarantine ward Where the hell did Gael Garcia Bernal's character get the gun? They never explain it and just expect us to go along with it. It's practically insulting how little is explained while they go through such a typical routine. And then it runs through so many gratuitous and unnecessary scenes to show us this decay of human nature that they are so persistent upon even though it's quite obvious that it has happened. I don't need to see closeups of people walking through piles of feces in a hallway or an attempt at showing nine women being basically raped in an artistic manner and then one of them getting killed for it.Though most frustrating of all has to be the ending. The entire film had me sitting and waiting for the scene at the end when everyone suddenly sees again for no apparent reason and there it was slapping me right in the face like an idiot. Disease comes out of nowhere and infects people with no explanation society falls apart disease ends and everyone is happy. What a waste of time. I do have to admit though that the art direction is extraordinary. I'll be surprised if that isn't in my lineup at the end of the year.Actingwise Ruffalo is the only one who was fantastic for me. He gives a shatteringly devastating performance that kept me intent on watching all the way through. Alice Braga was also quite good but that's about where the talent ends. Julianne Moore is god awful. I've always considered her a bad actress because she seems so unnatural and forced all of the time and this is the perfect example of that. It's a real shame that something so promising ended up being so bad but I've come to expect it from this year.".

	onyx:emotionText "Another large disappointment of '08 for me. What looked like it could have been a visceral original and extraordinarily acted story of human decay ended up being a clichd and relatively typical story of...well human decay. As a study of how we deteriorate as a study given a pandemic that disables one of our vital senses it works on quite a few levels. It shows how quick we are to snap and break apart from our normal routine of living and fall into our basic needs for survival in terms of both those infected and those who aren't. Then within the quarantine building set up for those infected we see how some work hard to keep things in order and preserve the living conditions for the group as a whole while others resort to absolute anarchy in their own greedy quest for a better living for themselves with no concern for anyone else. I also thought that seeing how the marriage between the uninfected Julianne Moore and the infected Mark Ruffalo progressed throughout the course of the film was quite interesting.That's about where it stops working for me though. The film takes far too long to really get going with needless scenes showing various people discovering that they have gone blind and then the final act drags on for what seemed like an eternity. Ultimately everything is just too obvious for me to be impressed and not wait for the next typical scene to happen. Everyone starts to go blind people don't understand chaos ensues more people are infected they're quarantined and treated poorly madness breaks out within the quarantined etc. It's like they just took out the pandemic movie handbook changed the disease to blindness and played out every step like they were just reading out of the book. It was depressing really.Another thing the film did that annoyed me quite a bit was how they left so many things unanswered. How was the infection started? Why were some particularly Moore's character immune? Why was Moore the only immune person with the decency to stay with the blind while everyone else in the world abandoned them? Surely there were other husbands and wives that were immune and would have stayed with their lover? Why couldn't Moore have taken the gun from Bernal's character the second he got it? Why did they just go along with him being in charge just because he had a gun when they had someone who could see? And the most infuriating question that was unanswered and served as the basic reason for all of the chaos that broke down within the quarantine ward Where the hell did Gael Garcia Bernal's character get the gun? They never explain it and just expect us to go along with it. It's practically insulting how little is explained while they go through such a typical routine. And then it runs through so many gratuitous and unnecessary scenes to show us this decay of human nature that they are so persistent upon even though it's quite obvious that it has happened. I don't need to see closeups of people walking through piles of feces in a hallway or an attempt at showing nine women being basically raped in an artistic manner and then one of them getting killed for it.Though most frustrating of all has to be the ending. The entire film had me sitting and waiting for the scene at the end when everyone suddenly sees again for no apparent reason and there it was slapping me right in the face like an idiot. Disease comes out of nowhere and infects people with no explanation society falls apart disease ends and everyone is happy. What a waste of time. I do have to admit though that the art direction is extraordinary. I'll be surprised if that isn't in my lineup at the end of the year.Actingwise Ruffalo is the only one who was fantastic for me. He gives a shatteringly devastating performance that kept me intent on watching all the way through. Alice Braga was also quite good but that's about where the talent ends. Julianne Moore is god awful. I've always considered her a bad actress because she seems so unnatural and forced all of the time and this is the perfect example of that. It's a real shame that something so promising ended up being so bad but I've come to expect it from this year.";

There were many instances where I expected the film to resort to more conventions in plot and execution but the story remained rooted in its characterizations. The performances are tremendous and look and feel so real. The film clearly functions as an allegory of the condition of the world but the film stays focused on the localized story of these characters and wisely just leaves room for the macrocosm to be experienced and examined. And it does provide a hopefulness to it in the end that nicely counters its darker themes.It's unfortunate that this film has been stigmatized since its weak debut at Cannes. The wide opening with very little business last weekend isn't going to help its financial future. Right now I think the people that have seen the film and appreciate it need speak up about it. Share your opinion with others so that this deserving film can get its viewers and not fall prey to the bad press. I know it will find an audience if not on DVD where often many great films get their dues like The Shawshank Redemption. But really Blindness should get the respect and business that's relative to the vision and energy put into making it. It looks great asks important questions and hits the right emotional notes.I highly recommend it!".

Fabulous acting Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Alice Braga and Gael Garca Bernal were the right choice for their roles. Despite less dirty than the book the chaos is adequately represented. The last scene is so wonderful as in the book. It is really a shame that some critics have not liked this movie. Sincerely I do not see any reason to hate this film. Fortunately the Brazilian critique received Blindness as it deserves with very positive reviews. For what I feel in the session the audience also liked it.

	schema:reviewBody "Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo star in one of 2008's most creative and harrowing films Blindness. The film directed by Fernando Meirelles has incredible cinematography a phenomenal score and disturbing imagery. It also serves as an incredible sociopolitical commentary on America and scene after shocking scene never fails to surprise the audience.When an epidemic of a strange white blindness sweeps the nation the government tries to quarantine all of the infected into one building which soon results in fights for food rations fires infections and rape. But one woman Julianne Moore is only in the building pretending to be blind the one person among everyone who remains uninfected by this strange event. She originally came to help and stay by the side of her blind husband but it quickly evolves into something more. She becomes a guiding light helping the others but watching on in horror as the worst possible things begin to happen.Julianne Moore gives one of her best and simplest performances as the headstrong doctor's wife. That is another amazing thing about this film  we never learn anyone's name. So much of the movie is left to the imagination which makes for so much interesting dialogue especially among couples that have become infected. Mark Ruffalo was clearly outside of his comfort zone here but it was great to see him as the main lead as such an intriguing character. Danny Glover while not in the entire film was plenty of fun whenever he was on the screen and made for a superb and mysterious supporting role. The King of Ward Three played by the always lovely Gael Garcia Bernal was by and far the movie's most disturbing character and Bernal's performance is incredibly effective. The fact that someone so evil emerges so simply when placed in this sort of situation with others is simply terrifying and Bernal constantly plays on this fear.The film has a lot of nudity and a lot of violence but it's never just for filler. Every scene has a perfect reason to be where it is and nothing ever feels like it doesn't fit or flow well. The survival aspect makes this movie truly unique especially later in a scene where Julianne Moore comes across a large supply of food and has to fight to keep it. The food rationing causes people to act absolutely insane and it's always a pleasure to view human nature at its absolute worst. Also the cinematography was my absolute favorite part of this film and it's what made me fall in love with the movie almost instantly. The fear of being blind is constantly played with using lots of white and some of the other scenes inside of the wards are grimy and horrifying. The consistency of the filmmaking effects are nearly impossible to describe because they were so expertly on display.Although the movie's last ten minutes are by far its weakest Blindness remains one of 2008's finest films from both a filmmaking and storytelling perspective. The movie never seems to favor style over substance and the story and events that unfold is when Blindness is most powerful. I hope to see more films from the director and screenwriter in the future as this was simply a magnificent film that I just couldn't get enough of. If the final ten to fifteen minutes of the film had been stronger Blindness would have undoubtedly gone into my top ten films of all time.".

The style is very very sensitive on subjects that make people squirm... and the cast and crew take you through the feces literally and figuratively. I wanted to turn it off so badly. I felt uncomfortable as the film went to places that 99 of filmmakers can't or won't go. Finally someone had the guts. Why? Because people who are faced with such questions as survival must face some of the roughest and evil things as to something that we all truly take for granted such as where we will get our next meal. There are vague references to what happens below but I wouldn't call them spoilers. Others like Iluvfriends Dec 13 2009 will tell people to avoid the film. The label Blindness as crap justifying it with the inclusion of what they call rape scenes which ARE awful. My fiance and I were shocked as the scenes continued ruthlessly. The odd thing was wasn't it actually consensual? The men didn't go to the women they made a proposition and the women voted one by one to go to Ward 3 after accepting the terms that the people of the ward set.

At that stage everyone was faced with something more sinister than being unfaithful. There was clearly input from those in the the field of relationships to offer feedback on how a spouse might react. I challenge people who love a good independent film who actually can look at life from all angles instead of through one or two sides to watch without turning it off.

A young college student who is 'tapped' to become one of the elite of the elite a problem crops up and there is a lot of running in fear for the life of our hero.This installment offers up more sexual energy and more likable and well played dislikable characters a few minor changes in casting could have been made. For instance the abundance of overly WASPish pretty boys. Without debating how ethnically diverse secret societies are I'm sure all the younger members are not all pretty boys.The story what little of it was there does turn the previous movie on it's ear sort of. Which would have been more refreshing had it had the sence of suspense and wonder of the original and excluded the somewhat rushedwannabeacoolplottwistbutwasn't ending. Make no mistake though I am not saying that the first one had a lot of suspense it just seemed to have more.Unfortunately the performances of the young actors could not bring this movie to life.All in all I would recommend it if you are not looking for much depth or story.If you're looking for a movie to satisfy look for something else. I would give it a 3 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "So where should I go with this one? I am pretty sure that most can realize how bad of a film this was without needing me to spell it out for you but then some of us do need guides so here it goes. The Skulls II is a classic example of a movie company trying to monopolize on the semisuccess of the original. Using the rules of lowbudget sequel making they get lesserknown actors to replace the better known actors from the original. They repeat several select scenes that resemble the original so that the audience doesn't get confused while all the while continuing with a similar story from the original. At first glance you may not realize that there is a difference between these two films outside of the grade D actors that are trying to make a name for themselves. When will Hollywood realize that they need to stop doing this? The original Skulls film was not a boxoffice sensation so why suck even more money from an already dried well? Then to see that there is already another film released for those of us that are foaming at the mouth to get more of this secret society makes me sick. Why Hollywood why?Let me begin by getting the shredder out. The acting was horrible. I mean I have seen some bad acting in many of the films that I have seen over the years but that done by Robin Dunne and Nathan West was despicable. It was obvious from the opening sequence that they were more excited about being in a film than the overall quality of the film. This was not a good sign. The only successful task that these young actors did for me was taking me from minute zero to minute ninetyeight. The progressed the film if that is what you want to call it. Of course how can you act if you are handed shoddy material anyway? None of these characters were developed or better yet underdeveloped. I would have been happier with underdeveloped characters because I could have blamed the writers but instead I have found that both are to blame. For lack of a better word the actors in this film were lazy. They accepted bad parts for money and that is never a way to boost your career. If you have noticed these guys haven't gone further with their jobs and I would be blaming this film if I were them for their lack of good employment.Another aspect to toss in the shredder is the concept of continuity. When one directs a film you must possess within your bag of goodness the ability to move the characters from point A to point B fluently. For those of you that have seen this film you will probably agree with me that director Joe Chappelle did not have this talent. There were so many holes in this story that he tried to fill with scenes from the original that forced Chappelle to shoot himself in the foot. I could not get involved with the plot of this film because one moment the organization was doing something and the next they were doing something completely the opposite. Perhaps it was the laziness of the characters that opened these holes but we cannot leave out Chappelle. He should have pushed his team further and used his leadership abilities. I have spoken before that I felt as if the actors were there to collect a paycheck and jumpstart their careers I feel the same about Joe Chappelle. Could he not see the overall awfulness of this film? When did he finally look at the finished product and say 'We have an Oscar winner here!' If he said this then I would question Chappelle's ability to direct.Finally I would like to make a quick comment about the use of CGI in this film. For those of you who have seen this horrible horrible film you probably missed it because of the burning sensation coming from your eyes. It says something about a film when the only use of CGI is on a trashcan. A trashcan being hurled towards a person is a waste of studio money and viewers patience. I laughed hysterically when I saw this because I could see Chappelle getting excited about this scene. What kind of damage could a plastic trash can do to anyone? It is a tough question and I am thankful that hardearned money went towards the creation of this piece of cinematic history.Overall I have had enough about this organization. For this series to continue the creators directors or film studios will have to completely break the norm and go out on a limb. As I can see from the next one it looks like they have a woman that wants to join the organization. That is not the limb that I am talking about. This now trilogy was failed from the beginning yet the Hollywood recycle factor chose to release it over and over again. It was sad to see these actors and director fail but it should have been obvious from the beginning when they were handed the directtovideo release script for The Skulls II. I encourage you to avoid this film at all costs. There is nothing redeemable in it at all.Grade  out of ".

Joining this club is a dream come true for every hotblooded college man and at first all is well. Then when Ryan witnesses the death of another student all kinds of danger and deception occur. This film is so good it makes me want to go back to high school and study more for the SAT so I can get into Yale. Anyway Sommers' love interest Kelly played by Lindy Booth is also very appealing.

	schema:reviewBody "I consider myself very open minded my boyfriend was telling me about how awesome the Skulls trilogy was and that I would probably love it too. He had all three movies so we watched them together and the first film was just alright it was clichd and predictable but overall harmless and had some good moments. The second Skulls movie I was told that it was decent enough to watch so giving it a fair chance I was honestly not that impressed however I think this was a better attempt at the story vs. the first film because it wasn't as predictable and they tried to give it better twists and turns. However the film really couldn't hold my interest that well so I think like the first film it just needed a little more loving and could have been a much better movie. Like most sequels it does fall a little flat not holding up to the original. The action is good the story is better it just needed to be executed correctly and had more focus.The redrobed Skulls are at it again. The exclusive sinister secret society that makes hazing seem like pillow fights inducts Ryan Sommers who later secretly witnesses what appears to be the death of a woman at the hands of a Skull member. But of course he can't tell on a Skull because the motto is A Skull above all others which is how some of these guys get to be high government leaders and megalomaniacal industrialists. Ryan's conscience bothers him anyway but once he begins investigating how to report the crime his girlfriend Ali rejects him and seemingly everyone in a position to help him is a Skull. With the inspiration of lovely goodhearted Kelly Ryan proceeds to do what's right even if it's wrong for him.The Skulls 2 has the opportunity to be much better than the first film however due to low budget writing direction and the bad actors it wasn't given the proper attention. There is too much going on at times for you to really catch on and enjoy the film. However like I said this story does work a little better for me. I like the idea that this guy not only wants to get into this club but that he enjoys everything about it and he just finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time going in a little too deep vs. the typical too good to be true scenario. The government being evil plot is way over used in movies and The Skulls trilogy had a good chance to make this a little more entertaining since this secret society supposedly does really exist however it's just not well written. I found the relationship between the two leads a little forced and somewhat made for TV. Especially when he sees the girl that he liked originally Ali and she walks up to them crying hysterically I thought that was more meant to get a cheap thrill from the audience. I felt that we knew what was coming to her and should have just left it at that. I don't know if I'd recommend the film I watched it just to see if it would offer anything good over the first film it does alright but just could have been way better.310".

The second Skulls movie I was told that it was decent enough to watch so giving it a fair chance I was honestly not that impressed however I think this was a better attempt at the story vs. the first film because it wasn't as predictable and they tried to give it better twists and turns. However the film really couldn't hold my interest that well so I think like the first film it just needed a little more loving and could have been a much better movie. Like most sequels it does fall a little flat not holding up to the original. The action is good the story is better it just needed to be executed correctly and had more focus.The redrobed Skulls are at it again. The exclusive sinister secret society that makes hazing seem like pillow fights inducts Ryan Sommers who later secretly witnesses what appears to be the death of a woman at the hands of a Skull member. But of course he can't tell on a Skull because the motto is A Skull above all others which is how some of these guys get to be high government leaders and megalomaniacal industrialists. Ryan's conscience bothers him anyway but once he begins investigating how to report the crime his girlfriend Ali rejects him and seemingly everyone in a position to help him is a Skull. With the inspiration of lovely goodhearted Kelly Ryan proceeds to do what's right even if it's wrong for him.The Skulls 2 has the opportunity to be much better than the first film however due to low budget writing direction and the bad actors it wasn't given the proper attention. There is too much going on at times for you to really catch on and enjoy the film. However like I said this story does work a little better for me. I like the idea that this guy not only wants to get into this club but that he enjoys everything about it and he just finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time going in a little too deep vs. the typical too good to be true scenario. The government being evil plot is way over used in movies and The Skulls trilogy had a good chance to make this a little more entertaining since this secret society supposedly does really exist however it's just not well written. I found the relationship between the two leads a little forced and somewhat made for TV. Especially when he sees the girl that he liked originally Ali and she walks up to them crying hysterically I thought that was more meant to get a cheap thrill from the audience. I felt that we knew what was coming to her and should have just left it at that. I don't know if I'd recommend the film I watched it just to see if it would offer anything good over the first film it does alright but just could have been way better.310";

And although I don't think Joshua Jackson is that cute in my opinion I did think that he had a certain charm in the film.  However I never though that Paul Walker would be in danger of being the less hotter of the two but Robin Dunne makes that a reality.  He is one of the HOTTEST actors of our time or at least in my generation. But other than how hot Dunne was in the movie which is a big part of the film the movie itself was quite surprising.  I was happy to find that this movie was just as good if not better than the first Skulls. It had some great intense scenes and some great plot twists.  It kept you guessing as to what was going to happen next and made you stick around for more.  With more than a few chase scenes and sexy boxers and bras the movie really helps show off Dunne's great acting ability. Which you might be surprised to find already knowing that he is hot and can't even being able to imagine that his acting could be as good as his looks. The two female leads were good.  The brunette was probably better at playing a bitch than the blond was at playing sweet and innocent. But I liked both and was jealous of both not only because they got to share the same air as Robin but also because they both got to kiss Robin! But all in all I think that the film was definitely worth watching and I'm glad I gave it a chance instead of pawning it off as just another dumb sequel. So check it out...you'll like it.".

But all in all I think that the film was definitely worth watching and I'm glad I gave it a chance instead of pawning it off as just another dumb sequel. So check it out...you'll like it.";

In the Netherlands of course no such thing exist.. there are society's of course but they just drink too much and have too many parties. They don't go around and kill people.For me this is a disgrace to the genre. Just another teen thriller.

For thirty years now their music has entertained millions in every corner of the globe with sellout tours of the UK Europe America Australasia and South America  even Africa was bitten by the Queen bug.  Their performance at Live Aid is widely regarded as the finest that day  and if they'd given the world nothing more than 'Bohemian Rhapsody' it would have cemented their names into the history books for all time.But there is much more to them that the Rhap... and this dvd is a suggestion of some of that.  Twentytwo performances of some of their most famous and not so famous hits from the first eight years of their chart career from early classics 'Keep Yourself Alive' and 'Liar' to the camp curiosity that is 'Flash' the signature theme for the 1980 cult hit 'Flash Gordon'  it's all there.Early attempts at promotional footage give way to the landmark 'Bohemian Rhapsody' video and then a dozen or so further promos along with tv footage and live performances.  Musically this is some of the best of Queen  visually they peaked much later on.  Most of these videos are simple lipsynchtothecamera routines as opposed to actually playing with the medium as they did in the 1980s and beyond but while they might be a little bit too much for one sitting they make perfect viewing you can just dip into once in a while.On a more technical front the dvd could be much better.  The sound is impressive on the first disc  as sixteen tracks have been remastered into DTS 5.1 sound and the backup PCM stereo track is adequate for the vast majority who don't have DTS why there's is no Dolby Digital is beyond me. The audio commentary is just about worth hearing but is really a onelisten affair.  The documentary 'Inside The Rhapsody' on the other hand is an interesting if badly designed and split into segments look into the creation of the legendary 'Bo Rhap' in which Brian May plays back different sections of what remains of the original master tapes.Picture wise however  this dvd is a mess.  Whilst you can't improve some of the images that much due to the videos being worn out and low budget butchering 43 images into 169 by simply cropping the top and bottom has left several of these videos looking odd  especially on a standard television set.  The 'Bo Rhap' promo in particular with its kalidoscope imagery is ruined by the process  and it's not even consistent either as of the six videos on disc two four have not been converted and one has been altered to widescreen only to be mastered as a fullscreen image stretched onto your tv set as a result!On the whole then this dvd is a great disappointment. For a band known to be perfectionists this is sloppy.  However the chance to own these videos on a digital medium may win many people over and if it doesn't the alternate takes of 'We Will Rock You' and 'Bicycle Race' now with uncensored fat bottomed naked girls racing on bicycles will grab many a Queen fan.".

In such videos like in Bohemian Rhapsody it is really irritating. Because it was originally shot for normal 43 TVs at that time I don't understand why it is better to show it like this. It is the same crime when they crop down the half of the images of widescreen films for VHS.2. The DTS sound is not bad but why there isn't Dolby Digital? Well that is an unanswered question.3. I think they promised something about Bohemian Rhapsody alternate edit in the Special Features you know the version with the flames in it but somehow they left it out of the final version.4. The Behind the Rhapsody feature is also a deception. The documentary in which Brian shows us the original recording of the song is quite good but in the Making the Rhapsody feature we watch the video over again with Roger's commentary about every halfminutes. The Really the Best Song option you can see only a few minutes of interviews with B. and R. but nothing else.Although the DVD is a good one it worth to buy it. The videos are all in perfect state. And it is a very good chance to see videos you cannot see anywhere in the last 2030 years like the original Killer Queen video the uncensored Bicycle Race and the extra videos Keep Yourself Alive Liar etc.. Also it is good for seeing about Queen itself which was UK's greatest band for 20 magical years.P.S. GVH2. is better than this one better videos and special features but why no Innuendo videos on it?!".

I've read about him before and from memory he was an exceptional martial artist he practiced HungGar and became a folkhero to the people of China much like his father Wong Kei Ying. So there is the true story and then there is the 200 or so movies made about him. 'Drunken Master' is one of these.I haven't seen most of those 200 movies except for the Drunken Master movies Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China' series and 'Iron Monkey'. The 'Once Upon a Time in China' movies and 'Iron Monkey' may be somewhat overthetop wu xia movies but they portray Wong Fei Hung as a serious hero. 'Drunken Master' features a very different take on the character.Jackie Chan's Wong Fei Hung is a rebellious troublemaker. His father Wong Kei Ying has given up on disciplining him and sends him to his uncle So Hai the master of drunken boxing hoping that a year of training with So Hai will sort Fei Hung out. Fei doesn't seem to learn his lesson until a chance encounter with Thunderfoot Hwang Jang Lee...Storywise it is a bit of a standard kungfu plot. However in a documentary on Jackie Chan I can't remember the name I know that as of this review it isn't listed on IMDb but it was shown on SBS in 2003 'Drunken Master' was mentioned as his breakthrough hit that nearly killed his career Apparently Chinese viewers were insulted by Jackie's portrayal of Wong Fei Hung and nearly boycotted him when he was just gaining fame as an actor.Onto more important matters. Like kungfu. 'Drunken Master' is one of the kungfu classics. Boosted by the presence of martialarts star Hwang Jang Lee this pretty much made or solidified the careers of Jackie Chan and Yuen Woo Ping in his directorial debut. 'Drunken Master' features some very well choreographed fights and training scenes. 'Drunken Master' is very funny too and is one of two movies I know where a young maincharacter gets beaten by an older middleaged lady which is always funny more movies need a scene like this  the other movie is Battlefield Baseball.As a matter of interest for Jackie Chan fans 'Drunken Master' signaled the end of Jackie Chan's work with director Wei Lo. Yay. In fact the Columbia Tristar DVD release of 'Drunken Master' includes audio commentary by experts on Hong Kong cinema. I will check that out sometime but it sounds like it would appeal to fans of kungfu movies. Some more trivia  the latest release doesn't have the complete Cantonese sound track and so the English dub is used where the Cantonese track is incomplete.'Drunken Master' features awesome kungfu scenes and has some interesting historical perspectives. Ah kungfu movies and history some of my favourite hobbies together at last  1010 a must see for any fans of Jackie Chan or kungfu movies 'Drunken Master' is kungfu perfection.".

It must also be noted that these characters  even the villain  are well acted and quite likable and familiar and thus add a credibility to the film. And Yuen's direction is also very professional and a couple notches above the average for a Hong Kong genre film of the time.Lives up to its own legend and wellworth the viewing.".

His father fed up of his delinquency hires Sam Seed aka The Drunken Master to teach him some discipline as well as his secret fighting style. Naturally the two get off on the wrong foot but learn to respect each other as the film goes on whilst of course getting into the obligatory scrapes and japes. There is of course a villain of the piece in this case its the Tae Kwan Do master Hwang Jan Lee as the underworld assassin Thunderfoot who in real life was just as badass as he is in the film. So it's all pretty derivative then? Well yes and no. There is a genuine rapport between Jackie and Yu Su Tien as pupil and teacher. The martial arts is brilliantly choreographed and inventive the scene in the restaurant is probably my favourite and the whole thing has a joie de vivre.

Was it worth it? Well yeah it was but at the same time it wasn't all that I had expected.The story was fun and wellthought through about Wong FeiHung who is a rascal dishonoring his father who is a Kung Fu master. As a punishment he is to train with his uncle who is said to be ruthless and mean. The young FeiHung is in for some rough training but eventually comes to see the meaning of the tough training.Drunken Master is more of a comedy or Comedy Fu if you will than it is an actual Kung Fu movie. There is a lot of slapstick comedy in this movie as is to be expected from a Chan movie. But it also shows off the grace dexterity and skills of Jackie Chan quite well. However for the Kung Fu well it was fun to watch lots of great movies and funny situations but wow it was so horribly staged that it was painful to watch at times. It just lacked that natural flow to it to make it seem realistic and natural. I am not saying that it wasn't enjoyable far from it just don't expect it to be all that and a bucket of chicken because it was really staged from start till end.This Jackie Chan movie is a definite must have in any DVD collection of any Jackie Chan fan just don't do the mistake that I did that compare this movie with the movies from the last two decades.I got a Sony DVD release of the movie from Amazon and despite playing the original Cantonese language track it kept changing between Cantonese and some seriously doubtful English dubbing. The dubbing was so bad it was beyond belief they were even doing racial stereotypical slur at the dubbing  it was just horrible. Luckily the DVD was in Cantonese most of the time but when it changed to English dub by its own will it was just painful to listen to. These movies are meant to be watched with the original language track. English dubbing always has and always will be a horrible experience.And the ending of the movie well I was stunned at that. It just ended immediately after the final showdown. It was the most abrupt and sudden ending to any movie that I have ever witnessed.".

	schema:reviewBody "1978's Drunken Master contains the same manic slapstick humor and acrobatic martial arts talents that would become a later trademark of Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan. This movie will have you rolling in your seat with laughter. Seriously it has elements of The Three Stooges and balletic Keatonlike stuntwork so that in essence Drunken Master is the perfect actioncomedy.Directed by Yuen Wo Ping who would later become wellknown to American audiences for his work on the Matrix films and the Kill Bill flicks Chan stars as an undisciplined troublemaker who happens to be an expert martial artist. When his father disowns him following an incident with a close relative Chan goes and finds apprenticeship with a drunkard hermit who teaches him the ancient kungfu fighting style of drunken boxing.For those that don't know drunken boxing a.k.a. drunken fist or drunken master as the title would imply is a martial arts style that utilizes the staggering unfocused movements of the typical drunkard. Chan exercises the movements gracefully in one training sequence and it's one of the most effective fighting techniques though one may need to have an incredibly flexible body to master it. Because of the apparently unfocused posture of the fighter his movements are concealed from the opponent making it nearly impossible to anticipate his strikes. To be able to use the style though I'm not sure if one needs to be genuinely intoxicated to master its movements.Chan eventually masters the techniques taught to him and then uses his newfound skills to battle a lethal assassin who has since arrived to collect a price on his father's head.I don't know what it is exactly that made me enjoy this picture so much. The character Chan plays has been the object of Chinese folklore for nearly two centuries but he would later find more serious film characteristics in the Once Upon a Time in China movies with Jet Li. Drunken Master shows why Chan is the star he is today. The film captures his talents masterfully and is forthright in its execution of his hyperactive skills in the many fighting sequences.I guess time has been good to Drunken Master since it's appeared on several alltime favorite lists for martial arts movies.1010".

Seriously it has elements of The Three Stooges and balletic Keatonlike stuntwork so that in essence Drunken Master is the perfect actioncomedy.Directed by Yuen Wo Ping who would later become wellknown to American audiences for his work on the Matrix films and the Kill Bill flicks Chan stars as an undisciplined troublemaker who happens to be an expert martial artist. When his father disowns him following an incident with a close relative Chan goes and finds apprenticeship with a drunkard hermit who teaches him the ancient kungfu fighting style of drunken boxing.For those that don't know drunken boxing a.k.a. drunken fist or drunken master as the title would imply is a martial arts style that utilizes the staggering unfocused movements of the typical drunkard. Chan exercises the movements gracefully in one training sequence and it's one of the most effective fighting techniques though one may need to have an incredibly flexible body to master it. Because of the apparently unfocused posture of the fighter his movements are concealed from the opponent making it nearly impossible to anticipate his strikes. To be able to use the style though I'm not sure if one needs to be genuinely intoxicated to master its movements.Chan eventually masters the techniques taught to him and then uses his newfound skills to battle a lethal assassin who has since arrived to collect a price on his father's head.I don't know what it is exactly that made me enjoy this picture so much. The character Chan plays has been the object of Chinese folklore for nearly two centuries but he would later find more serious film characteristics in the Once Upon a Time in China movies with Jet Li. Drunken Master shows why Chan is the star he is today. The film captures his talents masterfully and is forthright in its execution of his hyperactive skills in the many fighting sequences.I guess time has been good to Drunken Master since it's appeared on several alltime favorite lists for martial arts movies.1010";

Beggar Su's techniques are harsh but very effective so when an assassin named Thunderfoot Hwang Jang Lee is hired to kill FeiHung's father the young man is able to step in and save the day.Jackie Chan's comedic style is very much in evidence here with buffoonery slapstick action and fart and poo gags plus quite a few characters with peculiar facial features a hairy mole a red nose drawn on freckles and goofy teeth and the humour will not appeal to all I nearly always struggle with Chinese comedy. Thankfully the excellent fighting more than makes up for the silliness with Jackie performing some mindbogglingly amazing feats of physical prowess making the absolute most of his Chinese Circus training. He leaps he flips he tumbles he kicks and he punches performing snake style monkey style andof coursedrunken style all with incredible energy speed and split second timing it's absolutely breathtaking to behold.Naturally Beggar Su and Thunderfoot are no slouches in the chop socky department either the old drunken beggar pulling off some very cool moves against a baddie called The Stick King Hsia Hsu and Thunderfoot more than living up to his title with his technique 30 hands and 70 legs Hwang Jang Lee is given plenty of opportunity to show off his legendary kicking skills. Also very impressive in her small role as Wong Fei Hung's auntie is Linda Lin Ying I don't know much about her but the one fight scene she shares with Jackie is quite stunningher flexibility and leg control made my jaw drop I must check out some of the other titles in her filmographyDance of the Drunk Mantis also stars Hwang Jang Lee so that would seem like an obvious place to start.".

And it really did pay off. I also wasn't expecting such high comedic moments even for a Jackie Chan film and I was wrong in every way. This film has all that trademark Jackie Chan elements and it's highly entertaining and humorous. Sure it is kind of cheesy but it actually works for a film like this. And for a Kungfu flick from the 70's it seemed to be ahead of it's time. I was either smirking or laughing most of the way through while watching this amazing kungfu film. The plot does seem a bit random at times and more bonding parts with Jackie Chan and the Drunken Master would have been cool. This is like the way better version of The Karate Kid comparing because it does have slight similarities. Except this film came first. The creativity in this is also top notch especially when it comes to the fight sequences. This film was made during the prime of Jackie Chan and it does show what Jackie is capable physically and athletically. I saw this with English Dub and despite Jackie's British accent it wasn't bad. Drunken Master is one of Jackie Chan's best.8.410".

The situations of the film will feel fresh and original to viewers that have seen mostly Hollywood films. As to be expected from an 1978 Asian movie the sound and video are not up to today's standards and shouldn't be criticized because of that as is often done by young and naive viewers. This film offers you a chance to see expert martial artists doing physical stunts that almost nobody can do.

He then seriously kicks Freddy's sorry buttAfter that Freddy trains hard in the eight drunk gods and his transformation is a joy to behold. The sequence in which Jackie demonstrates seven of the eight forms is a jawdropping display of what a highlytrained martial artistacrobat can do. YOU WILL BE AMAZED. Highly recommended and whatever  you do don't miss Jackie's fight with an old lady in the middle of the street old school kung fu fans you know the rule if the person is really old DO NOT FIGHT THEM!!! and his drunkenstyle fight with the king of sticks.

This film has couple fight scenes but the end is the best I think. But I do like the very cool training sequence. Also you get to see Jackie fight Bolo Yeung. A very good fighter. I licked the fight in the bar or what ever that was. I also liked the two or three fights were Jackie beats up some thugs. I think this film is really good. And I hope you agree. So go see Jackie get drunk and beat up on some thugs.".

	schema:headline " 110 minutes of acrobatic physicality that is mindless heartless and without a story";
	schema:reviewBody "The film that made Jackie Chan a star Yuen WoPing's Drunken Master constitutes a departure from previous Hong Kong cinema with its intensely comedic elements while paying tribute to more ancient Chinese cultural traditions. The movie has very little plot relying instead on Jackie Chan's lowbrow Three Stoogesesquire comedic timing and his acrobatic ability.It begins with an action scene and really doesn't let up until the very end of the film. The plot concerns a feckless kung fu student Chan whose father forces him to study the fighting style of the Eight Drunken Gods. Of course this means that Jackie fights his many opponents acting as if he is drunk. His physical comedy is impressive such as his drunken stagger his slapstick demeanor and his acrobatic artistry is breathtaking. Chan was raised in the Peking opera where he learned acrobatics and dancing in addition to the martial arts. This gives his fighting style a unique fluidity as he tumbles falls and leaps out of the way of opponent's blows rather than confronting them head on fisttofist. Most of the movie is really just him using his acrobatics to escape from superior enemies rather than actually fighting them. As impressive physically as this is few fights actually seem to have any resolution meaning that the fights do little to advance the narrative functioning similarly to Busby Berkeley showstoppers in his 1930 musicals. Most of Chan's comedy is low humor involving bodily functions vomiting hitting other people a la the Three Stooges drunkenness and harassing the opposite sex. The action scenes become monumentally repetitive having a mindnumbing effect on the viewer by the time you reach the end of the movie. The acting is distorted and exaggerated for comedic effect but becomes shamelessly boring when combined with the redundant action scenes. The only reason why I give this movie a 5 is for Chan's acrobatic ability. Really that is the only thing going for this movie since Yuen WoPing doesn't concentrate at all on mastering the film's formal qualities. The editing is choppy with poor coverage of the individual scenes. Clearly all the fight scenes were edited in camera so the emphasis is more on the choreography of the fights rather than the filming of them making them seem rather static and lifeless actually. The movie fails in its formal textual qualities so its only draw is Jackie Chan's childish humor and acrobatics.".

With a nickname of Naughty Panther Feihung is in constant trouble with people and no matter his intentions to help out just makes things worse for himself. When his father has had enough he sends Feihung away to be trained by a wineguzzling master Su who is not only famed for his 8Drunken Genii style but also for crippling many of his students. Feihung tries to get away from this fate but it is not long till his drunken teacher tracks him down and teaches him whether he likes it or not. However when he is humbled by the mighty killer Thunderleg he decides to train to be better no matter what it takes.I've not given up on modern releases totally but a real deathmarch of uninspiring films of late has seen me using my DVD rental subscription to get in touch with older films and also genres that do not often show up on my basic TV package. Recently this has seen me getting some oldschool martial arts films and of course Drunken Master had to be one of the first to be seen. When watching it it is important that you keep your genre frame of reference because as a film with no riders or expectations it could be dismissed as having no substance to speak of  an accusation that I myself level at many blockbusters that offer me nothing to engage with. In this case though one does have to wonder if it matters because in terms of pure entertainment value there is just about sufficient story to pull a basic frame together for an amusing and exciting film.I say this because the plot doesn't do much other than set up the many fight sequences that the film has and really these are the reason why we are all here. Without exception these are technically and visually impressive. The physical strength and control of the actors is just as impressive as the choreography and unlike modern films the camera sits back so we can see and doesn't get into the close and frantic editing which reveal the actor perhaps could only do one short movement at a time and needed lots of help from the camera. Speaking of camera movement one of the joys of the film is to see what has now become the genredefining zooms in on faces and other such clichs.Speaking of which the acting also fits this mould as it is the wonderful OTT style of acting with big hair and exaggerated performances that owe a debt to silent cinema. Chan is not at his funniest here partly because his character necessitates a degree of arrogance that takes away a little but he is still very comic and selfeffacing in his comedy. He is well supported by Yuen who is also very skilled and able to do comedy while Hwang's villain is wonderfully 1970's martial arts and full of camp menace. The support cast features some familiar faces who bring stuff to the table such as the highkicking Linda Lin and the amusing Dean Shek.Drunken Master is very much a genre film and those who do not like the conventions of the genre should not be too shocked to find that they don't like it here. However for martial arts fans and the casual viewer this is a great film with plenty of brilliant action blended with a genial and comic tone that allows it to be solid good fun.".

	schema:headline " The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer";
	schema:reviewBody "Japanese film maker talent and inventive genius Takashi Miike born 1960 has done incredible amount of films in his notevensolong career so far. He has done madeforvideo cheapies and big screen films that vary from unconventional and wonderful Yakuza tales to insane comic book adaptations to mind blowing satires and the greater the themes in these films are the more serious he is and uses his ideas and crazy creativity with restraint inside the otherwise serious world he's created a bazooka torn from a guy's back isn't any funny moment in Dead or Alive 1999 but has its important meaning for the theme telling so much about the characters and their values in the violent world Miike depicts. His Full Metal Yakuza aka Full Metal Gokudo 1997 belongs to the cheap and fastly made video films and it is easy to tell it is a very exploitation oriented market that wants simple violent and graphic films without much more merits in them. Full Metal Yakuza tells the Robocoplike 1987 Paul Verhoeven story of a killed Yakuza who gets back to life as he is turned into a robothuman by one crazy scientist. He wants to avenge the death of his friend as well as try to save his former love from the sadistic hands of the rival Yakuza. Ultra violence and gore ensues and all the potential that was used to wonderful perfection in Fudoh 1996 for example is not there in this film. There are some nice Japanese cinema elements like the silence that tells more than words. The scene in the beach after a refusal to kill one Yakuza boss is especially memorable and also close to the work of Takeshi Kitano. Still the revenge theme is not handled here as it was in Dead or Alive or Fudoh. In Full Metal Yakuza violence and acts of revenge don't have any other meaning than to satisfy the gore audience and that is pretty sad for those who'd like to see Miike making more serious cinema all the time. In real world violence and revenge is never as harmless and fun as in this film and Miike for sure would have talents to make real films from the subject matter as he's done. Also the ending showing how desperate the characters are for personal revenge and payback would be as wonderful as in those other films but now it all is just mostly comical trash as Miike definitely wasn't doing this for anything else than money and to satisfy his huge need to work. It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes. The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer a film that is filled with cartoonish violence and blood plus sadism towards both females and males. Full Metal Yakuza has plenty of swordfights ! and other bloody carnage that gives the makers an opportunity to throw in plenty of blood geysirs and splatter that satisfies some viewers but is not enough when the film is by talented director like Miike. Neither this or Ichi the Killer are to be taken seriously hardly anyone takes at least Full Metal Yakuza and especially Ichi despite its flaws and negative sides tells something about the audience that laughs looking like a bunch of monkeys and as sorry characters as those inside the film when someone's being tortured and brutally murdered. Ichi the Killer has also some interesting elements in the form of Ichi himself who is a traumatized boy with violent environment and society around him. This important theme is handled more carefully in Rainy Dog and also in Fudoh.".

His Full Metal Yakuza aka Full Metal Gokudo 1997 belongs to the cheap and fastly made video films and it is easy to tell it is a very exploitation oriented market that wants simple violent and graphic films without much more merits in them. Full Metal Yakuza tells the Robocoplike 1987 Paul Verhoeven story of a killed Yakuza who gets back to life as he is turned into a robothuman by one crazy scientist. He wants to avenge the death of his friend as well as try to save his former love from the sadistic hands of the rival Yakuza. Ultra violence and gore ensues and all the potential that was used to wonderful perfection in Fudoh 1996 for example is not there in this film. There are some nice Japanese cinema elements like the silence that tells more than words. The scene in the beach after a refusal to kill one Yakuza boss is especially memorable and also close to the work of Takeshi Kitano. Still the revenge theme is not handled here as it was in Dead or Alive or Fudoh. In Full Metal Yakuza violence and acts of revenge don't have any other meaning than to satisfy the gore audience and that is pretty sad for those who'd like to see Miike making more serious cinema all the time. In real world violence and revenge is never as harmless and fun as in this film and Miike for sure would have talents to make real films from the subject matter as he's done. Also the ending showing how desperate the characters are for personal revenge and payback would be as wonderful as in those other films but now it all is just mostly comical trash as Miike definitely wasn't doing this for anything else than money and to satisfy his huge need to work. It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes. The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer a film that is filled with cartoonish violence and blood plus sadism towards both females and males. Full Metal Yakuza has plenty of swordfights ! and other bloody carnage that gives the makers an opportunity to throw in plenty of blood geysirs and splatter that satisfies some viewers but is not enough when the film is by talented director like Miike. Neither this or Ichi the Killer are to be taken seriously hardly anyone takes at least Full Metal Yakuza and especially Ichi despite its flaws and negative sides tells something about the audience that laughs looking like a bunch of monkeys and as sorry characters as those inside the film when someone's being tortured and brutally murdered. Ichi the Killer has also some interesting elements in the form of Ichi himself who is a traumatized boy with violent environment and society around him. This important theme is handled more carefully in Rainy Dog and also in Fudoh.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've already seen Takashi Miike's 'Fudoh The New Generation' 'Visitor Q' and 'Ichi The Killer' so I'm prepared for just about anything from this amazingly prolific and eclectic director. But as 'Full Metal Yakuza' is an early Miike movie made with a small budget for the direct to video market I expected it to be a throwaway action comedy with little evidence of Miike's future brilliance. However much to my delight it actually still managed to surprise me and despite being a cheap riff on 'RoboCop' one of my all time favourite movies Miike doesn't play it safe and you can see bits of 'Ichi the Killer' in there waiting to burst out. This was Miike's twentieth! movie give or take and despite having already released his breakthrough film 'Fudoh' it was still a long way before he was to be discovered by Western movie buffs in a big way. Miike was mainly working in the direct to video market which at the time gave film makers a lot of creative freedom if they made low budget genre movies that were able to sell a few thousand copies. He certainly took advantage of that freedom as the movie mixes silly comedy bloody fight scenes tacky special effects and costumes with a brutal gang rape sequence which Hollywood action directors just couldn't have gotten away with. Miike says he wanted the audience to be confused in how they were supposed to react and I think he succeeds big time! There are a few familiar faces in the cast from other Miike movies and those by Beat Takeshi and Shinya Tsukamoto but the star Tsuyoshi Ujiki was unfamiliar to me. In Japan he is best known as a rock star with Kodomo Band. Uliki plays Hagane a bumbling low level yakuza who is killed when he gets caught in an assassination attempt on his boss whom he worships. But in fact Hagane doesn't die he is resurrected by an eccentric scientist who has created a new body for him made out of a combination of metal and spare parts supplied from his dead boss! The rest you just have to see to believe. Hagane is far from your typical Yazuza tough guy and in many ways you can see his character as being a dummy run for Ichi. 'Full Metal Yakuza' isn't quite as amazing as 'Fudoh' or 'Ichi' but it's still pretty out there and highly recommended to fans of extreme Asian action.".

	schema:headline " Robocop meets Agitator in the world of Takeshi Kitano  impossible to pin down!";
	schema:reviewBody "As you can probably gather from the title Full Metal Yakuza 1997 is one of director Takashi Miike's most polarising and defiantly idiosyncratic works. Essentially a straight to video project  produced at a time when the market for straight to video pictures in Japan was at its most financially successful  the film imaginatively blends together elements of the director's more iconic and eclectic Yakuza genre films such as Osaka Tough Guys 1995 and Fudoh The New Generation 1996 with elements of Paul Verhoeven's classic American sciencefiction satire Robocop 1987. As with the majority of Japanese Vcinema Full Metal Yakuza offered Miike creative free reign with explicit overthetop bloodshed and sexual violence interspersed with moments of black comedy pathos and continual references to old Hollywood monster movies such as Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll. All of this is naturally delivered on a minuscule budget that seemingly left little room for convincing makeup effects or indeed CGI.Harsher critics of the film often cite such budgetary restrictions  as well as the absurd almost farcical nature of the plot  as the defining factors for this films supposed failure and its irrelevance within the context of Miike's career. However supporters of the film such as myself and other such online admirers tend to enjoy the film for these very same reasons with the limited budget and obvious lofi quality of the effects adding to the overall enjoyment with the film managing to encapsulate the very best qualities of lowbudget filmmaking such as boldness originality and imagination.However having said that this is very much a film of three distinct parts and the enjoyment of each specific segment will obviously depend heavily upon the individual taste of the viewer. The first part is probably the easiest to appreciate as it is the most dramatic of the three and the more focused with none of the tongueincheek humour or references to cult scifi cinema that will appear later. In some respects it brings to mind some of Miike's more routine runofthemill Yakuzacrime pictures such as the aforementioned Osaka Tough Guys and the great Young Thugs Nostalgia 1998 as well as somewhat preempting the style and tone of later films like Rainy Dog 1997 Ley Lines 1999 and Agitator 2001. As with Robocop itself this first segment illustrates the rise and eventual fall of the central character in this case an inept Yakuza underling as he attempts to protect his boss and mentor from a fatal doublecross carried out by his own men in conjunction with a rival gang. Its perhaps the most successful part of the film for most viewers as it features no lowtech special effects or attempts at obvious shockvalue instead drawing us in through the characters and the strong performances from the likes of Tsuyoshi Ujiki Takeshi Caesar and Koji Tsukamoto. The second half of the film is the more comical referencing Frankenstein and the much alluded to Robocop as a crazed scientist played by Shinya Tsukamoto regular Tomorowo Taguchi rebuilds our hero as a supersleek cyborg replete with a massively exaggerated penis! In this segment Tsuyoshi must come to terms with his fate as well as coming to terms with his new and improved? body building up his strength shooting skills and fighting ability in a hilarious montage before going off to claim bloody revenge in the name of his slain master!Subtextually the appearance of Taguchi as the central creative figure of this full metal yakuza is interesting in the sense that the film presents a similar thematic and philosophical ideology to that of Shinya Tsukamoto's cult classic Tetsuo The Iron Man 1988 in which a mildmannered Tokyo salaryman finds himself inexplicably turning into a mass of wires metal and steel and must eventually struggle with the inevitably disturbing consequences! The similarity is further stressed by the casting of Koji Tsukamoto Shinya's younger brother. Obviously Full Metal Yakuza presents these themes in a way that is completely different to Tsukamoto's dark expressionistic artdrama but clearly the parallels are there and are exploited by Miike in a clear attempt to give a greater sense of meaning to the drama between satisfying his own more subversive impulses as a grand provocateur.The third part of the film is more interesting but also at odds with the more outr sequences of violence and revenge reminding me of some of the more thoughtful and tender moments of films like Rainy Dog The Bird People of China 1998 and Dead or Alive 2 Birds 2000. It also ties this film in with certain images and ideas presented in the later film Dead or Alive Final 2002 which also features a cyborg character struggling with the more humane intricacies of their existence in a slow and hypnotic almost Takeshi Kitano inspired moment of surreal seaside tranquillity.This particular segment of the film  bookended by scenes of rampaging revenge  is really the heart and soul of the story and seems to be a conscious move on Miike's part to instil this very warped very silly little pastiche shocker with a genuine sense of character opening up further avenues of interpretation or simply giving us a brief moment to reflect on the violence and bloodshed that will continue through to the closing moments? Full Metal Yakuza definitely isn't classic Miike with the three disparate acts failing to make a fully consistent whole feeling at times like three completely different films edited together but it is certainly entertaining filled to the brim with moments of humour action thought and disgust as well as a whole host of imaginative and inspired sightgags and setpieces. As you would expect from any film by Takashi Miike there are a number of fairly shocking images presented for laughs including rape necrophilia dismemberment torture and death as well as an incredibly bizarre ending which  when viewed within the context of the first fortyminutes  seems to belong to an entirely different film!".

	onyx:emotionText "As you can probably gather from the title Full Metal Yakuza 1997 is one of director Takashi Miike's most polarising and defiantly idiosyncratic works. Essentially a straight to video project  produced at a time when the market for straight to video pictures in Japan was at its most financially successful  the film imaginatively blends together elements of the director's more iconic and eclectic Yakuza genre films such as Osaka Tough Guys 1995 and Fudoh The New Generation 1996 with elements of Paul Verhoeven's classic American sciencefiction satire Robocop 1987. As with the majority of Japanese Vcinema Full Metal Yakuza offered Miike creative free reign with explicit overthetop bloodshed and sexual violence interspersed with moments of black comedy pathos and continual references to old Hollywood monster movies such as Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll. All of this is naturally delivered on a minuscule budget that seemingly left little room for convincing makeup effects or indeed CGI.Harsher critics of the film often cite such budgetary restrictions  as well as the absurd almost farcical nature of the plot  as the defining factors for this films supposed failure and its irrelevance within the context of Miike's career. However supporters of the film such as myself and other such online admirers tend to enjoy the film for these very same reasons with the limited budget and obvious lofi quality of the effects adding to the overall enjoyment with the film managing to encapsulate the very best qualities of lowbudget filmmaking such as boldness originality and imagination.However having said that this is very much a film of three distinct parts and the enjoyment of each specific segment will obviously depend heavily upon the individual taste of the viewer. The first part is probably the easiest to appreciate as it is the most dramatic of the three and the more focused with none of the tongueincheek humour or references to cult scifi cinema that will appear later. In some respects it brings to mind some of Miike's more routine runofthemill Yakuzacrime pictures such as the aforementioned Osaka Tough Guys and the great Young Thugs Nostalgia 1998 as well as somewhat preempting the style and tone of later films like Rainy Dog 1997 Ley Lines 1999 and Agitator 2001. As with Robocop itself this first segment illustrates the rise and eventual fall of the central character in this case an inept Yakuza underling as he attempts to protect his boss and mentor from a fatal doublecross carried out by his own men in conjunction with a rival gang.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought of a couple of director Takashi Miike's movies while watching Full Metal Yakuza Ichi the Killer and Izo because of what they have sort of in line with it. Both of those films have a protagonist who more or less is on a hellbent path of murderous destruction. But even Izo in comparison with this and I consider Izo a flawed film is more worthwhile than this minor claptrap. Maybe it's also a sign of what Miike had with better things to come as it was just a short onassignment gig to fill up his VCinema requirements. Not that you can't tell he might've had a hand in some scenes notably the most violent and abrasive ones where the hero of the title gets his revenge albeit with the head of one yakuza and the heart  body of another hoho. There's not much story to it at all except that a lowly gangster gets gunned down when his mentor a yakuza previously in jail for 7 years gets out and gets killed too. A mad scientist dubbed the nutty professor double hoho puts them back together and this time totally in metal. Not that there aren't any other special modifications too like in the groin area to be precise not just quick blue electrical flashes go through when he gets charged up.Then the exploitationfun continues as the bare plot wheels away until I couldn't really care less about whatever really happened with most of the characters and just wondered when the next big huge violent gush of blood would occur. The special effects even for something as quick and ultra lowbudget and yes even for a Robocop spinoff it's very lowbudget even with an invention or two in Miike's arsenal are cheesy and sometimes the filmvideo speed reminded me of seeing kids movies from the 80s or something. The only side development in any of the characters however shallow is with a woman a prostitute I believe who is with another man after a previous illtimed engagement. Sure to be OK enough for most just looking for a splatteriffic time but I think to really get a lot more laughs out of it I'd have to be pretty wasted. It's not devoid of punch but it's got nothing in the way of a sharpness of wit or wild visual panache of Miike's other works. It's just what to expect a VCinema gimmick made long into a feature with soso acting and a yakuza story that's nothing new I don't even think it'll get too much better if on a repeat viewing either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guess that in potential this could had been a truly awesome and insane revenge flick but the movie instead goes for a more overthetop and comedy like approach. It doesn't really has the desired effect since it more often makes the movie just silly instead of entertaining or funny.Normally I either really love or truly dislike a Takashi Miike movie but in this case I'm stuck in the middle somewhere. I really didn't hated the movie but at the same time was also never impressed or entertained enough by it.Because the movie takes a more comedic approach it's also being a more simplistic one to watch. It's very straightforward without any good depth or underlying emotions to the movie its story and themes. It's why the movie feels like a bit of a bland one as well as redundant even for the fans of Takashi Miike movies.For a Takashi Miike movie it also certainly isn't edgy enough. It sounds weird with all of the violence and gore in this movie but the movie feels quite tame and like it's holding back with its graphic violence. This is something Takashi Miike normally really never ever does! But it's a movie from before the days he became an established name really so it perhaps isn't so surprising that this movie doesn't feel as edgy and daring as most of his later work.Another problem I really had with this movie was its story. To say it bluntly this movie really seems to be a Japanese remake of RoboCop. It uses a very similar concept and even some of the characters and sequences seem alike. So originality was also a big problem with this movie. And as a matter of fact it makes the movie even weaker considering that it isn't even halve as good or half as edgy and daring as Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop. It makes this movie feel like a bit of a lame ripoff attempt.But despite all criticism this is still a movie you could have some fun with. It's definitely entertaining to watch in parts and with a Takashi Miike movie you are always getting something unique and unusual. The movie is still filled with plenty of moments like that. So despite not being to original with its story it still is at least being original with some of its scene's.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Myself included.Most notable for his noholds barred nothing is too over the top style and his prolific release schedule Miike has his paws on any number of crazy weird for weird's sake films over the last couple decades.This is a slightly earlier work though as you will read it is no less wacky. It just isn't that good or different to set it aside from the pack.This is probably why Weird Al Yankovic is suddenly amusing every few years when he latches into to some popular song and tweaks it slightly. Every so often it is funny to hear a zany version of something just for a laugh. But you can't keep releasing the same thing every year and expect it to sell which is why Weird Al has two crappy sellers in between his occasional hit and it is why Takashi Miike is know as the guy who made Ichi the Killer and not Ichi plus Demon Pond plus NGirls Vs Vampire. Look at his IMDb page I could go on and on with insane sounding names.The fact is for every time that an audience is ready to be entertained by a left field movie there are years where they just aren't interested in a half cyborg wannabe Yakuza warrior.Which brings me to Full Metal Yakuza which must have been written in 3 minutes after the title was conceived.Now just try to follow me here this'll no doubt get messy. A Yakuza heavy named Tosa attempts a hit on his rival gang leader which nearly succeeds and is very definitely bloody he is imprisoned as a result.He is admired by Hanage a Yakuza underling who desperately wants to be part of the team but is just too useless and ineffectual to get the shot. In early scenes he is beat up by kids shows cowardice in scenarios that might earn him credit and is unable to please his chickie. To make matters worse his own brother is most certainly In and he makes no secret at times of his contempt for the inferior Hanage.After time elapses Tosa the Yakuza thug is released from jail and Hanage is given a task to drive him meet the boss. He feels this is his big chance to make a good impression only he doesn't realize that the gang boss wary of inflaming a gang war has sacrificed both Tosa and Hanage to appease the Yakuza boss that narrowly avoided death earlier.Phew you still there? So after the hit Hanage wakes up or should I say is rebooted by a mad inventor who has used parts of both Hanage's puny body including his head and Tosa including his wang and filled in the gaps with robotic inserts and metal reinforcement hence the title.He heads back to society initially trying to cover up his new metal status. He finds out that his Bro is now very successfully banging his chick and that noone misses the old Harage at all. Worse than that he finds that if he is caught in the rain his metal parts short circuit which leads to the question of whether rusting between the thighs causes sparks when chafing occurs? So after the short circuit he wakes up again realizes that if he eats metal he is temporarily superpowered only the Yakuza side sometimes takes over which turns him into a superkilling machine capable of only overthetop violence only the best kind there is.Really they should have ended the movie there as Miike no doubt had nothing further in the script than A Yakuza robot would be awesome! but there are still 45 minutes to go.Soooooo...Without spoilers some other things happen Tosa's ex widow? gets involved and both parts of the robot are thirsty for revenge.There is much gushing and severing blood curdling creams abound and Takashi's obvious disdain for women manifests itself often in frequent scenes of pointless torture and violence.Final Rating  5.5  10. A typical Miike film only somehow slightly less so.If you liked this review or even if you didn't check out oneguyrambling.com".

	schema:headline " A revenge tale by Takashi Miike";
	schema:reviewBody "Kensuke Hagane Tsuyoshi Ujiki is a beginner in the Yakuza world  he is very fearful and nobody respect him. After the prison release of Tosa Takeshi Caesar who is a Yakuza boss and the idol of Hagane both are killed as a result of a gang problem with Tosa. Both corpses ends in the hands of mad scientific who creates a kind of robot with parts of both corpses. Now Hagane is part machine with some parts of Tosa he is bullet proof and has an incredible strength. When he escapes from the scientific he is looking out for revenge with the heart of his boss and idol literally.This is the main plot of this unique directtovideo film and that is full with elements that only a Miike film can have. The storyline is pretty simple and very common in a Yakuza or Mafia film because is just a revenge story but Full Metal Yakuza is not a common Yakuza film. Since the main character Hagane who is not the usual Yakuzagangster with the badass attitude is more like a common guy and he is always afraid. And the scifi elements with all the influence of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop Miike said that Verhoeven is one of his biggest influences are really bizarre and sometimes funny. So the film is like the main character who is part Hagane part Tosa and part machine the film is part scifi part Yakuza part comedy and sometimes is really absurd. And creates bizarre situations like Tosa's girl is in love with Hagane but what she don't know is that Hagane has parts of Tosa including his penis. Or Hagane eating metal with milk really bizarre situations like in every other film of Miike.So i really love this film because is unique and for be released directtovideo with a very low budget it has a very good response in part because of the cult success of Miike in the West. But anyway the directtovideo industry of Japan don't have the same bad reputation of it Western counterpart. And according to the interview with Miike in the DVD he likes to make films in this industry due to the creative freedom and the less stringent censorship.Conclusion this film is great and unique not Miike's best but anyway this film works because of it originality. And is hard that you know about this film before watching Audition or Ichi the Killer so if you watch this film like in my caseis because you are into Miike so you must know his bizarre style. Takashi Miike is for me the kind of director that when you see a DVD with his name you don't care about anything else you just want to see more of his films so i really recommend this film to anyone who likes Miike and also to anyone who want to know about him because this is a great start into his work. 9 out of 10DVD i have the Region 1 DVD that i think is the only available in the American continent. Is really good with interviews with the cast and with the crew and anyway is the unique form for watch this film. Also i hope that soon more films of Miike can be release in Mexico and of course with Spanish subtitles.".

If it had a huge soundtrack budget it would be indistinguishable from a Japanese version of Kill Bill. Some of the gore effects are... quite unique. Along with some typical Japanese phallic humor the movie does manage to hold your attention. Enjoy the movie for what it is a quick and dirty gore flick with some 'interesting' bloody special effects that would make Quentin Tarantino become nauseous.".

It's cheap and cheesy gore and I have no complaints about that but the script appears to have been written by a drunk zombie. Truly it sucks. The interview with Miike on the Arts Magic DVD pretty much explains how and why gonzo trash like this got made but it doesn't really redeem the 75 of this movie which is just ham awful. It would make a great manga but the translation to live action only serves to emphasise the lameness of the Frankensan plot. It clunks but as a contrast to the beautifully scripted and acted films he's made since it just about bears watching. Try to borrow or steal a copy of the DVD. That way you won't feel ripped off.".

	schema:headline " Takashi Miike madness but unfortunately only the madness not the cinematic wonders he is capable of";
	schema:reviewBody "Japanese film maker talent and inventive genius Takashi Miike born 1960 has done incredible amount of films in his notevensolong career so far. He has done madeforvideo cheapies and big screen films that vary from unconventional and wonderful Yakuza tales to insane comic book adaptations to mind blowing satires and the greater the themes in these films are the more serious he is and uses his ideas and crazy creativity with restraint inside the otherwise serious world he's created a bazooka torn from a guy's back isn't any funny moment in Dead or Alive 1999 but has its important meaning for the theme telling so much about the characters and their values in the violent world Miike depicts.His Full Metal Yakuza aka Full Metal Gokudo 1997 belongs to the cheap and fastly made video films and it is easy to tell it is a very exploitation oriented market that wants simple violent and graphic films without much more merits in them. Full Metal Yakuza tells the Robocoplike 1987 Paul Verhoeven story of a killed Yakuza who gets back to life as he is turned into a robothuman by one crazy scientist. He wants to avenge the death of his friend as well as try to save his former love from the sadistic hands of the rival Yakuza. Ultra violence and gore ensues and all the potential that was used to wonderful perfection in Fudoh 1996 for example is not there in this film.There are some nice Japanese cinema elements like the silence that tells more than words. The scene in the beach after a refusal to kill one Yakuza boss is especially memorable and also close to the work of Takeshi Kitano. Still the revenge theme is not handled here as it was in Dead or Alive or Fudoh. In Full Metal Yakuza violence and acts of revenge don't have any other meaning than to satisfy the gore audience and that is pretty sad for those who'd like to see Miike making more serious cinema all the time. In real world violence and revenge is never as harmless and fun as in this film and Miike for sure would have talents to make real films from the subject matter as he's done. Also the ending showing how desperate the characters are for personal revenge and payback would be as wonderful as in those other films but now it all is just mostly comical trash as Miike definitely wasn't doing this for anything else than money and to satisfy his huge need to work. It is hard to make any interpretations on single images and scenes while everything before and after them fights against any serious analyzes.Also the way how females are treated and depicted is pretty unpleasant. I don't think there's even one normal calm and balanced female character here all are just screaming and sudden bitches that just need to be killed off by the more or less restrained men. The ending involves a very nasty abusion scene of a female character and that is definitely too strong in a trashy film like this. But fortunately it ends in a way that at least that female had someone who cared for her and loved her so at least females are not completely worthless in the film. Miike has depicted females in various ways and at least films like Fudoh and Rainy Dog show them equally significant if not always strong with the men.The film has also very few of the wonderful cinematic elements and ideas of Miike like the kinetic storytelling and speed of City of Lost Souls aka The Hazard City 2000 the brilliant and surreal imagery of one of his masterpieces Dead or Alive the claustrophobic creepy and disturbing brilliance of Audition 1999 or the manic elements in the soundtrack editing and camerawork of Koroshiya Ichi aka Ichi the Killer 2001. Of course the budget in Full Metal Yakuza was much smaller than in those mentioned films but still the film doesn't offer any significant achievements of its director other than the typical ultra violence and silliness. At least the always so great criticism towards the Japanese censors who like to censor all the pubic hair off the films is there and again very delightfully so. Another examples of these opinions can be found in his films like Visitor Q 2001 and Rainy Dog 1997. I'm sure the Japanese producers and censors have a lot of fun when they see what has Takashi done now!The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer a film that is filled with cartoonish violence and blood plus sadism towards both females and males. Full Metal Yakuza has plenty of swordfights ! and other bloody carnage that gives the makers an opportunity to throw in plenty of blood geysirs and splatter that satisfies some viewers but is not enough when the film is by talented director like Miike. Neither this or Ichi the Killer are to be taken seriously hardly anyone takes at least Full Metal Yakuza and especially Ichi despite its flaws and negative sides tells something about the audience that laughs looking like a bunch of monkeys and as sorry characters as those inside the film when someone's being tortured and brutally murdered. Ichi the Killer has also some interesting elements in the form of Ichi himself who is a traumatized boy with violent environment and society around him. This important theme is handled more carefully in Rainy Dog and also in Fudoh.Full Metal Yakuza is filled with desperate and weak human beings that have only few civilized characteristics that make it able to call them men not only beasts which they very often are inside in Miike's cinema. Full Metal Yakuza is far from his greatest achievements and ambitions and thus is not at all among his most noteworthy films but that is understandable considered the film's speedy low budget exploitation money maker status. 410 but only as a lover of Japanese cinema. Anyone with not interest in this great cinema and its elements won't likely to be able to sit through the manic and insane and also the most uninspired examples of it like Full Metal Yakuza.".

It has a scene highly reminiscent of The Brain that Wouldn't Die and a plot line that can be seen in anything from Killing Machine to Machine Girl and all kinds of movies that have happened before and since. Yet still I dare you to watch this movie and say Yeah I've seen it all before. Won't happen Miike's too playful and too willing to go there there being just as far as you didn't think anyone would go before.So simple plot synopsis this guy Hagane is in the Yakuza only he's an impotent fool and a coward and is only in his family because he greatly admires his Brother Tosa. But when Tosa gets gunned down and Our Intrepid Hero catches a few bullets in the process a selfproclaimed Mad Scientist appears out of nowhere to recraft him out of metal spare bits and the heart genitals and tattoo of his hero. Fully equipped on more levels than one it's time for Hagane to wreck vengeance. And stuff.There are some pretty amusing scenes here. For the most part this movie is kind of wonderful because it's a playful and actionfilled male wishfulfillment. He's nearly invincible he gets to destroy stuff easily and he gets a bigger penis. Of course Miike isn't satisfied with only one emotion and scenes range from hilarious to sentimental to disturbing switching gears on a whim and always allowing an opportunity for silly facial expressions the acting in this movie is great by the way. Japanese actors have this wonderful way of stretching their faces.Funnily enough the tone of Full Metal Yakuza fits closer to Zebraman than most of Miike's other work. Ultimately it's playful and escapist by nature which is not honestly what he does all that much. But whereas Zebraman can sort of kind of almost maybe be considered a children's movie except for its strangeness and a couple sordid scenes this is closer to Heavy Metal type escapism fully adult entertainment and yet full of boyhood passion.PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " Zombie movie from Japan... the usual weirdness";
	schema:reviewBody "Zombie movies have been taking rather weird turns in development recently. We got romantic zombie movies Shaun Of The Dead we got superfast zombie movies 28 Days Later and Dawn Of The Dead we got superhero comic book zombie movies Resident Evil Apocalypse and we got nonzombie zombie movies again 28 Days Later. Well things just continue getting weirder and weirder and now we got this Tokyo Zombie a completely offbeat comically silly representation of a zombie Holocaust in Tokyo. Even stranger the choice of weapon against the undead scourge is neither swords or guns. It's wrestling Jujistsu to be more precise. I was interested enough with it's premise but when I heard it starred two of my favorite Japanese actors Sho Aikawa and Tadanobu Asano well I really had to watch it.Tokyo Zombie as it's name suggests takes place in the Japanese capital. There due to the unpleasant habits of the local population to throw away their garbage wherever they like to has caused a large mountain of trash to appear. But people are not content with just that oh no they continue burying more and more stuff in that mountain. Ranging from refrigerators old cars even people there really is no limit. This is where our heroes enter the story Fujio Tadanobu Asano and Mitsuo Sho Aikawa two obsessed with wrestling garage workers who end up accidentally killing their boss. Of course that mountain prompts the obvious solution to their disposition and they naturally decide to bury him there. What they don't know and later find out is that all the dumped trash has created a chemical reaction that causes the dead buried in the mountain to rise again as flesh eating zombies.Instead of trying to make a relatively serious story director Sakichi Sato takes a turn for the comedic. The plot is an obvious pastiche of classical zombie scenarios. Starting with the zombie epidemic to the postapocalyptic society Sato presents an over the top comical side to this all too familiar plot. The overview of how the postepidemic survivors continue to exist is quite funny Sato answers one of the biggest mysteries of zombie movie. How do people create electricity when the entire world is supposed to be overwhelmed by endless hordes of undead flesh eaters ? Well the answer is simple. Squeeze Electric a company that supplies all the pollutantfree electricity citizens would need. It works by using state of the art technology requiring just a few hundred people whose's daily work includes squeezing an electric pod that in terms creates the all needed energy. Everything is completely ludicrous. Characters are no exception with quirky outright funny dialog and a strangely obsessive singeminded behavior they breathe a fresh air of unseriousness to this already not very serious situation.For a zombie movie Tokyo Zombie is pretty light hearted. Anyone expecting bucketloads of gore and blood will be disappointed there is really only one situation that could be described as disturbingly gory. A zombie starts chewing on a wrestler's guts the whole thing lasts for less then a minute and honestly rather than disturbing it's quite funny when the victim starts making those silly facial expressions. Midway through the film there is a rather pleasant animated sequence that describes the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse. Other effects are generated using CGI and it's a hit or miss thing. Some look pretty well while other effects are plain cheesy which is not a bad thing considering the fact that it's a comedy.Tokyo Zombi is wacky wild and in typical Japanese way quite weird. It's fun overthetop plot makes it worthwhile to watch. Or if you just want to poke fun at the already way too familiar clichs surrounding the genre this is as good as it goes.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the first minute to the end of the credits this movie is a zombie movie lover's fantasy. Imagine crossing Shaun of the Dead and Kung Fu Hustle and you'll have a small idea of what kind of movie you're in for when you watch Tokyo Zombie.I scour the world of film to find movies that stand out to me as being worthy of owning. I'm very picky when it comes to movies and I've seen many films that fall into the zombie category which end up being nothing short of wasted time in my life once I reach the ending. I am a fan of Shaun of the Dead simply because it not only is a comedy but it mocks the entire genre of horror movies and zombie flicks. Tokyo Zombie is much the same in the way that you try to open your mind to it and wonder how long it will be before you can accept it's another zombie movie before you realize that you're laughing hysterically aloud at flying heads and spurting blood.Don't think that you've EVER seen effects like these before. The movie opens to two men practicing JuJitsu one of them Micchan whom believes he has cancer after he forces his doctor to tell him that's what it is after the doc insists it's just a stomach ulcer and he dedicates his life to helping his friend Fujio learn JuJitsu so once zombies start sprouting from the graves why not practice on them?The two men accidentally kill their boss Ujimoto and decide to bury his body on Black Fuji a big mountain of ash which there are apparently hundreds of people burying things from satellite dishes to refrigerators to in a funny scene the mother of a wimplike guy who's up to her head and yelling at the young guy's girl who is threatening him with loss of sex if he doesn't bury his mom but well she's up to her head in the ash and the girl gets tired of hearing this woman's rantings so she punts the woman's head and it flies off the mountain at about 50 miles per hour screaming at her son Darrrliiinnnnnggggggg!!!! in Japanese as it flies off to the horizon. I pretty much lost it at that point laughing hysterically at the comedy of it all. Usually in a movie like this you'll get a 510 min break before there's more humor but no they keep it going with a school teacher burying the body of one of his male students who he had killed while apparently spanking in school... Well he was also the teacher of Fujio and he'd spanked him quite a bit before in the past so Fujio goes down to him and beats the crap out of him with a shovel and it's pretty funny how he does it. The teacher you'd think dies then but no he gets up a few minutes later to find his pants missing but is happy to see a young woman come out of the ground who's eyeing his exposed penis with a hungry smile so he decides to let her enjoy it and she does with zombielike abandon... Immediately following this the two JuJitsu buddies drive over the wandering body of the boy who's mother's head was booted off into the sunset because they're arguing as to whether or not the teacher had his way with Fujio in the past or not.All of this happens within the first 15 minutes of the movie well by 14 minutes and 11 seconds to be exact. The movie's script is well done the acting is quite nice the graphics and especially the zombies are very well done. I personally will end up recommending this movie to many of my friends and I'm sure that it will become one of my new favorites in not only Asian cinema but also in the realm of true horrorcomedy.If you have the chance to see this movie don't pass on it I'm sure you'll enjoy watching it none of the scenes are overthetop and none of the acting seems forced. It's a wellbalanced flick which I will keep in my mind's database of A movies and I'm sure I'll reference it whenever I try to explain how some Asian movies are well worth watching.I hope this review and my comments have helped you make your decision about this movie.".

You need to approach this movie with no sense of an actual serious zombie movie. This is a zombie comedy spoof and it have so many elements that seen to be making fun of a lot of Romero's movies. So think of a Japanese version of an extreme version of Shaun of the Dead then you will have a rough idea of what Tokyo Zombie is like.Tokyo Zombie is extreme in so many ways but it works out well enough because it is extreme in a hilarious way.

This is a very low budget entirely offbeat Japanese comedy that's more interested in the sport of jujitsu than actual zombies. In fact the zombies themselves turn out to be a mere plot device a background for the central storyline which is about the friendship between two demented buddies.It starts off on a fairly good footing reminding you of some of the classic Japanese zombie films like JUNK and VERSUS which all seemed to be filled with loads of chaotic energy and incident. Sadly as the storyline progresses at a very slow pace indeed you realise that TOKYO ZOMBIE just doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be. The zombies are dull and the storyline is silly going nowhere and offering little of the surreal humour I'd expected to see.It all falls apart for me around the halfway mark where there's a gap of five years because the second half just isn't as interesting as the first. The whole idea of the satirical gameshow is just a flop from the beginning and the film concludes with a whimper rather than a bang. The characters are an acquired taste to say the least and the production values are low I usually like offbeat Japanese fare but not this time. I didn't laugh once.".

The zombies are dull and the storyline is silly going nowhere and offering little of the surreal humour I'd expected to see.It all falls apart for me around the halfway mark where there's a gap of five years because the second half just isn't as interesting as the first. The whole idea of the satirical gameshow is just a flop from the beginning and the film concludes with a whimper rather than a bang. The characters are an acquired taste to say the least and the production values are low I usually like offbeat Japanese fare but not this time. I didn't laugh once.";

	schema:headline " Good Japanese Zombie Film Not Quite Great";
	schema:reviewBody "Two Japanese friends accidentally kill their boss and dump his remains in Black Fuji a mountainlandfill hybrid. This leads to poor results when the chemicals of the landfill mix with the corpse and many other corpses to give rise to a zombie infestation in Tokyo.This is a pretty bizarre film. Two men fight zombies with jujitsu. Not swords not guns but facesmashing jujitsu. One of them has a 'fro haircut while the other is bald. It's just an odd pairing. The film has been called the Japanese Shaun of the Dead. I see it. I think it's a stretch but I see it. Comparisons to other recent Japanese films such as Machine Girl seem more appropriate  there's a similar style of dark humor and violence coupled with cheesy CGI.There's also an attempt to connect this to Ichi the Killer. Don't be fooled by that. Ichi along with essentially all the work of Miike is better than this film. Q Audition and others just put Tokyo Zombie to shame. Perhaps it has the same writer but the fact this film was based off a manga is evident and infuses a humor that doesn't play as well in live action.This film's biggest flaw is a lack of zombies. Sure we have plenty of zombies but there still seems to be a shortage  there are periods of up to ten minutes without zombie action. These scenes are often filled with sentimental blather. Maybe in the original language this comes off better but I had little interest in hearing people talk sentimentally to each other.Typically I watch films while drinking but due to a cold I was not drinking during this one. That is unfortunate. While this movie was above average it would have been even better with alcohol. The humor is lame at some points and is either a cultural thing or just plain dumb. I'm uncertain. But all I know is that parts that were clearly meant to be funny fell flat for me.If you like Machine Girl I'd say give this one a chance. Perhaps even if you liked Shaun of the Dead though the connection is slight. A double feature with this film and a stronger Japanese film such as Battle Royale would make for a good evening. Show this one first of course. It's decent but by no means a headliner.".

	schema:headline " This movie was hilarious! But apparently it's not for everyone..";
	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie. It has a very offbeat comedy that left me in stitches. I happened to rent it randomly from a video store one night based on it's outer packaging and the line from a critic hailing it as the Japanese Shaun of the Dead. I was so smitten by the movie that I ended up buying it for myself later. I recommend this if you're already a fan of Japanese Cinema. Especially anime or manga. The comedy is so hilariously off the wall and it's probably different from what we would get here in the States. I will preface the rest of my review with the caveat that I am definitely NOT a horror movie fan. At least not regularly. I watched this movie because I thought I would find it funny and I did. A lot of other people that I showed it to didn't seem to share my sentiment. haha I don't know why. Many seemed to just find it weirdboring maybe but I found it hilarious. It definitely does have a distinct style and that may be off putting for those who can't get with it. I highly recommend it though and I think it is a very unique and quirky hilarious movie with some of my favorite and most interesting moments in cinema watching. The extras on the DVD are really worth it too.A little about the plot..the film follows the exploits of two Japanese mechanics in Tokyo who are trying to survive a Zombie outbreak. Oh and also they are Jujitsu practitioners. It's so funny seeing Tadanobu Asano trying to Jujitsu a Zombie. They travel through the country on a plan to escape to Russia. Needless to say they face some obstacles along the way. This is a really quirky and frankly hilarious end of the world tale. It is a little bit long and the pacing and way the story develops may not be what some are used to but I think if you're a fan of comic books especially alternative ones you like mangaanime or Japanese movies then you will find this movie as fun as I did. Also there are so many little things in the movie to notice that it definitely rewards repeated viewings. Like a certain snack that keeps reappearing. Also if you are a fan of JuJitsu you will appreciate that aspect as it is represented in the movie. If you get a chance watch the extras because it's really fascinating to see the interview with original creator of the comic that his movie is based on and how he himself is a jujitsu practitioner and incorporated it into his story and how hard the actors worked to actually learn the right way to perform the moves.Overall to me Tokyo Zombie is a really funny movie and it's well worth checking out. Give it a chance! Keep in mind that it is a bit different but if you stick with it you will be rewarded by a unique experience that may just have you yearning for more....brains!".

Tadanobu Asano is a highly regarded Japanese model and film star and plays Fujiothe frightwig wearing half of the dimwitted duo. Asano is better known for his more serious roles yet is able to deliver the laughs as required.

	schema:reviewBody "Among the wildest weirdest and most creative filmmaking countries are the Japanese. I love the strange and very funny films I have often seen from this moviemaking juggernaut. Sure they have made a lot of sophisticated and artsy film by the likes of Ozu and Kurosawa...but they also have brought us films like Happiness of the Katauris as well as the ultraweird films of Minoru Kawasaki. Happiness of the Katakuris is a hilarious zombie musical from Takashi Miike...possibly my favorite Japanese comedy. As for Kawasaki his films got far beyond this in strangeness...such as Executive Koala in which the leading character is played by a guy in a koala suit Rug Cop which is about a toupee wearing cop whose wig actually has a mind of its own as well as Calamari Wrestler...about a pro wrestler who is a giant squid!!! So it's not at all surprising that I would get a copy of Tokyo Zombie...a comedy zombie film from Sakichi Sat. Apparently it's based on a manga series...though I know nothing more about this.The film begins with two complete idiots Micchan and Fujio practicing very badly their martial arts instead of working. The boss catches them and is very angry...and attacks Micchan. To stop him Fujio smashes the boss in the head with a fire extinguisher and the pair then take the jerky boss to 'Black Mount Fuji....a giant mountain of garbage outside Tokyo. It seems that LOTS of murdered folks have been buried there...and soon after they plant the boss the dead all start coming to life and do what comes natural to zombies...try to feast on the living. During this period Micchan is bitten and jumps supposedly to his deathleaving Fujio with a really nasty lady he inexplicably takes care of through the rest of the film.The story then jumps ahead five years. It seems that within Tokyo the rich scum have set up a compound and they keep out the zombies...or at least most of them. They do bring in some to have them fight in an arena against various poor people who the rich have enslaved. One of them is Fujio and the awful rich women who come to the games hate him as he's too good and his fights only last a few seconds. So the man running the games brings everyone a surprise...zombie Micchan!! What's next? See the film and learn who prevails in this battle of the titans...or at least two crappy jujitsu practitioners.Based on the description the story sounds incredibly strange and right up my alley right? Well yes...and no. The problem is that while there are many funny story elements the film also has many slow spots and some of the characters especially Fujio's wife make little sense and the story seems almost as if they're winging it. Also some of the acting and special effects have an incredibly cheap quality about them. If you are a patient person and don't mind the lulls the story is worth seeing. But I cannot help that perhaps it could have been a lot better.".

Sure they have made a lot of sophisticated and artsy film by the likes of Ozu and Kurosawa...but they also have brought us films like Happiness of the Katauris as well as the ultraweird films of Minoru Kawasaki. Happiness of the Katakuris is a hilarious zombie musical from Takashi Miike...possibly my favorite Japanese comedy. As for Kawasaki his films got far beyond this in strangeness...such as Executive Koala in which the leading character is played by a guy in a koala suit Rug Cop which is about a toupee wearing cop whose wig actually has a mind of its own as well as Calamari Wrestler...about a pro wrestler who is a giant squid!!! So it's not at all surprising that I would get a copy of Tokyo Zombie...a comedy zombie film from Sakichi Sat. Apparently it's based on a manga series...though I know nothing more about this.The film begins with two complete idiots Micchan and Fujio practicing very badly their martial arts instead of working. The boss catches them and is very angry...and attacks Micchan. To stop him Fujio smashes the boss in the head with a fire extinguisher and the pair then take the jerky boss to 'Black Mount Fuji....a giant mountain of garbage outside Tokyo. It seems that LOTS of murdered folks have been buried there...and soon after they plant the boss the dead all start coming to life and do what comes natural to zombies...try to feast on the living. During this period Micchan is bitten and jumps supposedly to his deathleaving Fujio with a really nasty lady he inexplicably takes care of through the rest of the film.The story then jumps ahead five years. It seems that within Tokyo the rich scum have set up a compound and they keep out the zombies...or at least most of them. They do bring in some to have them fight in an arena against various poor people who the rich have enslaved. One of them is Fujio and the awful rich women who come to the games hate him as he's too good and his fights only last a few seconds. So the man running the games brings everyone a surprise...zombie Micchan!! What's next? See the film and learn who prevails in this battle of the titans...or at least two crappy jujitsu practitioners.Based on the description the story sounds incredibly strange and right up my alley right? Well yes...and no. The problem is that while there are many funny story elements the film also has many slow spots and some of the characters especially Fujio's wife make little sense and the story seems almost as if they're winging it. Also some of the acting and special effects have an incredibly cheap quality about them. If you are a patient person and don't mind the lulls the story is worth seeing.

	schema:reviewBody "In the last twenty years the zomcom has had a burgeoning rise throughout the world. A major proponent in this rise as of late is SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Films take the zombie genre and twist it into all sorts of bizarre directions. Sakichi Sat's TOKYO ZOMBIE is no different. It's essentially a buddy comedy immersed in the apocalyptic environs of Tokyo where a zombie plague..caused by the polluted industrial waste buried in a rubbish heap containing the buried dead murdered by others using this area to escape crime convictionrises from a mountain of trash nicknamed Black Fuji. Two working class Japanese men older bald MitsuoSho Aikawaand his Jujitsu student FujioTadanobu Asano must bury their disgruntled boss after accidentally killing him after a clunk over the noggin with a fire extinguisher. They bury him in Black Fuji encounter the dead and must find a way out of Tokyo with designs of tripping to Russia so Fujio can become a man..because Russia is a tough country. Mitsuo reveals to his protg that he's dying of stomach cancer and soon after Fujio forgets to grab a toothbrush and cigarettes when taking food from an abandoned grocery store they discover a young women YokoErika Okuda who expresses firmly her resistance towards joining up with them. Yet Mitsuo insists and loads her in their van against her will getting bit in the process..the bite is an amusing gag revealed at the end of the film. Soon the van is stolen by another bald guy Mitsuo leaps off a bridge presumably to his death with Fujio and Yoko left to squabble endlessly slapping each other around before diving off a bridge to escape zombies coming towards them. Soon Tokyo falls to ruin a massive wall is constructed around a giant pyramid with the poor and zombies used as slaves for the rich..which seem to be mostly loud demanding women  Fujio takes the fighting lessons taught to him by his mentor into a ring where he battles zombies for an audience who voices their criticism when his matches end early.The character of Fujio is run through the ringer. His only means of resolve comes from his dedication to Mitsuo who his fights are won for in the respect of Jujitsu. He is burdened by the shackles of a marriage to the insufferable Yoko his daughter is mute..and adorable his boss..the ring announcerwants to have sexual relations..always coming from behind Fujio attempting to engage in carnal activity socked by kicks for his trouble his best friend is seemingly gone forever and he must endure the hardships of poverty dealing with constant combat against foes whose bite can kill and deal with the constant angered boos of a despicable audience. The poor guy barely hangs in there. Before all this misery the film seemed to work as a confined story about two men against the backdrop of a fallen city which I think works rather well since both actors have good chemistry with each other. Jujitsu is a major part of their relationship as Mitsuo uses this skill as a means to prepare him for a harsh world. When Yoko is introduced Mitsuo leaves the film for a while and we enter the last leg of Fujio's story the film became a bit of a trial for me. There's a dark perverted sense of humor..pedophilia gags galore and a group of children attempt to hold up an office worker with a knifeand the expected zombie gore is present..the violence is so overthetop it becomes a parody of the zombie films that came before. Lots of unusual images through the use of CGI and plenty of histrionics by the cast who have animated faces and reactions towards each other..particularly when characters assault each other. The Black Fuji sequence at the onset is simply bizarre.".

This movie absolutely requires knowledge of Chinese history especially of the main character Tong Bak Fu. It also requires knowledge of Hong Kong popular culture from the 50's to the 90's. Indeed this movie references everything that is Chinese from Tong Bak Fu's scholar friends to the Cantonese dub of Dragonball Z and everything in between. Of course without such complete knowledge what is supposed to be funny is not even mildly amusing as the comedic element in scenes are often subtle or obscure or both.Tong Bak Fu is a malcontent scholar of great renown who has eight wives. Somehow his wives have come to take complete control his life and he finds himself constantly at their mercy who do nothing but gamble with each other. His friends too have become nothing more than an annoyance. Desiring romance he ventures out to seek true loveand finds himself fallen in love with a servant of a wealthy household. Back in those days servants though often socially lower than family were considered a part of the household and subject to the jurisdiction of the family especiallyin this casethe matriarch. Tong Bak Fu must disguise himself as a peasant and sell his services to the family in order to woo the girl and eventually marry her. With the help of a manservant he gets in and finally learns the name of the girlChou Herng. That of course is where everything goes wrong.Stop now if you cannot identify the three places that are blatantly set up for comedy in the above narrative. Now I don't mean that my rather apathetic introduction is funny in and of itself but rather that at least three of the things I've described have the potential to develop into a very funny scene. If you can find all three places exhibiting the potential for comedy this movie will be absolutely hilarious. If you can find two this movie might be pretty funny but nothing special. If you can find one don't expect too much. If you cannot find any then move alongthis movie isn't for you.".

He has 8 beautiful wives he has talent but unknown to others he does not have happiness because his wives do not understand him.One day he meets Qiuxiang played by Gong Li a maid to Madam Wah who unknown to him is actually his father's exgirlfriend wellplayed by Cheng Pei Pei and is so smitten by her. He disguises himself as Wah An an orphan from a rural village and comes out with a story that his family was killed by Tang Bohu so that he can enter the house.Qiuxiang is in love with Tang Bohu's poetry and hopes to meet the man himself not knowing that the man himself is in the same house as her.Gong Li looks beautiful as ever in her role as Qiuxiang. Stephen Chow makes me laugh with his witty remarks during the poetry competitions as the Wah household faces off with King Ning. Add the comedic talent of Yuen KingTan who plays the very horny Shek Lau Pakcheung Chan who plays the rather unreliable friend Chuck ChiShan and you are pretty much guaranteed comedy at its best! Will Bohu get Qiuxiang? Will the Wah household defeat King Ning's man Evil Scholar? Will Bohu restore honor to his father's weapon the steel spear? Watch and find out?".

Not that they were bad but they were not as good as the classics such as God of Cookery King of Comedy Shaolin Soccer and of course this film. I found the early films with Stephen talking in a cartoonish comedic voice annoying.The ones where he has more creative control tend to have him speaking in a more natural and more deadpan voice and those films tend to carry deeper messages than just a mindless comedy. Seriously some scenes are moving.Now back to this movie there's really not much to criticize here. The acting the dialogue the typical Stephen Chow style of humor all fantastic. There aren't many ROFL moments but there are endless classic funny moments that the film will make you grin from ear to ear pretty much from start to finish. And I know that I personally still quote some lines from the movie in my everyday life... The one knock I do have is Gong Li whose talents seem wasted in the film. No doubt she looks great in the film but she's not given much to do and seems rather wooden as if she did not enjoy herself in the movie. Knowing Gong's talent it felt strange to see her character just be a vase love interest and nothing more. I guess you don't want to have anyone upstage Stephen but in that case why not cast a starlet with a less impressive resume than Gong? However overall this is a great film and I highly recommend it.".

I really enjoyed this movie because it was very entertaining and there were so many new ways of making me laugh which was great.The movie is about a noble scholar who is not pleased with his gambling wives because they play majhong all day. Stephen Chow's character in this movie can paint sing and write poems. Then later he and his scholar friends sees this girl whose beauty outshines all other girls near her and then the Scholars try to disguise themselves just to get near her in weird but funny ways. The girl comes from a rival family which hates his family. So he tries to find a way inside to approach her without being noticed.

The contradictions in his character are revealed early in the vicious campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas and the oddly masochistic Checkers speech. His defeat at the hands of the hated and envied John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election followed by the loss of the 1962 California gubernatorial race seem to signal the end of his career. Yet although wholly lacking in charisma Nixon remains a brilliant political operator seizing the opportunity provided by the backlash against the antiwar movement to take the presidency in 1968. It is only when safely in office running far ahead in the polls for the 1972 presidential election that his growing paranoia comes to full flower triggering the Watergate scandal.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watergate hardly gets a mention in this film.  We see the 'plumbers' donning rubber gloves and the president fumbling with a few of his tapes but detail is almost totally eschewed.  There is no Egil Krogh no Jeb Magruder.  Kleindienst and Gray are mentioned only in passing.  Cox is fired by way of a spoken TV bulletin Jaworski is not referred to at all.  We do not see anything of the titanic courtroom struggles with all three branches of the federal government locking horns.  Though we are told that the American Constitution is selfrighting like a boat immune from capsize we are not shown how or why.     And in this Oliver Stone is perfectly right.  As it stands the film is very long and dense with detail.  There is no room for the minutiae of the coverup which in any event would make for a confusing narrative. Stone's subject is Nixon the man not the edifice that toppled around him.     And what a man.  Richard Milhous Nixon is a truly fascinating personality  both statesman and charlatan ruthless and vulnerable unable to express his emotions yet the most emotional of politicians a man who spent his life in the law and in high office but who never absorbed the legal and ethical mores of public life.  Genius and crook bold visionary and spiteful backstabber Nixon will continue to spellbind biographers for decades to come.     That's when it starts says Stone's Nixon when you're a kid.  The film takes us to Whittier California in 1925 to see the unloved boy who struggled painfully to earn his parents' approval without ever quite succeeding.  As a teenager he levered his way into the school football squad by sheer willpower.  Lacking talent he doggedly subjected himself to repeated physical battering in the scrimmages a tackle dummy with guts. This syndrome recurs throughout his career.  Always susceptible to scathing criticism never quite commanding respect Nixon never the less kept ploughing back into the melee when wiser lesser men would have quit.  It is hardly surprising that the years of punishment should have left psychological scars.     Nixon's hatred of John Kennedy had more than one source.  He was devastated by the defeat in the 1960 presidential election but not simply because of disappointment at losing or even because the Kennedy victory carried the odour of fraud bitterest of all for Nixon was the realisation that the Kennedy people had played hardball more effectively than the Republicans.  Nixon had been outsharked and it hurt.  On a more profound level still John Kennedy was everything that Nixon could never be.  He was a smooth handsome prince among men exuding poise and confidence a patrician imbued with the habit of authority.  To Nixon the perpetual outsider the quaker geek who looked shoddy and disreputable Kennedy seemed to have the dice unfairly loaded in his favour.  JFK was an East Coast bright boy and war hero fabulously wealthy and impeccably wellconnected. Nixon owned nothing and knew nobody and was all too obviously 'on the make'.  The great witchhunts of Hiss in the 1940's and Ellsberg in the 1970's are manifestations of the chip on Nixon's shoulder the fathomless bile that he directed at East Coast college boys.     Nixon always imagined that he was hiding his pain from the world whereas in fact it was on global display.  His nervous little laugh at moments of emotional crisis was so false so gutwrenchingly inappropriate that the onlooker could catch a glimpse of the man's tortured soul.  Hopkins captures the wretched laugh with devastating effectiveness both in the scene where Nixon is confronted by a hostile man in the TV studio audience and when he solemnly promises that none of the president's men will go to jail.  In the Checkers broadcast and the presidential TV address on Watergate Nixon tries to assure the camera that he is not a crook and on both occasions he has the exact opposite effect confirming to the viewer that that is precisely what he is.  Nixon seems incapable of examining his own conscience there is a hard core which his rational mind cannot penetrate.  Maybe that is why Stone has him referring to himself in the third person throughout the film.     'They' were always out to get Nixon without it ever being made clear just exactly who 'they' might be.  The imperative for this deeply paranoid man was always to be braced ready for the coming tackle or to organise preemptive strikes against 'them'.  Obstructing justice and tampering with evidence were to Nixon selfdefensive steps that did not need to be justified.  It was obvious that such things had to be done.  The mystery at the heart of Watergate  why a president so steeped in criminal conspiracy should taperecord his own intimate conversations  makes sense when viewed from Nixon's end of the telescope.  He had to have the goods on his own men ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone's film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward armsextended double Vsign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion.".

	schema:headline " Oliver Stone's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not normally a fan of Oliver Stone in fact I've NEVER liked an Oliver Stone picture beforebut this one just blew me away. The reason I usually don't like him is that though he is a great technical director and visual stylist his scripts are heavyhanded and onesided to the point of absurdity. But not here. In fact the script is perhaps the most impressive element in this whole movie not only for how ambiguous and evenhanded it is in dealing with Nixon as a character but also for the brilliant way it moves around in time. It starts with Nixon feeling embattled in the White House in 1973 as the Watergate hearings are upon him and uses the device of him listening to his secret tapes to jump back and forth to previous eras flawlessly moving between past and present to give an impressionistic kaleidoscopic overview of the man's life instead of following the staid and hohum linear approach most movie biographies take most recent example Man on the Moon the bio on Andy Kaufman which was a snoozer in spite of a great performance by Jim Carrey mainly because of the dry boring This happened. . .And then this happened approach.Another reason to see this film is the brilliant absolutely overwhelming lead performance by Anthony Hopkins his Nixon may not look or sound exactly like the 37th president but come on except maybe for Ed Sullivan who does? but he embodies his qualities  strengths as well as weaknesses  to such an enormous degree that he simply BECOMES Nixon at least for the three hours the movie is on screen.I have to say though I was not nearly as impressed as every one else critics and general audiences alike seems to be about Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. It's nothing against her performance she did fine it's just that as written the part is rather weak. In fact I was much more bothered about the liberties the filmmakers took in fleshing out her character than in all the political events it's like whenever they wanted to have someone blast Nixon or act as his conscience they'd trot out Ol' Pat giving her some of the most embarrasingly speechified moments in all of the movies  almost none of their scenes together ringed true as husband as wife it was more like Nixon sitting across from the Filmmakers' Conscience. In fact she's angry at him so often in the film you have to wonder what exactly does she love about the man? The film never answers or attempts to answer this question.But this one minor quibble is not enough to make me downgrade this film. It is an absolutely stunning achievement by any stretch of the imagination and it contains some interesting thematic and technical echoes of both Citizen Kane cavernous high ceiling scenes a March of Timetype newsreel on Nixon a dinner scene between Dick and Pat at a long impersonal table as well as The Godfather the burnished halfdark halflight cinematography several chamber of power scenes in tight dark and claustrophobic roomsthat I found in context to be totally appropriate. It paints both Nixon and the times he and the country lived through on a grand and mythic scale that was truly awesome and once again entirely appropriate. Yes it's a film that is at times big loud and bombastic because so after all was Nixon himself but just as often quiet contemplative and told at an achingly human level. The contrast between these two states is what gives the film a good deal of its overall power and as I've said I never would have believed that Stone would have been capable of doing the smaller quieter scenes so well.This is a good film to have on tape or DVD for two reasons. It's so long and so dense with facts characters and events that you're not likely to want to watch it all the way straight through the first time I saw it was in the theater and though I was held spellbound I began wishing for an intermission at about the twohour mark not so much to stretch my legs but to give my brain a chance to process all I'd seen and heard so far. Also and more importantly the videotape includes after the credits two scenes cut out of the final film for time purposes. In both cases I believe a severe mistake was made  these are both I believe ESSENTIAL sequences not just nice to have as an additional bargain but scenes which Stone should have fought tooth and nail to keep in even cutting out some others if he had to  my vote would have been to excise a few of those Pat Nixon scenes instead. Once scene involves Nixon's visit to the CIA and another a discussion between Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover in the Oval Office. The first scene is a masterpiece of writing and acting with Sam Waterston as CIA Director Richard Helms otherwise in no other scene of the movie and the other is I think key in understanding Nixon's motivation to begin taping his White House conversations in the first place also  an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie. I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all but they really belong as part of the entire story.".

	schema:headline " A Surreal Reality";
	schema:reviewBody "I will start by saying I am an Oliver Stone fan. For some particular reason though I did not expect to like this movie but obviously I did. He actually unexpectedly gave a very fair depiction of Nixon. Nixon really transformed before my eyes in here. That was really something special to see.The acting was quite good. Anthony Hopkins though totally uplifted this movie. I could imagine many people saying his performance was overthetop or a bit too surreal at times. Yet that is what really made his performance so amazing. The way he was able to transform the many crazy and totally off the wall aspects of Nixon and make them into a reality. To me as the movie went on I felt I was in some way able to see his paranoia anxiety thirst for power and just the simple fact of wanting to be liked. I could see he was more of a troubled and vulnerable man than a monster. He never quite connected with anybody which made him bitter and fueled his paranoia and greed even more. To me Hopkins portrayed this all perfectly all the complexities and inner feelings of Nixon. Hopkins slipped into this role in way that you rarely see. He became Nixon and at times I was speechless or should I say thoughtless watching him portray such an important figure in such a way. More and more I felt sorry for Nixon as he looked more and more like a schizophrenic. To me this role was more psychologically bonechilling than his role as Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs and I have no problem debating that. The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Joan Allen was very good in showing the complex relationshipmarriage she had with Richard Nixon. James Woods freaked me out at times displaying that pure evil and hatred at times that Hopkins showed as Nixon. Paul Sorvino was very good as Henry Kissinger. Mary Steenburgen was interesting to watch in the very limited time she played in here. The two actors though other than Hopkins though that really stood out to me were Bob Hoskins and Sam Waterston. Despite Hoskins not giving an amazing performance and having very limited time he gave me chills just seeing J. Edgar Hoover being portrayed in some sort of way. Sam Waterston despite being limited to really just one scene was even more chilling than the rest of the castexcluding Hopkins combined in that one moment. That moment was one of the most intense face to face scenes that I have ever seen. It was so memorable.The directing was very good. It was not the best I have seen from Oliver Stone but it was up there. For the first 45 minutes or so I was a bit confused about what was happening and the flow of the movie but I got used to it. The first portion of the movie did feel unbalanced at times but the feel of the movie got better as it wore on. Going back to that one scene between Sam Waterston and Anthony Hopkins I felt this scene was one of the best directed and written scenes I have seen from Oliver Stone or anyone ever. That scene was a microcosm of the movie. The motionsickness mind scrambling paranoid feeling of that scene captured the entire movie. The feeling of even seeing the president himself being treated like a puppet despite not that shocking was mind numbing to watch. That scene was true testament to the writing and directing abilities of Oliver Stone.The writing was also very good throughout. It seemed as if everything Stone wanted to get across got across. The writing was not amazing but it certainly served it duty. The cinematography was great though. Stone always knows how to get his point across in the way he photographs a movie even if all of other aspects of the movie fail. That dark Oliver Stonish feeling kept on creeping in on every scene but also that dark psychological feeling that he had put in Born On the Fourth of July and Platoon also was felt through the cinematography. The music by John Williams who always knows how to capture a moment musically was simply perfect in here again.I can understand this movie being boring to a lot of people or it being considered propaganda. Yet I think this movie is an overlooked masterpiece. Just seeing Anthony Hopkins perform as Nixon is a good enough reason to see this movie. He took control of this movie by force and took it to another level. Despite this being an Oliver Stone movie it is more fair than you would think. Of course this movie may have a few conspiracy theories included in it but Oliver Stone never forces his theories on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well?".

Sam Waterston despite being limited to really just one scene was even more chilling than the rest of the castexcluding Hopkins combined in that one moment. That moment was one of the most intense face to face scenes that I have ever seen. It was so memorable.The directing was very good. It was not the best I have seen from Oliver Stone but it was up there. For the first 45 minutes or so I was a bit confused about what was happening and the flow of the movie but I got used to it. The first portion of the movie did feel unbalanced at times but the feel of the movie got better as it wore on. Going back to that one scene between Sam Waterston and Anthony Hopkins I felt this scene was one of the best directed and written scenes I have seen from Oliver Stone or anyone ever. That scene was a microcosm of the movie. The motionsickness mind scrambling paranoid feeling of that scene captured the entire movie. The feeling of even seeing the president himself being treated like a puppet despite not that shocking was mind numbing to watch. That scene was true testament to the writing and directing abilities of Oliver Stone.The writing was also very good throughout. It seemed as if everything Stone wanted to get across got across. The writing was not amazing but it certainly served it duty. The cinematography was great though. Stone always knows how to get his point across in the way he photographs a movie even if all of other aspects of the movie fail. That dark Oliver Stonish feeling kept on creeping in on every scene but also that dark psychological feeling that he had put in Born On the Fourth of July and Platoon also was felt through the cinematography. The music by John Williams who always knows how to capture a moment musically was simply perfect in here again.I can understand this movie being boring to a lot of people or it being considered propaganda. Yet I think this movie is an overlooked masterpiece. Just seeing Anthony Hopkins perform as Nixon is a good enough reason to see this movie. He took control of this movie by force and took it to another level. Despite this being an Oliver Stone movie it is more fair than you would think. Of course this movie may have a few conspiracy theories included in it but Oliver Stone never forces his theories on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well?";

	schema:reviewBody "Hopkins is remarkable as Nixon.  Wisely not even trying for an exact likeness his interpretation of that sofamiliar physicality is uncannily evocative.  From the very start the characterisation is spoton  the jut of the lower jaw the growly voice the rounded shoulders.  Once the viewer has adjusted to the initial shock Hopkins IS Nixon.  It ceases to be an issue.Theodore Roosevelt Washington Kennedy and most of all Lincoln look down from the White House walls at Nixon their solemn portraits hovering like admonishing ghosts over the Watergate squalor.  In life Roosevelt was bold and selfassured whereas Nixon dithers Washington's selfeffacing propriety confronts a Nixon who is suggesting that the Nazis were right. Kennedy is everything that Nixon could never be  above all else at ease with himself.  Lincoln looks down from the office wall and from his marble seat in the Memorial in silent rebuke as his successor debases the presidency.Some of the camera tricks don't work.  We see Nixon rooted to the spot at Love Field as the camera soars up and away from him.  Why?  Obtrusive camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot.  This shot seems to have been included merely for its cleverness.  The same is true of the little flashes of blackandwhite which keep interrupting the action.  At one point in a dialogue between Nixon and Haldeman the focus is unsubtly and repeatedly thrown from one man to the other.  What does this achieve?  Is some artistic goal being pursued or are the effects included for their own sake?  What is the symbolic importance if any of the vanishing racehorses?Much of the attention to detail is of a very high order.  Stone's writing team has done its homework and we get authentic touches such as Nixon's love of log fires which meant having to run the White House air conditioning system at full blast during summer.  The reconstructions of the White House interiors are superb.  We see Nixon and Pat engaging in a domestic scrap beneath murals of more edifying battles like Yorktown and Saratoga.  Historical events recorded on news film at the time are brilliantly reconstituted replacing the real Nixon with the Hopkins version.  Thus we get convincing reconstructions of the Kennedy TV debate and the 1962 'retirement' speech.  Young Nixon's courtship of Pat is narrated without dialogue as a grainy jumpy home movie  and is beautifully done.  I did not feel quite so positive about the Alger Hiss segment. Welles did this 'newsreel flashback' idea in Citizen Kane more than half a century earlier and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badlyplaced coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman and does his usual admirable photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is this isn't THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer more stately more formidable Fred Emery's Watergate bears this out.  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide rather than the Chief of the White House Staff an emperor within his own not inconsiderable domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was so far as one can judge an altogether less articulate less philosophical less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL Checkers broadcast  she is a stiff repressed passive woman a true 1950's Republican wife not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept for example that Nixon's decision to retire in 1962 was his wife's diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don't work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a facetoface meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The reallife Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha's indiscretions because I love her.  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film for no good reason.  Similarly Tricia Nixon's exchange with her father was in real life an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon's credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically Did you cover up?  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon's tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House 'leaker' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate breakins.One scene which works splendidly is the true incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to gladhand the indignant youngsters using the hearty patronising approach of a bygone generation.  The sad revulsion of the protesters shows the gulf between Nixon's consciousness and the spirit of the age.I hope I haven't let you down is uttered one single time by Nixon towards the end of the film.  The truth is he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathynodes.  As such it was utterly gauche utterly craven utterly guileful yet utterly unrealistic. In fact utterly Nixon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Nixon's Oscarnominee Anthony Hopkins life is told from his early childhood days in 1920s California to his disgraceful resignation in 1974 from the Watergate scandal one of the stupidest and most trivial events of U.S. history. The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon a superb turn by Oscarnominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with bigtime oil men in Texas Larry Hagman leading the group and even with J. Edgar Hoover scenestealer Bob Hoskins. It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from highranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon but Nixon full of selfdoubt and inferiority complexes is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency. More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam a whole host of questionable allies led by James Woods E.G. Marshall J.T. Walsh David Paymer David Hyde Pierce Powers Boothe Fyvush Finkel and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino who rivals Hopkins' performance the whole way end up turning Nixon's life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and publicnationalinternationalmilitarysocial chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president's personal life is shown through flashbacks Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film. We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate breakin led by Ed Harris continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear. 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone who received an Oscar nod for cowriting the script surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching Platoon Born on the Fourth of July and JFK would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with Nixon. However he gives Nixon's story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations some that seem very logical and some not so much. Thus the film goes on and on running about 195 minutes. Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interestgenerator. Whether you like dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person Nixon the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone's better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more underrated and underappreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one has always been one of my alltime favorites. As a political science major I was fascinated the first time I saw it and have seen it several times since. You almost have to to assimilate everything. But as a political science junkie and a history nerd I always found this film to be very entertaining and fun to watch especially if you're a historian who's also read other books on the Nixon administration All the President's Men etc.This film gives a very raw look into the world of the Presidency and politics. I think Hopkins did a wonderful job as Nixon as well as the rest of the cast namely Bob Hoskins as J. Edgar Hoover and Ed Harris as E. Howard Hunt. From a historian's perspective I think it did a fair job of looking at what Nixon's career was like the disappointments he experienced the struggles he made the mistakes he committed and the situation he found himself in once he finally became President. The film's a bit long especially the redone version  3.5 hours but I think it's worth it.And I'm fully aware of Oliver Stone's background. I've always had a mixed reaction with Mr. Stone. Two of my favorite films ever are Nixon and Alexander and I'm even a Greek Republican yet the only film I've ever walked out on was JFK. JFK was just too much the only assassination theory Stone didn't throw in it was the UFO theory. But as far as Nixon goes I commend Stone for giving a fair portrayal of him knowing what a notorious liberal he is. And once again this is coming from a moderate Republican.Extremists will hate this film. Ultraconservatives will look as this film with skepticism and claim it's BS while radical liberals will claim it's too sympathetic toward Nixon. But for anyone with open eyes who isn't narrowminded one way or the other or for anyone interested in what the world of politics is like I highly recommend this film. Like I said it's always been one of my alltime favorites.".

From a historian's perspective I think it did a fair job of looking at what Nixon's career was like the disappointments he experienced the struggles he made the mistakes he committed and the situation he found himself in once he finally became President. The film's a bit long especially the redone version  3.5 hours but I think it's worth it.And I'm fully aware of Oliver Stone's background. I've always had a mixed reaction with Mr. Stone. Two of my favorite films ever are Nixon and Alexander and I'm even a Greek Republican yet the only film I've ever walked out on was JFK. JFK was just too much the only assassination theory Stone didn't throw in it was the UFO theory. But as far as Nixon goes I commend Stone for giving a fair portrayal of him knowing what a notorious liberal he is. And once again this is coming from a moderate Republican.Extremists will hate this film. Ultraconservatives will look as this film with skepticism and claim it's BS while radical liberals will claim it's too sympathetic toward Nixon. But for anyone with open eyes who isn't narrowminded one way or the other or for anyone interested in what the world of politics is like I highly recommend this film. Like I said it's always been one of my alltime favorites.";

	schema:reviewBody "Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by JFK one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his Nixon is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting Anthony Hopkins Joan Allen James Woods Bob Hoskins Ed Harris E.G. Marshall Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995 which is saying a lot.Nixon borrows a lot of elements from JFK on the editing department swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and largerthanlife character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to Citizen Kane establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.The comparison is even truer because like Kane Nixon hides a terrible secret although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man there's a secret but in Nixon's case there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election but not the hearts people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him.The chronicles of a man who could never be loved that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House in his whole political career actually. Indeed Nixon won two elections opened China signed a nuclear treaty with Russia ended the longest war America ever knew but as great achievements as they were Nixon's dark side eclipsed them Vietnam Cambodia Allende the Watergate. In his most lucid moments Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis Jack Kennedy was assassinated then Bobby his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with JFK stops it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast haunted by the ghosts from the past a man who always had to forge his carapace by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background in the poorest farm of California always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the postWar republican wave he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world like a personal revenge Only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain. This taste for revenge is his inner demon.I'm not comparing two characters but Nixon kind of reminded me of Downfall in the way the White House is showed as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy here the media to come to the leader. And one by one like a sinking ship every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal and Nixon as the Captain is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog while accepting that it must be destroyed. In a lesser measure of course I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone a notorious left wing created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed with his victory sign trademark his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile from his I'm not a crook to his dog Checkers from his resignation to The Simpsons he even inspired through his middlename the name of Milhouse to holdup masks he's in his way an icon of popular culture or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism his fascination for Lincoln the President who ended the Civil War or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him but when they look at them they find Nixon less than a low selfesteem it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's and maybe that's why he was loathed because people don't want to look at themselves.".

	schema:headline " Oliver Stone's film about Nixon looks  sorrowfully  like Oliver Stone's Nixon !";
	schema:reviewBody "I used to imagine it this way  after John F. Kennedy his opposite came down to supplant. From handsome quiet and peaceful everybody's lovely older brother to ugly nervous and fond of war everybody's grumpy boss. The opposition can't get more extreme and dark. It's the womanizer who became praised idol vs. the faithful married who became pelted icon. Balanced rich vs. complicated poor. Honest vs. lair. Perfect god vs. imperfect human if you will. The problem isn't in the irony it's in the events that the irony produced especially after the first was killed and the latter took over.Now Stone's Nixon is somehow close to my conception. Stone handled him through one question what could possibly lead to the Watergate scandal? In search for an answer he went into Nixon's whole life a huge bet Stone fell for and fell over due to I suppose. He could have exposed Nixon by Watergate not analyzing him all the way to it. The general title along with the film's main question produced a long and acrid reading for Nixon that caused Stone endless accusations of no objectivity. However Stone managed to portray an interesting complex he saw in the 37th president.Stone's Nixon did good things yet lost others his respect needless war seemed going forever and his honor Watergate. The way his psychological deepness is explored represents the best of the film. The dreary kid who's too sad to smile found himself carrying his 2 late brothers' dreams then the postKennedy's dreams while he originally didn't choose. And when he did it was nothing but confusion impetuosity and lying. He always played a role till the circumstances gifted him with one bigger than his capacities look how in intelligently metaphorical shot the 3 advancing horses overturned accidentally in a moment made the road wide open for a late horse that doesn't necessarily have to be the fitter. After John Kennedy's assassination president Johnson's withdrawal and Robert Kennedy's assassination Nixon had the wild opportunity that he never dreamed of. Like he was the best of the available but not the best.Nixon appears as that suppressed irritable sweat machine who suffers a lastingly lost comparison with Kennedy. He wanted to be as Kennedy but by his own antiKennedy ways. While being conservative and violent he never won the beloved rank of the previous president that even his haters such as the white house's servant bewailed him the day he died. Yet he tried hardly to attain that missing love. Hence Watergate was a fit climax for his too cautious too scared nature. The film's smartest point is its convincing conclusion Nixon couldn't be Kennedy couldn't beat Kennedy's super halo ending up as only a human defeated by his ordinariness When they look at you they see what they want to be. When they look at me they see what they are..The problems  Regardless of the actual running times of Stone's other films these 192 minutes were his longest to date. The conversations led everything. They were so lengthy with no redeeming image. Relying on Kennedy's complex went on and on there is nearly no scene where Nixon doesn't mention Kennedy in a vexatious comparison. I couldn't understand the wife's sudden change from leaving the house objecting to the decision of reelecting in a second to dancing joyfully celebrating the decision in the next?Yet nothing is stranger than Nixon's speech at the finale. It was  to my surprise  pictured by camera editing and music as an over soppy farewell filled with desperately idealistic Nixon and a sort of sad elegizing for him. Is it a side of Stone's objectivity? or is it some honoring reaction towards Nixon's death around the time the film was completed? Whatever the reason is I didn't buy it. Compared to the film's context it comes off as uncanny late and deficient rehabilitation or sudden hypocrisy ! Even Nixon's voice has been altered there to Hopkins's rational confident and smooth tone !Stone the director I love wasn't there for all the time. He was busy just shooting those huge pages of dialogs. Using black and white image sometimes was a failed trick to shatter the bore of the long talkative scenes. The thing is the original Stoneish touches don't show up and when they do they don't work. Enough to say and to pain I don't remember a scene rather a moment where I felt Oliver Stone the distinct director.John Williams's score was as tragic as the events and sorry for it though without special appeal. Director of photography Robert Richardson was in total suffocation. He had no chance to prove any singularity except looking polished and as strained and scary as Nixon sometimes see how the shadows of the hearth's fires are used in certain scenes. The acute editing embodied rightly a demented Nixon's world while stopping helpless in front of an entry that lost the film a more graceful figure. I thought it would have been better if Stone directed a political thriller about Watergate's interrogations the film sounds having that ambition at its core. But instead he ramified in inflated manner digressing to Edgar Hoover and else making heavy monotonous and weary film. Hmm maybe being heavy monotonous and weary is what Nixon means for Stone. Though making a film about a character is one thing and resembling him is another dangerous thing as much as Stone's Nixon is involved.".

	schema:headline " My Avaricious Constituency Go Ahead!! Support George McGovern!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Stone enables the movie audience to attain a full dynamic on the Nixon Presidency with this movie!! In a time of transition with American values Richard Nixon had to succumb to a Keynesian resolution to the United States' economic woes!! Relentlessy burdening inflation reduced the nation to a quasi socialist measure of wage and price control!! Oil dependency on the Arabs was formidably alarming!! To top it all off the ubiquitous monster of continued involvement in the Vietnam War was constantly rearing it's ugly head!! Such an atrocity brought on a bevy of antiwar protesters in front of the White House lawn on an ephemeral basis!! Now descends the left wing liberal ideological philosophy of desegregation through busing!! Political plea bargaining coerced Richard Nixon to renege on his pledges to corporate giants who put him in the White House in 1968!! Nixon's insolence and self righteousness incensed everybody!! His mainstream appeal was due to extremes on both sides of the political spectrum two such examples are George Wallace Right and George McGovern Left. The cacophony of foul language and racial hatred by the Nixon White House was deplorable!! Why? Nixon was the commander in chief of the United States!! An insidious aspect to this hatred was very nauseating because it signified how many Americans who were likened to the mindset of Nixon cabinet actually thought!! These dubious conceptions of the Nixon cabinet were perplexing the American people as to what actual ideologies were implementing a resolution on the final decisions made pertaining to copious political issues!! The egalitarian pretenses that these politicians so often masqueraded were merely a facade!! This film's full persecutive of Richard Nixon's political life was a laboriously successful rendition of Nixon's volatile temperament this haunting character portrayal was flawlessly executed by world renowned director Oliver Stone!! In so many of his movies Oliver Stone is uncanny in his ability to itemize a comprehensive hatred with the characters in his film.. When making this movie about Richard Nixon the former president of the United States he Oliver Stone depicts the intensity of how abhorrent Nixon's philosophical proclivities actually were!! Oliver Stone accurately pinpoints the composite personality of Nixon as a social anathema who was a victim of his fundamentalist environment!! In giving my assessment of President Nixon allow me to say this I am a Republican I have empathized with Richard Nixon concerning his candor with regard to human imperfection at the same time this does not mean that he should have cultivated a Carte Blanche to repetitively engage in egregious human character discrepancies!! Nixon did not contest the 1960 Presidential race against John F. Kennedy even though many of his advisers encouraged him to do so!! Such a protestation was on account of the contention that some states had allegedly fixed the election by stuffing their ballot boxes!! Nixon felt it was in the best interest of his political career not to pursue this matter!! In so doing this he resented JFK and the rest of the prominent Kennedys all of his life... I would not be too fond of someone who massacred me in a string of nationally televised debates either!! Nixon's words for John F Kennedy were The American people looked at JFK and saw what they wanted to be they look at me and see what they are!! Nixon's biggest problem was that he made an enemy out of everyone!! This was a president who was all too anxious to lay blame to the fact that he was grotesquely misunderstood as being the culprit to his disheveled presidency!! While he ended the Vietnam War this is like saying that after you stabbed someone's hand you stopped the bleeding!! This film points out how Nixon isolated all political coalitions with whom he had to corroborate that was his undoing!! This precarious situation brought on his ultimate political nemesis.. Watergate... The Washington Post's unearthing of the Watergate breakin brought on a revolutionary breach of public trust in the system of American democracy hence all of the media affiliates converged accordingly!! Nixon's post as an appointed public official was viewed by him with a sanctimonious temerity thus he invoked executive clemency as an indelible prerogative to quell investigation into the Watergate affair. What was infuriating to the American people was that the executive branch of the United States government could be complicit in the crime involving a third rate burglary!! Talks of espionage sabotage and wiretapping evoked a very distasteful resolve with the American public!! Henry Kissinger H R Halderman and President Nixon were the triumvirate in the Oval office who mandated the use of the fifth amendment!! Such theatrics were construed by the American people as actions which were tantamount to an admission of culpability by the Nixon Administration!! Nixon's presumed innocence was contingent on his option for executive privilege!! This privilege was revoked by the supreme court on account of the fact that the Nixon administration was up against criminal charges!! The movie Nixon portrayed Watergate with an ultimate clarity yes it was nurtured with a liberal bias at the same time this was the Rolls Royce of Republican blundering therefore it was time for the opposing party to capitalize on the entire matter!! The acting in this movie was sensational!! James Woods was terrific as H R Halderman Joan Allen portrayed Pat Nixon with a very succinct realism... Paul Sorvino's role as Henry Kissinger was simply fantastic!! and of course Anthony Hopkins proves his acting genius once again with the part of Richard Nixon as he is one of the best actors in the history of all movie making... The camera angles and the severity of agitated emotions is spellbinding with this movie!! See this Film it is a definite winner!!".

An insidious aspect to this hatred was very nauseating because it signified how many Americans who were likened to the mindset of Nixon cabinet actually thought!! These dubious conceptions of the Nixon cabinet were perplexing the American people as to what actual ideologies were implementing a resolution on the final decisions made pertaining to copious political issues!! The egalitarian pretenses that these politicians so often masqueraded were merely a facade!! This film's full persecutive of Richard Nixon's political life was a laboriously successful rendition of Nixon's volatile temperament this haunting character portrayal was flawlessly executed by world renowned director Oliver Stone!! In so many of his movies Oliver Stone is uncanny in his ability to itemize a comprehensive hatred with the characters in his film.. When making this movie about Richard Nixon the former president of the United States he Oliver Stone depicts the intensity of how abhorrent Nixon's philosophical proclivities actually were!! Oliver Stone accurately pinpoints the composite personality of Nixon as a social anathema who was a victim of his fundamentalist environment!! In giving my assessment of President Nixon allow me to say this I am a Republican I have empathized with Richard Nixon concerning his candor with regard to human imperfection at the same time this does not mean that he should have cultivated a Carte Blanche to repetitively engage in egregious human character discrepancies!! Nixon did not contest the 1960 Presidential race against John F. Kennedy even though many of his advisers encouraged him to do so!! Such a protestation was on account of the contention that some states had allegedly fixed the election by stuffing their ballot boxes!! Nixon felt it was in the best interest of his political career not to pursue this matter!! In so doing this he resented JFK and the rest of the prominent Kennedys all of his life... I would not be too fond of someone who massacred me in a string of nationally televised debates either!! Nixon's words for John F Kennedy were The American people looked at JFK and saw what they wanted to be they look at me and see what they are!! Nixon's biggest problem was that he made an enemy out of everyone!! This was a president who was all too anxious to lay blame to the fact that he was grotesquely misunderstood as being the culprit to his disheveled presidency!! While he ended the Vietnam War this is like saying that after you stabbed someone's hand you stopped the bleeding!! This film points out how Nixon isolated all political coalitions with whom he had to corroborate that was his undoing!! This precarious situation brought on his ultimate political nemesis.. Watergate... The Washington Post's unearthing of the Watergate breakin brought on a revolutionary breach of public trust in the system of American democracy hence all of the media affiliates converged accordingly!! Nixon's post as an appointed public official was viewed by him with a sanctimonious temerity thus he invoked executive clemency as an indelible prerogative to quell investigation into the Watergate affair. What was infuriating to the American people was that the executive branch of the United States government could be complicit in the crime involving a third rate burglary!! Talks of espionage sabotage and wiretapping evoked a very distasteful resolve with the American public!! Henry Kissinger H R Halderman and President Nixon were the triumvirate in the Oval office who mandated the use of the fifth amendment!! Such theatrics were construed by the American people as actions which were tantamount to an admission of culpability by the Nixon Administration!! Nixon's presumed innocence was contingent on his option for executive privilege!! This privilege was revoked by the supreme court on account of the fact that the Nixon administration was up against criminal charges!! The movie Nixon portrayed Watergate with an ultimate clarity yes it was nurtured with a liberal bias at the same time this was the Rolls Royce of Republican blundering therefore it was time for the opposing party to capitalize on the entire matter!! The acting in this movie was sensational!! James Woods was terrific as H R Halderman Joan Allen portrayed Pat Nixon with a very succinct realism... Paul Sorvino's role as Henry Kissinger was simply fantastic!! and of course Anthony Hopkins proves his acting genius once again with the part of Richard Nixon as he is one of the best actors in the history of all movie making... The camera angles and the severity of agitated emotions is spellbinding with this movie!! See this Film it is a definite winner!!";

The film is three hours in duration and yet manages to only pack about five minutes of fact into its content. There is absolutely no historical perspective or context given to any of Nixon's decisions the worst example of which was the film's depiction of the bombing campaign against the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese army in Cambodia. Showing a callous Nixon and stock footage of bombs dropping hardly does that involved and complex issue justice and merely serves to stereotype Nixon further.The scene towards the end of the film where Kissinger and Haig await Nixon's signature on his resignation letter is perhaps even more absurd. To even remotely suggest as this scene does that Nixon considered imposing martial law to retain his grip on power simply ignores all reality. This was the same man who chose not to challenge the 1960 election and more importantly resigned the presidency before there was ever even an impeachment trial in the Senate. Hardly the moves someone supposedly as power mad as Nixon should've made.This does not even address Stone's hopelessly absurd theories regarding the 18 12 minute gap or the director's sad obsession with the Kennedy assassination. Perhaps Stone could do himself and all of us a favor by ceasing to relive and rewrite the tortured 1960s and instead make a film about Cambodia under Pol Pot whose victory Evil Nixon's TM bombing campaign was attempting to prevent. It Stone is truly interested in informing his audience about tragedy and injustice there is not a more worthy subject.".

The flashbacks that are used tend to make the film somewhat surreal as does the continual shifting from black and white to color film but the story itself is riveting and engrossing even if we all know how it is going to wind up at the end.

	schema:headline " This Film is Intriguing and Dramatic";
	schema:reviewBody "Like other reviews I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president.The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the saintlike qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film.I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger played by Paul Sorvino was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman James Woods portrayed as antiSemitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate.Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was topnotch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore. After LBJ decides to not run he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However during his presidency Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in.The rest of the cast is topnotch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones a Texas man reminds me of his role on Dallas who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman Mr. President do you forget who got you where you are? Nixon The American people did. HagmanOh really? That can be changed.I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's you will love this movie! Highly rated!".

The real Nixon was a powerful driven man for much of his career.  He commanded an audience and delt with authority with Mao and the rest.

Couldn't Oliver Stone find something better to do than flash bad camera angles at us.  Dark lighting scratchy film black and white ... all of these are useful in their place and Stone is good with them but they were so overused in the movie as to make them pointless.  I don't need a strobe light flashing in my face or choppy dialogue that doesn't quite fit the lips to realize that the main character is loosing touch with reality.  On my first point was Nixon out of touch with reality from the beginning?  I have a camcorder and I got bored playing with the black and white feature after the first week.  I wish Stone had gotten bored of his.The symbolism was overdone and too obvious.  Blood coming from Nixon's steak on the boat?  The movie was mysterious and ominous because of bad lighting and camera angles not because of subtle dialogue and emotion.This movie could have been great.  Stone does a terrific job of portraying the demented side of Nixon.

There are bound to be as many IMDb users on either side of the Atlantic whom will disagree with mine or other users comments in why JFK is a disappointing film for a number of reasons and stop believing that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy because in fact there wasn't one. Much had already been written and discussed about JFK by film and history experts prior to the making of Nixon when they were fully certain that Nixon by Oliver Stone would be the next to fall into that category and they were right for Nixon opened with poor reviews also for being a mixture of truth and fiction and there was one such scene with Henry Kissinger smoking cigars when the real Kissinger said that he actually never smoked them. Like JFK the film is lengthy at nearly three and quarter hours from start to finish and is slightly more frustrating to watch. Sometimes the film is spoilt by the use of such sexuallyexplicit words like...er....er... you know.... followed by Nixon's wife wanting a divorce. Being set in the sixties and seventies it makes me wonder if such language like this was ever used at that time but in the case of film Nixon this was made in 1995 and unless I am wrong perhaps it was the way Oliver Stone puts it together. In the whole reviews for Nixon over the years have been of mixed fortunes the ratings climbing or sinking. I gave the film a slightly higher rating of 410.".

He basically put Eisenhower in the White House and denied other people from getting there. His portrayal in the film was very biased by Stone. Nixon was a great strategist a loyal and dedicated American. Traits that should have been made. Had Kennedy not been shot and his affairs been publicly known Kennedy would have been impeached too. Nixon got the U.S. out of Vietnam. Nixon's only err was panicking and trying to protect his loyal followers which made the whole affair worse and caused him to resign the Presidency.

There were some good performances by other castmates including David Hyde Pierce Joan Allen and James Woods. However when the leading man who is in almost every scene can't hold your attention the film is due for some bad criticism by anyone.The film was slow and at the same time I felt it skipped too much important information. Mary Steenburgen portrayed Nixon's mother and did a moderate job but it was hard to see her as Anthony Hopkin's mom later on in the film even with the gray hair.I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone unless you're interested in a long nap.".

I grew up during the period that Nixon was vice president and later president and never cared much for him. However primarily because of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the lead role I viewed Nixon on DVD yesterday.I was totally unprepared for how good this movie all three hours of it.  I am in my 50s and have seen lots of movies and I have to rate Nixon as one of the best of all time. In a real sense a modern Citizen Kane but about a real person a real former president who even through his insanity could not do lasting harm to the US form of government. The movie clearly focuses on the Watergate scandal that ultimately caused Richard Nixon's resignation in the early 70s but through relevant flashbacks actually tells the Nixon story from his childhood. Director Oliver Stone does a masterful job and Anthony Hopkins proves once more why he is arguably the finest actor of our days.The DVD is apparently duallayer and there is just the slightest pause when the player switches from one layer to the other.  The picture is expectedly sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is just right most of the time. However some of the quieter conversations required doubling the volume 3 dBto get acceptable listening levels.Allinall a great movie.  Unless you really don't like this kind of movie at all see Nixon the experience will be with you for a while.".

It is an ordinary portrait of Nixon all told as has been rehabilitated into public consciousness a broken man who could achieve anything except the one thing he wanted to to be loved and whole. His plight is ordinary in the sense that it is deeply human this is how we have retrogradely dramatized Nixon in order to be able to understand his actions. His downfall also human the desire to cling to the controls of a life that is far beyond our scope or any fouryear presidential term. The machinery or system keeps grinding out a narrative and we have only a small window to effect any change at all.So we unravel from Watergate where all control was lost from too much desire for it. We piece Nixon's image in a reverse Kane style from inside together with this man looking for himself.If I am lambasting the film it's for how much it grew out of hand as a film. It is very much Stone doing Nixon feverish ramblings from personal darkness powerful but manipulative rhetorics. Shamelessly emotional when it serves a purpose. We're spared nothing in the cinematic onslaught of different footage dutch angles slowmotion light flares incessant cuts and countercuts. No symbolism is too hamfisted blood oozing from a steak as use of nuclear weapons is contemplated superimpositions of Nixon's face on Mao's as the analogy is being forced a gigantic Nixon looking pensive superimposed on the skies the day before Dallas. I believe Stone took on Natural Born Killers solely as a test run for the madness of this. Of course that film was a deliberate mess pitched as hysterical satire. This is hysterically assembled helter skelter.On the part of Stone my view is that control was lost from the desire to be America's objective chronicler. In the early stages I believe the film was intended to be one long reverie and internal monologue triggered by the Watergate tapes. No doubt Stone was familiar with Robert Altman's film on Nixon and understood the project to be fundamentally visual. The idea was that we would visit from this room where an old weary man is listening to his own voice different stops in a long life in and out of the public eye looking from both ends looking for a narrative and who controlled the telling. In lieu with JFK I believe part of the film was meant to be an unreliable paranoid testimony shaped from memory. In lieu with JFK where the film was the trial that never happened this would be the televised public apology that did. A confessional but one we could trust?But it grew out of hand as did the man's ambitions.".

But going into this movie and just letting it do its magic it actually touched me deeply and made me think about it! Sure  there are a few things that might have been done differently probably even quite a bit better. But the allinall feel this movie leaves the viewer with is incredible. The bizarre but at the same time beautiful world of the inbetween the pain of the family members over the horrible loss and their unique ways of not necessarily dealing but rather living with it even the sick mind behind the murder  it all works together in creating that viewing experience that is deeply touching through its countless layers.The acting of pretty much each individual actor is already quite impressive but as the characters interact one can actually feel the emotional bonds and understandings as well as the tension or even hatred between them. All in all I can only urge anyone who loves movies that go beyond that typical mirror of merely entertaining and uninspired filmmaking to watch this gem. Certainly not everyone will enjoy or appreciate it as much as I did but at least give it the chance it deserves without going into it already looking for those 'evil CGI' parts and at the very least you will have your own opinion about it afterward and not the one of some guys that merely told you the same thing they only heard from someone else I hope you have a great viewing experience!".

True it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but then what is? I was taken by surprise a film of unbearable emotional suspense breaking every imaginable rule. We're far too used to have stories in which everything is neatly tied up by the end so we can go back home with a fictitious peace of mind. In The Lovely Bones we know who the monster is from the time the monstrosity is committed but we're only spectators unable to do anything about it and that frustration may have turn part of the audience and most of the critics away. True the CGI of the in between is sometimes too much but the film as a whole is a real experience. Saorise Ronan is marvelous so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Stanley Tucci was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Susan Sarandon another risk taker plays the emotional constipated grandmother with great courage. Look at the exhaustion on her face as she takes care of the family drained without betraying the arid nature of the character. As the film ended I stayed in silence for the longest time embedded in the sadness clinging to the hope and mystified by the massacre the critics perpetrated in this original and highly recommendable film".

	schema:reviewBody "In navigating the torrent of negativity to which this movie has been subjected one thing to keep in mind is that it's an adaptation of a very widely read and popular book.The book itself had a rather sunny disposition which is ironic as it often was somewhat grislier in detail than the movie. That's because events can be described in words in a grisly way but still be part of an optimistic universe when you are reading  it works. That doesn't quite happen when you actually see things with your eyes film is much more literal strange to say that literature.Considering the subject matter the murder of a young girl it's a bit unfair to go to the movie and expect to see the book come to life on the screen.The problem in making the movie as in any adaptation of magical realism concerning dark subjects is how to capture the magic without having it jar too much with the realism. That was extremely difficult to do here considering how grim the subject is. So when Jackson uses special effects to invoke heaven people tend to completely flip out without really offering their own alternative about how that should have been done.All this adds up to a book that perhaps shouldn't have been adapted for the screen at all. That said I think the movie is quite a fine one especially because of the magnificent performances of the two leads Ronan and Tucci. Thanks to the sweetfaced and deeply affecting Ronan you'll never forget Susie Salmon. The music is also just fantastic not surprising as Brian Eno did it  it's very disappointing that the soundtrack is not available as it's beautiful and haunting.I'd suggest seeing it and just let yourself decide if it's a worthwhile experience or not. I found it to be a very good try at adapting a book that by its nature is extremely hard to film. Actually the best way to go at it would be to watch the movie then read the book then try to figure out for yourself how you would have done it differently. I suspect that you'll gain a new appreciation for Jackson's movie if you do that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to preface my review with a comment about the negativity circulating around here about this movie. I don't think it's any coincidence that some of these selfappointed filmmaking experts who have nothing remotely positive to say about Jackson's effort cannot formulate complete sentences. It's not surprising at all that someone obsessed with the wetness of a prop in one scene and its dryness in the next lacks the faculty and capacity to appreciate the many merits of this film. It's ridiculous to knitpick on 'unrealistic' depictions of this aspect of day to day life or that aspect. If you want a realistic depiction of day to day life observe the world around you not a movie screen.The Lovely Bones is being unfairly hammered as maudlin drivel. Some of the concepts and visuals are on the representational side but if you take this film as a strange amalgam of a murdersuspense thriller and a fantasy in the vein of a children's book it all works perfectly. The emotional outpouring is portrayed very well by all the players involved. None of it seemed forced. I became emotionally invested early on and the overall impact of this work struck a chord in me that resonated deeply.More than anything else this film is unique. Jackson takes many chances when one considers all the traditionally accepted conventions of film making but unless you are one of those selfabsorbed selfimportant film student types who endlessly struggle with the rules of making good films you'll get something out of this.The use of CGI was adventurous to be sure but if one views this piece as an interpretation of life love and death through a fantastical lens then the effects remain harmonious to the telling of the story. More the CGI in this case describes 'world's unseen' metaphysical possibilities existing simultaneously without the bounds of physical space and time. A welcome departure from space ships and crumbling cities. Some of the nastiest complaints about the CGI are coming from people who probably have no problem with giant robots that transform into cars and trucks.Acceptance of a fictional story the suspension of disbelief these events occur in the relationship between a movie and its viewer completely apart from all the rules of pacing subtext and all the rigid pigeonholes that don't really apply to the creative process anyway. I did not find the Lovely Bones to be maudlin and I am a pretty jaded movieviewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the thorough thrashing this movie has received from other reviewers I came with few expectations. Movies based on novels are after all often difficult to put together in a way that is satisfying to readers yet visually engaging. On this note I must disagree with the negative reviews and naysayers Jackson has succeeded in both stunning me visually hard to do as I'm an artist and therefore picky and thoroughly tugging my heartstrings. I found myself in tears during easily one third of the movie. Although I am an emotional person I strongly disagree that The Lovely Bones bears much resemblance to a madeforTV melodrama.I gave it a 910 because it is not perfect. There are a few elements that could have been better developed such as the relationship that grows between Susie's younger brother Buckley and their bereaved father. However Jackson chose to focus almost completely on Susie's dilemma in the afterlife as she watches her family grieve and her killer become maddeningly arrogant in his ability to duck and cover.It is this reviewer's opinion that if you came to The Lovely Bones expecting a gruesome rape scene along the lines of A Time to Kill you were disappointed. Jackson expressed dismay that his viewers would even WANT to witness a 14yearold girl being raped and murdered stating that he had no desire to portray such and never will. This movie will not appeal to males in general particularly under the age of twentyfive for what should be obvious reasons. It is about a young girl whose life was stolen from her. She therefore has a young girl's feelings hopes and fantasies. If you can't relate to those emotions then you probably won't like this movie. If you can't be touched by the powerful imagery the CGI in the movie provides you probably won't like this movie. There are straightforward A to Z movies that tell their stories stepbystep from beginning to end plotdriven and then there are movies that weave a tale around the emotions and struggles of their characters characterdriven. This movie is one of the latter and if you don't like that kind then you probably won't enjoy it. Furthermore a characterdriven tale based on a novel in which every character receives as much screen time as it did page time ends up becoming epic in length. I marathonread the book in one day. How long does a movie based on it need to be in order to accurately establish the core plot?In summary if you can allow Jackson's special effects to blow you away as was intended and if you can approach it with an open heart then you're in for a real treat in The Lovely Bones. It was elegantly done and very entertaining  to the right person.".

	schema:headline " A look into author Alice Sebold's psyche but clouded by special effects";
	schema:reviewBody "If the movie had been truer to the book I would have given it 810 but as it is it just makes being dead seem super cool and Jackson injects too much CGI into a story that just doesn't need it. Plus do you really think it would be heaven to look down on your loved ones and see what they are REALLY doing? Their true faces? I don't think that seeing their sins big and little would be comforting at all. Mom what are you doing with that detective??? BLECH! That's in the book not in the movie. The story is that of Susie a 14 year old girl destined to be forever 14 when she is raped and murdered by a neighbor in 1973. She floats around looking at events below throughout the film until she finally enters into heaven conversing with her killerrapist's other victims.To understand this story overall you have to have read Alice Sebold's autobiographical work Lucky. Sebold was raped at the age of 18 when she was still a virgin by a total stranger on the last day of her freshman year while walking to her dorm late at night at Syracuse University. The rapist was an African American who admitted to her during the ordeal that he had raped before but for some reason thought that this kind of behavior constituted a date. Did I mention that he beat Alice to a pulp? Sebold came from an intellectual family. Her father was a renowned figure in academia on the subject of Spanish literature. Her mother was a cross between Susie's mother and Susie's grandmother. Mom had briefly been an alcoholic and had periods of raving the grandmother but Alice also always sensed that her mother rather resented the burden that the 1950's had put on her  society pushed women into the role of wife and mother Susie's mother. Like Sebold the character of Susie has one sister.I'm telling you all of this to show you that this work appears to be another albeit fictional work in which Sebold tries to deal with her own rape back in 1981. Her liberal intellectual roots have her painting the rapist in this story as an ordinary seeming white man that fit well into middle class society when in fact her own rapist was a black career criminal a serial rapist of any vulnerable woman he came across when it suited his mood and with a long rap sheet of violent crimes before he raped Sebold. But Sebold's intellectual liberal roots have her feeling some white guilt in Lucky even as she assists the prosecution with convicting this animal.Another complicating factor is that Alice Sebold's rapist  never mentioned by his right name in Lucky even though we display the name AND picture of convicted rapists in newspapers everyday  probably arranged to have her closest friend and college roommate raped by a criminal associate two years after Sebold's rape in retaliation for his well earned maximum sentence. Since the roommate would not cooperate with police and threw Sebold out of her life afterwards nobody can know for sure. But things that the roommate's rapist said mentioning Alice and her routine and insisting on raping the roommate on Alice's bed suggests that is what happened. Imagine what these two traumas did to Alice Sebold? What they did was send her into a ten year tailspin of self destruction at the end of which she discovered that she had PTSD got treatment and is supposedly cured. But how could anybody ever be cured of such traumas? Some have even said that Sebold is in fact Susie dead lingering between this world and the next  the girl she was before all of this violence looking for the life that she had before rape. It's an interesting thought.If you read Lucky you realize that Sebold even has a hard time coming to terms with the rage and desire for vengeance she must have had for her rapist. This is illustrated in The Lovely Bones when Susie's killer is never arrested or convicted by the authorities not even violently avenged by her father or some other caring friend or family member. Instead he is killed by a falling icicle in a freak accident. A most passive death for a horrible criminal. It is like Sebold is trying to say that God makes things right in the end when to me God appeared to be otherwise occupied during both Susie's and Sebold's ordeal. Maybe suffering and injustice mean nothing at all.I'd say I moderately recommend this filmed version of Sebold's excellent literary work but I highly recommend you read first Lucky and then The Lovely Bones to get the most out of it.".

Since the roommate would not cooperate with police and threw Sebold out of her life afterwards nobody can know for sure. But things that the roommate's rapist said mentioning Alice and her routine and insisting on raping the roommate on Alice's bed suggests that is what happened. Imagine what these two traumas did to Alice Sebold? What they did was send her into a ten year tailspin of self destruction at the end of which she discovered that she had PTSD got treatment and is supposedly cured. But how could anybody ever be cured of such traumas? Some have even said that Sebold is in fact Susie dead lingering between this world and the next  the girl she was before all of this violence looking for the life that she had before rape. It's an interesting thought.If you read Lucky you realize that Sebold even has a hard time coming to terms with the rage and desire for vengeance she must have had for her rapist. This is illustrated in The Lovely Bones when Susie's killer is never arrested or convicted by the authorities not even violently avenged by her father or some other caring friend or family member. Instead he is killed by a falling icicle in a freak accident. A most passive death for a horrible criminal. It is like Sebold is trying to say that God makes things right in the end when to me God appeared to be otherwise occupied during both Susie's and Sebold's ordeal. Maybe suffering and injustice mean nothing at all.I'd say I moderately recommend this filmed version of Sebold's excellent literary work but I highly recommend you read first Lucky and then The Lovely Bones to get the most out of it.";

	schema:headline " a grand sloppy folly for Peter Jackson his writers";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad lifeanddeath meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the inbetween a kind of purgatory after being raped and murdered on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or possibly a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.Maybe it's just a general attitude that Jackson and his writers wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Bowens take from the book. What might have been poignant observations for example from the girl Suzie Salmon like the fish becomes a series of really jagged narration in the film that is a poorly written b in a continuously ineffective andor annoying tone from Saoirse Ronan who is not bad in the film by the way when the material requires it and c it's redundant. We see her sights in this inbetween world moving about and in quick motions without consistency though as with Avatar one might say at least it's pretty and her descriptions are at best unnecessary and at worst just stupid. It's some of the worst use of narration last year compare it to The Informant! and see how much of a dropoff it is.But narration is just one thing. Another is a lack of focus in the story and actually getting to really care about any one of the living characters. It's not really the actors fault as Wahlberg Weisz and Imperioli do what they can in their roles Wahlberg especially in spite of everything throws himself into the devastated father well. When it comes time for us to really get into the emotional grit and horror of this situation of how horrible it really is it's actually glossed over by Suzie's situation up in the inbetween. There isn't a solid 'conflict' about who the killer is since it's revealed in the first few minutes of the film. On top of this the logic on Stanley Tucci's character is alltoo obvious  it's a perfectly creepy performance but a little subtlety might have helped. And then there's the lush grandmother played by Susan Sarandon that is used for very illtimed and unfunny comic relief midway through the movie after which she's pushed aside to a reactionary role.And yet I didn't have as big a problem like some critics have had which is with the inbetween itself and its visual scheme. While it's not as imaginative as Jackson seems to think it is it does reflect more or less what a 14 year old girl's emotional state would be in an afterlife world. It's moreso a problem when Jackson deals with balancing this fantasy afterworld with the real one and the rules of how Suzie reaches out to those is never firmly established the one girl she brushes against running down the street is one thing her parents and sister are another. It's not so much the sights but again a mood and attitude that Jackson botches what is with this Asian girl that accompanies Suzie? It's explained to be sure as are the other victims of Tucci's child killer but the attachment she has with her previous life and family is screwy it becomes muddled and unsatisfying.I would almost stop short... no I would just about claim that this is close to being the kind of cloying sappy crap that one would usually find its way onto Lifetime where struggles are put to melodramatic limits and by the end every plot strand no matter how unlikely is resolved one of those involving Rachel Weisz's character is just ridiculous in its timing. And yet for all of the story and character problems for all the clunky dialog Jackson has a few moments where he can let his actors have room to breathe. Chief of these are scenes involving suspense when Suzie is in the lair of the man who will kill her which is a gradual scene of weird intensity and then later a scene where Tucci comes into his house while Suzie's sister is snooping around. Little glimmers of the kind of filmmaker one saw from fifteen years ago on another movie about teenage girls and the fragility of life and death and love Heavenly Creatures in such real dramatic clarity and power. But that's all really.The Lovely Bones has so much that could go right with it that it's most disappointing how wrong it goes. It takes someone with as much talent and passion as Jackson to screw up on this level. He and his writers have not made an exactly boring movie but it could very well be for some in the audience. I found myself shaking my head and frowning at what I saw a watered down vision of reconciling grief and loss and at best a mixedbag of a story surrounding a notwhodunit about a child killer. Some may be moved and more power to them. I couldn't wait for this wishywashy journey to end.".

Jackson puts on rosy color glasses when he deals with the character of Susie and that's where he goes really wrong because he does not make her a real person he makes her an unreal angel that was with out fault.Peter Jackson not only hurts his own film but hurts the actors who made an effort to be faithful to the heart of the book as well making this adaptation very painful to watch.".

	schema:headline " A lovely mess.";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Peter Jackson's incoherent and ultimately pointless adaptation of the bestseller is just an intolerable mess from start to finish. Jackson manages to take a wonderful story about tragedy and grief and turn it to a carnival of incompetence and stupidity. Gone is the strong characterization that define each of the characters in the book and in its place is a sad spectacle of incompetence with heavy handed CGI and bad scriptwriting that makes this film a real eye sore to sit through.I don't blame any of the actors involved in the movie because you can see how badly this film was edited in post production making certain characters look foolish with out any reason and certain scenes that don't make any sense what so ever. You can see that the actors are really trying to their best and for the most part they are able to succeed but its manly due to their professionalism than what they are working with which is not much. Stanley Tucci gives an ounce of humanity to his character but that's mostly because he's a great actor not because of the role which he had to work with. His character is so badly written in this film that he comes more across as a cartoon bad guy than the monster that was in the book. Stanley Tucci manages to give the viewer glimpses of heavy psychoses with his character but he's left out there by himself with no support from his director or the script which fails him every step of the way. Rachel Weisz struggles hard with her role which was short changed by the director in the editing room in post production because he could not handle the plot line that her character has. A plot line which gave the original book a sense of reality and made the reader look into themselves as human beings and question their own selves on how far their grief can go. Unfortunately Jackson proves that he's not a mature enough filmmaker to answer those questions and Weisz and the viewer are left with little to related to. Rachel Weisz does manage to convey her character's dilemma quite well despite Jackson's immaturity Which of course is more about Weisz being a great actress than the material and director she is working with and by doing this Weisz manages to give the viewer a glimpse of how good this film could have been if you had a director who was mature enough to handle the realities that the book presented to its readers. Saoirse Roan is left with really nothing to do other than run wild in a computerize playground that is supposed to be limbo. She tries her best she really does but one gets the sense that most of her dramatic scenes were left on the editing room floor during post production as well. We can't connect with this little girl and that's the biggest crime of all because she's the murder victim. The book give you a complete picture of who this little girl is and it give you a real human being to care for too bad the script for the movie does not. Susan Sarandon is left with a shallow version of her character who was quite no nonsense and soulful in the book but is reduced to becoming a sad and awkward comic relief device thanks to Jackson who left almost all of her dramatic scenes with the family on the cutting room floor. Susan still makes her character soulful but again that's because she's a great actress not from any help from the director or the script. Mark Wahlberg struggles very hard as well with what he has to work with and he does make a great effort unfortunately his character comes across more befuddled than assuring and the heavy editing and lackluster script leaves him out to dried as well along with the rest of the cast in this movie.No book can be faithfully adapted but they can at least have someone who care about its truthfulness to its core. Unfortunately The Lovely Bones does not have that and despite the game effort by all the actors involved its the director who ultimately sabotages this movie with his unwillingness to face its hard truths and we are left with a film that is shallow to its core.".

The acting was fine everyone did a good job on that end but the cut scenes to the acid trip land of Susie Salmon's Heaven were a waste of time. She never did anything there that impacted the story line. At least in What Dreams May Come there was a point to it. So here are some highlights of lack of logic and frustration for me Watching Mark Wahlberg who they couldn't hide his frame under the 70's shirts get beat up by a wimpy high schooler was completely bogus!  The ending with the icicle causing the killer to trip and fall off a cliff was horrible watching Mark beat the crap out of him and throw him off a cliff would have been much better.  The LSD trip scenes of heaven were just plain boring. If Susie could have actually done anything to help her family that would have been good.  Mark's character welcoming his wife back after however long she had wimped out on her family was pretty bogus.  Mark's daughter holding the book of the killer to see his mom and dad have some fairy tale greeting and not saying Look I found her killer and he almost got me and may try again...Oh hi mom! was completely stupid.  Many more...Good points I could only come up with one  I liked them not going into details of the murder who needs to have their mind filled with junk like that. That was well done to give a somewhat tense scene without having to see the murder or even know if there was a sexual assault.".

The best parts of the book are manipulated and regenerated so much that you do not even get the true meaning of what truly made this story memorable. Especially the key role that certain characters played that they did not even give the light of day!! What happened to the most important part that Ruth played??? The characters do not even get a chance to grow up for goodness sake!!! The whole point of the story is how the dead and the undead cope after wards! There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie.TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE!!

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Jackson did a HORRIBLE job with this movie. Just like all other booktomovie adaptations it was a TRAIN WRECK. There are several missing andor outoforder events that were crucial to the story as well as some discrepancies from the book.1. In the book the mother leaves AFTER the dad gets the living daylights beat out of him in the cornfield NOT before.2. In the book Ray and Ruth are Susie's same age not older. 3. In the book the mother and Detective Fenerman have an affair. THIS IS CRUCIAL to the rest of the story as it not only happens while Dad is in the hospital recovering from the cornfield incident but it causes her to leave! 4. There is just way too much that happens in the book after the murder that is actually IMPORTANT to the story and sadly left out.5. In the book Mom returns only when Dad is in the hospital after suffering a heart attack and the children are MUCH older. Also she and Lindsey do not automatically make nice with each other the same holding true for her and her husband. 6. Nothing is done to show the developing relationship between Dad and Buckley in the time that has passed since the murder as it is in the book. The poor little boy just kind of...disappears. In fact nothing is really done to show the progression of time at all. 7. As with Buckley the stories of Ruth and Ray just kind of...disappear. 8. Where is Mrs. Singh? She is a critical character as Mom befriends her at some point in the book! 9. In the book Mr. Harvey dumps the safe with Susie's body into the sinkhole RIGHT after the murder NOT at the end when he is preparing to run away. 10. In the book when Susie comes back to Earth near the end her soul possesses Ruth's body and Ruth's soul goes up to heaven where she is considered a hero. Susie in her entirety does not fall back down to Earth. Ray kisses Ruth's lips but it is Susie's soul who occupies the body.11. In the book Dad tells Lindsey to break into Mr. Harvey's house. She doesn't do it of her own accord.12. In the book Dad doesn't root through lists of serial killers etc. to suggest Detective Fenerman to look through. His initial instinct is Mr. Harvey. Also in the book Ray is thoroughly investigated by the police as a suspect.Peter Jackson seems to have yet again gone specialeffects crazy and not too focused on a plot. Alice Sebold herself should have directed the movie at least we would have seen some sort of visible plot.Also my recommendation to anyone wanting to watch a movie adaptation of a book  just read the book. Don't waste your time on the movie.And my recommendation to directors who want to make a movie adaptation of a book  don't waste your time either. It seems that every movie adaptation of a book is brutally butchered then left hanging in the Inbetween just as Susie Salmon is in in The Lovely Bones.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am an ardent admirer of Peter Jackson's 'Heavenly Creatures' and rate it 1 in my top 5 drama films of all time thus far. I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of Alice Sebold's novelwhich I have not readas it sounded like he was going back to his 'Heavenly Creature' roots with the story that was presented. I had read some disappointing reviews before seeing 'The Lovely Bones' so did not go in with much expectation but kind of hoping that the detractors may be wrong unfortunately they were right.Where to begin 1 I found the acting weak and forced. Mark Whalberg was miscast and was so obvious at playing emotional and serious rather than being the feeling like much of the movie there was no finesse to his performance. Rachel Weisz had hardly much to do at all and her role seemed lost and neglectedbut I would put this down to editing choices. Stanley Tucci and Saorise Ronan fared better but they are better actors than Whalberg so that goes without saying. Susan Sarandon was just a gross caricature.2 Like Sarandon's performance there was no subtlety to the presentation of the film. It's like Peter Jackson was too concerned with making a great looking technically impressive film which has overshadowed the human element of the story. Personally I found some of the CGI effects second rate like something I would find in a television commercial it just did not grab me and was surfeit.3 While it appears that much effort had gone into the production design with some meticulous detail it looked overdone and so fake 70's the actors looked like they were playing dress up and acting like they were still in the 21st century. The supporting roles were nothing to write home about at all and were just plain embarrassing to watch in some scenes. 'Heavenly Creatures' had strong performances from then largely unknown actors and this film had nothing exceptional to offer in the thespian stakes yet had a big name cast.4 I was not connected or emotionally involved in the proceedings due to the overimportance of the pyrotechnics on display and the screenplay was choppy and all over the place too much forced fed sentiment. Maybe I missed something but the style of the film did not mirror the substance and potential that was on offer and what could have been a moving and distressing experience ended up being distanced and flaccid.A huge disappointment!".

This story which seems like it should be about the slow disintegration of a family following an unimaginable tragedy has been turned into a campy whodunnit where you know who dun it from the start.Rather than concentrate on the relationships between the characters he fails to connect the dots jumping perspectives often enough to break any of those connections. It comes across as a set of disjointed episodes with overdone cgi in between rather than a coherent story. The jumps are so jarring at times Oh look mom is moving out. Oh look she's come back again I have to wonder if some of this is down to the editing and there was far more here in earlier cuts.There's one particularly tonedeaf sequence where the grandmother Susan Sarandon clearly enjoying herself swoops in and tries to cheer everyone up. Fair enough there are people who would do that in this sort of situation but it is so so overdone  overflowing the washer setting the kitchen ablaze all to a bouncy rock soundtrack  that I couldn't help thinking of Mrs Doubtfire. Completely offcolor for something like this. I was struggling already but kind of gave up at this point even if I did want to see how far he would go  and the ending is a doozy! After the luminous first halfhour where I thought there was potential for a serious shattered innocence angle it's a long sequence of wait... really? moments.The actors try hard including Wahlberg who I have trouble taking seriously after The Happening and I'm pretty sure THEY understood the real story here but Jackson gives them very little to work with. Actors often say they don't like to watch their own work because it's almost always disappointing to see a different story than the one you thought you were telling and they would be welladvised to stay away from this one because Jackson not only changes the story  he barely tells a story at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a highly anticipated film on its release . Based upon the cult novel by Alice Sebold and directed by Peter Jackson it opened to very Luke warm reviews by the critics . Normally I don't care what critics say but since I was very short of money I decided to save myself the price of a cinema ticket and catch it for free. In the mean time a lot of time had passed before I caught it tonight and I don't know if the criticisms of the film adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES had prejudiced my own opinion but this is a highly offensive film and we all know why don't we ? Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he called this film deplorable . The premise of the film centres around a 14 year old girl called Suzie who is raped and murdered by George Harvey . Jackson does his level best to make the inciting scene of the rape and murder as tense and as frightening as possible without causing offence . The irony is that as soon as Suzie reaches the afterlife any viewer with the vaguest notion of secularism will be very offended to think that a murdered 14 year old child will be enjoying them self in an afterlife beyond all human imagination in its beauty . Put it like this  If this was a film featuring a protagonist fighting Jihad and woke up to the afterlife seen here would you believe there wasn't an agenda behind it ? Of course I'm not for a second stating there is any spiritualreligiouspolitical agenda behind the film but this is the totally confused unintentional message Jackson is giving out It's a certainly a beautiful film from a technical viewpoint . Jackson is certainly influenced by the aesthetic beauty of the best Michael Powell movies and the cinematography is worthy of Jack Cardiff at his very best which is complemented by the visual capabilities of 21st century film making . All this is enhanced by the haunting score from Brian Eno . Unfortunately all this belongs in a different film entirely such as a film with an original screenplay featuring perhaps a doomed love affair perhaps a film where someone remembers someone who they can never have In short Peter Jackson is the completely wrong choice for director . A film featuring a victim of child murder should be gloomy and introspective made with a much smaller budget . It certainly wouldn't have had the critical anticipation that Jackson had brought but it certainly wouldn't have had people complaining that the message of this film screams that  Kill them all and let God decide . Dying has never been so much fun ".

The Lovely Bones is potentially a life changing story but it is squeezed out poorly.The story in itself is quite profound and disturbingly moving the excellent writing ability of Alice Sebold however the power is tragically lost amid the array of overly expanded scenes of Susie in the 'Inbetween'. The beautiful cinematography is stunning and creates an atmosphere but the way in which it's fused together produces a disappointing patchwork. There are certainly some talents on display with Tucci truly creating a menacing presence and Weisz's broken mother being entirely convincing. However these roles are disparagingly lost in the cascade of drawn out and overemphasised scenes of a CGI afterlife. Unfortunately these bones are not so lovely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a colossally misguided failure. Based on the wellreceived 2002 novel by Alice Sebold Jackson  along with his Lord of the Rings cohorts Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh  has penned a meandering screenplay made merely all the worse by uniformly awful performances poor editing and generally bad filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg who stepped in to replace Ryan Gosling prior to filming is in Happening mode which means he's doing that insincere dopey niceguy routine again that he's particularly bad at Rachel Weisz disappears for half the movie Susan Sarandon acts like she fell out of a Farrelly Brothers comedy then also disappears for half the movie and relative newcomer Saoirse Ronan is a bit too precocious for her own good. And Stanley Tucci in the role of a twisted serial killer alternates between horrific and morbidly humorous as Jackson attempts to have us laugh at this guy's predicaments and then root for his demise. The whole movie doesn't have a clue what it wants to be and because the thread of the story  the brutal rape and murder of a 14yearold girl  is so deplorable the film's lack of commitment to any singular theme or idea renders the picture offensive rather than just boring which it certainly is as well.Jackson doesn't like dialogue as is clear from his recent roundtable discussion with fellow directors. That's fine. But it's hard not to assume his inflated ego is to blame for the movie's visual excesses  maybe the sequences in heaven were poignant in the novel but here they seem distracting and unnecessary pulling us out of the main narrative the human story no less which needed all the help it could get to begin with. Furthermore for a director with such a renowned visual sense as Jackson the special effects sequences are simply bad  no more or less fantastical than a standard television commercial advertising antidepression pills. Let's hope TinTin fares better.For major studios January is considered dumping grounds  a time to toss aside the aborted Oscar contenders or latest Eddie Murphy comedy. Jackson's movie was originally set for release at the end of 2009 in time for the awards season but was delayed a wider expansion after disastrous test screenings and subsequently scathing reviews. One of the film's final shots is of a character discarding an unwanted object into a big hole in the ground burying it from existence  it's hard not to see the irony.".

I do like Peter Jackson and I thought the talent in the movie had the skills to be good. The problem though is that Peter Jackson apparently not only lost a bunch of weight but some of his brain must have leaked out too. He did a very very poor job on this one. It was a story about young girls being raped and murdered yet he wanted us to feel happy about it? The only good scene was went the sister was snooping around the house and then the brief chase but even then he screwed up! Here's this teenage girl running from a man who she knows for a fact now killed her sister and she just broke into his house and now when she gets home completely out of breath she sees her mom and just says Nah I will just forget about this dude who might still be after me and I will stay quiet. It seems like forever b4 she eventually gives the book over to Susan Surandon and then the scene ends without us seeing her reaction. It was real bad. Speaking of Susan I love her but she was like a damn character out of some comedy with Seth Rogan or something. It was totally misplaced. Also the trailer for this film made it seem like the girl would help catch her killer and that is just not how things were. Then to top it off the bad guy dies in what is one of the absolute lamest deaths I have ever seen. Not good. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I rated 2009 a disappointing year for movie viewing but it seems that 2010 is going to plumb new lows. Lovely Bones is a mess of a film. Lets start with casting  the 14 year old's love interest actually looks about 25. The kissing scenes with him are even more creepy than those involving the pedo  murderer. Mark Wahlberg is his usual cardboard cutout self. The plot is simply ludicrous  some examples Why do the parents wait for 4 hours for the girl to come home and then the first thing Walberg does is head out into the streets of town flashing a photo of his daughter to complete strangers wouldn't you ring the school ring her friends ring the police??? Why does Wahlberg compile files on hundreds of potential suspects but totally disregards the loner weirdo living right across the street. Why do we have the wacky scene in the middle involving the arriving Grandmother does not in anyway match the mood of the rest of the film. As a piece of art  it is also atrocious  we see the same scenes over and over again I felt like I had been bludgeoned by the Pedo. And what was the point of the plot anyway  the Pedo does not get caught seemingly lives a long and happy pedo life and then falls off a cliff. Are we meant to be convinced that just because he dies a tragic death at about age 80 that somehow he got what he deserved. He was probably going to die of old age the following day in any event. Are we also meant to believe that the girls family is now going to live a happy and fulfilled life. This seems unlikely when the police have again bungled capture of the killer and for all they know he is coming back for the younger daughter. Combine this with the fact that the murdered girl is left to live an eternity in heaven with 6 murdered strangers  what type of heaven is that? The special effects look cheap the music score is overdone. I have never understood what voyeuristic pleasure people get out of watching films about serial killers and what they do to innocent people. The book at least tried to tackle this issue from an uplifting perspective but this Hollywood piece of trash is just another morbid account of a serial killer dressed up as a piece of failed art. Ryan Gosling dumped this movie shortly into production  not even he could have saved this absolute Turkey1 out of 10 from me".

	schema:headline " This film is fascinating but definitely not for everyone";
	schema:reviewBody "I love this film. I have now viewed it three times and I still keep getting something new out of each viewing. I think it's one of Cronenberg's best. It is not however for the uninitiated. By that I mean those who are not familiar with Cronenberg's previous work and those who have not read J.G. Ballard whose novel was the basis for this film. Cronenberg excels at bringing difficult pieces of fiction to film. This is one such example.The written works of J.G.Ballard are generally dark dreary and disturbing psychological fiction. The characters in them are often very disturbed and socially dysfunctional. These are people who often due to unusual circumstances are not in their right minds. In Crash we are observing a group of characters who are all survivors of horrific car crashes. Like many crash survivors they are during their period of recovery in shock. They are badly shaken. They are recovering from severe physical injuries and they are disoriented fearful and emotionally numb. Instead of recovering in the normal fashion how sad that we've come to think of auto accidents as normal these characters stumble into the car crash cult of Vaughan. Vaughan who is brilliantly portrayed by Elias Koteas is a scientist who believes that there is a strong connection between the violence of a car crash and the passion of the sexual act.He easily indoctrinates the other characters into his mode of behavior and beliefs. By staging car crashes for entertainment by initiating traffic altercations with his followers and ultimately finishing with some very warped sex usually involving cars there is a metaphor being created. Accidents and the viewing of them becomes foreplay. It's the eroticism of the automobile taken to an extreme.Our society has had what is often referred to as a love affair with the automobile. This love affair has resulted in a worldwide addiction to a means of transportation that is in reality often very unhealthy and destructive. Aside from the aftermath of pollution and the sheer carnage of the ever rising highway accident rate this addiction also increases people's isolation from each other. Hidden in their private shells they move about only interacting with one another as necessary. This interaction rarely becomes intimate until it is violent as in aggressive driving and accidents .In Crash the characters are all portrayed as cold hearted numb and incapable of true intimacy with each otherthey sure have a lot of sex though. They are only capable of intimacy through their cars.This film is a bizarre metaphor for the human condition and how it is affected by our choice of technology. It is not meant to make car crashes look sexy. It is meant to draw attention to how our most familiar technology has changed us and made us less human. I love this film. Brilliant cast. Great cinematography. An excellent soundtrack by Howard Shore multiple layers of cleanly played very dissonant electric guitar sounding like a cross between Sonic Youth and Brian Ruryk. Only Cronenberg would have the guts to tackle a subject as difficult as this particular work of Ballard's. I think he did quite well.Depending on your mood at the time of viewing this film can range from being shocking amusing revolting hilarious to even just plain boring.

	onyx:emotionText "I love this film. I have now viewed it three times and I still keep getting something new out of each viewing. I think it's one of Cronenberg's best. It is not however for the uninitiated. By that I mean those who are not familiar with Cronenberg's previous work and those who have not read J.G. Ballard whose novel was the basis for this film. Cronenberg excels at bringing difficult pieces of fiction to film. This is one such example.The written works of J.G.Ballard are generally dark dreary and disturbing psychological fiction. The characters in them are often very disturbed and socially dysfunctional. These are people who often due to unusual circumstances are not in their right minds. In Crash we are observing a group of characters who are all survivors of horrific car crashes. Like many crash survivors they are during their period of recovery in shock. They are badly shaken. They are recovering from severe physical injuries and they are disoriented fearful and emotionally numb. Instead of recovering in the normal fashion how sad that we've come to think of auto accidents as normal these characters stumble into the car crash cult of Vaughan. Vaughan who is brilliantly portrayed by Elias Koteas is a scientist who believes that there is a strong connection between the violence of a car crash and the passion of the sexual act.He easily indoctrinates the other characters into his mode of behavior and beliefs. By staging car crashes for entertainment by initiating traffic altercations with his followers and ultimately finishing with some very warped sex usually involving cars there is a metaphor being created. Accidents and the viewing of them becomes foreplay. It's the eroticism of the automobile taken to an extreme.Our society has had what is often referred to as a love affair with the automobile. This love affair has resulted in a worldwide addiction to a means of transportation that is in reality often very unhealthy and destructive. Aside from the aftermath of pollution and the sheer carnage of the ever rising highway accident rate this addiction also increases people's isolation from each other. Hidden in their private shells they move about only interacting with one another as necessary. This interaction rarely becomes intimate until it is violent as in aggressive driving and accidents .In Crash the characters are all portrayed as cold hearted numb and incapable of true intimacy with each otherthey sure have a lot of sex though. They are only capable of intimacy through their cars.This film is a bizarre metaphor for the human condition and how it is affected by our choice of technology. It is not meant to make car crashes look sexy. It is meant to draw attention to how our most familiar technology has changed us and made us less human. I love this film. Brilliant cast. Great cinematography. An excellent soundtrack by Howard Shore multiple layers of cleanly played very dissonant electric guitar sounding like a cross between Sonic Youth and Brian Ruryk. Only Cronenberg would have the guts to tackle a subject as difficult as this particular work of Ballard's. I think he did quite well.Depending on your mood at the time of viewing this film can range from being shocking amusing revolting hilarious to even just plain boring. It's a great piece of art but you really do have to be in the right mood for it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Crash is a very sexually explicit film but if you buy or rent this movie expecting it to be an evening's erotic entertainment you are going to be disappointed because it is also an antierotic film.Even in the midst of frenzied lovemaking the characters remain distant their voices quiet and abstracted their gazes directed inward.  These are people who have been told all their lives by their culture by TV and movies that sex is on the one hand the most perfect form of communion and connection with another human being and on the other hand that it is the ultimate in transcendent and transformative experiences.  Instead they discover to their horror that even during sex they still feel nothing. They crave connection they are starved for a glimpse of transcendence but no matter what they do no matter who they do it with or how often while their bodies may feel passion their minds and hearts remain cold and empty.In the more recent movie Pleasantville the JenniferMary Sue character is unable to feel anything either and remains stubbornly black and white no matter how much sex she has until her brother suggests that maybe it isn't the sex that is the key to moving from black and white to color from passionlessness to feeling.  Unfortunately in Crash there is no one to suggest to David and Catherine Ballard that maybe it isn't through sex that they will find the transformation and connection they are craving.  So they instead seek more and more extreme forms of sexual stimulation only to be disappointed again and again.James is hurt in a car crash and during his stay in the hospital he meets Helen who was in the other car and later Vaughan a man who like James and Catherine is in desperate search of feeling only he looks for it in the violence of car crashes.  With Helen at first James then Catherine too is drawn into Vaughan's world where sex and death eros and thanatos for you Freudians meet in the twisted metal of wrecked cars and the mutilated bodies of the victims of fatal car crashes and the survivors of nearfatal ones.They attend staged recreations of famous car crashes like the one that killed James Dean.  They have sex in crashed cars and start touring crash sites on the freeway as a form of foreplay. They begin to watch films of crash tests and fatal race accidents like other people would watch erotic films and to have sex with people whose bodies have been mutilated by car crashes.But not even the horror of mutilation or the adrenaline rush of neardeath experience can lend James and Catherine's desperate coupling the depth of feeling that they so desperately crave.Like all the people who buy expensive automobiles to give them a feeling of power and independence only to discover that no matter how snazzy their car is they still feel powerless and unhappy James and Catherine have bought into one of our culture's Big Lies that sex is the answer.  This film shows us that it is not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crash caused a huge stir in the United Kingdom. Many conservatives were outraged by the combination of sex already an issue of danger because of aids and traffic accidents. Dangerous driving is like smoking a subject that you just can't touch without many moral watchdogs chasing you through a hellish puritan junkyard.I remember seeing this and a middle aged to elderly man in the theater began to quite obviously...ahem...trouser cough. This was one hell of a way to clear the cinema! That moment is pretty much like this film. Crash has weird sex and masterbation stuff that you do not really want to see. But David Cronenberg with the help of James Ballard drags us into a world that just takes the whole 'I love cars' boy racer thing way too far! It is just not healthy...Ballard writes in a bleak monotone. A monotone that Chuck Palahniuk seeks to imitate unsuccessfully. All of his characters are alien because of their lack of emotion. Cronenberg takes this aspect and runs with it. This makes the film good not because of the familiarity and sympathy that the viewer can build with the characters. It is actually quite the opposite the film strikes the viewer because of the sheer UNREALITY of what is happening. The complete and utter icy way that everything is presented just leaves the viewer going 'what?' Am I watching a bunch of jellyfish here?  The characters are so jaded. Trying desperately to experience emotion in an industrialized emotionless world. A world that has become nothing more than a production line. Good Ford! Sorry Huxley joke. Nerdy but necessary.Also Cronenberg is presenting a discourse that the famous intellectual Donna Haraway puts forward. That basically the human race has become cyborgs. The the human form is constantly changing. That machines are changing our humanity and crash seems to say that our own sexuality can mingle with the mundane machines that we hold so dear. Oh no! I am getting flashbacks of the crazed artist Stellarc...no...no...no! Besides I bet in the future terminators would make much more money as sexual partners rather than as assassins. Imagine that a beautiful spouse who always thinks your right and never argues with you. I LOVE THE FUTURE!Sex is considered to be the ultimate joining of two people. The most intimate way that human beings can connect to one another. Wrong! This film suggests that sex means...well nothing really. Procreation and a simple physical reaction. This is shown by James Spader and his wife's Deborah Unger relationship. These two are so jaded they tell each other their sexual adventures for attempted excitement but feel absolutely nothing. Certainly not some sought of emotional closeness to one another.This film is just so incredibly empty. But it is also a comment on the human condition. How we make almost suicidal attempts to attain pleasure. If this was a film about heroin for instance about junkies this film would be much more understandable. Ballard has taken this addictive self destructive behaviour and replaced it with an everyday object. The motor car. It is a brilliantly simple idea! But look at how many people it has horrified and offended! C'mon people are we really this stupid? Sex and drugs sex and violence. Sex drugs and violence. These things are all o.k. Portrayed constantly in Hollywood movies. Van Diesel anybody? But sex and car accidents how dare you? What kind of a sick freak are you??!! Consider how hypocritical this is when you watch something like Fast and the Furious.This is also a film that features the psychological nature of fetish heavily. Instead of having the common fetish for breasts or bottoms which again people might find more understandable. The fetish is actually for wounds and crash test dummy videos! That scene with Rosanna Arquette ewww! Would that work? This is definitely something that no one should try at home.David Cronenberg really deserves credit for making this film. He really has some big balls and respects the intelligence of the audience which I however do not. All of the actors deserve much credit for taking on some truly difficult material. They must really trust the director. I'm surprised no one said 'no David you are out to lunch on this one!' This film could have become a parody so easily. Never have I seen a film where everyone in the audience seemed so uncomfortable with the material. In fact when I saw this film without the trouser coughing people still walked out. It hasn't been since Salo that I have see a movie upset so many people. I give this 8 out of 10 for sheer weirdness. A great moment in a   major auteur's career who is not afraid to take risks. Hollywood take note!".

Set in Los Angeles James Spader and Deborah Unger play a couple drawn into an  underworld of odd characters who are sexually aroused by automobile crashes. Spader discovers this when he hits Holly  Hunter's car head on killing her husband. They become lovers meeting in a parking garage having unsatisfying sex in a parked car. Later they are involved with a clique that reenacts famous crashes for excitement.It's a fascinating premise and it starts off quite promising. However Spader's patented flat emotionally dead antihero never shows a spark of life. Nor do any of the other characters. And yet while there is an attempt to capture that serene surface perfected by David Lynch the attempt fails. In the end we do not care what happens to any of these characters. It becomes an exercise in guessing who will sleep with who next. Even the final scene in which Spader and Unger are brought back together fails to move because we have never cared about either of them. It felt like getting the news that your cousin twice removed who you have never met is getting married. You know you are supposed to feel happy for them but frankly you just don't care.On the other hand the movie is visually lush and does take some legitimate risks. Spader has a gay sexscene that as tame as it was is a true rarity in American theaters. Even Faith! Hope! and Glory! did not come close. One scene deserves especial mention. A group including Spader Hunter and Rosanne Arquette are watching video tapes of safety tests of automobiles starring the test dummies. As they watch they become increasingly aroused. They are all completely absorbed in films that were shot by engineers. Like lowbudget porn the videos are grainy out of focus and have no camera movement. Nevertheless the scene is oddly hysterical.Cronenberg also keeps close to home in another way. He always seems to be obsessed with violation. In his films this is represented literally. Here we have a number of characters whose bodies are violated with pins and braces administered by doctors. Not for the squeamish although the scenes are not gory. But to see the male nurse just poking at people's apparatus and wounds is unsettling recalls the Monty Python skit where the major missing a leg has it poked by his superior office asking if it hurts.".

Again Cronenberg delivers a dive into human psychic the world of dark obsession and twisted fantasy's. The plotA sexually frustrated couple starts experimenting with the outlines of anonymous sex. It is the husband James Ballard James Spader who gets into a car crash with Dr. Ellen Remington Holly Hunter and her husband. They crash frontally and both Ballard and Remington are seriously injured. Remington's husband dies while being launched from his seat through his own windshield into Ballards. Ballard ends up in the hospital traumatized trying to recover from his injuries. He gets into deeper contact with Helen Remington. Their mutual Crashvictim status brings them closer together ultimately delivering them into the sumpoilsoaked world of the pathological Vaughan Elias Koteas. Renegade scientist and leader of a strange subterranean group Vaughan is only able to achieve sexual release by crashing into people on the motorways surrounding Heathrow airport. Getting sucked into his world Ballard becomes obsessed with car crashes and dives into the illegal world of thrill seeking and raw and hard but mostly cold sex.The reviewTo be quiet honest Crash is a very underestimated picture. First of all there are a serious amount of people who thought that the subject was laughable and not to be taken serious for how could you take something like this serious ? After crashing your car and being injured having sex with the victim of a carcrash ? Apart from the posttraumatic stress that can appear after such an incident it also triggers a lot of adrenaline which is almost a self produced drug. Cronenberg cuts a subject which is still very much of a taboo the thrill seeking taboo. You got a lot of so called thrill seekers now these days which can result into ghost riding on the freeway climbing on buildings without security etc. All in all the thrill seek element isn't that original. This is where Cronenberg has looked for a thrill that rushes into a perverse sexual outburst. After the shock of crashing into a car the adrenaline the rush of the experience becomes so real you feel so alive that you need to let it all out which comes into the act of making love. Cronenberg is trying to paint the audience a picture of an event like this. Based on J.G. Ballards novel Crash which was quiet detached and cold the director follows in style with the dark freeways of Canada showing that even in your car you are not always save and how a car can become the ultimate drive for pleasure. The problem with this film like many others is that it is so far out there that you either hate it or love it. The pacing is rather slow in the beginning and its hard to get into if you don't understand the psychology that lies underneath the dialog. The movie has a solid script but the subject and material is not accessible for everybody. James Spader who often he almost could be a stereotype plays sexual frustrated protagonists SexLiesand Videotapes Secretary Speaking of Sex delivers a terrific performance here. His distant and alienated acting fits perfectly into the dark en and sensual story and doesn't come as a insincere or over the top. Some people felt that Koteas and Hunter performances where a little flat but they have just the balance between low key and an over the top performance Koteas more than Hunter. You got to keep in mind that these people are already deranged from the beginning. What you see is simply a drop falling into bucket that is overflowing. The use of light and shadow is very subtle and excellently done by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky. He really knows how to pull you into a certain world that LOOKS like ours but feels very different. In any case I can recommend the movie if you want to watch something different. A lot of people will not understand the weight this film carries and therefore this movie will be underrated or simply will be put aside as boring or unrealistic. THIS IS A MISTAKE... don't put it away watch it and feel the awkwardness. The result ? Humans really are quiet weird creatures...".

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg's Crash was one of those dirty movies I more than likely wasn't supposed to rent let alone watch when the NC17 cut first came into existence on video and if anything the film was more than an eyeopener in my young teen state going even further than I had seen at the time with Boogie Nights or Kids. But I didn't pay quite as much attention to the story as I should've aside from the James Dean subplot as I remembered it anyway with Elias Koteas's character and from the very dark atmosphere. It was almost TOO dark at the time and I stayed away until recently when it was shown on TV late one night. Seeing it now I'm much more absorbed into the wretchedly but totally sensually charged work by the actors and the crew and Cronenberg's utmost trust and professionalism with both. It certainly has that effect on a first viewing of veering way too close into the softcore boundaries and even seems like the kind of thing that I used to see in that 'scandalous' section of mainstream adult films as a kid like Last Tango in Paris. But the psychology behind the characters ends up being more striking than anything and like many of Cronenberg's films the duality of man and woman apparently comes strongly into play and the merging of the two as usually becomes the case.James Spader is in one of his very best performances albeit only somewhat removed from the sexual deviants of Sex Lies  Videotape and Secretary maybe closer to the latter however without any of that film's outright satire as Ballard also the author this film is based upon. He gets in a car accident a horrible one that kills a doctor and leaves his wife Holly Hunter injured both physically and psychologically. But Ballard and his wife Deborah Kara Unger very good as well get brought into this strange world that's been built around Vaughn Koteas perhaps in one of his top 3 best pieces of work very creepy but somehow convincing early on at least to his new arrivals. He is a man who is completely enveloped into his psyche of carcrash sex and how history ends up adding a mystique to it all hence the James Dean references which are very amusingly pathological. But this all becomes very dangerous if only on some subversive level when Ballard his wife and Hunter's Helen Remington get involved in this underground cult.Seeing the film again I'm a lot more struck this time after seeing other Cronenberg work how the style slips so amazingly into the content of the picture. The first time around the style almost seemed to be just another side to the content that it was obvious to have such a wild yet controlled technique particularly for the sex or car crash scenes. This is as much a credit to Cronenberg's poetic touches to the material as it is to DP Peter Suschitzky and Howard Shore's music which somehow rises above being too pornographic to being really touching. In fact after seeing it again very late at night and not remembering the entire film I may even need to see it again to let it all sink in. But really this won't be the case for all the NC17 rating isn't too unwarranted in this case even if it's more a rating for the nature of the sexual contact and aggressiveness of the fetishism as opposed to something like the Dreamers where there was blatant nudity a lot of the time. I wouldn't dare recommend the Rrated version however as the whole point is to see it all in its untarnished view. It's a harsh vision painted here of people reaching out for some kind of connection through the most destructive way imaginable. One thing's for certain once you've seen it there's no mistaking this from Paul Haggis's Crash and for me this beats out Haggis's contrived goodintention machine any day.".

In fact there's a lot of admire in this sweaty atmospheric adaptation that perfectly captures the sense of heightened alienation that charactersises much of Ballard's prose.  While among the cast Deborah Kara Unger is sexy as always Elias Koteas is suitably creepy and even James Spader is kindof OK if you don't mind him doing that lost little college boy grown up to be a pervert thing that he first perfected as Graham in 'Sex Lies and Videotape' a role he basically reprises here.But  and let's get real for a minute  this is a film about people who are turned on by car crashes! Now what the hell is that all about?  If you ask me the film is trying to say something about the need for transgression in an age with no real taboos  so its characters push at an endlessly receding door until in the end only death itself can offer a way out.  The problem is that the film suffers from the same problems as the world it portrays  these people have no moral rules so their actions carry no implications beyond themselves  which leaves us with an idea with happenings but no narrative drive as such.  Without anything to set against their nihilistic desires 'Crash' coveys no sense of tragedy just driving around in cars with sex.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is the very real possibility that CRASH is an elaborate joke. That is the only way that this monumentally idiotic mess could possibly be explained. Certainly there is nothing in this silliness that in any way touches upon normal human behavior as most people understand it. Indeed I even suspect you would have trouble finding any psychologist or psychiatrist who would have ever encountered the type of freaky weirdoes who populate this film  or for that matter even have read about such freaky weirdoes in text books. The film deals with people who get sexual aroused by automobile accidents and the pain and suffering such wrecks cause. I suppose anything is possible and such people may exist but CRASH takes it one step further and suggests that there is this cult of individuals who somehow network to fulfill their fantasies of motorized mayhem. Two such characters are played by Holly Hunter and James Spader. In a most grotesque parody of meeting cute the two encounter each other when he crosses the center line and smashes headon into her car killing her husband and apparently getting her hot and bothered in the process. Hunter's Helen is already into smashup sex so after a stay in the hospital the grieving widow naturally rushes Spader  playing James Ballard the author of the original novel  into her small band of bumper car aficionados. In addition to being wreck 'n' roll fanatics the people must also be incredibly rich. They like to recreate infamous celebrity auto accidents such as James Dean's roadside death. For instance to do so they have to buy or recreate not only a replica of Dean's rare 1955 Porsche Spyder but also an almost equally rare 1950 Ford coupe that was the other car involved in the crash. With these and a variety of other new and used cars we're talking about thousands perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars for autos destined to be demolished in the name of foreplay. Talk about expensive quickies. A couple of tickets to a demolition derby would be far more economical  and a virtual orgy. Of course the film isn't really about auto eroticism it is about sexual obsession in general. The fetish in question could have been about anything that inspires abnormal lust. The characters could have been turned on by say internet porn gambling bungee jumping farm animals or jiggling JellO molds. But gosh darn it car wrecks are so much more photogenic. It doesn't seem to bother the filmmakers that they are perpetuating a correlation between sex and violence because well they apparently believe such a link already exists. Nor do they seem to be aware that they are undermining their own efforts by building an ohso serious drama around a ludicrously grim and lame joke. As such the insipidness of the story is accentuated by the pomposity of the storytelling. Director David Cronenberg approaches the story as though he were Igmar Bergman directing PERSONA. Other than a few lapses the film is cold and lifeless and empty though it is somewhat appropriate that a film celebrating a sexual obsession with automobiles would depict sex as an utterly mechanical act. Cronenberg and crew do slip up a couple of times and inspire moments worthy of laughing out loud. One scene in particular is hilarious Hunter and several others are lounging around watching videos of auto crash tests like they are watching porn videos One particularly messy smash up prompts Hunter to excitedly demand that it be shown again in slow motion. Crash dummies watching crash dummies as it were.There is an unwritten rule of movie sex If films featuring explicit sex are fun and comic then it is pornographic but if the sex is joyless degrading and dispassionate then it is art  or sex as something good is dirty sex as something bad is honest. It is this simplistic neopuritanical attitude that makes films like CRASH so insultingly hypocritical Make a big deal about filming graphic lurid sex scenes then condescendingly shake one's finger at the audience to remind them how perverse such activity is. It's like slipping an alcoholic a drink in order to selfrighteously chastise him for being a drunk. Had the filmmakers shucked the smug moralizing and openly played the material as sly satire perhaps CRASH could have been a sharp commentary on modern romance both between people and with their cars  speeding as flirtation road rage as rape reckless driving as masturbation the headon collision as the one night stand marriage as the aftermath of roadside carnage. But I don't think the film has the courage or the intellect to explore such themes. The film plays it safe giving us a tale of obsession where the obsession is devoid of the thrill the energy or the naughtiness of actually giving in to an impulse. It's an addiction without a high but worse no expectation of there being a high. Here is a film that wants us to identify with a psychological quirk that is to say the least ridiculous but it doesn't even make the effort to frame the quirk in a realistic fashion. How are we to care one way or the other  emotionally dramatically socially or even clinically  about people the film itself seems to regard as emotionally dead freaks? CRASH thinks it is speeding recklessly down uncharted roads but it is up on blocks spinning its wheels and destined for the junkyard.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1996 Crash 1996 Cronenberg won The Jury Special Prize at Cannes. However this proved to be a rare positive response. In other quarters the picture was almost universally loathed and condemned as perverted and repulsive. Westminster Council in London banned it outright. The Daily Mail and Evening Standard in particular saw the film as threatening to public morals criticising it regularly often on their front pages. Christopher Tookey writing in The Daily Mail caused outrage amongst the disabled lobby by using the phrase 'sex with cripples'. This seems to have caused more offence than by anything in the film. Alexander Walker described Crash as a movie beyond the bounds of depravity. So what's really been going on? Crash is David Cronenberg's third masterpiece. However unlike Videodrome and Naked Lunch there is no confusion between reality and hallucination. The protagonists actually engage in even the more extreme behaviours in Crash. The characters engage in seemingly random acts of dangerous driving crashing cars and sex but there is more to Crash than sex and wrecks. The film is also a deeply disturbing analysis of the interplay between these obsessions in the lives of a group of emotionally damaged people.Crash is a movie about unsatisfying relationships in particular the flawed relationships between the main characters. The empty relationship between Catherine and James Ballard the strange relationship between the protagonists and their cars and the tortured relationships between the characters and their body modifications crash injuries.Vaughn's relationship with his car is extremely personal  he lives in it and fks in it. His car is described by Catherine as a bed on wheels. Ballard tells his wife that it smells of semen. Crash asks us what relationship do we have with our vehicles? Is it our mobile office? Or is it perhaps our refuge from reality a place of safety and seclusion when we want to be alone? Are we relieved when we are able to escape from daily pressures into the safety of that mobile metal womb? With reference to Crash Cronenberg has remarked A car is not the highest of high tech. But it has affected us and changed us more than anything else in the last hundred years. We have incorporated it. The weird privacy in public that it gives us. The sexual freedom  which in the '50s wasn't even subtle! So we have already incorporated the car into our understanding of time space distance and sexuality. To want to merge with it literally in a more physical way seems a good metaphor. There is a desire to fuse with technoness. The sex in Crash is mundane and boring a joyless experience for all involved Did you come? asks James of his wife as she tells him about her latest conquest. No she replies. The participants seem distracted cold and distant. They rarely even face one another during sex with the action being mostly from behind. The characters seem distracted looking off into the distance their eyes dead and empty such as when James and Catherine have sex and discuss Vaughn. There is a third person involved in their actions.The cars end up as twisted and damaged as the people involved. The wreckage that Vaughn and company leave behind symbolises the wrecked and soulless relationships they have with each other. After a crash the driver and passengers are removed effectively removing the car's beating heart. Vaughn and his companions inject temporary new life into the wrecks by reclaiming them either as drivers or as a place to have sex in. Conversely the broken and smashed vehicles seem to give life to their new inhabitants who only seem to be really alive and able to connect with their feelings when they are either behind a wheel or having sex in the back.As an uncompromising comment upon how our lives and behaviour have been affected and altered by modern technology Crash is exceptional in its bravery and honesty. The film's characters find their bodies being altered and twisted by modern science in the form of cars. Advancing technology Cronenberg tells us alters us and will continue to do so as it becomes more integrated into our lives and our personal and collective consciousnesses. Our world our behaviour and our bodies will continue to change as technology invades our flesh and our minds.These themes of metamorphosis mutation and 'treacherous flesh' have been explored by Cronenberg in practically every one of his previous movies perhaps most successfully in Videodrome 1982 and The Fly 1986. Videodrome considers the impact and influence of broadcast media on human behaviour and sexuality and implies that you can actually change what it means to be a human being in a physical way Cronenberg 1997. The Fly studies these same themes but replaces technology with disease. The potential of illness to transform the physical shell is contrasted with the changes forced on our bodies by the aging process. We're used to our bodies changing. First we grow up then we grow down. There's only a moment where there are a few years of the illusion of stability. It doesn't last long Cronenberg 1997 This singularity of vision confirms Cronenberg as an auteur with imagination singlemindedness and power as well as a disturbing new vision of the world. Indeed 'Cronenbergesque' has become a term describing a specific and unique genre one that is unlike any other associated with typical horror cinema.".

I give an enormous amount of credit to some of the cast members Holly Hunter especially for participating in such crap.  She obviously saw something erotic or dangerous in the script.  I saw idiocy stupidity and unnecessary pain.  I did not know whether to laugh or vomit but I somehow made it through.The film involves an oversexed James Spader who 'crashes' into a car with a halfnaked Ms. Hunter killing the driver and seriously injuring Spader's leg.  In the hospital the film's forced sexuality never stops considering a visit Spader gets from a handy blonde.  Through a series of weird events and experiences involving automobiles I would rather not get into the film's selfimportant message is clear How modern technology changes the human body i.e. car crashes.First of all we've been presented this message in countless other ways. Cronenberg has just found a sick and explicit way to present it.  Secondly what these characters think and do exist only to 'present' this overblown message.  They have no other duties ideas character traits or appeal other than to go wild sexually in all kinds of cars car washes and car chases.  What is this?  NeoIndustrial Revolutionary filmmaking?  No it is garbage.Onenote  Rosanna Arquette appears as a goodlooking Darth Vader.  Only anyone who has seen this will know what I mean. This is in no way a recommendation and this has been a fun waste of time discussing bad cinema.".

And put your dirty socks in the hamper.If you think YOU'RE warped wait until you see the characters who populate this movie. You'll not only emerge from the experience reassured you'll wind up feeling like a paragon of normality.The story if that's the word for it has Spader getting into a headon smasheroo with a car in which Hunter is a passenger. Her husband is thrown through the windshield and killed. Spader is hospitalized with various pieces of shiny steel holding his long bones in place. He finds the pain and discomfort and immobilization so arousing that when his wife Unger visits him it leads to masturbation. There's a lot of that sort of thing in this movie.You'd never think Holly Hunter would suffer from such a paraphilia but she does. So does Spader's wife. Hunter and Spader run into each other figuratively in a garage full of wrecked cars and make furious love in one of the surrealistically twisted carcasses.Before you know it the Spader family and Hunter have fallen in with a group of  well there's no easy name for people of this quality. Koteas the head of this underground cohort is some sort of showbusiness stunt driver who with a few associated restages fatal car crashes of celebrities. Spader and Hunter are one of a dozen or two spectators who come to watch the staging of the 1955 crash between James Dean's Porsche and a Ford driven by somebody named Turnipseed. None of the men involved in the stunt wear helmets or seat belts and there are no roll bars or any of that wimpy stuff. Koteas' shiny Porsche Spider backs up then speeds full blast into the front of the Ford. Kaboom. Sirens burping the cops arrive and everyone scuttles for cover. It is never explained exactly how Koteas makes enough money to smash up beautifully restored Fords and Porsches. His next big show will involve the decapitation of Jane Mansfield. At Koteas' home they watch movies of test crashes with dummies instead of porn.Spader's wife has seemed relatively reasonable up to now but she finds herself turned on by crashes stunt men and the rest. When she and Spader are making love this time in bed not in the back seat she asks about Koteas. Did you see his penis? Spader He says it's all scarred from a motorcycle accident. Unger ecstatically Ewwwww. Anyway to get on with it one thing leads to another  one thing being crashes and the other being flaming death amidst twisted metal. What with everyone being swept up in the craze and wanting still more of the excitement the only sensible way to arouse and satisfy your wife is to smash into her car and kill her right? Two Big Os for the price of one  Orgasm through Obliteration. So Spader continually rams the convertible driven by his willing wife until it flips over on the side of the highway. But she's not dead after all. I'm all right she mumbles. Maybe next time. Maybe next time he whispers to her and then does her bloody and half conscious body in the sere grass.So what's it all about you ask? You might find that SOME people have no idea but I have a very firm answer. I don't know. At one point Spader asks Koteas why he's so interested in this stuff and Koteas replies portentously It's the reshaping of the human body by modern technology. Gosh.It's an awesome statement but what does it mean? How is modern technology reshaping the human body? Does he mean that vehicular accidents tear it all to bits? Is he somehow thinking of the Thighmaster or simulacrum that imitate rowing or crosscountry skiing or walking upstairs? Is Cronenberg really after ROCK HARD ABS? Here's what I think he's up to. It's been called self testing. It's seeing how far you can violate ordinary tastes and still get away with it rather like a toddler who insists on wobbling along by himself until he either falls down or somebody picks him up. The real message of the movie is that there is no message. It's a highly ritualized violation of the viewer's expectations of taste. A Halloween prank.What else could it be? It's certainly not a realistic portrayal of a bunch of perverts. Where could they possibly get insurance after the first dozen crashes? And the fear and sexual responses are antagonistic the former mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the latter by the parasympathetic. Somebody who jumps off a cliff might have a spontaneous ejaculation a sympathetic reflex but he's not going to have an erection.I don't mean to pan the movie entirely. Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic. At any randomly chosen moment the screen will show cars on the highway cars crashing people having sex in cars or people talking about cars crashing and people having sex in cars. And it's neatly directed too. What shiny metal and what frangible flesh! Everything but the bodies seem gleaming and cold.My only problem was that I didn't like it. Not my perversion.".

He and the gorgeous Deborah Kay Unger are a couple although not monogamous. Through certain accidents they stumble across a cell of car crash fetishists. More stuff happens I shouldn't get into it. This movie would have been more disturbing if it didn't have such a sense of humor. There is a nasty scene in which Spader is about to rub his willie against a long puckered vaginalike scar on the luscious Roseanna Arquette's leg. She wears an outfit that is a combination of leather bondage gear and handicapped leg braces. A truly weird flick with good sex scenes but not for a first date unless the girl likes SM and looks at copies of that fullcolor British magazine featuring motorcycle racing showing the racers proudly displaying their often horrid scars and injuries. Yikes. Well if you liked Secretary and if you liked Cronenberg's other flicks and his orifice obsession and general grotesqueness you'll like this. It has a similar tone visavis humor as Secretary and some of Videodrome. The title credits are exemplary and some of the shots are marvelous. The scene wherein the camera lovingly rolls over Spader's leg brace after his accident is stunning. I am happy to say that there is no amputation in this flick at least. That would have been too much.".

I keep getting disappointed by some IMDB users.

For example the cute but just cute My Big Fat Greek Wedding was so ridiculously praised that when it was first rated the average was 8.3 Jesus Christ! Hopefully it isn't so high now but yet a 7.1 for just a cute but soooo ordinary movie. Imagine I'm saying that being Greek!".

With Crash Cronenberg pushes us but I don't know what kind of repsonse he was going for.  The story concerns James Ballard and a group of crash enthusiasts.  After his initial crash Ballard meets up with Helen Remington and a mysterious man named Vaughn. Ballard is soon introduced to the strange world of car crashes and the rush of sexual tension. Now I can see where there is a thin line that separates these two acts. Both bring out a strong physical and emotional reaction but the characters in the film are too detached from life. There is sex without pleasure and the only way these people can experience pleasure is through the trauma of an automobile accident.  The film moves along at a leisurely pace and nothing ever really happens.  There is no dramatic need that these characters have to fill.  There is no urgency in their actions and their motivations are clouded by what I interpret as boredom. Cronenberg has done some fine work in the past and I think he'll come along and shock us with a truly original film.  Until then stick with the four I mentioned at the top.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD and it's followup Female Prisoner Scorpion 701's Grudge Song for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji they are each vastly different from the others. The first movie Female Prisoner 701 Scorpion is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing  very reminiscent of the antiheroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. The second movie Female Convict Scorpion Jailhouse 41 is a real tourdeforce. Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam. This movie Female Prisoner Scorpion Beast Stable is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays out as much more of a crime drama. Once again our heroine is on the run. But this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life relatively speaking anyway. She gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside. But of course everything has to unravel eventually. FPS Beast Stable has a more straightforward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end. And don't worry there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie! But I think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for inyourface shock value. Yes there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily. But I didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story well maybe a time or two. One thing I have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued buildup of Scorpion's mythos. With this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We get to see that she is much more than just a stonehearted vengeful badass!As I mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed. It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had a different director. Without giving anything away I want to mention that FPS Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mindblowing trilogy.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in outoftheordinary films. FPS Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a standalone piece as can the first two movies but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.".

Yes there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily. But I didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story well maybe a time or two. One thing I have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued buildup of Scorpion's mythos. With this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We get to see that she is much more than just a stonehearted vengeful badass!As I mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed. It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had a different director. Without giving anything away I want to mention that FPS Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mindblowing trilogy.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in outoftheordinary films. FPS Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a standalone piece as can the first two movies but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.";

	schema:reviewBody "The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation movies and the third masterpiece in a row Joshuu Sasori Kemonobeya aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion Beast Stable aka. Sasori Den Of The Beast where I live of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects but that equals or arguably even surpasses them in brilliance. The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema and all of the films especially the first three uniquely combine Exploitation and Arthouse cinema like no other movie does. Beast Stable is the third and secondtolast Sasori film with Meiko Kaji the last one to be directed by genius director Shunya Ito and in my opinion the greatest of them all. The first film Joshuu 701g Sasori of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of ExploitationArt. In the equally brilliant first sequel Joshuu Sasori Dai41 zakkyob Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third Sasori film Beast Stable keeps up the surrealism allthough not quite to the same extent as the second and features even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics like poverty forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie. This third Sasori film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the generally brilliant cycle to me it's this one with the first one as a close second. Once again Best Stable is both very artistic and very Exploitationlike. The visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty. The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima aka. Sasori. I absolutely worship this wonderful actress and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do so. The rest of the performances are also great especially Mikio Narita is great as a police Inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same throughout all three films with UramiBushi sung by Meiko Kaji herself as the main theme which is great since the score is simply put pure perfection. As its predecessors Beast Stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of ExploitationArt that no serious lover of film can afford to miss. The entire Sasoricycle ranges high on my personal alltime favorite list. Beast Stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Shunya Ito's final entry in the FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION series starring the great Meiko Kaji. The series based on a Japanese manga follows the exploits of a woman unjustly imprisoned brutalized by guards and fellow inmates who defends herself with such aplomb she becomes a jailhouse legend. The other convicts nickname her Sasori which means Scorpion. Over the course of two films she escapes to wreak vengeance against the man who got her busted is sent back for his murder and escapes again the second film ends with Sasori on the loose.This the third film focuses on Sasori's life as a fugitive outside the walls. In an eyeopening first scene Sasori evades detectives on a subway train she comes out of it handcuffed to one of the detectives' arms but not the rest of him. She flees to a slum which consists of a redlight district run by a forcedprostitution ring and a residential area made up of a mud street and shacks where she is put up for the night and befriended by a lonely prostitute named Yuki. We soon discover that Yuki gives of herself on a nightly basis to her braindamaged brother who she keeps locked in a closet. Sasori tries to lead a normal life taking a job as a seamstress and renting her own apartment but she and Yuki soon meet again and are both embroiled in a plot that involves the Cruella De Villefromhell madam who runs the prostitution ring and the detective from the subway Mikio Narita a regular in Kinji Fukasaku films who by God wants his arm back.What follows is an atmospheric noirhorror yarnit takes elements from both and uses them wellthat applies Ito's flair for the visual to a mood that is different from the first two SCORPION films yet bears the same unmistakable signature. A scene involving lit matches falling into a sewer tunnel is especially beautiful. Ito's use of sound like when Sasori is incessantly scraping the handcuffs with the arm against a tombstone in an attempt to free herself is as effective here as ever. He also employs silence more than usual as if by virtue of a newly honed minimalism. This goes along with the relatively subdued tone of the first section of the film which allows space to explore Sasori's and others' characters. Things pick up by the end though it's all handled with a dreamier rhythm than the previous films. This is an asset. Each of the three films has its own style I realize now and seeing this one made me go back and watch the first appreciating it more than before.Meiko Kaji gives her usual amazing performance as Sasori emoting silently standing or moving or pouncing or maiming with a grace that switches seamlessly between human and animal. The pathos present in all three films is largely due to the human side of this grace which never inhibits the films' darker aspects. Reportedly Kaji who did one more SCORPION film after this one had as much to do with developing the character for film as Ito not only in her performances but offcamera as well. This film is a worthy swan song for the collaboration. Very Japanese very seventies very much something else entirely.".

Shinya Ito the director of the first installment returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion Meiko Kaji cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist. She takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother who ends up impregnating her. Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose. She is beaten sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain's lair. I loved everything about this hypnotic nihilistic and emotionally touching movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the Female Scorpion series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. Beast Stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles. The original more or less qualified as a socalled WomeninPrison flick but already an atypical one but you can't possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls. And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well. The first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic. Don't let this last description discourage you however as Beast Stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance. The opening sequence for example is downright fantastic. Sasori still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there's no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her. Her run through the city with the cutoff arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold! The story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new types of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing atelier. Her own retarded brother ! impregnates the prostitute while Sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network. She cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile the onearmed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against Sasori. Our multitalented director Shunya Ito formidably crisscrosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style. Beast Stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing. Those who know Sasori's character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with Meiko Kaji's wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces. There's very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words. In fact I think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far. My only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage. That bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.".

Matsu is still her usual quiet self albeit with a few more lines than normal and the men are still complete scumbags.

She soon finds herself in a situation defending herself and two prostitutes against a local gangs and violence obviously ensues.So is it actually any good? For most part yes yes it is. The pacing is definitely slower but works well with its new rhythm. It just that it really does not go anywhere with all its character development that fills the first half and the carnage that ensues does not the fun spirit of its predecessors. Its still a very colorful and stylish film with some really memorable scenes but it leaves you wondering why such an otherwise energetic trilogy had to end on a period and not the exclamation point that its avid fans had all been expecting.610".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel Jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima a.k.a. Scorpion and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother ... while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best.The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. From there however the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. That's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action  Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. There's a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. Overall I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality  not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.".

The series' star Meiko Kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment Grudge Song directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock Sex Hunter. The original Female Prisoner 701 Scorpion is one of my alltime favorites. The sequel Jailhouse 41 is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series and I might agree I think if it ever gets a better release on DVD the original by Image is very poor. Beast Stable in my opinion is nearly as good as FP701. It's much slower much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and nastiness but there's more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori Kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off  and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed! and hooks up with a freelance prostitute Yuki. Yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofylooking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story which is never resolved it heartbreaking. The images are startling and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series. This is an awesome film.".

However when the local prostitution ring gives poor little Yuki a very hard time our silent heroine decides to seek revenge and in doing so reveals her whereabouts to the law.Judging by IMDb's current rating 7.6 out of 10 and some glowing comments by trusted prolific authors I expected to have my socks blown clean off by Female Prisoner Scorpion Beast Stable. Indeed the first few minutes in which protagonist Nami Matsushima hacks off Kondo's arm which is handcuffed to her and proceeds to leg it with the severed limb dangling from her wrist did just that I paused the DVD to pop them back on.Unfortunately however the remainder of the film proved to be far less impressive never matching the sheer audacity of the opening scene. Sure director Shunya Ito comes close with some exploitative moments including incestuous sex between Yuki and her retarded brother and a nasty forced abortion but for the most part Beast Stable is rather boring being very slow in the telling and uneventful for long stretches.The film is of course very stylish and always good to look at the stunning lead actresses certainly help there with Watanabe obligingly getting her kit off a few times but compared with parts one and two this third outing for Scorpion is a tad disappointing.".

Based on the manga by Toru Shinohara it's the seminal Women in Prison movie franchise although you wouldn't immediately guess the subgenre based on this third film alone.Unlike the first film an entertaining exploitation sleazefest or the second the quasifeminist trippy road film the third one is a lot more serious and quite darker than the first two. The pacing is much slower the colors much dimmer and the setting is mostly urban except for the final 10 minutes which do take place in prison.Once again Meiko Kaji barely says anything on her request because she felt that her character in the first film was too obscene but still has a great screen presence. The story is unfortunately not that memorable. Aside from exploitative elements such as a prostitute pregnant with her retarded brother's child the entire film just feels like it packs lesser of a punch than the first two did. There's an interesting subplot where a guy blackmails Matsu into being his girlfriend or else he'll turn her in but that gets resolved way too quickly. The main villain is fine but the other one the exinmate turned brothel owner and a Cruella DeVille lookalike is so ridiculous and annoying. She also keeps a huge cage of crows for some reason which later gives way for a short but bad visual effect of a flying crow maybe to resemble a comic book villain but that feels out of place.The surreal elements are also fewer. Even though the abortion scene set in a white room with blood splattering all over is very good the others consist of applying lazy filters to the image or focusing on the motif of matches being struck and thrown which I admittedly don't get. Unfortunately Meiko Kaji doesn't sing a second theme song here like she did in the previous film and overall the movie just feels uneventful despite the strong beginning and a stylish ending scene. Great cover art though.".

The Scorpion series shows some significant changes each time but they all have the same sort of appeal. The second film already got rid of the prison setting for the most part and this time we don't even visit the cold walls until the very end. The change of atmosphere seems vital but it's not without any risks.This one starts off with the best opening so far. An impressive and rather hilarious start certainly triggers your excitement muscle. Watching Matsu run down the street with a dismembered arm dangling from her wrist while listening to the lovely soundtrack still 'Song of Vengeance' is pure gold. I even dare to go as far as to say it's one of the coolest scenes ever.But stick around because there's a lot more to come. Introducing various subjects such as prostitution rape incest and of course murder. It's a compelling bunch of problems which definitely gives 'Beast Stable' some new ingredients to cook with.It has some great writing keeping you hooked non stop. The environmental changes are perfectly timed switching from parts in the gloomy city to dirty sewers and even jail. It will take you all over the place. Of course drenched with a stylish sauce. Probably not even close to the crazy ideas in the first and mainly second film but the almost of course relatively subtle approach feels spot on at all times.Matsu remains unforgettable and she makes me beg for more and more. I still have Grudge's Song to go so I'll be seeing plenty of her later on. I shouldn't forget the 'Stray Cat' films she's in and of course Lady Snowblood. Damn I've got so much to look forward to!I've said it all I guess. It's becoming hard to come up with new complementing words for every brilliant Scorpion film. Let's hope the fourth one is as good as all of Ito's work. But I guess Hasebe should be capable of pulling it off. Let's keep some fingers and possibly all other body parts crossed because I can only hope for a happy finish.".

That is reasonable though certainly not the unanimous view. At this point in the series Scorpion is barely even a prison convict and we can no longer say this is a women in prison film really that only happened in the first.This film has its ups and downs and I suppose if you watched the first two you should probably watch the third.

Hell hath no fury like Scorpion and a determined detective GondoMikio Narita seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her will do whatever it takes..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereaboutsto catch Nami. Nami finds an ally in hooker YukiYayoi Watanabe who provides her a temporary shelter. Yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of him..in a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides his sexual needs!..she in actuality keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets! Meanwhile Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own..she works as a sewer and he threatens to turn her into the authorities..Nami was an escaped convict who fled a subway from the copsif she doesn't supply him sexual favors. His wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body resulting in death  the prostitution clan come looking for Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. That's when KatsuReisen Lee the pimp's lover and confidant realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers Scorpion. Subduing her with an injected liquid drug placing her in a bird cage! Katsu embellishes in her imprisonment. What ultimately fuels Nami's rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced lateterm abortion left to bleed to death. Finding a scalpel clutched in her hand..from the operation room Nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker's death. The series of scalpel murders provide Gondo with an opportunity to catch Nami and he'll trap her in the underground sewers below the city but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to her aid?Trust me when I say there was no shackles binding director Shunya Ito or his filmmaking team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPIONBEAST STABLE is yet another perverse deranged and ultraviolent entry in the very entertaining series. Equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways Ito pulls you right..or he did meinto the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen. When you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your antiheroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man's severed arm handcuffed to her the viewer has to know what they're in for! The incestuous subplot is simply bizarre..and it's shot in a softcore way with the retarded brother humping his numb cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead! and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through. But the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for Nami's revenge..despite Nami's imperfect ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa. Interesting angle with Detective Gondo as well. Gondo is willing to break the rules and he becomes a forceofnature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy. His fate at the end visiting another enemy of Nami's in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining. The scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags in various places the blades protruding from flesh with Nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic book adventure there's a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws. I imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPIONBEAST STABLE is..specifically how Nami is able to escape capture time and time again accomplishing her goals of revenge paying back all those who have wronged her but I looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80's films and enjoyed it for what it was. As always this film features some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavies. Meiko Kaji almost always reservedquiet yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine form..in more ways than oneand Reisen Lee as her crosseyed repugnant adversary runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment..when both are in prison Nami's ways of torturing her are sweet. My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering Gondo's rotted severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it!".

Things look up when Mike literally bumps into 10year old shoplifter Kristina Vidalwho Mike sees as a possible gold mine for their agency and does manage to get her a lucrative commercial deal as cookie salesgirl. This movie is watchable thanks to a charming performance by Fox who imbues his own experience as a former child star into this character and this performance. It's very sad whenever you watch Mike go into one of his stories about his days on the sitcom and how whoever he's sharing it with looks completely bored. Lane offers comic relief as Mike's brother and Cyndi Lauper steals every scene she is in as the agency's receptionist. There are also some laughoutloud hysterical sequences of children with varying levels of talent auditioning for the agency. Between these scenes and Fox's performance this film can hold your interest.".

He also lives in a messy apartment appears to be a heavy smoker and has missed out on a lot of education from his childhood due to his stardom. His adult life is a wreck.One day Michael is pickpocketed by a young girl Angie. He sees her again later and she appears to have been caught attempting to pickpocket somebody else. At this point she bursts into tears and blurts out some dramatic dribble about her family winning the sympathy of passersby. Michael witnesses her performance and tells her that she could use her acting skills to become wealthy.Later we discover that Angie does in fact have domestic problems. Her mother is dead and her father is at a rehabilitation centre. She has to live with her older sister and her boyfriend who push her aside and do not take good care of her at all. Angie decides to go and live with Michael giving him the responsibility of taking care of her.This film has its high points and low points. It appealed to me because Michael J. Fox Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are in it. It was lovely to see these familiar faces and they each gave a good performance. However the plot itself was a bit allovertheplace. It is difficult to give the full summary of what happens but I think that Michael's responsibility for Angie is where the majority of the plot lies. I also found some scenes in this film painfully cheesy. The happy birthday scenes the auditions and the wrestling scene in particular were a bit of a letdown for me.Overall I think this film is alright. It's not exactly a mustsee film but hey you might enjoy some of it.".

	schema:headline " Not a great film but has a certain charm if you're in an undemanding mood";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Chapman is a washed up child star who now runs an agency representing child talent  albeit without a great deal of success.  When Michael has his wallet stolen by a street urchin he chases her until a crowd surrounds the young thief.  Seeing Angie turn on the waterworks and con her victims with a performance of woe he sees her as a potential actress. Signing her as a client he gets her an important audition which she wins with her mix of refreshing honesty and directness.  However her background is not clear and it is apparent that she'll be a lot harder work that any of the firm's other clientsI came to this film with no idea what it was about but just that it had Michael J Fox in it and maybe that was worth a look.  The plot is a little cutesy and doesn't make any logical sense whatsoever but that doesn't matter too much.  Nor is it very funny it has moments which are funny the auditions are good or characters which bring a bit of life into it The Cereal King is great fun but mostly it just ambles along easily enough. Part of the reason for this is that it does have a certain amount of harmless charm which is easy going and not a problem for anyone!  What I mean is if you're in a relaxed undemanding mood then this film has just enough charm to cover it's weaknesses and you may like it.Credit for much of this charm must go to the cast and in particular the main couple of leads.  Fox is not great but he is OK he doesn't try very hard and seems to relax into the movie which I felt kind of encouraged the audience to do the same.  Supporting him is a great little performance from Vidal.   Before I realised where I knew her face from I was thinking to myself that she would make a great actress when she gets older.  However if Taina is anything to go by she has just kept doing the same role as an adult!  The support cast is great and features plenty of funny kids as well as quite a few well known adults including Lane pretty funny Lauper although God knows why Krumholtz and Garber.Overall this is NOT a very good film.  It isn't very funny and it's plot is so obvious and weak that you wonder if one of the children in the cast couldn't have helped make it a bit stronger!  However it does have an easy charm about it and while not being great fun is amusing in it's own way and maybe worth a watch on a lazy evening.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michael Chapman is a washed up child star who now runs an agency representing child talent  albeit without a great deal of success.  When Michael has his wallet stolen by a street urchin he chases her until a crowd surrounds the young thief.  Seeing Angie turn on the waterworks and con her victims with a performance of woe he sees her as a potential actress. Signing her as a client he gets her an important audition which she wins with her mix of refreshing honesty and directness.  However her background is not clear and it is apparent that she'll be a lot harder work that any of the firm's other clientsI came to this film with no idea what it was about but just that it had Michael J Fox in it and maybe that was worth a look.  The plot is a little cutesy and doesn't make any logical sense whatsoever but that doesn't matter too much.  Nor is it very funny it has moments which are funny the auditions are good or characters which bring a bit of life into it The Cereal King is great fun but mostly it just ambles along easily enough. Part of the reason for this is that it does have a certain amount of harmless charm which is easy going and not a problem for anyone!  What I mean is if you're in a relaxed undemanding mood then this film has just enough charm to cover it's weaknesses and you may like it.Credit for much of this charm must go to the cast and in particular the main couple of leads.  Fox is not great but he is OK he doesn't try very hard and seems to relax into the movie which I felt kind of encouraged the audience to do the same.  Supporting him is a great little performance from Vidal.   Before I realised where I knew her face from I was thinking to myself that she would make a great actress when she gets older.  However if Taina is anything to go by she has just kept doing the same role as an adult!  The support cast is great and features plenty of funny kids as well as quite a few well known adults including Lane pretty funny Lauper although God knows why Krumholtz and Garber.Overall this is NOT a very good film.  It isn't very funny and it's plot is so obvious and weak that you wonder if one of the children in the cast couldn't have helped make it a bit stronger!  However it does have an easy charm about it and while not being great fun is amusing in it's own way and maybe worth a watch on a lazy evening.";

	schema:headline " One of the last great slashers of the eighties!";
	schema:reviewBody "INTRUDER is without a doubt one of the last great slashers from the genre's peak decade. Scott Spiegel had been a friend of both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell since hi school and had also worked with them on most of their early movies actually cowriting the script for EVIL DEAD 2. For his Directorial debut he roped in his old friends Placing Raimi in one of his only starring roles. Unfortunately Campbell only managed a small cameo appearance maybe it was because he was busy with that other great genre piece from the same year MANIAC COP. The movie suffered harshly under the censors surprisingly more so in the States than at home here in the UK. Although this BBFC certificated print was still missing well over five minutes of footage. There are uncut copies of the movie floating about but they are in fact so rare that I haven't yet managed to track one down.It tells the story of a group of teenage workers at a convenience store that have been told that they will soon be losing their jobs due to the fact that the business is losing money and has to close it's doors for good. The night crew are asked to stay late and begin pricing down the stock so that it can be sold at a discount. Cashier Jennifer Elizabeth Cox is already on edge because her exboyfriend Craig Danny Byrnes has just been released from prison for manslaughter and keeps hassling her. He has already kicked off with one of the store managers Bill Sam Raimi and has threatened to return. As the workers settle in to their late night shifts it seems that a certain unseen someone is butchering the employees one by one in gruesome and merciless ways. Whoever is behind the remorseless murders is saving poor unfortunate Jennifer for last orders. Will she realise that there's a maniac at work before she becomes chopped meat like the rest of her workmates?Castwise INTRUDER doesn't work as well as it should have. Cox doesn't manage to convince as the heroine and I believe things would have been better if leading lady duties were handed over to Charlie and Emilio's younger sister Renee Estevez who gave a brief performance as a cashier. But Sam Raimi doesn't disappoint in his rare starring role and we have the great but somewhat short cameos from Campbell and Alvy Moore. Lawrence Bender produced and cowrote the screenplay before going on to find success a few years later with RESERVOIR DOGS. Actually Spiegel is the one who introduced Quentin Tarantino to Bender who went ahead and got the movie made. Quentin returned the favour by crediting the writerdirector with starting his career.  Where this movie really manages to shine is in the excellent direction. Taking a leaf from his old friend's book Scott keeps things lively with some zany and interesting camera positions and shots. Although his brave and innovative effort may not appeal to every viewer you can't help but merit his ingenuity. The dark scenes are satisfactorily lighted and he manages to keep a strong enough pace running throughout. The final chases towards the end get pretty tense and the final plot twist satisfies although it had already been done to similar effect in weaker efforts EDGE OF THE AXE and THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD. The characters are likeable enough if not greatly acted and the plot doesn't waste time to introduce brutality as the major attribute.  Although this version may indeed be heavily edited it's still pretty gory and luckily for us the censors weren't as scissor happy' as they have been in the past with other attempts. Although you'll probably guess the silhouetted killer's identity early on some releases even have his picture on the cover it really doesn't spoil things too much and there's enough fun to be had with the imaginative murders and suspenseful pacing. INTRUDER manages not to overuse the relevant clichs and can't help but entertain for it's ninety minute runtime. It's Stylishly directed with a decent score some innovative murders and a likeable if not overly talented cast. Although further success hasn't found Spiegel as easily as it found Raimi no one can deny this entry into our favourite subgenre is easily one of the best. If you can get hold of the uncut copy then add a star to the score below if not still try your best to seek out this movie. If only for the reason that along with MANIAC COP it remains one of the last great slasher movies to come out of the eighties. Recommended wholeheartedly to all genre fans".

Lawrence Bender produced and cowrote the screenplay before going on to find success a few years later with RESERVOIR DOGS. Actually Spiegel is the one who introduced Quentin Tarantino to Bender who went ahead and got the movie made. Quentin returned the favour by crediting the writerdirector with starting his career.  Where this movie really manages to shine is in the excellent direction. Taking a leaf from his old friend's book Scott keeps things lively with some zany and interesting camera positions and shots. Although his brave and innovative effort may not appeal to every viewer you can't help but merit his ingenuity. The dark scenes are satisfactorily lighted and he manages to keep a strong enough pace running throughout. The final chases towards the end get pretty tense and the final plot twist satisfies although it had already been done to similar effect in weaker efforts EDGE OF THE AXE and THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD. The characters are likeable enough if not greatly acted and the plot doesn't waste time to introduce brutality as the major attribute.  Although this version may indeed be heavily edited it's still pretty gory and luckily for us the censors weren't as scissor happy' as they have been in the past with other attempts. Although you'll probably guess the silhouetted killer's identity early on some releases even have his picture on the cover it really doesn't spoil things too much and there's enough fun to be had with the imaginative murders and suspenseful pacing. INTRUDER manages not to overuse the relevant clichs and can't help but entertain for it's ninety minute runtime. It's Stylishly directed with a decent score some innovative murders and a likeable if not overly talented cast. Although further success hasn't found Spiegel as easily as it found Raimi no one can deny this entry into our favourite subgenre is easily one of the best. If you can get hold of the uncut copy then add a star to the score below if not still try your best to seek out this movie. If only for the reason that along with MANIAC COP it remains one of the last great slasher movies to come out of the eighties. Recommended wholeheartedly to all genre fans";

It makes up for its lack of originality with some good performances and a helluva lot of style including unconventional camerawork which Spiegel is clearly in love with and brutal gore. Intruder is especially good considering its late entry into the slasher pantheon and actually manages to recapture a lot of the stylistic and structural panache of its early '80s predecessors. It graciously avoids the kliegdrenched hackneyed and tongueincheek approach of its contemporaries and instead uses murky tints and plays it straight and without airs.

	schema:reviewBody "OK first off I have a big problem with the box of this flick. I don't know if it's the same for all the various releases but you see who the killer is right on the freakin' cover. Not that this was a suspense bonanza or anything...but come on! Also they try to hook you with from the maker's of Evil Dead 2 splashed across the top. I think they had the same caterer. Sure you got Sam and Ted Raimi Dan Hicks the unlucky hillbilly bastard from ED2 and Bruce Campbell...but don't be fooled this is NOT Evil Dead 2.I think It was half way through the film before they even started naming the characters. I was overjoyed when they did it was an anchor in a sea of chaos. The pacing on this movie wasn't exactly great. There's a lot of pointless unnamed character interaction before you get to the actual intruding. Although...come to think of it once you get to the actual intruding...I found myself waxing poetic over the pointless interaction of the first half. You get a peek into the everyday life of Walnut Lake. A place where shutting down a grocery store totally bones up the lives of all the people working there. I got the impression these kids weren't exactly going to Walnut Lake Community College Go Beavers!.As the movie hobbled on I began to wonder if the Intruder wasn't some faceless psycho we had yet to see but the intrusion of a City Run Grocery Store into the lives of these humble cashiers and stockers. Wow what an interesting subject for a short film...and then I could see why they packaged it as a horror film playing up the Evil Dead involvement...a ploy sure but a good way to attract attention to Independent Film...and then the I saw the one cashier get knifed in the parking lot and shot that theory all to poop.So basically what we got here is a slasher movie. With the ohsonauseating camera tricks of Scott Spiegel...who apparently wants to oneup Sam Raimi so bad he doesn't care what it does to his lame ass movies. In a related note avoid Dusk til Dawn 2 like the plague. They're weak and detract from the already dubious quality of the film. Everyone gets wiped out pretty quick during the rest of the film removing any real shock value. For some reason Ted Raimi's character Produce Joe is listening to Muzak on his headphones...over and over again which I woulda thought might make him the prime candidate for the Intruder role. Also in one scene I found an interesting metaphor. Wherein the INTRUDER used Junk Food Breakfast cereals to hide our for lack of a better word Heroine uses Wheat Germ to defeat him. Is Spiegel attempting to smuggle in a health conscious message? Maybe I'm just thinking too hard. Also...once we know who the Killer is which we do because we looked at the cover of the BOX! Isn't he more an Infiltrator than an Intruder? Food for thought.So we have to wait for the end of the movie to see Bruce Campbell...but I guess that's better than blowing it all at the start. There is a ... neat little twist at the end. Which actually left me satisfied...because...none of the characters were remotely likable except for Bruce's cop..and what do I care if the killer gets away. Oops. forgot watch out for Spoilers. Peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time Intruder was released the slasher craze that dominated the early to mid80's was pretty much over. The market had been so saturated with this genre especially the DTV market that so many that were being released were just clones of various predecessors and not very good ones. Films like The Last Slumber Party and Killer Workout highlighted what went wrong with the genre during this time filmmakers had become lazy. Anyone thought they could make a slasher flick and what resulted were films that were full of clichs bad acting and awful production values. Besides diehard horror fans most lost interest in the genre.But in 1989 Intruder came along. And while it has its clichs and other flaws it stood out simply because we could tell that true effort was put into the film. It looks good there is some great inspired moments of direction the acting is decent the atmosphere foreboding and the gore effects extremely impressive. All of this on top of a setting not seen in a horror film beforea grocery storeelevated it into one of the best slasher flicks of the 80's.The plot involves a group of workers at a local grocery store who are told that the store is closing and that that night will be there last being employed. This causes a few grumbles on top of the fact that one of the clerk's Elizabeth Cox boyfriend who was just released from jail for manslaughter showed up to harass her. He is quickly ejected from the store though not without a fight. However after the store officially closes it doesn't take long for an unknown intruder to begin butchering the crew in very very very brutal ways. The film is extremely graphic and contains probably two of the most graphic death scenes of any slasher from the 80'sone involving a trash compacter and one involving a meat slicer. As disturbing and noteworthy as they are the deaths are not even the best thing about this film. Spiegel obviously is a fan of the genre and his direction illustrates this. He knows how to build tension and implements some pretty creative camera angles. That foreboding atmosphere that is created is incredibly creepy and the soundtrack certainly adds to the dark isolated setting of the supermarket. The film never manages any real jumps or scares but still creates a uncomfortable dirty feeling that is almost just as frightening. The pace is fast the acting decent though I would have preferred Renee Estevez cast as the lead as she was the stronger actress and was definitely underused.My only gripe with this film is the last 15 minutes or so. Once the killer is revealed Spiegel abandons the creepy unsettling tone that he tried so hard to successfully create and the film adopts a lighter almost comical tone. The killer makes some wisecracks that are completely unnecessary and the film almost loses its effectiveness. The ending also tries to be unconventional but comes of as unbelievable and again abandons the horror aspect of the film.This film is a must see for slasher fans and is truly a great ride. It has aged pretty well and truly is one of the best slasher films not only of the 80's but possibly of all time.My Grade A".

	schema:headline " Arguably the best slasher of the late eighties";
	schema:reviewBody "In the words of Andy Warhol every decade creates its own individual social characteristics. Even though perhaps there has been little cultural invention during the last twenty years the tail end of the twentieth century was an era of creation within the entertainment industry. The fifties will always be remembered for the birth of rock and roll whilst The Beatles Bob Dylan and the introduction of the 'make love not war' antiVietnam mentality of youth signified the cultural identity of the sixties. The vivid images of white suited medallion sporting men and disco divas became synonymous with the seventies but it was the eighties that will be remembered for generating the most generational landmarks. The slasher genre also played a part in defining the personality of that era and despite the invasion of titles during the postScream outbreak of the late nineties there will never be a time that can compete with the genre's initial overkill period. The eighties began with a bang for slasher enthusiasts with the notorious kill her mommy lines of Friday the 13th and despite a fall in popularity studios were still producing cycle entries consistently throughout the final years. The decade also closed strongly with this excellent and bizarrely overlooked slasher movie from Scott Spiegel. Released towards the end of 1989 Intruder tells the tale of a group of night staff in a super market that are asked to work through the night pricing down items as they all have been made redundant due to the closure of the store. As they lock the shutters for the last time it becomes apparent that an unwelcome guest has crept in amongst them. Before long the staff are being killed one by one by an unseen maniac. In film as in life timing is everything. Whether it be the comedic timing of a screen joker or the understanding of the span of suspense by a director the clock can be a vital tool in the creation of cinematic perfection. The reason I write this is because as it stands Intruder is an obscure slasher movie that is highly regarded by those that have seen it. If however it had been released eight years earlier I would be writing the review of a horror classic. Spiegel's opus has enough wit gore audacity and creativity to be ranked amongst the best of its ilk. If Sam Raimi's adventurous direction makes him the outlaw of Hollywood sensibility then Scott Spiegel should be Billy the Kid. The Jesse James of eccentric cinematic vision. Here is a man whose modus operandi seems to be to imagine the most audacious and outrageous camera angle possible and then in the same breath attempt to shoot it. Although much like mayonnaise on chips you'll either love his flamboyant approach or hate it kudos should be given for his brazen audacity and outlandish vision. The movie is a pieeating contest of slasher clichs which add up to a megafeast of tongueincheek overindulgence that leaves you begging for more after the final curtain. The gore is Intruder's biggest selling point. Heads get lopped off crushed and sawed in half and much like the work of Fulci everything is filmed in loving closeup. A movie can sometimes become an extension of the filmmaker's personality and having watched Scott Spiegel's interviews many times this his signature feature is truly a case in point. It's a shame that such a modest downtoearth and clearly talented director has never reached the heights of his highschool buddies Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.Paramount Studios the enemy of all gore hounds after their stringent censorship of countless genre classics  were responsible for changing the name of Intruder from the much better Night Crew The Final Checkout and their VHS release also characteristically cut out all the gore. The first print I watched was the BBFC's rated version which in all fairness was still a wellproduced and competent slasher but the uncut print is the real gem. Obviously Spiegel's effort is no Halloween and it's something that the director is modestly aware of. But if you asked me to pick the best ten  hell best five  genre classics Intruder would certainly be amongst them somewhere alongside Carpenter's seminal favourite. Very few know that Intruder is a remake of an old Spiegel 8mm feature that he shot during the early eighties titled Night Crew. Credit has to be given to Lawrence Bender's slick production skills which turned an equally gory but ultimately mediocre Halloweenclone into a standout slasher classic. The film would be a learning curve for Bender who would go on  through Spiegel's introduction  to become one of the most important producers of the last twenty years. It's strange to think that this lowbudget stalk and slash flick would be the first step on the career that would launch upon us Quentin Tarantino and a host of Hollywood hits including Good Will Hunting. OK so the cast were never going to turn up at the academy awards but they do a good enough job and a nod to Sam Raimi who delivers a highly committed performance. The conclusion has been seen before in both Pranks and Edge of the Axe although it's more thank likely coincidental and it's handled slightly differently here. There's also a decent whodunit plot running which is stupidly ruined by packaging on many versions that gives away the killer's identity on the front cover! But thankfully the film is no mysterythriller and it stays true to its slasher roots.Intruder is by far one of the best slasher movies of the eighties and should be a member of every avid fan's collection. The movie mixes black humour and gruesome slaughter outstandingly well and is an excellent example of the genre at its best.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the words of Andy Warhol every decade creates its own individual social characteristics. Even though perhaps there has been little cultural invention during the last twenty years the tail end of the twentieth century was an era of creation within the entertainment industry. The fifties will always be remembered for the birth of rock and roll whilst The Beatles Bob Dylan and the introduction of the 'make love not war' antiVietnam mentality of youth signified the cultural identity of the sixties. The vivid images of white suited medallion sporting men and disco divas became synonymous with the seventies but it was the eighties that will be remembered for generating the most generational landmarks. The slasher genre also played a part in defining the personality of that era and despite the invasion of titles during the postScream outbreak of the late nineties there will never be a time that can compete with the genre's initial overkill period. The eighties began with a bang for slasher enthusiasts with the notorious kill her mommy lines of Friday the 13th and despite a fall in popularity studios were still producing cycle entries consistently throughout the final years. The decade also closed strongly with this excellent and bizarrely overlooked slasher movie from Scott Spiegel. Released towards the end of 1989 Intruder tells the tale of a group of night staff in a super market that are asked to work through the night pricing down items as they all have been made redundant due to the closure of the store. As they lock the shutters for the last time it becomes apparent that an unwelcome guest has crept in amongst them. Before long the staff are being killed one by one by an unseen maniac. In film as in life timing is everything. Whether it be the comedic timing of a screen joker or the understanding of the span of suspense by a director the clock can be a vital tool in the creation of cinematic perfection. The reason I write this is because as it stands Intruder is an obscure slasher movie that is highly regarded by those that have seen it. If however it had been released eight years earlier I would be writing the review of a horror classic. Spiegel's opus has enough wit gore audacity and creativity to be ranked amongst the best of its ilk. If Sam Raimi's adventurous direction makes him the outlaw of Hollywood sensibility then Scott Spiegel should be Billy the Kid. The Jesse James of eccentric cinematic vision. Here is a man whose modus operandi seems to be to imagine the most audacious and outrageous camera angle possible and then in the same breath attempt to shoot it. Although much like mayonnaise on chips you'll either love his flamboyant approach or hate it kudos should be given for his brazen audacity and outlandish vision. The movie is a pieeating contest of slasher clichs which add up to a megafeast of tongueincheek overindulgence that leaves you begging for more after the final curtain. The gore is Intruder's biggest selling point. Heads get lopped off crushed and sawed in half and much like the work of Fulci everything is filmed in loving closeup. A movie can sometimes become an extension of the filmmaker's personality and having watched Scott Spiegel's interviews many times this his signature feature is truly a case in point. It's a shame that such a modest downtoearth and clearly talented director has never reached the heights of his highschool buddies Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.Paramount Studios the enemy of all gore hounds after their stringent censorship of countless genre classics  were responsible for changing the name of Intruder from the much better Night Crew The Final Checkout and their VHS release also characteristically cut out all the gore. The first print I watched was the BBFC's rated version which in all fairness was still a wellproduced and competent slasher but the uncut print is the real gem.

You can argue that such films as Evil Dead are low budget but they don't have the amateur quality to them I'm speaking about. In this film a grocery clerk's exboyfriend shows up to harass her. After the store closes people begin dying off one by one. Is it the boyfriend? With notable appearances by the Evil Dead alumni Bruce Cambell Sam Raimi Ted Raimi Scott Spiegel and Danny Hicks. What a lineup! The film has its flaws. I mean it's a very amateur movie so the music is just awful how long can the produce guy listen to the same song?. Not sure where the regular composer was this day. The acting is decent but iffy and the overall feel is of a cheap and predictable film.But that is ignorable. The unique camera angles let you know you're working with a Raimi posse member. You won't find shots like these in anything else except maybe an M. Night Shymalan film and in that case maybe he owes someone a thank you. And the deaths are of a kind you won't find in your average slasher film a simple grocery store is taken to new depths.Nice product placement for Adidas Meister Brau and Diet Pepsi. Too bad they didn't actually get the money for doing that. And an excellent reuse of the monologue from Raising Arizona about the head and sandwich. The RaimiCoen connection is strengthened.If you liked the dark humor of the other Raimi projects you'll love this. Scott Spiegel does not have the name recognition he deserves showing us here he is just as able as the big boys to step up to the plate for a low budget horror comedy thriller.".

Don't get me wrong this movie was a total blast and very satisfying for someone who spends most of their time in a grocery store but I was very disappointed to see that Bruce Campbell was only in the film for about 2 minutes at the very end. The movie was good but that really let me down.The acting isn't great but it doesn't really have to be because this is your typical 80's slasher and I thought Sam and Ted Raimi were awesome in their roles. The same pretty much goes for the story but there are very few slashers that have well thought out story lines so I think it's pretty much fine. So what do you ask can make up for a movie with okay acting and a weak story? The gore of course! The gore in this film is great. I don't want to give the creative deaths away but you'll have to check it out for yourself.If anyone reading this happens to work in a grocery store they absolutely need to see movie for the experience.

The movie unfortunately was not scary but don't dismay the movie has a special charm that will most likely keep you horror fan happy.Bruce Campbell is in the movie for a total of about 2 minutes so even though it says his name on the cover...don't buyrent it because of him.

	schema:headline " This is awful but has ONE classic death scene!";
	schema:reviewBody "I rented this one on the basis that it has some pretty good reviews overall and the Evil Dead 2 connection the ONLY good film to come out of RaimiSpiegelCampbell.It was to say the least a great disappointment. I could tell from the opening shot of the moon which lasts about 5 minutes while the credits roll that this was going to be bad. I mean they could have zoomed in or cut to something else or anything! Still I gave it the benefit of the doubt but then we are introduced to the characters and you can immediately see the tackiness of the film. The dialogue is painful the acting is worse. All the characters' personalities blend into one and most of them look the same not just the Raimi brothers making it impossible to give two hoots about any of them and thus taking most of the enjoyment out of their death scenes.Straight off it tries to be funny but fails as an old man lifts up his bag of shopping  then surprise!  the bag splits and his shopping falls on the floor. Hilarious. Another example of this fine comedy script is when the police officers finally turn up and one of them says Here take my card....oh no that's not my card. Then he pulls out a new card That's my card yeah ha ha. Oh dear oh dear do you see what I mean?! And people like this!??! I think I know why this has a relatively good rating  It's because gorehounds will give 1010 for any kind of film that has gore in it irrespective of poor scriptactingfilmmaking etcetera this is how I explain the unrealistically high rating for Lucio Fulci's Godawful movies and other European tripe like the Demons films Now don't get me wrong I like slashers Black Christmas Nightmare on Elm Street Blood and Black Lace What Have They Done to your Daughters I am a big horror fan and I love Evil Dead II. But this is pure trash.The only bits worth watching are the gore scenes  which come in quite late in the movie. We see a spike through an eyeball So how is the same thing in Zombie Flesh Eaters still cut in th UK?!! a headcrushing scene which is nice and I must admit one of the most enjoyable death scenes committed to celluloid along with the death of Tina in Nightmare on Elm Street and Capt. Rhodes in Day of the Dead when a guy has is face cut in half with a saw.The effects aren't as realistic as in those two films just mentioned or even as good as the ones in Evil Dead II but more akin to the rubberfoam FX in Bad Taste. Still enjoyable all the same. However the total of about 2 minutes worth of gore does in no way justify the tripe that is the rest of the movie. Like the badly done intentional 'scares'  at one point one of the characters turns around and the film cuts to a close up of a magazine with Sting on the cover. I could have passed this off as one of the 'jokes' but Spiegel cuts to exactly the same shot later in the film!! Why?!! It's not hard to work out who the killer is and the 'surprise' ending is just done so badly it made me hate this film even more.At the end of the day you're either going to avoid this film or watch it just for the gore  but expect the worst!".

	onyx:emotionText "I rented this one on the basis that it has some pretty good reviews overall and the Evil Dead 2 connection the ONLY good film to come out of RaimiSpiegelCampbell.It was to say the least a great disappointment. I could tell from the opening shot of the moon which lasts about 5 minutes while the credits roll that this was going to be bad. I mean they could have zoomed in or cut to something else or anything! Still I gave it the benefit of the doubt but then we are introduced to the characters and you can immediately see the tackiness of the film. The dialogue is painful the acting is worse. All the characters' personalities blend into one and most of them look the same not just the Raimi brothers making it impossible to give two hoots about any of them and thus taking most of the enjoyment out of their death scenes.Straight off it tries to be funny but fails as an old man lifts up his bag of shopping  then surprise!  the bag splits and his shopping falls on the floor. Hilarious. Another example of this fine comedy script is when the police officers finally turn up and one of them says Here take my card....oh no that's not my card. Then he pulls out a new card That's my card yeah ha ha. Oh dear oh dear do you see what I mean?! And people like this!??!

	schema:reviewBody "Slasher films in the eighties were a dime a dozen. Some were just carbon copies of more successful franchises IE The Burning. Some were bloated gimmicky sequels to a surprising success IE Friday the 13th Part III  And finally some offered an interesting take on the genre rather than just duplicating it. However some of those films ended up lost in the shuffle only to be discovered and branded with a cult following years later.One of these films happens to be the 1989 Intruder. Written and directed by Scott Spiegel one of the cowriters for Evil Dead II. Spiegel worked along side Sam Raimi one of his closest friends on Evil Dead II and a lot of the Sam Raimi spirit seems to bleed through Intruder. It's gory unapologetic in some of its kills and offers the fastpaced style of storytelling we're so used to horror films. Almost like a so many bodies so little time type motivation.The story is centered around a market which the owners announce will close the following day and that the staff needs to stay late to mark down prices. The central protagonist is Jennifer Cox a young and attractive woman who gets into a fight with her exboyfriend very early in the film. Out of nowhere in the wee hours of the night someone begins to repeatedly kill the workers in the building. The staff doesn't begin to notice until less and less people are in the store. They are clueless confused and trapped.Horror films that center its plot around a claustrophobic place almost always succeed. For now at least. If the setting is utilized appropriately by that I mean making us feel like we're trapped with these characters and the music combines the right level of helplessness and tension the film will most likely achieve its goal. Intruder takes place mostly all in the supermarket. Very few times do we leave to check out the parking lot. These characters are trapped and so are we.Sadly many of the characters are very bland and undeveloped. Except for of course the female lead. Everyone else is just victim to a splatter film. Speaking of a splatter film this one definitely succeeds because it doesn't pull cheap punches. It shows us what we came to see. Remember the original Friday the 13th? Of course it occupied a very good setting and was dripping with unsettling atmosphere but it didn't show us what we wanted. The murders. Intruder at first seems like it's another film that censors its action but in reality it shows us just what we came to see.The ending is not the simple mindless contrivance we've become used to in horror films. No cliffhangers no abruptness to the story no clichs truly an original ending attached to complete a good horror film. What more can you sincerely ask for? Starring Elizabeth Cox Renee Estevez David Byrnes Dan Hicks Sam Raimi and Ted Raimi. Directed by Scott Spiegel.".

	schema:headline " One of the truly great 80's slashers.";
	schema:reviewBody "Intruder is set in Wallnut mini supermarket store where store owners Danny Eugene Robert Glazer  his partner Bill Danny Hicks have decided to sell up after two consecutive years of making a loss they tell the unfortunate night crew that they will be losing their jobs  that they have to stay all night to mark all the products up on the shelves as half price. A young cashier named Jennifer Elizabeth Cox has an unpleasant visit from her violent exboyfriend Craig David Byrnes which turns nasty  the police are called but Craig disappears before they arrive the market is closed for the night  the crew carry on with their work. However someone inside the market is killing everyone off onebyone in a variety of gruesome ways...Originally filmed under the title Night Crew this delightfully gory 80's slasher flick was cowritten  directed by Scott Speigel who played the guy who delivered the bread  got a knife stuck in his back Intruder is surely one of the true slasher greats from the 80's it just ticks all the right boxes with distinction. The script by Speigel  producer Lawrence Bender who played one of the two cops at the end is like a cross between Dawn of the Dead 1978 with it's supermarket setting  Friday the 13th 1980 with it's gory killing of various teens lets be honest here what more do you need for a great horror flick? I mean it's got the isolated location  it's got plenty of victims so the only thing left to wonder about is whether the blood  gore is excessive enough  Intruder passes the test with flying colours as it features some of the greatest  goriest on screen deaths ever in a slasher flick. From people literally having their heads sliced in half with industrial band saws eyes impaled on spikes meat cleavers in heads people hung on meat hooks enough severed limbs to fill a butchers shop  my personal favourite when someone has their head literally squashed to pulp in a trash compactor. I also liked the ending where it seems the bad guy actually gets away with it in a sense. The character's are reasonably likable for a slasher flick the story is decent although I think it spends too much time trying to implicate Craig as the killer so it's not that surprising when it turns out it isn't him. On the negative side I thought the films pace was a bit uneven the first 30 minutes is all setup  noone is killed at all during this period  in fact it's sometimes hard to remember your actually watching a horror film then it bursts into life with a constant stream of gory highly entertaining killings for the next 30 minutes  then for the final 20 it goes into standard stalk  slasher mode as the killer plays a game of cat  mouse with the one surviving teen.Director Speigel does a fine job  injects some life  style into what could have turned out to be a dull film his camera angles are interesting  some of his shots are cool like showing someone on the phone from inside the phone looking up at her the shots from inside a trolley as it is wheeled around the market are fun  there's even a shot from the perspective of a door knob as it's being turned. A visually enjoyable film. Then again shots like those are merely there to fill the time up between the gore effects from the boys from KNB. The murders are all pretty gory  look incredibly good the band saw scene is a real shocker as is the part when the guy has his head crushed by a trash compactor. They are pretty brutal scenes  rank amongst the best deaths ever seen in any slasher film ever. The trailer for Intruder on all the DVD releases contains a bit of extra gore from the scene when the guy is impaled on a meat hook it show's the a closeup of his  chin the hook actually entering it along with a closeup of his face  blood pouring from his mouth. The trailer also features an unaltered shot during the scene when the woman is talking on the phone looking up at her but without the transparent dialler over the screen to signify that we are looking at her from inside the phone itself.It is amazing to think that Intruder had a budget of about 100000 which is frankly peanuts. This looks good with extremely impressive gore effects  is well made the makers certainly got the most out of the meagre budget. Low budget killer doll auteur Charles Band was an executive producer on this  was going to distribute it under his Empire label but that went bankrupt  Paramount picked it up for distribution they cut it down to get an R rating  every gore scene was completely cut or edited in some way so make sure you stay away from that version. The acting is fine Rene Estevez has gone on to star in the political TV drama series The West Wing 1999  2006  is the younger sister of Charlie Sheen  Emilio Estevez. Sam Raimi is an accomplished director in his own right responsible for the Evil Dead  recent Hollywood SpiderMan series of films  Bruce Campbell has a small cameo at the end as a cop.Intruder is one of the very best 80's slasher films it has the gore the isolated location a decent killer some visual style between the killings  is enjoyable on many levels. A must for slasher fans  anyone who likes their films nice  gory the band saw head slicing  trash compactor head crushing scenes are worth the price of rental alone.".

	onyx:emotionText "Intruder is set in Wallnut mini supermarket store where store owners Danny Eugene Robert Glazer  his partner Bill Danny Hicks have decided to sell up after two consecutive years of making a loss they tell the unfortunate night crew that they will be losing their jobs  that they have to stay all night to mark all the products up on the shelves as half price. A young cashier named Jennifer Elizabeth Cox has an unpleasant visit from her violent exboyfriend Craig David Byrnes which turns nasty  the police are called but Craig disappears before they arrive the market is closed for the night  the crew carry on with their work. However someone inside the market is killing everyone off onebyone in a variety of gruesome ways...Originally filmed under the title Night Crew this delightfully gory 80's slasher flick was cowritten  directed by Scott Speigel who played the guy who delivered the bread  got a knife stuck in his back Intruder is surely one of the true slasher greats from the 80's it just ticks all the right boxes with distinction. The script by Speigel  producer Lawrence Bender who played one of the two cops at the end is like a cross between Dawn of the Dead 1978 with it's supermarket setting  Friday the 13th 1980 with it's gory killing of various teens lets be honest here what more do you need for a great horror flick? I mean it's got the isolated location  it's got plenty of victims so the only thing left to wonder about is whether the blood  gore is excessive enough  Intruder passes the test with flying colours as it features some of the greatest  goriest on screen deaths ever in a slasher flick. From people literally having their heads sliced in half with industrial band saws eyes impaled on spikes meat cleavers in heads people hung on meat hooks enough severed limbs to fill a butchers shop  my personal favourite when someone has their head literally squashed to pulp in a trash compactor. I also liked the ending where it seems the bad guy actually gets away with it in a sense. The character's are reasonably likable for a slasher flick the story is decent although I think it spends too much time trying to implicate Craig as the killer so it's not that surprising when it turns out it isn't him. On the negative side I thought the films pace was a bit uneven the first 30 minutes is all setup  noone is killed at all during this period  in fact it's sometimes hard to remember your actually watching a horror film then it bursts into life with a constant stream of gory highly entertaining killings for the next 30 minutes  then for the final 20 it goes into standard stalk  slasher mode as the killer plays a game of cat  mouse with the one surviving teen.Director Speigel does a fine job  injects some life  style into what could have turned out to be a dull film his camera angles are interesting  some of his shots are cool like showing someone on the phone from inside the phone looking up at her the shots from inside a trolley as it is wheeled around the market are fun  there's even a shot from the perspective of a door knob as it's being turned. A visually enjoyable film. Then again shots like those are merely there to fill the time up between the gore effects from the boys from KNB. The murders are all pretty gory  look incredibly good the band saw scene is a real shocker as is the part when the guy has his head crushed by a trash compactor. They are pretty brutal scenes  rank amongst the best deaths ever seen in any slasher film ever.

I did last night and when I came to its conclusion it had me questioning why I put it off for that long. Since I kind of forced myself to watch it I was thinking it might affect my viewing but no I came away with a surprising slasher treat. One that had invention guts and a dark humorous vein. Hey it's your sameold sameold killer picking off victims formula uh not quite but what made it unique was its creatively graphic death scenes random camera angles and a confined setting of a closed grocery store after hours. The idea behind the concept is scary because it does seem plausible but the black humour does soften the lasting impact.What it looks like is that they had something ultracheap to work with but director Scott Spiegel successfully crafts and implements a lot from it restrictions. Especially with his visuals as he effectively displays stylish positioning lighting and composition layout. After a slow opening buildup it then gradually adds the tension and drills an alienating feel as it moves from one sadistically gruesome death scene after another to lead onto the final chase sequence and revelation. The intensity is kept tight shocks are plastered with tremendous flair and there's a real unpredictable development to its progression with an ending that bears an ingenious but bitter twist. The makeup effects are drenched in blood and brimming with imagination as those involved are let loose to do their stuff and what a job! The music score has a beaming electronic tempo that runs rampant.The performances are very tolerable and Elisabeth Cox is genuinely pleasing in her lead role. Showing up in the cast are the Raimi brothers Sam and Ted. Dan Hicks provides plenty of spirit to his performance of a man that loves his job and the spunky Renee Estevez has excellent chemistry with Cox. David Byrnes makes for an excellent thuggish red herring and Eugene Robert Glazer as the part store owner. Bruce Campbell might get a billing but it's a minor that's very minor appearance.A late comer to the jolting 80s slasher market but honestly one of the best that the subgenre has to offer.".

The numerous methods of this slayer include a person's face being destroyed by a box crushing machine a face being split apart by a meat slicer a person being hung on a meat hook through the throat the trusty butcher knife stabbing into chests  into the back of one man's head not to mention the unfortunate fellow forced eye first into a desk letter spike with blood trickling on a fallen lamp bulb painting the ceiling red. A meat cleaver is used effectively to halt a killer's attack on Jennifer trapped in a fallen telephone booth turned over by the psycho. And to top it all off the killer uses the decapitated head of a victim to throttle a man unconscious! I think the grim conclusion where innocents may be considered the ones responsible for the killer's carnage puts a damper on the film's overall tongueincheek tone..of course some may see this as tongueincheek. And I'm not quite sure the identity of the psycho and his reasons for butchering the grocery employees holds up well. One might say that when the killer explains his bloodlust to Jennifer why he continued to kill long after punishing his desired target the slasher flick falls right in line with how overthetop the movie is.Horror buffs should enjoy watching director Sam Raimi as a meat man and his brother Ted as a nerdy produce manager..with a penchant for watermelon. Elizabeth Cox is cute and adequate in the role of final girl trying to escape the clutches of the serial killer trying to find an exit from the store. Bruce Campbell is wasted in a small unimportant cameo as an aggressive policeman at the end. Dan Hicks lets it all hang out as Bill the grocery boss who resists the idea of selling the store he built from scratch who seems to be a softspoken kindly employer to his hired help. David Byrnes looks thuggish as the red herring excon boyfriend who bullies those who attempt to pry him from Jennifer. Some slasher fans might feel frustrated with the film because it takes a while before the violence ensues with director Scott Spiegel trying to bring a style through every kind of camera angle imaginable using reflections of facesbouncing from a lifted butcher knife from mirrors or swinging glass doors shooting from the inside of shopping carts through empty spots..between merchandise items on store shelves from high above explaining the vastness of the killing grounds available to the psychopath..if there was a way to shoot characters unusually with offkilter camera angles Spiegel does so. Obviously Spiegel knows that the material he has isn't much but by bringing an unorthodox style to this slasher flick he keeps you entertained before the murder spree begins. An 80's sleeper and perfect Midnight viewing.".

Forced to continue their regular duties a mysterious killer soon hits the store taking them out onebyone. When only a few remain they realize the horrible secret behind the killer's identity and race to get out of the store before becoming victims in the rampage.The Good News This one was a really nice slasher surprise. There's some really inventive shots in here that give it a really great look. From the shots through the telephone during a conversation to the scenes of the camera wandering through the store to all the insane POV shots of the killer stalking the victims this one has a wide range of impressive camera shots in here that are just plain fun to behold. The location here is simply fantastic going from a grocery store that seems like an ordinary one that soon goes into a normal slasher set complete with the dark locations in the back where no one can see the crimes committed and the setup provides some great stalking locations. The meatslicing room the manager's room stock rooms and various other backways that make for some truly outthere suspense scenes. The location here which is new and unique allows it come off as really refreshing and makes for some great settings. The big point in this one is that there's a really outstanding amount of gore in here. This one's special effects are handled very well throughout and even better is that each kill is given a great buildup and a satisfactorily bloody conclusion. The kills are done with great brutality making them seem all the better due to the realisticness involved with the kills. There's some great ones including having a neck thrust into a meat hook having a head forced down to where an eye penetrates a letter spike on the desk a decapitation being cut to ribbons with a meat cleaver a butcher knife to the back of the head and it's most infamous scene where a bandsaw saws a face in half vertically just below the eyes. It's brutal done in great detail and is completely memorable. It's even placed in the middle of the film's middle half where nearly all the murders occur. They're done quickly moving from one to another without time to really breathe and comes so fast that there's little stop. The finale where the heroine confronts the killer in a darkened supermarket is replete with tons of goodness as the stumbling across the bodies bit comes in the confrontations between the survivors are brilliant and the whole thing is rather fun. Overall this here is a fun enjoyable slasher.The Bad News This one here wasn't all that bad and only had a couple of problems. One of the main ones is that it takes a little long to get started. From the first kill onward it takes well into the middle half of the film to get started. It has a few problems getting started because it deals with the dealings of the psychotic boyfriend and these here are really detrimental to where it goes on much longer than it should and get the same point across. All it really does is put the killings to come in later in the film and while fantastic killings having it so far back in the film is something that could be avoided. The other flaw is the fact that it never really plays around with the conventions as it should. Rather than just placing it in a unique location this one decides to so and keep the genre rulings firmly intact making it seem like there's nothing new is going on in here. These here keep the film down.The Final Verdict Without as many flaws but a rather big one this one is preserved as a really impressive slasher. Highly recommended to hardcore slasher fans fans of the creative team or are just in the mood for a different slasher but those who tend to want the creative side over the gore will be let down slightly.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language".

Gunther of the police department are converging on the shit they're wallowing in. Former Rain City police officer John Hawkins  Hawk to his friends  has just been released from prison where he served eight years for murder a crime to which he readily admits.

A veteran of Alan Rudolph films he has a wonderful transformation. Without any commentary he goes from a ruraltype flannel shirt  jeans to a denizen of the city wild clothing makeup boufant hairdo. And his behavior gets more bizarre with his change in locale. Also watch for one of cinemas most unique murders. Let's just say it involves water a major feature of the movie but it takes place in a location you would never fathom. This is one film I would love to see get the deluxe DVD treatment.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is perhaps the ONLY film to document what life was probably like for the vast majority of young people in working class America in the late seventies and early eighties when a true sense of bizarreness reigned in big cities all across the country. This was the world that David Bowie Kiss disco and cocaine had made for everyone who had to get out of the house at night. It was also a statement about how rough life was for anybody trying to make their way in the world during that period where inflation was rampant and jobs were VERY difficult to come by.This situation leads one of the characters Koop played by Keith Carradine to join forces with a paranoid but educated and shady black guy by the name of Solo in a diner owned by Genevieve Bujold's character Wanda. Also frequenting the diner which he also lives over is excop Hawk newly released from prison played by Kris Kristofferson. The two clash as Koop descends into a life of crime with Solo trying to feed his wife and baby while Hawk develops an eye for his young wife played by Lori Singer.The mood of this movie has many parts equal parts weird compassionate exposition selfconsciously fashionable and stylish. It captures the zeitgeist of the period between 1975 and 1982 perfectly...the desperation of young people especially POOR young people to get a taste of the glitzy good life and to simply survive in a world that it is too easy to realize really IS cold and cruel! Alan Rudolph's art director should have won an Oscar for his work on this film as it captures the presumed time it was set in perfectly. Rudolph himself deserves kudos too for giving the world a chronicle of the weird world of new wavedisco era big city America. Bujold Carradine Morton Singer and even Kristofferson are good in it as well.This is the middle one of three great movies Rudolph produced in the midtolate eighties that he and his repertoire company usually just Bujold and Carradine can be justifiably proud. These are Choose Me The Moderns and this one. The Moderns must be seen to be believed. As good as the mood setting is in TiM The Moderns walks all over it.Enjoy.".

	schema:headline " A hidden gem of a neonoir";
	schema:reviewBody "TROUBLE IN MIND is a heavily atmospheric neonoir from Alan Rudolph that is quite intriguing and interesting to watch. The story if one can call it that is about an excop a coffee shop owner and a young couple who are each trying to make their own way in RainCity a fictionalizedalternate universe version of Seattle. Like the name implies there is a lot of rain and there is a pervasive sense of melancholy that hangs over it like a cloud. The people who live there all have their pasts but what really drives them is the hope that they will make it and overcome their circumstances. That I believe is at the heart of what this movie represents. In many film noirs past the general thematic tone was one of fate and destiny and it being out of human control. Here in a similarly constructed world we have people trying to wrest control back into their own hands. Overall I thought the movie was rather good. Kris Kristofferson gives a great performance as the excop with a checkered past and Genevieve Bujold Lori Singer and Keith Carradine give equally decent performances as the coffee shop owner and the young couple respectively. Ample time is also spent with each character so that you get to know and sympathize with them although to a lesser degree with Genevieve Bujold. The effect that the city has on a person is seen most explicitly with Coop played by Keith Carradine as his appearance changes considerably over the course of the film and he gets deeper and deeper into the underworld. Also worth mentioning is Divine who takes a supporting role as the top gangster in RainCity. This is probably his best performance and he brings shades of flamboyance and menace to it. He is only in a few scenes but his presence is felt over the entire film and he makes the most of his limited screen time. The movie also has a fantastic jazz score and some great songs sung by Marianne Faithful. But despite how great the film is there are a few drawbacks. The biggest one is a climactic shootout which comes out of nowhere and seemed poorly choreographed. There's also some spotty acting from people in minor roles. Overall I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first heard about this but I was pleasantly surprised. Alan Rudolph managed to create a neonoir which doesn't wallow in misery and which maintained its own unique style. I'd recommend checking this one out especially if you're into the noir genre. You probably won't be disappointed.".

A few random thoughts much like the script The future looks a lot like the '80's. Kris Kristofferson is downright peppy compared to the pace of this movie. Genevieve Bujold is on crack. A shootout for a climax should never be staged as comedy. A bizarre dwarf like woman with Big Hair steals the movie. Do not attempt depicting the future on a low budget. What was up with the black guy who lived in the clock tower? Events in your screenplay should contribute to the story.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie captures the neon world of the late seventies newwavepunk era nearperfectly and is unique in the fact that it is the only movie to do so! The acting specifically Carradine Bujold and Morton is topnotch the music by Mark Isham is moody jazzy and noirperfect and humor abounds throughout. The story is cartoonish but that is part of its charm.The interesting cast does a fine job. Lori Singer as Georgia is the right blend of beauty innocence and vulnerability which nicely contrasts with Wanda's tough but yes goodhearted exterior. John Considine as the completely corrupt lawyer Nate is fine also and the other supporting cast chips in as well.

The acting specifically Carradine Bujold and Morton is topnotch the music by Mark Isham is moody jazzy and noirperfect and humor abounds throughout. The story is cartoonish but that is part of its charm.The interesting cast does a fine job. Lori Singer as Georgia is the right blend of beauty innocence and vulnerability which nicely contrasts with Wanda's tough but yes goodhearted exterior. John Considine as the completely corrupt lawyer Nate is fine also and the other supporting cast chips in as well.

Unfortunately where it departs from BLADERUNNER most noticeably is in the area of and talent and budget. Bujold Kristofferson and Singer are about as exciting as bran flakes.  Carradine's hair is rather dull to begin with but develops unusual colour and a neat curl towards the end of the film which comes none to soon. Divine offers the only performance of note but it is far too brief. Obviously this film experienced a great deal tightness in the budget department. The future appears to be Seattle on an overcast day with a handful of classic cars and one army jeep cruising the streets. A vague vision of the future coupled with an aimless script makes TROUBLE IN MIND a not so great movie to see. A better bet would be to rent the directors cut of BLADERUNNER.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film from the seventies MORT D'UN POURRI DEATH OF A CORRUPT MAN was produced by and stars Alain Delon  who was remarkably handsome and talented as everyone knows or at least as everyone knew now that so much time has passed. It is a spectacularly well directed film by Georges Lautner and the cinematography is equally stunning. The film is one of those French classics which are being restored nowadays in France and issued as BluRays accompanied by a DVD for those who cannot play BluRays. This is one of the many such films which have now been issued with English subtitles. The film goes more deeply into the profundity and pervasiveness of French political corruption than most of the many French films on that subject. An outstanding modern example of the genre is the hairraising TELL NO ONE 2006 see my review. The French are obsessed and for good reason with the corruption which pervades their government and society like rich seams of black coal running through a strip mine. So pervasive is corruption in France at the highest levels that one is tempted to say 'There could be no recognisable France without corruption.' A morally clean French Government is as inconceivable as is a cesspool filled with pure spring water. Whereas political thrillers in America tend to portray corruption as an aberration French films more often portray it as an intrinsic rot like a leper displaying his disintegrating limb. Delon's old chum Philippe Dubaye a Deputy in the French Parliament comes to him in the middle of the night while Delon is in bed with his adoring girlfriend Mirielle Darc and says something really terrible has happened. He has killed another Deputy in the Parliament. Without hesitation Delon offers to help clean up the mess but the mess becomes messier and more people are killed as the ripples of corruption widen on the surface of the political pond. Every which way Delon turns there are people being murdered commencing with his close friend Philippe. After this he becomes obsessed with discovering who killed him which leads him into increasingly desperate dangers. He then befriends Phlippe's girlfriend played by Ornetta Muti who had the biggest and most alluring bedroom eyes in the film business at that time. When she looks at a man he feels the heat as if someone has turned on the grill. Muti then effortlessly dominates the screen with all of her emanations of sex appeal with the camera lovingly dwelling on her simmering looks. More and more outrageous attempts are made to try and murder Delon who keeps scraping through impossible ambushes such as cars falling on top of him. The dialogue was written by Michel Audiard who also was a director himself. The twists and turns and multiple spiders' webs multiply faster than a spider can scuttle up a wall. The sinister air of menace is greatly heightened by the subtle performance of Klaus Kinski as one of the most powerful bad guys. This certainly is a cracking yarn and is real edge of the seat stuff.".

The production values of this Zgrade stinker is worse than you could imagine for one there is absolutely no reason that a production should look this bad. The prison sequences look extremely cheap and it becomes quite obvious that this is being shot in some abandoned warehouse or storage area. Another aspect is that of the really bad fight sequences these are so poorly staged and slow that one wonders if it even deserves to be compared to it's lame predecessor  3 let alone Bloodsport  1 and  2. Bloodsport IV is the worst of the series and without doubt due to it's sheer badness factor. Movies seriously don't get as poorly made or dull as this stinker. There is nothing at all to redeem anything to even earn a full star. This is the pits.12 out of 4Awful".

I can't believe that it's possible to act as bad as some of the people in this movie do. The two villain's are especially bad. The movie has a really dark feel to it and I didn't like that at all. It's filmed in Bulgaria. I guess that was the only thing they could afford but it looks really really bad. Good fighting scenes sometimes save a really bad movie but that doesn't happen here at all. The fighting scenes are in fact really bad and they're a big waste of Bernhardt's great potential. Oh did I forget to mention that the plot sucks big time? A VERY VERY BAD movie indeed.".

What the heck? Let me sum up the plot. John Keller infiltrates a prison where prisoners keep mysteriously disappearing. His job is to find out what's going on. There he meets psychopath Justin Caesar Ivan Ivanov and the sadistic warden Preston Derek McGrath.I would really like to know how this guy got to direct this film. I love this movie so much because I laugh a lot when I watch it. It is truly an unintentional comedy and I have already recommended it to friends. The best part is two people singing at this kumite and dancing around for a couple of minutes before the fighting begins. Another great thing is the way Caesar talks. This guy is extremely slow and his voice is sometimes not in sync with his mouthmovements.On an entertainment level this gets a 7. On a quality level this get's a 5.".

Well the dark kumite the title promises is really quite bad very few fighters even fewer good fighters and fights so short you'll miss them if you blink.However outside of this failed kumite the movie's alright and if you've enjoyed Bloodsport 1 2  3 and don't expect too much out of 4 you should check it out.";

	schema:reviewBody "Premiering on video early in 1999 well into the worldwide MATRIX craze the fourth and final installment of the martial arts series begun by JeanClaude Van Damme had little chance of gaining prominence to begin with even before viewers were exposed to its questionable plot line and production decisions. Since then it's been collectively deemed the worst of the series but I disagree. THE DARK KUMITE isn't about to outdo the original and the first sequel as a western martial arts opus but it's more or less onpar with sequel number two showing strength where that one was weak and viceversa via some solid fight scenery and an unexpectedly interesting story.The plot Police agent John Keller Daniel Bernhardt goes undercover to follow a vicious serial killer Stefanos Miltsakakis to the dreaded Fuego Penal penitentiary so he can investigate the unexplained deaths and disappearances of several inmates. His investigation leads him to a deadly underground fighting circuit hosted by a sadistic mob boss Ivan Ivanov.It's pretty disappointing that Daniel Bernhardt isn't reprising the Alex Cardo character from the last two movies and if given the choice I'd prefer a straightup tournament storyline like those had to this thriller stuff. Thankfully this isn't as bleak murky or colorless of a thriller as its madeinBulgaria label suggests. The basic premise is pretty straightarrow but the story's filled with characters who range from colorful to absolutely crazy e.g. Derek McGrath as the heavybreathing unstable warden with an inferiority complex interesting set design e.g. Ivan Ivanov decorates his interior with pretty statuesque young women and the setup of some scenes that unintentionally makes it unclear whether we're watching actual storyline progression or a character hallucination e.g. John's sex scene. Aside from failing to convince us that the storyline isn't taking place in Europe the production is generally strong with a few occasional slipups in editing and filming and the occasional strange decision on the director's part like when he has Derek McGrath display anxiety by fogging up the camera lens with his breath. Bits like these are most likely what led to the film's initial poor ratings but as a connoisseur of lowbudget DTV junk I can say without a doubt that this movie would've been very boring if it didn't have all these weird little things going for it.Except of course when it comes to the fight scenes which are mostly pretty good in any setting if your standards aren't too lofty. As a cumulative whole the fight content can't hold a candle to the first two films but I prefer the stalwart if generic competence of these encounters to the overabundance of tensecond scraps in the third one. THE DARK KUMITE has nine fights and of these seven are of decent length and worth watching for the soundness of Daniel Bernhardt's kicks. They're unhampered by poor camerawork or overediting but if they have a problem it's their lack of varied fighting styles and innovative choreography of their predecessors. With the exception of the ones wherein Stefanos Miltsakakis displays his grappling skills all of them are straightup karatekickboxing matches and none of the extra fighters are all that interesting. Still I can't underplay my appreciation of their unwavering base quality and I really liked the end scuffle between Bernhardt and Miltsakakis it's not as long as I would've preferred but I still think it's better than the one between Bernhardt and Nicholas Oleson from the last movie.Regardless of how many folks would disagree with me I'm glad that this series managed to end on a respectable note. It's come a heckuva long way from the Van Damme's stepping stone into the mainstream and lost some of its charm but I declare it worth owning for fans of the previous films.".

But if I had to guess how Bloodsport 4 got into production my theory would be that the screenplay writer suffering from innovation fatigue stole the script from a third grade student who in turn ripped off the formula from the movie Death Warrant with JeanClaude Van Damme. Then the producers forgetting that the martial arts genre was no longer popular wrote a cheque worth millions of dollars after three seconds of considered thought. The next step was to hire some really bad actors either that or they were so embarrassed reading the lines that they ended up sounding like seven year olds pretending to be very serious and then conceal this fact by tacking on the normally charismatic Daniel Bernhardt as the protagonist Keller. The only problem is that Bernhardt looks as lost in this movie as all of the other actors. Plus the action sequences are that special either. It takes the suspense out of a movie when the bad guy touches Keller's shoulder to indicate to him that now is the time to try out some of those martial arts moves. Then as the movie started entering into its second leg a strange thing happened I actually started to miss the sound of JeanClaude Van Damme's tough guy accent from Death Warrant which was easily more entertaining than anything in this picture.".

Probably to make money because of the bloodsport name they decided to call it Bloodsport The Dark Kumite. Honestly the main character is far less interesting than Alex Cardo the setup although already done previously is not that bad but its just something feel off about the whole thing.Fight scenes are OK but way under the ones in the previous movies and the budget look very small the acting is not convincing.

	schema:reviewBody "Warning this review might contain spoilers. This cgrade martial arts flick is deliciously entertaining. Beautifully filmed in Bulgaria 'Bloodsport IV' has a distilled plot melodramatic acting homoerotic dialogue and some very interesting visuals. The movie reminded me of classic Paul Morrissey movies such as 'Blood for Dracula' and 'Flesh for Frankenstein' because of the way it takes all of its clichs and plot shortcuts to such overthetop extreme it becomes almost artful and clever. Filling the movie with superficial Christian iconography onedimensional characters and various fetishistic imagery director Elvis Restaino created a surrealistic fantasia that transcends its genre. We follow our hero agent John Keller from the previous Bloodsport movies and Blaire his loyal partner and lover one night as they discover that a very dangerous and supposedly executed criminal named Shrek is in fact alive and free. After they witness Shrek murder a fellow cop Keller decides to infiltrate Fuego Penal from where Shreck has escaped to find out how Shrek was able to escape the death row without anyone noticing. Blaire agrees to pose as a nun to keep Keller in touch with the world outside. In Fuego Keller has an eclectic bunch of prisoners to keep him company including a psychotic killer named Dr Rosenbloom think Dracula's Renfield another undercover agent named Winston Jesuscrazed thug named Billings who wants to kill Keller for getting him imprisoned and Keller's archnemesis himself  Shrek. But these inmates are not our hero's worst problem. As it turns out Fuego Penal's administration has made a deal with a very mysterious and very wealthy man who calls himself Caesar and who likes to watch martial arts tournaments where prisoners are forced to fight each other to the death. The surviving champion gets to live and go free with a plane ticket and a generous amount of cash. Will Keller be able to overcome his principles and kill his opponents in order to survive? Will this be the end of Keller or will his kickass girlfriend save him in time? Why do Caesar and his entourage look like they've come to a Renaissance fair? Why do Fuego wardens dress like SS guards? Is there a point to Caesar's girlfriend having wild monkey sex with Keller in the middle of the movie? What's with all the ecclesiastic imagery? Don't expect answers to most of these questions but do expect to be entertained as long as you like campy 'bad' movies.".

He's a huge hulk of man who can take a beating and keep fighting. He's appeared in five JeanClaude Van Damme movies including Maximum Risk The Quest and Lionheart. This movie unlike some of his other projects is just one major cheese fest.  The plot is thin the acting is wooden and while there are some good fight scenes with Stefanos of course it's just not enough. The main bad guy the prison warden is totally laughable. So if you're forced to watch Bloodsport The Dark Kumite I recommend you fast forward to the fight scenes because you won't be missing much.".

In fact there are many similarities between the romance in Titanic and in Far and Away.  I feel that the depiction in this film works much better than the other mainly because of the plausibility factor how many times would you run into the same person on a huge ship?.  We understand why Shannon would want to take Joseph along with her.  This is the opportunity she's been waiting for.  Along the way and through helping each other through tough circumstances they fall for each other.  This is not some momentary crush that will pass when the next good looking person walks by we know that these two truly care for each other and admire each other.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfect  one would think that they're both Irish natives.  If their marriage is anything like their relationship here it is bound to last for some time.  This is hands down Tom Cruise's best movie ever.  Here we don't see the typical cocky young man but instead a man driven by passion and destiny to do what needs to be done.  This is probably much closer to the real Tom Cruise  Proud without being arrogant.  This film remains on my list of alltime favorites and I look forward to seeing it on the large screen one day.".

Nicole Kidman is so beautiful in the movie and she really carries the movie with her charisma. Tom Cruise plays his part very well. The scenery in the movie is some of the best I've ever seen. It is easy to lose yourself in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone I know.";

	schema:reviewBody "While the whole rich girl falls in love with the poor boy routine is a little over done Far and Away is actually a very romantic and wonderful movie starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I think because they had such great chemistry they made this movie into a tear jerker. Not to mention how great the story was a part of our history that has always been ignored the Irish immigrants coming over to America to have land and settle down. At a time when America was the new world and very exciting where anyone could be free Joesph and Shannon were two very lovable characters and you just keep hoping that their dreams come true.Shannon is a very upper class lady in Ireland with her controlling mother who wishes her to marry a snobbish land owner Stephen. Joesph is a farm boy who has just lost his father and his home has been burned by Stephen Shannon's father owns the land so Joesph goes to kill him but fails. His punishment is a duel but he and Shannon see each other and have an instant connection but won't admit it of course but Shannon offers for him to come with her to America to claim some land with her. He accepts her offer and goes with her. They claim to be brother and sister to survive but soon they can no longer resist each other's love but their family may be too strong to let them be together when Shannon's family comes to get her in America.Far and Away is a very charming film that I'm sure you will be impressed with. It's just a very romantic film has fun comedy to it good drama and has terrific pictures and sights. Ron Howard is just a fine director he got the whole feel of the old days and that race for land at the end was just shot so beautifully. Tom and Nicole did a great job they were so beautiful to watch and made this into a great film. I highly recommend this movie I think you'll love it.810".

Their intensity shines as well as their artistic ability to envelop a character and relate their thoughts to a viewer. Besides their very well done performance the film is absolutely beautiful. Kudos to the set and costume designers that spent long hours on Far and Away.  But he real story in this film is Ron Howard.  It is simply a asthetic masterpiece.  I spent most of my time wishing that he had just set his camera up on the prairie and filmed the grass growing.  It was truly beautiful.  Incidentally sometimes one scene just makes a film.  Brings it up from a good film into near 'masterpiece' status.  This is one of those films.  The music the best soundtrack of the year thanks to Horner combined with Ron Howard's vision made the land race scene of Far and Away and classic within itself.  Put this scene up there with the chariot race in Ben Hur and the parting of the Red Sea in The Ten Commmandments it is just that good.  This is far and away one of the best films of the year.".

For Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman it's the land their own bit of land to work as they please and answer to no one.The story of Far and Away takes place in a very specific time period in the history of both Ireland and America. In Ireland the home rule movement had been dealt a stunning blow with the fall of Charles Stuart Parnell in scandal. Independence had been set back and the landlords were riding high though not without opposition. Opposition in this case comes in the form of Tom Cruise and his family who are Irish tenant farmers about to be tossed off their land because they can't pay the exorbitant rents. Turns out the landlord's got a most fetching daughter in Nicole Kidman who's got her eye on the peasant lad. Far and Away is first and foremost a romance the rich girl and the poor boy two beautiful young people we all wish we were. Of course the real affair of Tom and Nicole and their eventual marriage is fairy tale storybook stuff on its own. It sure didn't hurt the film.They've got a rough road ahead though. In Boston they get exploited by their own people as badly as the English are doing in the old country. Of course their eventual salvation is the Oklahoma land rush where Tom can get his own land to work.Frederick Jackson Turner was a famous American historian who put forth the thesis that the reason America escaped the class struggles and revolutions of Europe was our frontier. It didn't work out so well for those Indians already there but the proletarian masses instead of becoming a mob that agitators could stir to revolution just went west and made opportunities. Turner's thesis is still a widely respected paradigm in the study of American history and I think if he could have seen Far and Away he'd say Ron Howard proved his point.Speaking of Ron Howard it's pretty obvious he was influenced by both versions of the Oklahoma land rush previously made in the two films of Edna Ferber's classic Cimarron. He doesn't do badly in recreating Boston of the Gay Nineties and Ireland of the same period.And Tom and Nicole certainly look beautiful even when she's working in a factory and Tom's getting clobbered in a bare knuckle prize fight. Look for nice performances by Robert Prosky as Nicole's father Thomas Gibson as Tom's rival for Nicole and Colm Meaney as the Irish political boss in Boston.Maybe the world needs a frontier to solve its problems.".

Too little chemistry driven by the usual emotional triggers another man another woman a lusty old dude a gunshot wound charged bickering drunkenness and a bathtub. Cruise's accent? Not for me.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers In 1892 Ireland the son of a poor farmer forms an unlikely alliance with the daughter of a wealthy landowner in Far and Away' a romantic adventure directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  When his father dies and an agent of the landlord to whom back rent is owed burns their modest home to the ground Joseph Donnelly Cruise vows revenge.  Armed with an ancient rusty rifle  he travels to the estate of the landowner Daniel Christie Robert Prosky intending to shoot him.  But his plans to settle the score quickly go awry as he draws a bead on Christie and pulls the trigger the rifle explodes in his face.  Christie takes him into his home to treat his wounds and there Joseph catches the eye of Christie's daughter Shannon Kidman.  The lad she notes has pluck and he's obviously a scrapper and she immediately sees him as the means by which she can effect her dream of running away to America where they are giving land away for free or so says the ad she has ripped from a newspaper.  She realizes that such an undertaking would be impossible for a woman traveling alone but with a man such as Joseph along to tend to her needs and offer protection it could be done.  Circumstances prevail in her favor and soon the two of them are off covertly with the plan being to land in Boston then head west to the Oklahoma Territory where Shannon will be able to claim her land.  Of course Joseph sees land in it for himself as well.  They hit a snag however upon landing in Boston Shannon's silver spoons stolen from her mother and with which the trek west was to be financed are stolen from her leaving them without means.  With some help they manage to find affordable accommodations a room at a local bordello and Shannon finds work in a factory.  Meanwhile Joseph finds he can make some money by prizefighting at one of the local pubs under sponsorship of a man named Kelly Colm Meaney the connected' Irishman of the town.  It's enough to keep them going temporarily but the question is can they make it to Oklahoma in time for the land rush' of 1893? Cruise gives a credible performance here as Joseph complete with a passable Irish accent and he has a natural charismatic persona that comes across so well on film.  Kidman too fares well with her portrayal of Shannon her accent is good and the camera likes her.  And of course there's a real chemistry between them.  Howard has crafted a visually handsome movie with a good story told in a predominately straight forward manner.  There's not a lot of surprises and much of it is predictable beyond mere foreshadowing but the pace is brisk and the characters are alive which keeps it all interesting.  Also there's a touch of humor thrown in at appropriate junctures which helps to offset the dramatics maintain a positive atmosphere and keep it all from becoming too sullen. The cinematography is especially notable particularly early on when capturing some of the lush vistas of Ireland and later during the land rush' sequence.  The performances are good all around and the excellent supporting cast includes Thomas Gibson Steven Barbara Babcock Nora Christie Cyril Cusack Danty Duff and Michelle Johnson Grace.  Far and Away' is well made and delivered and most importantly it's an entertaining movie perhaps not one of the most memorable Howard has made but it's an enjoyable film and well worth seeing.  All in all it makes for a pleasant night at the movies.     I rate this one 710.".

Beautifully done in a classic and family quality Golden tradition of Hollywoods best. Unfortunately todays audiences need full frontal Porn and the Fword used as the main dialog to get a rise out of younger folks. I'm no prude. I served in the Navy on submarines and can use language that would make a Marine squirm with disgust. There is a place for everything but for me great films are not that place. I think Far and Away is one of those rare films that didn't get it's just due from the public but it will always have a place on my Top 25 list of the best films ever made just like Forest Gump also a Ron Howard film. God help us.".

The film really is about when the British owned most of the land and the Irish had to pay high tax's so most went off the America. The plot was good only the boxing dragged on a bit and they were earning money but still never left to go and get land or to even get better accommodation other then staying in a brothel. It is a good movie to watch if there is nothing else but please do not judge the Irish by the accents of Tom and Nicole.".

	schema:headline " Low budget swashbuckler provides high seas fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone watching this movie expecting epic sea battles and nonstop action will likely be disappointed but for those viewers who grasp that it's essentially a black comedy there is much entertainment to be found. Charles Laughton plays Kidd as a conniving buffoon who seeks to finagle his way into a peerage. John Carradine steals the show as Povey the satanic looking henchman to Kidd. His basso profundo voice and intense eyes have seldom been put to better effect. The other scalawags in the crew include character actors Gilbert Roland Abner Biberman and Sheldon Leonard with a nice bit by John Qualen as hero Randolph Scott's loyal sidekick. Scott seems a bit out of place on a ship's quarterdeck instead of a horse but he manages to do a good job with his heroic role anyway. The film shows its minuscule budget through the repeated use of stock footage cramped sets and more talk than action but it compensates with colorfully written and played characters.SPOILERS AHEAD Two of the best scenes occur near the beginning and end. In the first a crew of cutthroats led by Kidd haul a treasure chest into a cave to bury it. One of the rogues remarks that it's deep enough to bury a man in. An argument ensues when Kidd gets annoyed at his underlings having the nerve to demand to inspect the chest first. He finally loses patience with the most demanding sea dog and shoots him. When the dead pirate falls into the hole with the chest they bury him along with it. Later Kidd Povey and hero Adam Mercy  Scott dig up the chest. When Mercy finds a human skull he asks Who might this be? and Carradine replies in a menacingly polite growl  Perhaps a man who asked too many questions! There's great fun to be had with this movie for lovers of pirate flicks. Mention should also be made of the dry comic turn by Reginald Owen as the valet hired by Kidd to teach him respectable society ways. He takes this small part and makes the character into a believable appealing individual and not just for comedy alone. Anyone who likes old pirate movies ought to check this one out for a very good time.".

Despite the rather farfetched nature both of his scheme and of much of the plot as a whole Laughton's rousing performance and the movie's other strengths carry everything off nicely.The story setup is nicely conceived pitting Kidd and his deceitful scheming against some fully worthy adversaries with plots and secrets of their own with John Carradine enjoyably spiteful as Kidd's longtime untrustworthy partner and Randolph Scott as a mysterious convict who gets recruited to be Kidd's master gunner. The three of them join in an entertaining battle of nerves and wits with most of the other characters serving as useful pawns in their game. Reginald Owen also pitches in as something of a wild card character whose loyalties are for a time uncertain.The action sequences are good and they are also interspersed at wellchosen intervals in the main plot.

This is not the story of the real William Kidd who in fact some say may not even have been a pirate merely a British privateer. There's some controversy raging to this day about whether he left some buried treasure in and around the New York City area. In fact colonial New York is where the captain's base of operations was though New York gets the barest mention in the beginning of the film.This version of Kidd has him as a cockney with a burning ambition to rise in class. Actually Kidd was born in Scotland in either Aberdeen or Dundee depending on what source you use. He's a clever rogue after sinking a king's ship and then accusing that noble captain of piracy.Giving that story to King William III of Orange Kidd gets a ship and he picks a crew of cutthroats and sets sail to do more plunder.Captain Kidd suffers from two faults mainly. It's badly edited the film clearly begins at a point where some previous action took place explaining some of what we see. Probably something of New York where Kidd began his career. A whole lot of things are left up in the air because of this. Secondly Randolph Scott is horribly miscast in a part that Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power or Douglas Fairbanks Jr. should have played. My guess is that none of these gentlemen could be secured for a loan out from their studios. Even Cornel Wilde or Louis Hayward would have been better.But what enjoyment you get in the film comes from Charles Laughton's florid performance as Captain Kidd. Basically what he's done is taken his Horace Prin character from White Woman and set him to sea. Laughton's overacting is nicely counterbalanced by Reginald Owen as a valet he's hired and takes to sea to teach him the fine art of being a gentleman. Laughton overacts outrageously but I'm sure he realized that without it the film would have been dull as dishwater.Gilbert Roland John Carradine and Sheldon Leonard are all part of Laughton's gang of thieves. Barbara Britton looks properly demure as a heroine caught up among them. And Henry Daniell the man with the built in sneer in his voice for once plays a good guy as King William.Charles Laughton fans will love Captain Kidd. And Laughton was even more outrageous when he reprised Captain Kidd when he met up with Abbott and Costello. But that's a whole other movie.".

Carradine never cut a finer figure than he does here.Only real complaint would be that the direction and the photography were rather quaint  I hadn't seen the date on the print and I really thought I was seeing a film from about ten years earlier than when this one was actually produced. There was even a shot  when Scott and the heroine Barbara Britton land on the small island  that I think was probably done with front projection possibly glass mattes from photographs or paintings. Those are kind of nice touches for the fan but it speaks to how oldfashioned this film was even at the time of its release. It offers the kind of loose romantic thrills that you would hope it to and I expected nothing more of the film.".

There are few pirate cliches that don't find their way into Norman Reilly Raine's overwrought script  buried treasures kidnapped maidens English nobles masquerading as buccaneers. Much of it is unintentionally silly It is for example impossible to take the hale beefy Virginiatwanged Randolph Scott as either an English nobleman or a pirate. Scott claims two friends aboard Kidd's pirate ship both strangely effete deferential characters Another pirate who acts as Scott's valet and Kidd's own valet who spends most of the movie surreptitiously assisting Scott in his scheming against the pirate captain. Kidd's companions by comparison are swaggering caricatures and Kidd spends most of the movie scheming to dispatch them in one of the film's strangest images Laughton huddled over a small book jotting down names or crossing them out muttering to himself and cackling.Much of this is good fun and some of the cinematography is gorgeous  even by today's standards the use of miniatures and trick camerawork creates a convincing illusion of ships at battle on roiling seas. But the story is so far from history that there seems to be no good reason to name Laughton after the real Captain Kidd a bumbler whose short career as a pirate and humiliating death was little but a series of bizarre travesties. But the script is awkward and choppy and many of the set pieces are strangely cramped and stagey as though this were a theatrical production rather than a film. Ultimately the true pleasure in watching the film comes from Laughton's peculiar performance which is similarly theatrical as though it were an oversized clown act from a London stage transferred to film. He plays Kidd without nuance telegraphng the captain's bloated greed and amorality as though these were comical personal eccentricities. The closest the screen has since produced to Laughton's outre characterization is Harvey Fierstein's Pirate King character in 1997's Kull the Conqueror which is pure camp.Laughton was in fact gay and though this fact is never made overt in Captain Kidd there is some surprising subtext. Two scenes in particular strike contemporary eyes as having implicitly camp sensibilities  one in which Laughton sniffingly dismisses any interest in female companionship and another scene in which Scott a legitimate beefcake shares a bath with his valet both happily scrubbing each other while surrounded by hundreds of semiclad pirates.

Even when the movie is set on the high seas we rarely see the sea the story being confined to the inner parts of the ship. Laughton's Kidd is not an historical treatment of the legendary pirate but rather a mythical yarn about Kidd's attempt to reclaim a treasure stashed away near Madagascar and his attempts to gain even more treasure by selling himself to King William III as a protector and escort of one of His Majesty's ships en route from India to England laden with riches.The performances here were all right  headed of course by Laughton  but the story honestly didn't really capture me. Compared to Laughton's earlier Bounty this seemed much older in terms of production values and quality in spite of it being made 10 years later. Overall it's something of a disappointment.".

	schema:headline " A Good Cast Cannot Compensate for a Shortage of Sea Battles.";
	schema:reviewBody "The pirate movie Captain Kidd opens with narration over an explosive battle at sea that establishes the setting the characters and the rationale for action on the part of the Randolph Scott hero. Interestingly this sea battle is the only one that occurs in this otherwise formulaic pirate movie that concerns stolen treasure an abducted female aristocrat and honor. Indeed Captain Kidd has more dialogue sequences than it has action sequences with cannons being fired and ships sinking into the briny deep. Granted it isn't the best nor is it the worst.Madagascar booms the narrator for centuries the bloodiest cockpit of all the seas where the infamous brotherhood of the damned waited to plunder the treasure laden galleons of India and . . . then return drunken with slaughter to their pirate stronghold of the last hope. Most ruthless of all was Captain William Kidd. He encountered the great London galleon The Twelve Apostles commanded by Admiral Lord Blaine and approaching unsuspected in the guise of a peaceful merchant by a sudden treacherous salvo reduced her to a burning hulk. When night fell the Twelve Apostles was only a blazing funeral pyre on the placid surface of a Madagascar lagoon. At this point Captain Kidd Oscar winner Charles Laughton of The Private Life of Henry VIII and his accomplices bury the booty from The Twelve Apostles as well as prizes from other ships. Before they lower the treasure chest into a hole that they have dug in a cave Kidd's cutthroats want one more glance at the treasure that they have acquired through acts of piracy. No sooner does one pirate observe that the pit is deep enough to bury a man than Kidd shoots him and they bury the dead man with their loot.The year is 1699. At Hampton Court Palace one of King William II's advisors proposes that His Majesty authorize Captain Kidd to sail under the British flag. At this point the English believe Kidd has attacked only Spanish ships. Kidd tells the King that he fell into the hands of a ship commanded by Blaine a highranking British officer that had turned pirate. Of course Kidd is lying. Nevertheless William outlines Kidd's task And now captain the main mission of your cruise is to meet a great ship the Quida Merchant sailing from India with vast treasures and to give her safe conduct in my name past the waters of Madagascar. As his reward Kidd requests that William give him Admiral Blaine's castle and lands. Initially William reacts with horror at the notion that Kidd plans to recruit a crew from Newgate Prison. Kidd defends himself There's none would be so loyal nor fight so desperate as cutthroats under sentence of death... if they knew that at the end of the voyage a royal pardon would be in their pockets. Among the pirates imprisoned in Newgate Prison is Adam Mercy Randolph Scott of Virginia City and his best friend Bart Blivens John Qualen of The Searchers.Meanwhile the scheming captain contemplates more than merely protecting one of his Majesty's ships. He keeps a list of comrades that he aims to kill and tries to figure out a way to serve best the King and himself. No sooner has Mercy come aboard than Kidd suspects that he is an agent of the King William particularly when Mercy refuses to drink a toast to the sovereign. Meanwhile the treacherous Kidd whittles down his accomplices so that none will survive to share the booty from The Twelve Apostles. At the same time we learn that Mercy isn't really Mercy but he is the son of Admiral Blaine. MercyBlaine wants to clear his later father's good name. It seems that William branded him as a pirate as a result of the encounter between Kidd and him.Anyway Kidd has an ocean rendezvous with the treasure ship. He sends his cohort Jose Lorenzo Gilbert Roland of Any Gun Can Play into the powder magazine to supervise the transfer of ammunition. In fact Lorenzo leaves a burning candle attached to several fuses. Not long afterward the British ship vanishes in a terrific explosion and sinks. Before the ship goes down the captain Lord Fallsworth Lumsden Hare of Rogue's March and the comely Lady Anne Dunstan Barbara Britton of Bwana Devil are climbing aboard Kidd's ship. Kidd doesn't waste time with Fallsworth. As the treasure chest is hoisted up in a net Kidd pushes it and the net with its chest flies back and strikes the captain knocking him overboard to his death into a long ship below. Appropriately Lady Anne is horrified. Later Lorenzo makes a play for her affections. She screams and Mercy comes to her rescue. Kidd and another comrade Orange Povey John Carradine of The Grapes of Wrath watch as Mercy defeats him in a swordfight.Captain Kidd boasts a fine firstrate cast including Gilbert Roland horror icon John Carradine and several notable character actors but the action is confined to ship sets prison interiors and no sea battles take place after the battle at the beginning of the story.Laughton later reprised his role as the nefarious pirate in the 1952 Universal Studios' comedy Abbot and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. Director Roland V. Lee who directed a hodgepodge of every genre in Hollywood keeps the action moving aheadespecially when there's nothing but dialogueso that Captain Kidd is more than tolerable entertainment nothing great but watchable on a rainy day. Laughton with his hammy chops chews the scenery with relish while Randolph Scott does nothing to conceal his Virginia accent. Interestingly this was director Roland V. Lee's last movie to direct and the last one that his brother Robert N. Lee to provided with a story. Norman Reilly Raine who penned two Errol Flynn features The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex wrote the screenplay that contains some clever dialogue.".

He's not very convincing with his obviously American accent and demeanor. Laughton replays his Captain Bligh role from his 'Bounty' role 10 years before. Interesting to see some other odd casting choices like Sheldon Leonard Gilbert Roland and John Caradine for English pirate types. This film is good to see by a mediocre film at best served up during the WW2 years.";

Running at 90 minutes the film is surprisingly short on blood pumping action with much of the screenplay given to draggy verbose passages. But there is an overriding sense of fun throughout with a cast of highly watchable actors making it very much an acting 101 picture. Particularly striking is Laughton who seems to be enjoying himself royally as he gets to pout stomp and dally in villainy. However there's not enough of the excellent Daniell and the very pretty Barbara Britton is a token offering who is reduced to a near walk on part late in proceedings. Janssen's score is suitably full of high seas bluster and plot has enough skullduggery back stabbing and treasure plundering to at the least keep one interested to the finale. 610".

However much this assignment would have defeated a lesser actor Laughton sets to with a will hamming up the part with such lively gusto and infectious enthusiasm as to turn the birddroppings of an almost featherless screenplay into a veritable feast of robust entertainment. Laughton is greatly helped in his endeavors by Reginald Owen another seasoned performer who knows all the tricks of inflection and demeanor to strike sparks of histrionic excitement from the driest pasture. John Carradine also has a nicely insinuating way with words but the rest of the players are far less able to spin their spidery lines into threads of gold.

Gilbert Roland tries hard and does most of his own fencing while an obvious double substitutes for our hero but misses the ingratiating charisma of a trueborn villain.

It's not just 'boys meets girl stuff happens they get married and live happily ever after'  Annie and Chris have to deal with real adversity and issues which are shown through numerous flashbacks throughout the film. ie Chris being embarrassed to dance teaching his daughter about deathYou're not supposed to watch this film for the visual effects.  They're great but they're not the point.  If you have a short attention span and are expecting action thrown at you every five seconds then go watch something else and don't complain that this film is boring.This film was very simple and very human. If you want inspiration that REAL love exists and not that stupid teen movie crap then I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was a moving visually stunning masterpiece unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Even though I knew how it was going to end I kept cheering for it to happen. An absolutely beautiful film. Chris Robin Williams and Annie Annabella Sciorra are husband and wife. They met by chance and fell in love immediately. They have two wonderful kids and a marriage full of love and life. But tragically one day their kids are taken from them in a car accident. They fight to continue their lives but one day four years later Chris's life is also taken. He ends up in Heaven but can't accept his fate. A guide is sent to him in the form of his friend Albert Cuba Gooding Jr.. Albert leads Chris on a journey through Heaven and the wonders it can bring. In the real world Annie can't handle Chris's death and she kills herself and ends up in Hell. Chris must go on a journey to find her and save her from an eternity of sorrow.This movie hits all the right chords. It makes you laugh at times and makes you cry at times. The love Chris has for Annie is stronger than anything you have ever seen. He's willing to lose his mind and spend all eternity in Hell with her with neither of them recognizing the other because they are soul mates destined to be together for all time. This movie is hard to explain in any other way. The journey Chris goes through is remarkable but the real star of this film is the visuals. When Chris goes to Heaven he is told that what he sees is what his mind can create. So what he sees is himself inside Annie's paintings. He lives in a Heaven full of brilliant colors. Life in a painting. It was amazing to look at. And the colors of the movie along with the set designs were incredible. His house Annie's Hell the sea of Faces. I just couldn't believe how fantastic everything looked in this movie. The performances were wonderful. Robin Williams was at his dramatic best and Cuba Gooding Jr. brought energy to the film. The story was strong if predictable and the manner is which it was made utilizing flashbacks was powerful. You really felt the characters emotions throughout. I know this review is weak but I really don't know what else to say. I guess you're going to have to see for yourself. It doesn't matter if you don't believe in a Heaven or a Hell. What Dreams May Come will make you believe in something even more powerful than that. Love and what one man will do because of it.".

I feel that from almost every one of the actors there was a luminous glow emanating from their faces like there was some sort of special lighting used. There probably was! As a result the audience has empathy toward the characters and actually cares about what is happening to them. I've heard so many complaints about how it tries to pull at your heartstrings. Excuse me but if there WAS a movie out there that made people cry without trying to I would stay as far away from it as possible........YES I believe there IS merit to be deserved by a movie if it creates any kind of obvious emotion. I think that crying at a movie either scares or annoys some people.          I like how the movie made me feel awed during the first half and even more awed during the second half all the while making me feel sad throughout the movie at the same time. However there is a difference between 'sad' and 'depressing'. I think the sadness helps any audience realize some parts of their innerselves.  While very memorable curiously the movie never intends for its audience to be closeminded enough to think that this is with certainty what happens after you die. It is more of a suggestion an analogy of how precious life is and how deep the bond of love is between some people no matter what happens. Rent this one today.".

He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that he can truly touch you with his oh so tearjerking lines.My conclusion if you are planning on watching this movie keep your tissues at hand and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn't exactly what you call short.".

Then there was a mercifully highspeed review of a perfect family forming only to be interrupted by the central tragedies of the children's deaths soon followed by that of the husband Robin Williams. All of which in the absence of any substantial character development would have left us cold  if it weren't for the sentimental speeches and overblown musical score which heralded and underlined every essential moment of the film.In heaven the rot really set in with overblown special effects and surging symphonic passages trying hard to overcome the zero storyline.  After much traipsing through the flowers of paradise's imaginary pallet we reached the nub of the story with the earthly suicide of the wife.At last a good 45 minutes into the film the plot emerged an old fashioned search and rescue mission set in cyberheaven.  But what a miserable mission a search emasculated of any dramatic tension by the fact that the protagonist is already dead but living well in paradise  so what has he to lose?  what threat has to be survived?  It's a case of have Robin Williams will travel on a tour through a bizarre series of sets and special effects including Hell dressed up as a burning boat was this something picked up from Titanic's cutting room floor?  And a rescue so bland and predictable that it wilted on the flacid vine and the resultant reunification of family was as cloying and sickmaking as the cheapest brand of ersatz champagne.OK so there were a few stunning images that brought to mind Terry Gilliam's work although without the wit or bite but these didn't compensate for the crass dialogue and laboured direction.  In any event they were undermined by some sinister undertones in the film.   Such as the large proportion of black people inside the burning gates of Hell contrasting with the white faces in Heaven and the idea that suicide is in all cases irredeemable but for the rest of us there is a better life to be had after we are dead.So sorry to all of you who thought this was such a great film  for me it was drivel of the worst kind a simple story dumbed down and painted up  a thin very thin veneer of eye candy and nothing more.".

Most of the film takes place in the afterlife of a man who is killed in a car accident and wakes up inside an oil painting This is difficult to understand without seeing the movie but don't bother. The story revolves around his attempts to reach out to his wife both before and after her own death. Unfortunately this story gets put on hold for long periods so that we can see them portrayed as giggling idiots during their courtship and then so the director can explore various visual tricks and then again to insult the audience with pointless plot twists where character A actually turns out to be B. I had to wonder whether the writer planned that part from the beginning or was just trying to write himself out of a corner.Williams managed to shine despite the material he was given but the film as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth.".

As well as a classic depiction of hell definitely some inspiration from Dante's Inferno. The movie didn't have enough time to explore all the philosophical possibilities for heaven probably for the better because I felt it was already trying to cram in storytelling.It felt very fast paced in establishing the relationship then immediately jumping to the tragedies. Then once Robin Williams is in heaven they have to keep doing flashbacks throughout the movie and keep introducing plot points right up to the end. What irked me the most was perhaps how no one appeared to be who they really were in heaven part of being who you literally want to be. But it didn't really matter that they kept changing identities because their characters were underdeveloped and you don't associate them well with how they looked when they were alive anyway.6.510".

In this movie people do not go to Hell because they are evil but because they got confused and committed suicide. When Annie kills herself she is trapped in Hell by her confusion. Her husband Chris manages to rescue her but all the other suicides remain in Hell for eternity. Too bad for them.Anyway Chris and Annie make it to Heaven where they are safe. But Chris suggests that they be reincarnated so that they can experience life again. Of course that means taking a chance of becoming confused committing suicide and going to Hell with little likelihood of there being another rescue. Who in his right mind would chance it? But the idea is that life is so wonderful that it is even better than Heaven even worth the risk of committing suicide and being eternally damned.Of course that wonderful life involves such things as having your children die in a car accident having the marriage deteriorate to the point of almost getting a divorce and then having a husband die in an accident. Who wouldn't want the chance to experience something like that again? Who wouldn't forgo Heaven and risk Hell to experience such misery and suffering once more?".

	schema:headline " Tears That Jerk";
	schema:reviewBody "In What Dreams May Come Robin Williams plays a doctor who dies and goes to Hell. Sitting through New Zealand director Vincent Ward's visually arresting but histrionic New Age allegory about life death suicide and reincarnation is like going to Hell too. What Dreams May Come derives its title from William Shakespeare's Hamlet but prolific science fiction  fantasy writer Richard Matheson penned the actual novel. No I haven't perused Matheson's novel but people have reliably assured me that the movie pales in comparison with its literary source. An earlier and more successful Matheson novel Bid Time Return became the cult romance classic Somewhere in Time with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.Kiddie friendly pediatrician Chris Nelsen Robin Williams and his gifted artist wife Annie Annabella Sciorra of Jungle Fever are soul mates. Nothing can separate them! Dreams repeats this theme ad nauseam so that its ludicrously lackadaisical ending comes as no revelation. Meeting in their youth on a serene lake in Switzerland they court in the scenic Alps. Life blesses them. Residing in a palatial home they raise two adorable teenagers Ian Josh Paddock and Marie Jessica Brooks along with a rambunctious Dalmatian. Chris enjoys a successful practice as a doctor while Annie doubles not only as an artist but also as an art gallery curator.During the opening expository scenes Dreams bathes audiences in the warm radiance that wreathes the Nielsen home. Predictably the good times prove ephemeral. Less than twenty minutes into the action an offscreen auto accident claims the lives of both Ian and Marie. A few scenes later four years in story time Chris dies in a spectacular onscreen accident. Initially Chris refuses to believe that he has kicked the bucket. After all Chris is walking on Earth as the living do and he appears none the worse for all his wear and tear. Audiences know better however because they see his heavily bandaged body from several high angle shots that suggest his spirit has blown town. Chris eavesdrops on his own funeral. He struggles to console his griefstricken wife. Eventually his fuzzylooking spiritual guide Albert Cuba Gooding Jr. convinces Chris that he can do Annie no good by lingering. Every time that Chris achieves a breakthrough with Annie she collapses in tears and recriminations. Frustrated Chris gives up the Ghost routine.Meanwhile Annie's condition steadily deteriorates. She holds herself responsible for the accidental deaths of both her children and Chris. She let their housekeeper drive Ian and Marie to school the day of their fatal accident because she was too busy with her career. Later she dispatched Chris to get some paintings for an upcoming gallery exhibit which she couldn't fetch because she was feeling poorly. Colliding with death in a trafficclogged tunnel Chris dies playing Good Samaritan to a woman trapped in a wrecked car. After Chris's funeral Annie considers suicide. Nothing can console her not even the diary that her therapist has made her compile to deal with her grief and guilt.Veteran scenarist Ronald Bass adapted Dreams. Usually he knows what constitutes a worthwhile weepie. His impressive credits include Waiting to Exhale When a Man Loves a Woman and How Stella Got Her Groove Back. Sadly Bass's skills abandon him in this overblown loveconquerorsall melodrama riddled with chaos contrivance and a conspicuous lack of coherence. Neither Bass nor Ward focuses enough time on the Nielson family as a unit to make them seem sympathetic or charismatic. Cluttered incomprehensibly with flashbacks which come and go in fits and starts Dreams generates wholesale confusion. Ward and Bass shuttle audiences incessantly between the present and the past as well as Heaven and Hell. Not only do they weave a tangled tale but they also play musical chairs with their characters. The characters aren't so much individuals as they are puppets that stand for ideas.Despite all of this rampant confusion Dreams conjures up some of the most phantasmagorical imagery that any movie has ever offered. Lenser Eduardo Serra of Blood Diamond and production designer Eugenio Zanetti of Flatliners deserve Oscars for their sterling efforts. Even when Dreams is boring the LSD scenery is powerful. Hell resembles a conventional synthesis of Dante's Inferno and the art of Dutch painter Hieronymous Bosch.A miscast Robin Williams does a mediocre Kevin Kline impersonation. Worse reverting to his usual comic antics Williams cracks giddy jokes that clash with more than compliment this metaphysical melodrama. Sciorra suffers from a string of bad hair scenes. Williams and Sciorra both play characters that reinforce sexist onedimensional stereotypes. Chris braves Hades as the neversaydie husband hero while Annie epitomizes the hysterical damselindistress. Dreams represents Sciorra's first role after an absence of some years. Too bad that she chose to grace this posterart pabulum to stage a comeback.Only mahoganyfaced Max Von Sydow of Flash Gordon emerges with his reputation intact. Cast as 'the Tracker' he escorts Chris through Hades to find Annie. Sydow wears an outfit that combines Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name with Charon the ferryman of Greek mythology who steers the dead to Hades over the river Styx. Meanwhile Cuba Gooding Jr. brings good cheer to a role that qualifies as strictly secondary.What Dreams May Come makes the afterlife appear alluring. Admirably the filmmakers treat suicide as a big nono. Horribly they do a soft shoe where morality is concerned. In granting amnesty to Sciorra's suicidal character Dreams suggests that life and death are not altogether terminal states of consciousness. The theology of Dreams stirs Greek mythology New Age religion and JudeoChristian traditions into a thick soup that shouldn't offend anybody except diehard fundamentalists. Although thematically ambitious and visually spectacular What Dreams May Come degenerates into a sluggish schmaltzy tearjerker whose happy ending is hopeless manipulative.".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the recent loss of the incredible talent of Robin Williams I found this film incredibly moving. Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell I believe they go to heaven like everyone else  Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant  she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this his was also a great piece of acting I wouldn't expect anything less from him. I cried a lot through this film all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him also the film was very moving and does make you think it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good I've seen worse CG in films nowadays. Anyway a fantastic film and anyone wishing to see a moving performance by Robin should watch this he's incredible and always will be. I hope he's in his own private heaven at peace right now.".

Satisfying of course to see the typical good guygetsrevenge tale but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through a real treat for the eyes and mustsee on a widescreen DVD.I also put on the English subtitles on the second viewing in parts which helped me understand a few things I missed on the first viewing and had made the film just a bit confusing in several parts. That was cleared up and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances.Most fun to watch was Richard Harris as Priest the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel the man Edmond Dantes unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Yes Harris' teaching stretched credibility as he seems to teach his pupil about everything there is know in life! Harris too had some of the best lines in the movie several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel  who two years later was playing Jesus in The Passion Of The Christ  sermons about believing in God! That's Hollywood! One film you're an atheist the next you are God.For those who might think the first 3040 minutes of this movie are a bit slow stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch played by Luis Gusman who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but once again you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing making enjoyable films like this. To be fair it isn't just revenge as this film points out it's justice we all like to see. In here the two words are interchanged depending upon ones rationalizations.".

This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with but in the context of the whole story the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.Guy Pierce surprised me with a performance that was totally believable.  His dry humour only made him more appealing very well acted.The entire epic though long never gives you the impression that you have been sitting still for ages.  It moves along swiftly and always had me gripped from the action suspense and even to the humour that was evident from time to time.  The love story surprised me most of all.  Instead of taking on a highly sexual slant as all these new films do it was understated the female lead doing an admirable job of portraying the wounded lover who has always longed for her Edmund.  I loved the innocence that she managed to bring to the role a really terrific actress and a really beautiful one as well.Wonderfully scripted exceptionally carried out!  This has to be the best adaptation yet!An emphatic 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing an advance Screening of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and having only seen one advertising TV spot before hand I really did not know what I was going into this time.  I vaguely recalled it being an Alexander Dumas book and former filmTV versions featuring rather depressing prison scenes with men tunneling to the freedom of the Sea.  Indeed despite its wonderful locations and details once the aforementioned prison scenes of this version presented themselves I was set to be depressed again and wondered where the story was going.  And then several wonderful things happened A whole new group of characters were introduced to our rather whiney protagonist  some good some very bad.  And by the time said Protagonist had escaped the Prison he too had become wonderfully evoked and dynamic and I wanted to see him get everything he wanted and deserved REVENGE. From then on this film was a barrage of wonderful scripting the adaption being perfect in its pacing and wit characters acting events costumes action suspense and romance.  The audience laughed with genuine awe as each new moment or detail was revealed to us in the plans of the main character's played perfectly from his innocent beginnings to his scheming later yearssteps towards that end.  This movie was amazing with very cool performances from Guy Pearce and the rest of the supporting cast each figure getting his or her share of good lines.  The tale of vengeance is wellbalanced with tales of friendship questing and plotting and romance and all of the implications each relationship holds be it good or bad.  At times the theater openly applauded twists or returning characters.  It is perfectly timed and written with powerful moments and style and I would recommend it to ANYONE.".

	schema:headline " Satisfying revenge story from a famous book.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most famous revenge stories The Count of Monte Cristo is here turned into a dashing oldfashioned swashbuckler. The plot is riddled with unconvincing coincidences and occurences as indeed was the book but other than that this is a wellmade enjoyable film with some literate dialogue and believable action sequences. It is the fact that the action is believable that makes the film memorable because in too many 2002 releases the action was so overblown and unrealistic not to mention physically impossible that the credibility of such films was destroyed. Edmond Dantes Caviezel is a honest young sailor working out of 19th Century Marseilles. His best friend Fernan Pearce secretly craves the hand of Dantes's gorgeous fiancee Mercedes Dominczyk so he informs to the authorities that Dantes is a conspirator plotting to aid in Napoleon's escape from Elba. Dantes is sent to a terrible inescapable island prison while Fernan takes Mercedes to be his wife. After many years of hardship Dantes makes an audacious escape and having acquired a fortune by solving a cryptic treasure map slowly plots his revenge under the new identity of the Count of Monte Cristo. Caviezel was a relative newcomer when he did this film but he really catches the eye as the innocent man driven to despair by his terrible and unjustified punishment. Pearce is good too perfecting his arrogant sneer as the deplorable Fernan. The prison scenes are well shot with the hopelessness and horror of the place captured in considerably believable detail. It's quite surprising that The Count of Monte Cristo was a relative disappointment at the box office since its dramatic storyline and the themes of revenge betrayal and loss are usually guaranteed crowdpullers. This film deserves to be seen by more people and the more people that see it the more its reputation will surely grow.".

This 2002 adaptation of Le Comte de Monte Cristo is a good one.The story is about two friends. One of the friends betrays the other and that one is send to a prison on Chateau D'If. He escapes after 13 years with the help of an older man. I will not tell you the details but this part in prison is a great part. The man tells him where he can find a lot of gold. After he has escaped he wants revenge on all of them who betrayed him. With the gold he finds he becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and his plan can begin. Basically this is the story with some subplots involving Napoleon some kind of pirates a magistrate and his father a new friend and a girl who once was the fianc of the count and now is the wife of his former best friend.Everything looked pretty good. The costumes the setting everything. Th actors were all terrific. Jim Caviezel as the count Guy Pearce as his betrayer and especially Richard Harris as the older man in prison. We see the sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves in a same kind of role he has there perfect for him and Luis Guzmn as the new friend. They all do a great job together with director Kevin Reynolds also Robin Hood and the rest of the crew. 910.".

	schema:headline " I love this film!!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's kind of strange my wife and I just recently rented Rob Roy.  I remember hearing that it was quite good when it was released in the 90's. And although I can't say it was a bad film I can't really say it was all that satisfying.  It had it's moments but it is not one that will linger with any real distinction in my mind.  Usually films in that time frame intrigue me and it was a little disappointing to see such an average film with a pretty good cast.  On the other end of the rainbow you have this film.  Now even though this is not exactly the same time frame it is that type of film.  You know old England old France old whatever.  It is pre1900's.  I put all kinds of films into this category.  Anything from Braveheart to Man In The Iron Mask to Quills all falls neatly into this type of category.  Just like you would say anything from Nosferatu to Nightmare On Elm Street is horror anything pre1900 is in this type of film category.The Count of Monte Cristo is in one word AMAZING.  There are two reasons I wanted to see this film.  One is the trailer had me completely intrigued and the second is because I really enjoyed the book and the film version of Sleepers.  That was the Robert Deniro Kevin Bacon Brad Pitt Dustin Hoffman and Barry Levinson film where several youths are sent to a boys prison for an innocent enough mistake that cost someone their life.  In the film the boys are tormented by Kevin Bacon and his entourage of prison guards and one of the things that keeps them going is the book The Count of Monte Cristo.  When one of the boys is first given the book he looks at the authors name and says  by Alexander Dumb Ass? and his friend replies that's Doomaa read it it's about a guy that escapes from prison and takes revenge on the ones that hurt him.  That is not the line verbatim but you get the point.  Ever since seeing this film I have wanted to read the book. Never getting the opportunity to do so when the film was advertised I was needless to say excited.The Count of Monte Cristo is the ultimate tale of revenge.  It is a story that has stood the test of time because it is probably everyone's fantasy to right the unjust wrongs that have been comitted against them.  And oh what fun it is to imagine yourself finding a buried treasure and then making yourself a king or a count?  To have everything usurped from you only to take it all back twenty fold is not only intriguing it is absolutely diabolical and gives you a sense of power.  Perhaps that is why the story transcends generations and time frames.  Because it is a story and a concept that we can all relate to perhaps not out of experience but because we have all dreamed about it. A simple man makes a decent living is thrown into prison for a crime he didn't commit and then escapes and finds some hidden treasure and becomes the richest man in the world and extracts revenge.  How can that not sound intriguing?This present version of Monte Cristo is masterfully made.  Kevin Reynolds of Waterworld and Robin Hood fame was given the director's chair and he doesn't disappoint.  There is enough action in here for all of us looking the for next great swashbuckling adventure and there is also a trace of romance and even some humour.  Jim Caviezel plays Edmund Dantes and Guy Pearce plays Fernand Mondego. Together these two shine.  I wasn't a big fan of Caviezel's work thus far. I thought he was alright in Thin Red Line and Angel Eyes but his work in Pay It Forward as the homeless junkie really turned me off of him.  In Frequency he was quite good but that was the only film I could really recommend him in.  But I think that has all changed now that he has made this film.  He is perfect as the average peasant that works to achieve his goals and eventually as the man who has learned from the fountain of knowledge and takes his revenge.  Guy Peace on the other hand is not even recognizable in his role as the insanely jealous best friend.  When you look at his last film Memento and then see him here you won't even realize this is the same actor.  He comes across as a jealous scheming whining son of a wealthy man that has been given everything to him on a silver platter.  One of the best lines in the film describing his acerbic disposition in life is when Mercedes  the love interest in the film  tells Fernando that when he was a little boy he was upset when he got a pony and Edmund got a whistle because that whistle made Edmund happier that when Fernando had his pony.  He is perpetually unhappy and I'm not really sure what could give him any sort of concord.  He reminds me a little of the Tombstone character Johnny Ringo. Doc Holliday once described him a man who wanted revenge for being born. Perhaps Ringo and Fernand are distant cousins.A sure sign that you are enjoying a film is when you laugh at what is not even funny.  You are enjoying yourself to the point that you are anticipating with such joy at what is about to happen.  You know that sometime in the film Edmund is going to escape the prison that he is in and that he is going to find Richard Harris' treasure and extract revenge on the monsters that put him in prison.  But all the while you can't keep that goofy grin on your face.  There wasn't one moment in this film when I wasn't having a great time.  And that is not easy to do.  I think at times it is simple to become a cynic when you see as many movies as we all do.  I perhaps see a little more than the next person so when so many films begin to tread down that familiar path that it usually does the perpetual groans become standard occurences.  But this film kept me laughing entertained and anxious to see the outcome.  I love this film.  This is on par with some of the greats like Raiders of the Lost Ark Empire Strikes Back Predator Lethal Weapon and a few others that never stops the action.  There is nothing to dislike about it and there is every reason to recommend it.2001 was one of the weaker years that I can recall for the film industry. There were very few pictures that I really honestly enjoyed.  There were so many films that will take the infamous ephemeral dive.  Five years from now ask anyone what the best picture of 2001 was and not many people will recall with reverance what films came out in 2001.  But here we are in the second month of 2002 and I have already seen two films that blew me away.  Mothman Prophecies and The Count of Monte Cristo are two films that I am proud to recommend to many of my friends.  I am sure I have made Mothman an extra couple thousand dollars because of my recommending it.  I hope I can do the same for The Count.  These are two films that people should not miss.  But seeing as this is a review for The Count let's just end it by saying I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!9.5 out of 10  Just see this movie.".

I never even knew there was a film version of it until I mentioned my love for the book to a friend who informed me of the recently released movie that she too liked. I did in fact enjoy the movie but it disappointed me slightly. The book is very much different from the movie. The plot and list of characters were simplified to in my opinion make the movie easier to understand and to keep it from being 3 hours long. If you liked the plot twists and interesting characters in this movie I must insist you try reading the book. Sure it's very long and intricate but if you keep on your toes and keep all of the details in check you will absolutely love it! You will meet other characters who play a role in Dantes' downfall and a sweet love story involving characters that do not even exist in the movie! will unfold. Dantes will take on other roles not seen in the movie. It is truly an incredible piece of work written so many years ago by Alexandre Dumas. Again I say the movie was indeed good but the book is better. Please try it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Count of Monte Cristo is exactly what I expected it to be  entertaining. A classic? No. However it's far from a dud and you could do a lot worse if you want to whittle away a bit of time watching a movie. The movie version of the book leaves a bare bones plot which is quite simple. Edmond Dantes James Caviezel is falsely imprisoned for treason having been blackmailed by his friend Fernand Mondego Guy Pearce who covets Dantes' wifetobe. Queue languishment in prison where he plots his escape and his ultimate revenge on Dantes in a highly fashionable style. This movie is a neat little adaptation of the novel seeing as it manages to retain some great pacing on screen. At times admittedly you feel there's certain pieces rushed particularly towards the end as Dantes' plan unveils but since it suffices to keep the story moving along swiftly that's OK. The script is nice and witty  there's a real sense of fun permeating the movie. While Caviezel is a serious actor Guy Pearce is obviously loving his role as the dastardly Mondego hamming and camping it up with a glee that's delightful to behold  he steals the screen every time he's on it. Other members of the cast similarily light up the movie particularly Luis Guzmn as Dantes' sidekick Jacopo and a wonderful turn by Richard Harris as the highcamp prisonwarder Abb Faria I found him hilariously nasty. The direction on the movie is nice and smooth  there's no need for any fancy trickery here on the part of Kevin Reynolds. Indeed the smooth almost gentle nature of it all including well paced sword fights is a nice change from some of the more overlyexcessive energetic work of today's movies. Is the movie perfect? No. It's not smart enough or quite well made enough for that. But it is a hell of a lot of fun and most certainly enjoyable  and that's often all you want. With it's great sense of fun and some lovely performances throughout it's a worthwhile diversion for a while. I'll give it a 7.8.".

This film might be easier to engage in than the book but that's because it's a simplified version.I found the conclusion satisfying and the swordplay was shot in an interesting way.  However I was a little disappointed that after all that buildup the aristocrat turned out to be a pretender instead of a master with the blade.  Maybe his skills had ebbed from fighting weaklings forced to defend their sisters' honor.  Ah wellan entertaining film with a cast that's fun to watch.  A solid filmby no means the worst of the Dumas adaptations for a look at a spectacular villain and good action scenes wasted on a horrible film that's The Musketeer..".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I get into the review may I just say Read the book! It is phenomenal! I could not put it down and I now own it. That said I must say that the first time I saw the film version starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce I was terribly disappointed. Not that the performances were bad but it was quite unlike the book and I unfortunately a purist had major issues with all the divergences from the original plot. I have no desire to spoil the movie for anyone so if you would like to see what I mean please read the book. I went away from the movie quite upset but I have seen it a few times since then and I have to say that though it is no match for the book it does stand quite well on its own. If one were to go into the movie knowing nothing of the story it would be quite enjoyable. The performances by Cavaziel as the vengeful Count and Pearce as the villainous Fernando are without equal. Cavaziel smolders with pentup rage and Pearce slithers his way through every scene like the snake his character is. Wonderful! To be honest I do have to say that the woman playing Mercedes was not convincing nor was the actor who played her son Albert but in the face of the other great performances this is not really a big issue. It is unfortunate that the leading lady felt her character needed to be a weak sighing woman which in the book she is decidedly not but I choose to forgive this because really the rest of the movie is fantastic. Every human emotion is captured in this picture from rage to disappointment love to hate. I would recommend this movie though with the proviso that if you have read the book don't expect the movie to overly faithful. In fact you may want to watch a few times so you can fully appreciate the differences!".

As an English teacher that teaches the classics including The Count of Monte CristoI was amazed to find few similarities between the novel and this film and these similarities were questionable at best. The vengeful plot of the Count is a beautifully woven romanticized psychological thriller. After Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned on the Chteau d'If he plans to take vengeance on the men who were responsible for destroying his life. These men were Danglars Villefortand Fernandwho was not a friend of Dantes but the man who took away his love. Because of these men Dantes lost everything that was dear to him including the women he loved Mercedeswho was not pregnant by Dantes and who waited 18 months before she married her cousin. It was from the pressure of prison that Dantes carefully calculated the methods he would use to get his revenge. He wanted it to be a slow and painful sufferingbecause a quick death was too good for these men. None of this tension is evident in the film. The film bastardized a novel that was full of tension and suspense which keeps readers wanting to find out what happens next. This was Hollywoods way of chasing the almighty buck. This film did little to make me or my students want to watch it. My juniors and seniors who are not always focused on reading are thoroughly engaged in the novel because of Dumas' masterful writing. Several students have seen the film and have made the same comment I have madethis is film for people who have never read the book. So stay out of the video store save your money grab the book out of the librarysit down and let Alexandre Dumas take you on a thrilling adventure that will keep you turning the pages.".

I read the novel for the first time last year after hearing a snippet of the Orson Welles oldtime radio version which was probably a bastardization in itself.After reading the book I learned that none of the movie versions or the serialization of it had been true to the novel.They ALL apparently change the ending to make it a Hollywood ending not that the original novel doesn't have a satisfying ending on its own merits. But when you have read the book what they have done in the movie version is unforgivable.I caught this one on cable this evening and I must say the last hour was unbearable. Dumas must be rolling in his grave. They TOTALLY rewrote the book.I think this has been done because it is a difficult novel to start getting into though the reward for those who do is great. So the reference point for most people is the film from the 30s which also apparently was not true to the Dumas story.It is one thing to leave out some plot elements...this is too sprawling of a novel to film. It is better to do it as a miniseries though when that was done they also changed the book apparently...for some bizarre reason. But this book totally changed the ending and message of the book and thus eliminated all the meaning of the novel.Had I not read the book I could have enjoyed the film on its own merits but this is NOT the classic Dumas novel.If you have seen this without reading the book do yourself a favor read it. Trust me nothing has been given away. It will be like discovering a completely different story. The original by Dumas is caviar...this film version is powdered rotten eggs.".

Unfortunately Kevin Reynolds used very little of the material in his film version of The Count of Monte Cristo. He kept a majority of the characters Edmond Mercedes Fernand Albert and Danglars. However he carelessly changed their relationships motives background makeup and plot points to create his own story. As for the plot itself Reynolds kept only a bare minimum for his purposes Edmond Dantes was engaged to a beautiful girl was betrayed by people he thought were his friends imprisoned injustly by a man looking to protect himself. In prison he came upon a father figure who on his deathbed gave him the whereabouts of a great treasure. Dantes boldly escapes is rescued by a pirate ship and wreaks vengeance upon his enemies.Reynolds incorporates these points in his movie. Almost everything else contained in his movie is a creation of his own mind not that of Dumas.The movie is entertaining if you can forget it's origin. My only hope is that it might move some viewers to actually read the novel. Therein they will find a masterwork of depth and resonance.

In my mind this is inexcusable. Why even tell the story if you're going to controvert the entire point of the book?  Outside of that major gripe not much else in the movie impressed.  The acting was mediocre at best as were the fight scenes. And the plot and timing seems very forced at some times some of this is inevitable when converting a book this long into a 100minute movie but it certainly could have been done better.

	schema:headline " Johnnie To  Hong Kong's best kept secret";
	schema:reviewBody "Johnnie To is one of the world's most underrated contemporary film directors. Working in Hong Kong he effortlessly switches between genre flicks like The Mission but he's equally at home in romcoms like Needing You or Love on a Diet and weirder though sometimes even better material like 'Running on Karma' or Heroic Trio is earlier times. The man is just as prolific as he is original and even if he is derivative he is still a great effortless entertainer. His Milky Ways production company makes studio and independent films with the same dedication. His latest film 'Election' is actually in competition in this year's Cannes. The Mission is the type of film JeanPierre Melville would probably make today. Its a mix of Hong Kong Noir and stylised setpiece. It boasts some of Hong Kong acting heavyweights many of which appear also in the Infernal Affairs trilogy. Dialogue is minimal efficiency is the maxime. The music is so detached that the effect overall is almost hypnotising. The film is not perfect and the flaws hurt because this could have easily been truly great. Still it's way above average.

	onyx:emotionText "Johnnie To is one of the world's most underrated contemporary film directors. Working in Hong Kong he effortlessly switches between genre flicks like The Mission but he's equally at home in romcoms like Needing You or Love on a Diet and weirder though sometimes even better material like 'Running on Karma' or Heroic Trio is earlier times. The man is just as prolific as he is original and even if he is derivative he is still a great effortless entertainer. His Milky Ways production company makes studio and independent films with the same dedication. His latest film 'Election' is actually in competition in this year's Cannes. The Mission is the type of film JeanPierre Melville would probably make today. Its a mix of Hong Kong Noir and stylised setpiece. It boasts some of Hong Kong acting heavyweights many of which appear also in the Infernal Affairs trilogy. Dialogue is minimal efficiency is the maxime. The music is so detached that the effect overall is almost hypnotising. The film is not perfect and the flaws hurt because this could have easily been truly great. Still it's way above average. Watch this and anything else by To you can get your hands on. It boggles";

This isn't to say the movie was just one shootout after another.It isn't a mainstream A Better Tomorrow type Hong Kong gangster movie and doesn't pretend to be. It's dark the characters don't verbalise what they want to do or are thinking but the nuances are all there. But it's befitting of the setting  they're Asian male hired hands. It's not realistic expect them to be all philosophical and willing to wear their hearts out on their sleeve.I also liked the movie because it cast some of the finest Hong Kong actors who were really working as a team and no one was really glamourised to be the hero. Anthony Wong epitomises cool as his character Curtis in Chinese his character's name was really Ghost with more grunts than dialogue.Francis Ng does his edgey best as does Roy Cheung. All three went on to make Infernal Affairs one of my alltime favourites.".

Consider the scene where a sniper catches the five hit men off guard as they escort their boss to a car. One of the hit men veers off and is left behind on the conscience decision of the lead hitman. When this left behind man returns to base he slaps the lead man in the most offending manner for minutes. The lead man a tough guy named Ice allows himself to be beaten. Why? Because in their world of corrupt organizations and tight hit groups one does not leave a man behind. This sense of loyalty arises to a full extent in the third act where the men must question what is the right thing to do.The film also contains a couple of shoot out scenes. But don't be fooled you are not gonna watch The Matrix. Instead look for the wide angle lense shots of various suited hit men standing in very specific places barely moving their feet but the sequences are very exciting because if you step back it's orchestrated skillfully and cued beautifully to themusic.From the opening scroll a sort of 'laughable' techno beat pumps and all sorts of upbeat synthesized sounds fill the soundtrack to an unexpected result an acceptance.

This type of tough nitty genre relies on music and the setting of the film calls for this amped up sound.".

The characters while still stereotyped to a certain extent are not the usually uncontrolled triad powermongers that are often portrayed in other less palatable fare. These people are professionals and they knew how to get a job done. Faced with a sniper none of them panic and each of them know exactly what to do. The scene in the mall was tightly controlled and well orchestrated with minimal movement and gun fire adding more to the tension then any hail of bullets can.The direction of Johnnie To evokes images of films by John Woo whose scenes of gun fights have always in my opinion verged on poetry in motion. To's characters are restrained while the same degree of subtlety is employed with the plot. The audience in my opinion an often mindless group who are unwilling to think and must be spoon fed every little detail are left to find meanings and hints in little gestures.The film also reminds me of Things To Do In Dallas When You Are Dead. Five strangers called together to serve a mob boss who is past his prime. And again there is conflict among members of this special 'team'.In the end aside from a less than believable plot line The Mission scores high on its entertainment value both in its visual style and delivery.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen a couple of To films before this one so I kind of knew what I was getting into. This may be a HK action film but it's nothing like the more loud and workmanlike fare that has come from there in the past 15 years.Five men are called to protect a Triad boss who is repeatedly attacked by gunmen. The plotting is as simple as that. What matters here as in any other To film I've seen is the style and the contemplative pacing. Sure there are shootouts galore to quench the thirst for lead of the action fanatics but they're not all out bloodbaths or elaborate stuntwork. They're carefully choreographed and subtle in execution. The pacing might appear slow to people used to the spastic editing of Hollywood action fare like Bourne Ultimatum but therein lies the power of The Mission. You get to spend time with the characters observe the camaraderie that develops between them share the mundane parts of their job  it's not all glamour and glitz in the work of the bodyguard. In that aspect I believe Johnnie To to be equal parts Howard Hawks circa Rio Bravo and JeanPierre Melville albeit with a slick layer of HK style on top nice suits fancy cars cool glasses et al.The cast deserves a mention though. Anthony Wong Francis Ng Rony Leung Simon Yam they're all great in their respective roles understating things enough to fit with the contemplative pace of the movie. The score deserves one as well it's cheesetastic in all its casiotone synth glory. I laughed the first couple of times the music cue played but then warmed up to it until I realized it's an integral part of The Mission's peculiar charm. If anything it lends character.All in all this is a subtle action film but thoroughly enjoyable. For a much superior execution of the same idea check out Johnny To's Exiled from 2006.".

However as the unofficially loose precursor to Johnnie To's recent movie Exiled The Mission did seem quite dated but you can be dead sure that many of Exiled's plot points characterization and stylistic influences get established as far back to this 1999 movie.A triad leader Brother Lung Eddy Ko survives an assassination attack and to protect oneself you'll get together an ATeam of your merry men as bodyguards entrusting your life to the skill of their gunmanship. His brother Frank Simon Yam gathers this team consisting of your day to day average working professionals  Curtis Anthony Wong Roy Francis Ng somehow credited as Francis Wong Shin Jackie Lui Mike Roy Cheung and James played by the ever reliable Lam Suet sans pencil thin moustache.

In other words the practice of the triads code of brotherhood and camaraderie in trusting each other too with their lives as they seek an end to their mission to return to their normal lives.The Mission is a visual treat to action fans though as I mentioned the action itself might look dated. What's key here and extremely well done is the buildup. The anticipation of the prey the feeling of the unknown the entire setup for the kill. Shootouts occur in a narrow alleyway and in an abandoned warehouse amongst others but my favourite would be the one in the mall. It might be strange that as a protection detail they chose to leave in the open and when the crowd is absent. Perhaps it's easier to spot suspicious persons? One thing's for sure to enjoy the suspense forget about the why and the what if questions Where are the security guards? Where are the police but just soak in the moment. I can't get enough of those ultra cool poseur shots and the ones at the shopping mall were probably the best in the movie.The somewhat trippy somehow happy theme track made it seem a little awkward accompanying the plenty suspenseful build up but strangely it all worked even when it's used for light hearted moments. Written by long time collaborator Yau Naihoi who this year had made his directorial debut with Eye in the Sky the tale is not a gun battle a minute story but a look at the code of brotherhood amongst the men  do they follow orders to a T because their boss orders it or do they have it inside them to do what their heart tells them? If you've watched Exiled this conflict amongst the team already had its roots here and watching The Mission in hindsight you could never had guessed that this theme could alone could spin off into its own separate storyline in Exiled.My advice would be to watch The Mission and Exiled as a double bill  fans out there would probably not get enough! I'm sure I will pop both the DVDs into my player soon for back to back viewings! If you like me have watched Exiled first then this movie surely is not to be missed.The Code 3 DVD by Mei Ah Entertainment isn't really fantastic but I suppose for the price I paid you don't come to expect a chock load of extras. You get a choice of either the Cantonese language track or the Mandarin track in either Dolby Digital or Dolby Surround 5.1. However at times the audio does seem erratic and at certain points in dialogue the audio level will fluctuate inconsistently. Subtitles come in traditional or simplified Chinese and English. I watched the DVD with the English subtitles on and though it's fairly good there were minor spelling typos spotted every now and then. A letterbox version the visual transfer isn't pristine as well as it can get quite noisy and sometimes turn out to be rather blocky.As mentioned it's a bare bones version consisting of a Data Bank with a very scantily written synopsis which can also be found on the back cover of the DVD sleeve and the Cast and Crew credits which can be obtained from the actual end credits from the movie. The Data Bank comes in both English and Mandarin texts.Besides the stylish theatrical trailer 1min 25sec with no dialogue but just the pulsating soundtrack from the movie a chapter selection is included 9 chapters in total and a Best Buy section featuring the trailer for Ringo Lam's movie Victim starring Lau Ching Wan and Tony Leung Ka Fai.".

However distracting these heavenly creatures are though they do become quite rightly overshadowed by Stephen Fry in a role that could not be more perfect for him if it were based on fiction rather than fact.I have been a fan of Oscar Wilde for some time and this film gave amazingly accurate insight into the life of a great Irish literary. Indeed many a speech by Stephen Fry has been quoted word for word from the actual trial monologues and the uncanny resemblance of Fry to Wilde himself is astounding. 'Wilde' proved to be entertaining and beautiful maintaining the historical biopic status is revels in but never drawing away from the fact that this story is of real people and real events. So much can be gained by observing the prejudices of the past and such sadness realized from knowing the suffering of those who were not meant for their time. 'Wilde' deserves credit in all aspects from accuracy to acting direction and scene it is a beautiful film and a credit not only the cast and crew but to Oscar Wilde himself.".

They both provided inklings into the heart and mind of of one of the literary giants of the 19th Century. But one aspect of the tragedy because let's face it it is a tragedy. His relationship with Alfred Douglas that in a very direct way will mark his destiny. It was so difficult to believe that Peter Finch's Wilde will go to war for someone like John Frazer's Bosie. Good looking yes but devoid of the most important element if you are going to believe in the power that Bosie had over Wilde. Finch and Frazer have the sexual chemistry of two slices of white bread but here in this 1997 Wilde with Stephen Fry in the title role the mystery is revealed Jude Law makes the whole thing totally believable. The desire he inspires we see in Oscar Wilde's eyes. Stephen Fry is another Humbert Humbert to Jude Law's Lolita. Amazing when the most incomprehensible action becomes totally understandable in the face of an actor. That alone makes this Wilde my favorite.".

	schema:headline " The Role Stephen Fry was Born to Play";
	schema:reviewBody "Cinematic biographies even when they are based on a work of nonfiction are generally fictional in form and often follow an established literary structure. The filmed nonfiction documentarystyle biography seems for some reason to be more suited to the television than to the cinema screen. Wilde is essentially based on that ageold literary form the tragedy of a great man undone by a flaw in his character.It is not true to say of the film as Halliwell's Film Guide did that it attempts to reclaim Wilde as a heterosexual or even to claim him as bisexual if by that term is meant someone with an equal sexual attraction towards both men and women. It does however explore the paradox that a man who has today become a gay icon was a married father of two children. The impression given in the film however is that Wilde's marriage to Constance was not based on sexual attraction indeed we learn that the sexual side of the marriage came to an end by mutual consent after the birth of their sons. Rather it was a marriage based upon a desire for companionship for social respectability for children. Wilde is here shown as a loving father.Today Wilde is sometimes seen as a foppish effeminate dandy whose main characteristic was a biting cynical wit. That is not however how Stephen Fry portrays him in this film. He is certainly witty but also kindly sensitive and generous without any outward display of effeminacy. He is able to inspire great love in others two of the other characters in the film are shown as being deeply in love with him. One is Constance who remains loyal to him throughout and even after his disgrace refuses the demands of her family and of society that she should divorce him. Despite the general Victorian disapproval of divorce being a divorce was evidently regarded as a lesser social stigma than being the wife of a man like Wilde. The other is his first male lover Robbie Ross who remains a true friend even when he realises that his love is not reciprocated.The flaw which proves Wilde's undoing is not in itself his homosexuality in modern times it would be a strange and politically incorrect film which tried to paint homosexuality per se as a character defect. Rather it is his infatuation with Lord Alfred Douglas Bosie which clouds his judgement and leads him to act rashly and foolishly. It is a paradox that a man who wrote so wisely and perceptively of human nature in general should have shown so little judgement when judging the nature of individuals. Bosie was a young man of noble family and handsome appearance but who otherwise had little to recommend him. Here as brilliantly played by Jude Law he appears as spoilt vain selfish petulant and cruel. Whereas Constance and Robbie are in love with Wilde and Wilde is in love with Bosie Bosie is passionately and obsessively in love with himself.Apart from selflove Bosie's one great passion in life is his hatred of his father the Marquess of Queensberry. Admittedly Queensberry is an arrogant and domineering bully but Bosie takes this family quarrel beyond the limits of reason persuading Wilde to launch an illadvised libel suit over an intemperate remark. It is this action that destroys Wilde in two ways. Physically it leads directly to his conviction for gross indecency and subsequent imprisonment. Spiritually it means that the man who has always claimed to hate hypocrisy more than any other vice is forced to become a hypocrite and to perjure himself by denying his homosexuality in the witness box. Giving evidence he interprets Bosie's line about the love that dare not speak its name as referring to platonic friendship between an older and a younger man such a love dare not speak its name for fear that it will be misunderstood as sexual. It is a skillful performance but an insincere one and Wilde knows it.In his native Britain at least Stephen Fry is perhaps not best known as an actor. While he has appeared in a number of films he is equally well known as a comedian television presenter and novelist. Nevertheless he can at his best be a superb actor and Oscar Wilde seems to be a role that he was born to play. To declare an interest he was a university contemporary of mine and I knew him slightly. For all his faults and his selfdestructive nature we are always aware that Wilde is not only a great man but also a good one. This is one of the most touching performances of recent years. Fry is well supported by Law and by Jennifer Ehle as the aptlynamed Constance a woman so attractive tender and faithful that one can easily understand how a man who was basically gay could have felt such affection for her. The one performance I was less impressed with was from Tom Wilkinson as Queensberry who I felt was insufficiently forceful and explosive.The name of the director Brian Gilbert was a new one to me I have not seen any of his other films. Nevertheless Wilde is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking one of the best biopics and certainly the best literary biopic that I have seen in recent years. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This film biography of Oscar Wilde is a showcase for Stephen Fry. He not only looks like Wilde he breaths life into the many passages from Wilde's writings that are woven into the screenplay. The difference between reading Wilde and experiencing Fry's performance is like reading Shakespeare and seeing Olivier perform. An evening listening to Fry read from Wilde's works would be worth paying a tidy sum to attend.I had no idea that Wilde had married young to Constance Lloyd Jennifer Ehle in a fine performance and had two adorable boys by her. In an effective plot device periodically throughout the movie Wilde reads to his sons from his children's story The Selfish Giant. The readings are presented in a way that cleverly integrates the storyline of the writing with the storyline of the movie with Wilde being the selfish giant. And how many people know that Wilde wrote children's stories?There are many examples given of Wilde's biting wit such as Give a man a mask and he will tell you the truth The world is a stage but the play is badly cast and I find that alcohol taken in sufficient quantities can bring about all the effects of drunkenness. Fry delivers these with perfect tone.Of course a good part of the movie is devoted to Wilde's arrest and ultimate imprisonment for indecent acts with Lord Alfred Douglas Jude Law. Wilde truly did live his life in accordance with his comment Where your life leads you you must go. I defy society. As presented here Wilde is a courageous and sensitive man who was forced into a tragedy by the strictures of a hidebound society. In current America most would judge his infractions with mild distaste at worst.There are some disconcerting transitions mostly in scenes with Lord Douglas. Douglas is seen to have a volatile personality. He could be needy and tender but he could also be a firstclass ass and manipulator with an explosive temper. His fits of anger seemed exaggerated and disrupted the tone of the movie. I had a similar reaction to the sex scenes in terms of disrupting the flow. Robbie's initial advances were abrupt and without foundation. The explicit sex scenes between Wilde and Lord Douglas would have been better hinted at than seen  their kisses and embraces could well be imagined but they felt incongruous and unbelievable in the flesh.Wilde was much more than a wit. He could express emotions with eloquence. Consider this quote about encountering a previous lover after a hiatus of a few yearsLife cheats us with shadows. We ask it for pleasure it gives it to us with bitterness and disappointment in its train. And we find ourselves looking with dull heart of stone at the tresses of goldflecked hair that we once had so wildly worshiped and so madly kissed.The movie is nicely filmed with a good musical score. I wound up liking it more after having thought about it.Watching this has expanded my appreciation for Wilde as a writer and as a person  I have been left wanting to know more about him and his work.".

It should probably have focused more on his writing than on his personal life but beyond that choice the film is almost perfect.When it isn't completely perfect it has to do with the plot which has some rather weak points. The love between Wilde and Bosie is somewhat difficult to understand. They are completely different. Maybe opposites attract but not when two people live in two completely different worlds like Wilde and Bosie seem to do. Of course one could look at it from a cynical point of view and say that they both have what the other one want Wilde has money and Bosie looks but one can also look at it in a romantic way give them the benefit of the doubt and think that they really are in love. That makes the story nicer for a while and much MUCH more interesting!Beyond that I have only positive things to say about Wilde. The script is fabulous and adding a double story by putting in one of his nursery stories was a great move! One of the most best parts of the film is Wilde's speech in court. Really touching! The ending could easily have become extremely sentimental but that is cleverly avoided.Stephen Fry shines as Oscar Wilde. He is so credible and does his job so well that if I didn't know better I'd actually think that it really WAS Wilde I saw on the screen. Law and Redgrave also put in top notch performances.Everyone will probably not appreciate this film as much as I did it is a matter of whether you can deal with gay sex or not and like dramas of course but give it a try! It deserves two hours of your time and much much more!".

Instead we see Wilde as a kindly sensitive almost avuncular man. What's more surprising is the parallel absence of manifest sordidness selfloathing or desperation which one might have assumed would have been par for the course in an age where homosexuality was stigmatised and criminal. But as 'Wilde' tells it Oscar on discovering his true nature in early middle age then enjoyed a number of halcyon years in a gay literary milieu tensioned only by the childish behaviour of his lover Bosie and was taken quite by surprise when he suddenly became a figure of public scandal. Which may have been the case but it makes for a less pressing and gripping drama than one might have hoped for. What's interesting is Wilde's defence in court which has very little to do with normal homosexual behaviour or ordinary human relationships but which rather comprised a divine idealisation of the bond between a wise older person and a beautiful younger one hardly the sort of argument that gay rights campaigners would make today. A special credit should go to the team responsible for allowing Fry to appear so convincingly both a dashing young twenty year old and a ruined man on the verge of death.

Oscar Wilde was a character not only of similar physical attributes intellect and sexuality as Fry but also with the same standing in relation to society and specifically London society  the media. However for all his popularity Wilde's pecadilloes ultimately brought him public opprobrium and he fell foul of the law. Fry however rediscovered his confidence to assume a more exalted mantle in the estimation of the British public following Cell Matesgate.This film is Fry riding that public affection  and failing to really return to love frankly. Wilde is a more of a document than a drama despite super turns from Jude Law as Bosie Douglas and Jennifer Ehle as Wilde's wife. It's a competent film but it doesn't touch me at all. Most strangely perhaps is that the film fudges an assessment of Wilde's standing in retrospect neither the document nor the drama come down in judgement either way on the man or the life.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Fry alleged comedian claims to enjoy a passing physical resemblance to the real Oscar Wilde lost on me! He is also gay. This 1997 film was the culmination of several years' courtship with the Oscar legend with Fry asserting that he was born to be Wilde. This bowdlerised piece of saccharine is a serious disappointment. Worst of all it deliberately dodges the truth.Every generation concocts its own ways of lying. The 1960 treatment of the same material The Trials of Oscar Wilde managed to avoid all talk of homosexuality  which is rather like making a film about J.P. Morgan without mentioning money. Wilde is even more dishonest than that. If your aim is to canonise the man then you are under a duty to tell the truth.To the public Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was a writer and late Victorian poseur who went to prison for being a homosexual. From our 21stcentury vantage point his was a kind of martyrdom. It seems barbaric to put a man through disgrace not to mention two years' hard labour on account of his sexual preferences. Many people today particularly media types are progay making Oscar a highly suitable candidate for hero. That's the film's big mistake.The film itself is pretty enough to look at. Production designer Maria Djurkovic has pulled off a tour de force rendering the period detail with exquisite accuracy. It's a pity that the same can't be said about the screenplay's content. Jude Law's brittle Bosie exhibits the blend of effeminate elegance and semidemented rage so characteristic of the reallife Lord Alfred but the stables scene in which the sarcastic son tells the irascible father what he thinks of him is simply not believable. The Marquess was a walking volcano of insane anger and in real life Bosie was intimidated by him. He only ever sneered at the Marquess from a safe distance What a funny little man you are. The whole point about the historical Marquess of Queensberry is that he was an unstoppable halfcrazed bully. So why insert a fictional scene in which a debonair Bosie gets the better of him? Because this Wilde the 1997 emanation has to radiate Christlike goodness. And his acolyte Bosie has to champion the paragon's cause.The film's ending is badly bowdlerised. After his release from Reading Gaol our hero enjoys a blissful reunion with Bosie in sunny Rouen beneath the cathedral bells. Fade out. Though the two men really did have an encounter in Rouen it was brief and unhappy. The relationship was over. The three short years left of Wilde's life were spent in absinthesodden poverty cynically corrupting the youth of France. Wilde's end was ugly and miserable as these filmmakers well know but they choose not to refer to it.There is an argument which suggests that it really doesn't matter. Feature films are entertainment not documentaries. Wilde's story is a fable and can function on the merely mythical plane.And so it can. But when Wilde in this screenplay defines 'la vice anglaise' as hypocrisy it is ironic given the hypocritical stance of the film itself. Take for example the courtroom dramas which pop up towards the end. Oscar is a serene hero a moral giant who Christlike again permits his enemies to immolate him. This is simply not what happened. Wilde the pampered socialite chose  against excellent advice  to launch the libel case. When it all went horribly wrong the fault was wholly his own. In the witness box Wilde trapped himself with the utterly unnecessary flippancy of his answers. Wilde was noone's saint. He brazenly lied on oath and lied to his legal team. He seems an odd choice for a gay icon this man who so squalidly denied his homosexuality. The real Wilde didn't bravely await his heroic destiny he sank into morbid indecision.It gets worse. In this film we see a dignified Wilde face down two cockney lads who make an affectionate halfhearted attempt to wring money out of him. The truth was these were rent boys whom he'd used and they were blackmailing him ruthlessly. Far from seeing them off Oscar cravenly coughed up the money. His wife Constance is depicted as a saintly type who forgives him for the devastation he's brought upon her and her sons. No mention here of her changing the boys' names to eradicate the disgrace.In reality Wilde was not singled out for an unfair martyrdom. He brought disaster on himself. The arrogant attempt to 'punish' Queensberry failed and in the process opened him up to criminal prosecution. He had been recklessly flouting the law for years. Plenty of homosexual men comfortably avoided scandal the Prime Minister Lord Rosebery was sleeping with Bosie's brother. Wilde flaunted his homosexuality and knew what he was doing. A modern reader can trawl through the literary works of Oscar Wilde without ever hitting on an unambiguous statement of gay identity. Even Dorian Gray which is ABOUT homosexuality never dares to speak its name. The film could have presented Wilde as he was  flawed vain cowardly  and still have captured the tragedy of his downfall. But it took the unimaginative route.Wilde's Irishness is sometimes trumpeted as redounding to his credit as if he were a lovable leprechaun teasing the staid English with the poetry of his charming Gaelic soul. Not so. Wilde was like the rest of his tiny band of anglo exploiters an absentee rentier with no love for his colonial underlings back in Ireland. He tried to be more English than the English. A rich fop living off peasants whom he despised found himself lionised then spurned by fashionable London society because he thought that he alone could live outside the law. Now THAT would have been a film worth making.".

Wilde the pampered socialite chose  against excellent advice  to launch the libel case. When it all went horribly wrong the fault was wholly his own. In the witness box Wilde trapped himself with the utterly unnecessary flippancy of his answers. Wilde was noone's saint. He brazenly lied on oath and lied to his legal team. He seems an odd choice for a gay icon this man who so squalidly denied his homosexuality. The real Wilde didn't bravely await his heroic destiny he sank into morbid indecision.It gets worse. In this film we see a dignified Wilde face down two cockney lads who make an affectionate halfhearted attempt to wring money out of him. The truth was these were rent boys whom he'd used and they were blackmailing him ruthlessly. Far from seeing them off Oscar cravenly coughed up the money. His wife Constance is depicted as a saintly type who forgives him for the devastation he's brought upon her and her sons. No mention here of her changing the boys' names to eradicate the disgrace.In reality Wilde was not singled out for an unfair martyrdom. He brought disaster on himself. The arrogant attempt to 'punish' Queensberry failed and in the process opened him up to criminal prosecution. He had been recklessly flouting the law for years. Plenty of homosexual men comfortably avoided scandal the Prime Minister Lord Rosebery was sleeping with Bosie's brother. Wilde flaunted his homosexuality and knew what he was doing. A modern reader can trawl through the literary works of Oscar Wilde without ever hitting on an unambiguous statement of gay identity. Even Dorian Gray which is ABOUT homosexuality never dares to speak its name. The film could have presented Wilde as he was  flawed vain cowardly  and still have captured the tragedy of his downfall. But it took the unimaginative route.Wilde's Irishness is sometimes trumpeted as redounding to his credit as if he were a lovable leprechaun teasing the staid English with the poetry of his charming Gaelic soul. Not so. Wilde was like the rest of his tiny band of anglo exploiters an absentee rentier with no love for his colonial underlings back in Ireland. He tried to be more English than the English. A rich fop living off peasants whom he despised found himself lionised then spurned by fashionable London society because he thought that he alone could live outside the law. Now THAT would have been a film worth making.";

	schema:reviewBody "My review is a bit of a mixed one. To start off with I really like Stephen Fry seeing as I'm a proud owner of the complete Jeeves  Wooster. I also like Jennifer Ehle who played Constance Wilde though I've only ever seen her in Pride and Prejudice before.I didn't consider this a bad movie but I didn't consider it an extraordinarily good movie either. I kept having the feeling that it could be more than what it was. The plot seemed to jump from incident to incident without much time for the audience to fully appreciate each.In the first couple of scenes the relationship between Oscar and Constance is starting then before I know it they're married. Before I could get a full grasp of the dynamics of their marriage Oscar is sleeping with Robbie and before I could figure out how the relationships with Constance and Robbie were reconciling themselves in Oscar's mind he was onto the next one. Then before I could figure out how he felt about that he was meeting Bosie...Bosie was one of my favorite things in the film. Just when I thought he was a spoiled little rich brat he was cuddling Oscar and then once I decided he was all right after all he was whining about how boring Oscar was when he was sick. I'm sure you're witty and charming when you're ill Bosie...rolls eyesThen there were the renters. I liked the renters if only because they reminded me of the parts in the book At Swim Two Boys where MacMurrough is thinking about Oscar Wilde his hero. Of course I am not going to complain about Jude Law in bed with a naked renter either.Seeing as each relationship didn't have sufficient time to be developed however some of the nudity came across as gratuitous. Gratuitous nudity can be fine but after a while my thoughts were less Oh nice arse and more Here we go another naked renter again.I found the dynamics of the Douglas family quite intriguing and I'd love to see a movie in which Bosie and not Oscar is the main character. Bosie's father was sexobsessed had a fixation with cremation and drove one of his sons to suicide according to Bosie that is. He carried a whip everywhere and apparently used it on various members of the family. Forget the naked renters let's examine how Bosie became the way he was.Oscar on trial was of course fascinating to watch as the reallife facts of the trials could never be ruined by any screenwriter or director. However seeing as I didn't have much time to develop feelings about Oscar and his situation I wasn't emotionally drawn in.Things I liked Constance's slightly suspicious innocence of her husband's relationships. I was also fond of the scenes with their children and the fairy tale that Oscar writes and tells to them it serves as a metaphor for large portions of the film. My favorite OscarBosie scene was early on when they're walking around arm in arm while Bosie tells Oscar how he's being blackmailed. Oscar's advice on how to get rid of the blackmailing former lover was insightful as to the initial attractions Bosie has for him.In conclusion the film certainly had its great moments but it was choppy and sometimes sensationalized which in my opinion prevented it from being truly powerful.".

	schema:headline " The same story told in two very different ways";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film a day after I first saw Ken Hughes' The Trials of Oscar Wilde 1960. Seeing them both in rapid succession is an oftenconfusing experience that makes one want to run straight to the nearest Wilde biography to find out exactly what is the true story.That is they present pretty much the same sequence of events though with greatly differing perspectives. The most obvious being that of Wilde's sexuality. Now whether it is because of Fry being cast in the lead role for the 97 movie who was famously quoted as being 90 homosexual or that the earlier film wouldn't have got past the censors the two takes on the character are wildly different. While it can be interpreted that Peter Finch's Oscar and John Fraser are lovers it is generally presented that they are not and that Wilde was the innocent victim of a blackmail attempt that cost him his reputation. Certainly the halfdozen or so witnesses in his trial are identified as criminals not as renters and there is no nudity or profanity in what would then have already been a controversial film.While the former may have presented a more sympathetic edge being authorised by Wilde's son the latter presents an Oscar and Lord Alfred Bosie Douglas that are not only homosexuals but also Bosie especially promiscuous ones. This also casts a different light on the trial sequences where what was an innocent man wrongly convicted becomes a man who while not deserving of conviction lacks the courage to admit his true nature. This also seems rather harsh on Constance a woman whom he marries as I have to marry someone. Jennifer Ehle is used for appearance' sake in this film though in the 1960 picture Constance as played by Yvonne Mitchell is someone he once loved yet merely bores him. On the other hand Jude Law is convincing as the sort of man Wilde could have a sexual relationship with while John Fraser strikes more of a masculine buddy role in the previous film. What I missed in the second movie was the drama such as when Wilde begs Bosie in tears not to kill him while in Brighton. With Wilde we don't really get to know the characters to the same degree and all but Fry and Law are peripheral in its construction.Fry meanwhile almost matches Finch's portrayal with a softer more vulnerable Wilde that seems less at ease in front of an audience. I was amazed when I found out that Wilde is only five minutes shorter than Trials  it seems far less it's construction not as rigid. Maybe this is because it tries to tell so much more the story begins before his soulless marriage to Constance and continues after the point at which Trials concludes. Neither however features Wilde's death though the Fry vehicle does have a postscript to account for this. Less coherent Wilde lacks the pace or form of its predecessor. Where the Hughes film had a clear plot Oscar caught between a fatherson feud this only forms after several minutes in the later film and with less attention to Wilde's degeneration in the public eye. The major flaw with the second movie is of course what the playwright was most renowned for his wit. Where Peter Finch gets to try his hand at the best of Oscar's quips  at least until his eventual downfall  Stephen Fry gets but a handful of oneliners to try out. Rather like casting a man in the role of Jesus and not letting him utter a psalm or perform a miracle.The pace of each individual scene is longer with classical music adding an easier pace meaning large jumps in time must account for it's leisurely style. Two ways in which the second film does score over it's older relation is in Wilde's incarceration and the settings. In truth the settings are very much a matter of personal taste and Trials must be commended for having no outside filming and conducting it's many horsedrawn carriages in the studio. Wilde meanwhile takes full advantage of rich countryside and stately homes to present its vision. And whereas for the former we got scant scenes in what was just another set dressed as a jail here we get to see the hard labour only referenced in the former and witness the dirt and desperation whilst in prison.If I had to choose between the two films then I would suggest the Peter Finch version to be superior in pacing construction and interest. Though in truth they are both very different films with very different agendas. Wilde is a good film though it's wistful often indifferent pacing and lack of drama make it slightly the weaker but an interesting film experience nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two very fine films about Oscar Wilde came out roughly at the same time during the sixties and they starred Peter Finch and Robert Morley respectively as the great literary icon. But those were in the days before Stonewall and you couldn't be all that explicit. I'm not just talking about sex scenes though there are some here. As far as films were concerned homosexuality was the love that really dare not even breathe let alone speak its name.One reason I liked this film Wilde that starred Stephen Fry in the title role is that the others began with Wilde's involvement with Lord Alfred Douglas played here by a sexy Jude Law. Here we get a bit of background and we discover that Wilde was a latent case for years because society dictated gay was an abomination. He married and fathered two sons whom he no doubt loved. Just some of the beautiful children's stories he did write attest to that.But as the film opens with Wilde in America and touring a mining camp and giving a lecture to miners below the earth's surface you can see the look of love in his eyes as he beholds some of those hunky miners with their shirts off. Since you know who Wilde was and his story already you're looking yourself for signs.Wilde was a latent case until he was seduced by Robbie Ross an actor in one of his plays portrayed by Michael Sheen. I can certainly attest to the fact that if gay is your orientation and you've been with women before when you do it the first time you KNOW it's right for you. Later on Ioan Gruffud who apparently is his inspiration for Dorian Gray actually falls in love with Wilde.But Wilde's like a kid in a candy store and when he meets the incredibly handsome Lord Alfred Douglas. Unlike the other two Wilde pictures I mentioned this version fleshes a bit more out of 'Bosy's' character and Jude Law may be pretty to look at but he's a vain shallow selfish and spoiled young aristocrat. Among other things Law introduces Fry to is the availability of rent boys on the street and at certain posh establishments frequented by closeted Victorians.But it all comes to an end when Bosy's dad played by Tom Wilkinson leaves a calling card accusing Wilde of being a sodomite. In the other two Wilde films it's Oscar who just arrogantly think he can squash this thing in court with his fabled wit. Here it's Bosy who pushes Wilde into it.The other films concentrated on the trials civil and criminal. In Wilde the emphasis is on Oscar's character and relationships. The women in Wilde's life are wife Jennifer Ehle and mother Vanessa Redgrave. In watching the two women how they interact it's like watching the families of Ennis and Jack from Brokeback Mountain and how they react to their husband's strange behavior.Also in the film very briefly is Orlando Bloom playing a rent boy. I'm surprised that the film received no Oscar nominations no pun intended. Though it was honored in the United Kingdom.Some 40 years after Stonewall the tragedy of Oscar Wilde not being true to his nature as he says he wished he had done from the beginning is still being played out in many areas in many walks of life. Just look at the number of outings there have been of various political figures on the right and you know it is so.Wilde is a great film which speaks to this generation of GLBT people with current players to tell sadly an often repeated story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wilde is an episodic Masterpiece Theatrestyle look at the famous playwright Oscar Wilde and his notorious trial and imprisonment upon sodomy charges at the turn of the last century.  While not a penetrating or indepth look into Wilde's character it does keep your interest with a fast moving look at a fascinating life.Unfortunately the film begins with an already famous Wilde and gives us no real insight into his beginnings or character.  Stephen Fry is an inspired physical choice as Wilde but is content to show us only a genteel endlessly patient and saintly man whom young men are constantly throwing themselves at.  One longs to see a more multifaceted depiction. Also there's a distractingly awful makeup job in the prison scene with his wife toward the end looks like he's coated with gray paint!The gay sex scenes which some other commenters have alluded negatively to are actually pretty mild I thought  some kissing and hugging some rather discreet huffing and puffing under the sheets and a few bare buttocks. Nothing anyone would get worked up over if it were a man and a woman doing it onscreen so why the double standard?A special word of praise to Zoe Wanamaker who plays Wilde's society friend Sphinx and who is acerbic and wonderful in her few scenes  one wanted to see much more of her!".

	onyx:emotionText "Wilde is an episodic Masterpiece Theatrestyle look at the famous playwright Oscar Wilde and his notorious trial and imprisonment upon sodomy charges at the turn of the last century.  While not a penetrating or indepth look into Wilde's character it does keep your interest with a fast moving look at a fascinating life.Unfortunately the film begins with an already famous Wilde and gives us no real insight into his beginnings or character.  Stephen Fry is an inspired physical choice as Wilde but is content to show us only a genteel endlessly patient and saintly man whom young men are constantly throwing themselves at.

Like the warm voiceover of Wilde's own short story THE SELFISH GIANT whenever the story draws in with Oscar's interactions with his two young sons Wilde is the giant who is destined to suffer from the wounds of love again Fry's performance is unarguably the film's strongest suit notably his speech about the unspeakable love during the court scenes.Oscar Wilde's astonishing talent and homosexuality are two sides of his personae as one might expect the film follows suit in exploring the more sensational latter while the former can only be glanced through his witty loquaciousness and the aforementioned court speech truly the gay melodrama is what audience ask for only if we could also given some leeway to enter his kingdom as a writer. Then the drama Bosie is viewed as a capricious needy ungrateful and selfish goodfornothing who is the undoing of Oscar Wilde's tragedy ended with an early death in destitute. There is unequalled devotion between them which Wilde is not too blind to notice but his naivety a common characteristic among great artists convinces him that Bosie is a spoilt boy who needs love wantonly and inordinately and he is willing to do whatever he asks and eventually comes down from his high horse and becomes a convenient lever utilised in the detrimental fatherson retaliation between Bosie and his father. Fry gives a sympathetic performance but for Wilde we can only assume that he has only himself to blame meanwhile the film makes Robbie his sole loyal friend in his last days watch the doom befalls on the one he loves they would make a much better match only if Wilde could be more sensible in his mind takes the gargoyle looking over the pretty boy that's the typical gambit for a melodrama as if that happens so common in real life.Jennifer Ehle who REALLY should play Meryl Streep in a biopic is the benevolent but tormented wife who marries a closeted gay man but instead of hatred and complaint her support of Wilde defiance against the convention even in his lowest moment is a shining beacon in this biopic Ehle elicits amazing nuance in it. This is the very first role introduces Jude Law into the international cinema where his Adonis attractiveness would peak two years later in Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY 1999 810 in WILDE he is less refined but incredibly right up Bosie's rally an amoral wayward snob a selfseeker banks on his vainglory so is Wilkinson as his father a showstopper with his boorish umbrage like father like son indeed one might protest the upper society doesn't get a fair treatment in the movie but de facto they are the last bunch on earth who needs a sentimentally sympathetic response from the mass so whatever R.I.P.

Billy Connolly is excellent his wit and charm is on display throughout the film and it is very very funny most of the time.Unfortunately it is slightly too long and there are a few bits that could have been quite easily cut without harming the story. Billy seems to spend an awful lot of time mooning around churches and the 'divine intervention' bit is embarassingly bad and entirely unnecessary. Quite frankly whoever came up with this scene should be shot!However having said that the film does have many qualities. The scenery is fantastic and the cast are generally excelent. Judy Davis is very good as the journo who takes an interest in Connolly's case. She strikes some nice romantic sparks of Connolly who is in great swearing ranting mode throughout. Colin Friels is also pretty good as Connolly's brother and Wendy Hughes is nice as the prickly but understanding exwife.I can't imagine many Jews would be too pleased with the portrayal of the Rabbi So we just prove there is no God ...who cares! seems to be his attitude but generally the film is pretty amusing with an interesting premise.As I say there is at lease one totally shoddy scene and some unnecessary wandering that could have been fixed by a decent editor but still if not a classic still a genuinely funny film and well worth seeing.By the way Connolly gives a fantastic and quite different acting performance as an excon artist in the Debt Collecter 1999. Get a hold of this Scottish thriller if you are a Connolly fan as it is absolutely brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's too easy to dismiss The Man Who Sued God as 'just' a lighthearted romantic comedy. Any genre can be elevated to the level of genius if it's done this well.Starting with a brilliant premise  challenging the stupid 'act of God' terminology used by the insurance industry  this film explores the philosophical ramifications. Is there a God and is He responsible for random misfortunes? Does organized religion really believe what it preaches? And how does it respond to a logical even legal challenge to its dogma? At the same time the film follows an eccentric but extremely likable character played by the inimitable Billy Connolly as he seeks his own form of redemption. And it adds a quirky yet equally likable news reporter whose views are drastically different from Connolly's.It's a formula to be sure but it's worked out brilliantly. One comparison that comes to mind is Adam's Rib which uses the law and some very witty dialog to explore marital relationships. And the ending is absolutely perfect resolving all the questions with just the right mixture of theology and enlightened common sense. Instead of a heavyhanded Hollywood resolution we get something more delicate and subtle but also far more satisfying.The Man Who Sued God manages a difficult feat  being both hilariously funny and deeply thoughtprovoking. It's a nearperfect film and a highly enjoyable one as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scottish stand up comedian Billy Connolly recently featured in The Last Samurai plays divorced and disillusioned exlawyer Steve Myers who now whiles away his time on a fishing boat in New South Wales Australia. One afternoon his boat which is now basically his life is destroyed by a bolt of lightning which also results in a chard of the hull being embedded in his foot. On crutches he approaches his insurance company who refuse to pay as the incident is deemed an 'Act of God'. Connolly's traditional Celtic brand of outrageous yet amusing expletives result in his being carried unceremoniously out of the building. Undeterred by this he decides to challenge the very meaning of the term 'Act of God' which by it's very nature determines that someone in this case God is responsible and if someone God is responsible then they or He can therefore be sued or at least their or His representatives can. The subsequent court case generates a media storm as Myers a not unaccomplished and uncharismatic courtroom tactician initially runs rings around his opponents. Thus begins the David and Goliath battle between the little man and the formidable powers of the Church and the massive legal and insurance firms in their employ. Myers also gathers 800 or so coplaintiffs all victims of the 'Act of God' clause to support him in his case. It eventually gets to the point where it looks like the only way the church are going to win their case is to prove that God doesn't exist. It's a clever simple premise and one you wish you'd thought of yourself. It's no coincidence that Connolly's character is a fisherman or even a fisher of men and that his beef is with the corrupt insurance companies representing an apparently corrupt church. If it was suddenly discovered that Christ was Scottish then it would have been Connolly calming the storm out on the Sea of Galilee and Connolly who threw the moneylenders out of His Father's house and hirsute and ranting as he is in this movie impressive he would have been too. Billy Connolly as Christ  now that would even give Mel Gibson a run for his money I bet he'd be great at parting the Red Sea oh no that was Moses wasn't it. Never mind he could play that role too nobody seems to worry about accents in movies anyway and in fact he almost pleads to the court on behalf of his coplaintiffs 'Let my people go' or rather 'Give my people their money you bastards' but with a smile and a twinkle in the eye that only Connolly can get away with  well him and Sean Connery. Why haven't they been teamed up in a movie? It seems like a match made in Heaven to me. There are many storms brewing toward the end of the film Religious zealots surround the courthouse hurling abuse at the blasphemer Myers Myers can't afford to lose the case the lawyers can't afford to either nor can the church and there's also a mighty wind storm approaching the town bringing forest fires and floods and no doubt frogs plague and locusts with it. Needless to say it's a happy ending the lawyers and the church get their knuckles rapped the image of God remains untarnished of course Myers gets the girl and the zealots go home sulking and dragging their large wooden cross with them in another Christ reference. It's a refreshing film as most Australian movies are. There's great attention to character and background detail. Connolly Water Mrs. Brown Muppet Treasure Island Boondock Saints Timeline undoubtedly a talented actor and comedian is obviously cast for distribution purposes Myers isn't a particularly Scottish name after all and seems a little out of place in the Australian backdrop but his rants are very funny. Veteran and versatile Australian actress Judy Davis Deconstructing Harry Celebrity Absolute Power The Reagans as Myers' journalistic coconspirator and love interest is subject to some slapstick humour as a drunken and literally legless Myers wrecks a restaurant and the excellent supporting cast are all the more convincing for their unfamiliarity.".

The phrase Act of God universally used in insurance policies gets a severe thrashing in the film and in the process leaves one doubled up in uncontrollable laughter.  It's a real winner...a film guaranteed to send you home with a smile on your face.  Steve Billy Connollyis seeking replacement of his fishing boat which has been destroyed in an unexpected lightning storm but his insurance company refuses to pay a cent on the grounds that the catastrophe was an Act of God.   Not satisfied with this decision Steve recruits family friends and action groups to back him up in a court of law.  The storms at the beginning and end of the film are something to behold.  The cinemaphotography throughout is praiseworthy and the shots of the Australian coastline warrants special mention.   The plot may not be quite believable but it is original and makes for a good story.  The church interiors are serene and inspiring and there are other quiet and tender moments as well but on the whole the action rattles along at a rollicking good pace.  Billy Connolly obviously relishes the part of the boisterous fisherman as he strives onward in a kind of David and Goliath battle.  In short he is well cast.  When the going gets really tough Steve consults his dog Arthur who stands by his master through thick and thin.   There is an amazing climax in the final court scene which ensures that everyone leaves the theatre with a good feeling deep down inside.".

This is a real shame as it sucks the punch out of the story and undermines some good performances and some good comedy.Here's a few problems with the direction and script that bothered me while watching this Characterisation With the exception of the main characters all other characters are poorly drawn. The TV and Radio hosts are badly acted along with the TV interviewers who stand on the steps of the court house. The problem is that these are the elements that we as viewers are the most familiar with leaving me with the impression that they just couldn't be bothered to pay enough attention to the detail.Music Oddly the music editing in this film is amazingly distracting. The music is often too loud over the actors voices which makes it hard to concentrate on the performances. Also it seems that the editors couldn't resist in laying music over almost every scene. Basically there's way too much music and it's used heavy handedly throughout.The Love Story Where the  did that come from? There was a nice bit of friendship chemistry between the two leads but I don't think there's any element of the film that hinted at them falling in love until they start snogging. I think the film would have been stronger if they'd remained friends with a strong respect for each other.Cop out ending It seems that the writers wrote themselves into a bit of a corner and by the beginning of the third act you start to wonder how their going to get themselves out of it. For a film that raises a pretty serious issue they seem to abandon their principles at the last moment which is a shame because it's the main hook of the movie in my opinion. Plus and ill conceived sign from god episode which is completely pointless.Summary A reasonable vehicle for Billy Connelly who is as watchable as ever but unfortunately it lacks the courage of its convictions.".

But it told us it in a sharply witty and deftly handled way. These are all amongst Billy's favourite social comments and although he didn't pull too many punches he showed the real power of cleverly directed humour in exposing the hypocrisies of the establishment.Some may claim Billy has himself become an establishment figure and other reviewers here have been harsh on his failure to ram home the assault on the churches. I think we all know Billy's opinion on the Catholic church in which he was raised but he chooses in this film to leave a little bit there for those who like to still hold on to the mysteries. However he does lampoon the religious fanatics who consider that they and they alone have a hotline to God and they are the sole custodians of absolute truth.The only spoiler for me was the attempted Scottish accent from Colin Friels. And I couldn't quite figure out the plot twist that had two Scots sons following their father into the old established family law business but happening to be doing so in Sydney???It isn't destined to ever be regarded as a great movie classic but as a low budget piece of irreverent ! Aussie fun and a great vehicle for Billy's comic talents and the terrific acting of Judy Davis it was pretty much right on the money. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the Circus of Dr. Lao. We show you things that you don't know. Oh we spare no pains and we spare no dough but we're going to give you one helluva show!And the Good Doctor certainly did thanks to the boundless imagination of producerdirector George Pal the cuttingedge script from Twilight Zone veteran Charles Beaumont and of course MGM's remarkably talented makeup wizard William Tuttle whose efforts for this film earned him a Special Achievement Oscar long before Best Makeup ever became the more permanent category it is these days.The story based on the book by Charles Finney takes place at the cusp of the early 1910's. The setting is a small Arizona town named Abilone whose inhabitants are facing a crisis that threatens the overall future of the town. The greater crisis however lies in the townsfolk's own humanity and the balance of our story follows Dr. Lao and his Circus as they transform that crisis into a better understanding.At the heart of the town's battle to survive is the personal conflict pitting newsman Ed Cunningham John Ericson against town shyster Clinton Stark Arthur O'Connell. Only the intervention of the Circus will permit them to come to terms with who they really are as opposed to who they should become. Ed has also fallen in love with Angela Benedict the town librarian Barbara Eden and must confront his own passions for her while covering Dr. Lao's Circus.But when Angie's young son Mike Kevin Tate befriends Dr. Lao the film is strengthened with its greatest wisdom one that is best explored when the entire family watches this film. The whole world is a circus if you learn to look at it the right way the sevenmillenniaold Dr. Lao reminds his new friend. Every time you pick up a handful of dust and see not the dust but a mystery a miracle right there in your hands  every time you stop to think 'I'm alive and being alive is fantastic!'  every time such a thing happens Mike only then are you part of the Circus of Dr. Lao.Even today I still shed a tear when I see this film especially during the scene in which Lao summons Merlin the Magician to perform for the good folks of Abilone. Most of them have pretty much lost their ability to believe in magic. But not Mike Benedict. How can you not be moved to tears when you see Merlin tenderly embracing the lad to thank him for having believed in the wonder of Magic?The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao is one of the few quintessential examples of the astounding range of Tony Randall's acting versatility.... a versatility we will most certainly miss.... and most certainly remember.As my Wizardly alter ego Blackwolf will tell you that one scene  Merlin's magic show  holds a special place in the hearts of all Magicusers. With the news of Tony Randall's death having just gone out over the wires I think fans of Dr. Lao will want another look at this remarkable little film that reminds us all how important it is to take a look at ourselves and our future. This is Dr. Lao's greatest feat and to accomplish it he tells the tale of The Fall of the City to the townsfolk of Abilone. Using stock footage from George Pal's Atlantis The Lost Continent interspersed with new footage featuring the Dr. Lao adult cast performing double duty as various Atlantean inhabitants and the awesome strains of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor booming in the background The Fall of the City sequence is a masterpiece of drama and an inspiring reminder that life is worth the battle so long as you learn something from it.Overall The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao is that rare curiosity of a movie the kind that has something to say and says it eloquently without preaching or sensationalizing its subject matter. We should all thank Tony Randall for having taken on this unique oneofakind filmmaking challenge. That I think is why we will miss him most of all.".

	schema:headline " Special thanks to Tony and Me  Jack Klugman";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll start off by letting you knowI'm not going to rehash the story in my review. Everyone's pretty much covered itso I'll just hit what were the highlights for me. First of allI grew up with The Odd Couple reruns in the early 1980son channel 5 here in PhoenixAZ. I loved what Tony  Jack did together. So I was sad when I heard about Tony's passing and was compelled to read Mr. Klugman's book Tony and Me. In the bookJack recommends seeingThe 7 faces Of Dr. Laocalling it a rare gem. He is certainly correct. I had never even heard of or seen this movie anywhereanytime or anyplace in my lifewhich I find odd. AnyhowI think what sets a person up to watch this movie is you think it's going to be another typical western. It couldn't be anywayit's set in the early 1900's. With Lao's riding in on a horse with a goldfish bowl in the saddleyou know it's going to be a strange trip. I was glad to see that Tony Randall got to speak in normal English and not just as the stereotyped Chinaman. For a movie filmed in 1963it has great ideas and daring scenes. Scenes like the one with Barbra Eden and Pan the God of Joy. As someone statedfor this erait's a pretty racy scene. Especially since in most films long agoyou rarely saw a woman demonstrate her desires like that. Other scenes are Merlin the Wizardwho ends up letting down his audience but then again they were being impossible with himso maybe he did it on purpose? Who knows.The scene with our resident villain and serpent who resembles him is a great character assassination on the part of said serpent. The whole scene is hilarious but true. Some people think too highly of themselves. That fact is later set in stone when he gets his fortune read by Appollonius. Although depressing and very surprisingAppollonius' brutal honesty in reading futures is what makes the two scenes with that character compelling. He's not catering to their egos or whimshe's cursed' to tell the absolute truth. I love how Tony R. submerges himself into these characters!The Medusa scene probably would have scared me if I were a kid but it's still a bit of an uncomfortable thoughtbeing turned to stone. At least Medusa shut up that loud mouthed woman! Seeing Mr. Randall in that make up...sort of like Boy George 20 years beforehand. The second night of Dr. Lao's circuswith the overhead visualiztion is great too. I love how the scene goes black and they all wake up in the town hall. Ready to vote to sell or save their town.Grantedthe special effects in the film are a product of their time but since it's fantasyit really doesn't take anything away from the film. In factwhen the seaserpent attacksit's no less exciting for not being computer animated.I mostly just like the honesty of the characters. These aren't your average movie characters. They are very much like real people of that era. After watching thisI can't believe it wasn't even considered for a Best Picture Oscar. My Fair Lady a better film? I think not. Find Lao wherever you canI guaranteeit'll be worth it.".

	schema:headline " Wonderfully unique fantasy with amazing performance by Tony Randall";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a oneofakind fantasy film a neglected masterpiece. It was produced and directed by the great George Pal pioneer creator of quality sciencefiction and fantasy films in the 50's and 60's Destination Moon The Time Machine War of the Worlds Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.It was based on a underground cult novel from the 30's The Circus of Dr. Lao by Charles G. Finney and the screenplay was written by master fantasist Charles Beaumont The Twilight Zone Corman's Masque of the Red Death. And it starred the late Tony Randall in the performance of his career the central character who constantly transforms into all sorts of magical mythological identities from the mysterious immortal Chinese mage Dr. Lao to the ancient legendary magician Merlin to the pagan fertility god Pan to the mythical Greek seer Appolonius to the fearsome snakehaired Medusa to the Abominable Snowman and so on. William Tuttle's amazing Oscarwinning makeup helps Randall achieve each transformation. Dr. Lao brings his wondrous Bradburyesque traveling circus to a small Arizona town at the beginning of the 20th century and the townsfolk witness a series of impossible creatures supernatural spectacles as they learn hidden lessons and transcendent truthsas does the audience in this supremely imaginative truly magical film. As the kindly supernatural Lao tells the little boy who wants to run away from home to join the carnival The whole world is a circus if you look at it the right way.

It was produced and directed by the great George Pal pioneer creator of quality sciencefiction and fantasy films in the 50's and 60's Destination Moon The Time Machine War of the Worlds Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.It was based on a underground cult novel from the 30's The Circus of Dr. Lao by Charles G. Finney and the screenplay was written by master fantasist Charles Beaumont The Twilight Zone Corman's Masque of the Red Death. And it starred the late Tony Randall in the performance of his career the central character who constantly transforms into all sorts of magical mythological identities from the mysterious immortal Chinese mage Dr. Lao to the ancient legendary magician Merlin to the pagan fertility god Pan to the mythical Greek seer Appolonius to the fearsome snakehaired Medusa to the Abominable Snowman and so on. William Tuttle's amazing Oscarwinning makeup helps Randall achieve each transformation. Dr. Lao brings his wondrous Bradburyesque traveling circus to a small Arizona town at the beginning of the 20th century and the townsfolk witness a series of impossible creatures supernatural spectacles as they learn hidden lessons and transcendent truthsas does the audience in this supremely imaginative truly magical film.

Ed has unrequited love for the widow librarian Angela Benedict Barbara Eden and opposes to the powerful rancher Clint Stark Arthur O'Connell that wants to buy the lands of the inhabitants of Abalone. He uses the argument that the water supply pipe is decayed and needs to be replaced and it will be very expensive.

There is a meeting in the town to decide whether the locals will sell their real estates to Stark or not but the decision is postponed after the arrival of Dr. Lao.

It's playful original and moralizing feelgood fun for all the family. Directed by cinema's preeminently fantasist George Pal. The legendary director who already shot a few delightful myths and fairytales such as The Time Machine' Atlantis' and The Wonderful world of the Brothers Grimm'.  This time he bases his film on a famous novel and it's a successful adventure with unlimited imagination. Tony Randall puts on quite a show as the multifaced illusionist Dr. Lao. He arrives with his circus in a neardead little town. A greedy magnate wishes to buy the entire town and makes the inhabitants believe their properties are worthless. With a little help from a news reporter Dr. Lao faces the townies with some of the smaller joys of life and their own consciousness. Both fortunetelling sequences are fascinating and remarkably written and  in order to be complete  the story foresees a touching romance. There are tons of educational and mythical aspects to discover in this filmlots of facts about the Greek Mythology for example! The creature effects and makeup are terrifically kitschy and rather charming. Recommended for sure! Seven Faces of Dr. Lao is some of the most pleasant fantasy adventures of the sixties and it has the right to a larger fanbase!".

I'm sure there's been criticism even before it became COMPLETELY popular to do this about having a nonChinese actor play the part just as there's been with Kung Fu a show that strangely resembles this story. But Tony Randall and his makeup were so good that there hardly seems reason for it. Even the thick accent the character used part of the time was really another one of his disguises not even meant to be his real voice. So whether it's called political correctness or something else criticizing this movie or Kung Fu itself for THAT reason seems really off the point. One scene though I'm sure it's been gone into here that temporarily takes it out of the family film category is the Pan scene with Barbara Eden which shows how hot a scene can be in the middle of a completely different kind of story. But one thing that doesn't always seem to be mentioned is that Pan is played by TWO actors first by Randall himself and then by John Ericson because the whole scene is about her suppressed feelings for the Ericson character. If there's one part that's a fly in the ointment to me and unfortunately it's a pretty big part it's the Atlantis story that Dr. Lao shows as a kind of movie at the circus. Compared to all the other little lessons in the story I think this one was pretty heavyhanded. And there was the kind of depressing scene between the Lee Patrick character and Apollonius but it doesn't stand out in the same way. At least that scene had the great line I only read futures I don't evaluate them.".

The special effects might be a bit dated but this is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects anyway it has a real story at the center that can entertain adults as well as children.Tony Randall is wonderful as Dr. Lao and all the other characters here we see him at the top of his form bringing the character to life in a way that few other actors could have done. He freely switches accents explaining that he does it to confuse people. In the tradition of all ageless mythological clowns such as Kokopelli the native American Coyote Harlequin and Pierrot Dr. Lao is a trickster and a comic laughing at human frailties even as he pretends to sympathize with them he is not without heart however.I agree with another review who commented on the scene with Apollonius it is well written and one of the best scenes in the movie. The scene with the snake is well done too he tears into Stark's insecurities and doesn't let go. Where a lesser film would have relied only on the topical imagery of a talking snake this scene exposes the antagonist's black soul a remarkable bit of writing for what might otherwise be a pedestrian children's film.The movie is littered with memorable scenes Dr. Lao fishing at a dry streambed Tony Randall sitting in the circus audience shaking his head the old harpy being turned to stone a Loch Ness monster's rampage accompanied by the sound of bagpipes Barbara Eden's icy librarian learning that there's more to life than just books if you know what I mean.This is a very good imaginative film and I think there are lessons in it for everyone.".

Back then I didn't see a message in it but enjoyed it absolutely.As a teenager in philosophical discussion with my friends someone mentioned this movie with the comment that 7 Faces of Dr. Lao contained a profound message but not everyone got it. This got me thinking that perhaps I needed to see it again.I was in my 30s before VCRs became common household items and video stores appeared in all the shopping centers. I began renting copies and sharing it with friends asking the important question Does this movie contain a message or is it just entertainment?I have always enjoyed the responses from those I have persuaded to watch it most of them my age or older who did not see it back in the 60s all of them saying Yes this movie has a message.Several of those have commented that this movie was way ahead of it's time before people thought much about profound meanings in stories that were popular at the time. I would often respond that it was indeed unique for it's time but even today I am unable to find another movie to compare it with.How this message has been interpreted has already been well covered here so I will now focus on the other things that makes this movie so special.It came as a great surprise to me that Tony Randall did not consider this his best work as I did. Yes he was great as Felix in The Odd Couple but in 7 Faces he played multiple roles. Whenever I watch it I enjoy the way he changes voice and dialect from one line to the next. True not all characters he played had speaking parts and in the case of the snake it was a voiceonly part. Still I would think the late great Tony Randall would be pleased with having this opportunity to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.The special effects were well up to date for 1964 though not so impressive today but I still enjoy seeing the fish turn into a sea serpent almost as much as I did seeing it the first time.All of my friends enjoyed seeing Frank Cady who we remember as Sam Drucker from Green Acres.Who can ever forget Barbara Eden?There are those who have commented that today it is not considered politically correct to have a white man playing a Chinese man but let's remember that Peter Sellers and David Carradine have also done this.One friend I have shared this movie with said How can anyone not see the message in it? It smacks you in the face!I give this movie a 10 in consideration of it being made in 1964 and that no producer to my knowledge has made anything like it since.To anyone who has ever thought deeply about why we are here and has a sense of humor I recommend The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.".

This film shows adult corruption a woman Barbara Eden no less nearly being seduced by a halfman halfgoat out of Greek Mythology. It pieces together a lot of Greek Mythology with the destruction of Pompei  a tale about the Loch Ness Monster. The film was treated very unfairly by critics when it was released as enemies of Tony Randall ganged up  shot the film down. This is unfortunate because this film is much better than the critics who might not have liked Randall due to personal reasons not because of the quality of the film.Arthur O'Connell who would go on to some good television work does well in this film as the bad guy Stark whose trying to steal all the land in town because the railroad is coming. In that way the plot is reused later in Blazing Saddles by Mel Brooks but this film is more cerebral than the latter film. Frank Cady is in this film in support  he had worked on Pal's When Worlds Collide too  went on from this in television as the owner of Druckers store  postmaster of of Hooterville on TV's Petticoat Junction Green Acres  appeared on the Beverly Hillbillies.Dr Lao's Circus is kind of like a mirror that exposes all of us to really solid entertaining film. The mystery surrounding Dr. Lao  the little town he comes to visit  straighten out is much deeper than most films.

I must admit it is a cool title.After avenging her mother in 'Lady Snowblood' Yuki Meiko Kaji is arrested by the new Japanese police. Sentenced to death Yuki is granted a reprieve by Kikui Shin Kishida an agent of the secret police. Kikui will let Yuki live if she spies on Ransui Tokunaga Juzo Itami an active socialist. Yuki accepts Kikui's offer but making that offer may not have been the smartest thing Kikui ever did...The first thing you may notice about 'Lady Snowblood 2' is that there is a lack of vengeance. It seems to have been substituted for politics. Naturally there is some vengeance and the requisite amount of Yuki killing people but 'Lady Snowblood 2' seems to grounded in the political and social climate of Japan in the early 1900s. I've studied a bit of Japanese history from this period at university so the tiein managed to maintain my interest. However characters make references to the Hibiya Riots and the RussoJapanese war events that happened in 1905. This is supposedly set right after 'Lady Snowblood' which I believe was set in the 23rd Year of Meiji. By my reckoning that would make 'Lady Snowblood' set around 1891. I think I've missed something or gotten the Meiji years wrong. If someone doesn't correct me I'm going to assume timetravel was involved. Timetravel? Cool!Meiko Kaji turns into something of an acting robot in this outing. Yuki seems devoid of any emotion and while that was a theme in the first it was established that she was capable of human feeling. However she still makes a good assassin. Although we have more politics and less action the action we do get is still pretty good if dated.'Lady Snowblood 2' stands in the shadow of its prequel. The first movie outshines this movie in every way but the second is still entertaining. Worth a look for fans of the first  710".

On the way to the gallows she is rescued by the Japanese secret police who want her to go undercover as a maid to spy on anarchist Ransui Tokunaga Jz Itami who is in possession of a letter that could be used to incite riots and topple the government.But when Yuki learns that the letter contains evidence of a conspiracy to frame innocent anarchists for an act of unrelated terrorism she decides that the corrupt officials involved need to be taught a lesson.It's easy to understand how this more serious politically themed plot might not sit well with those who enjoyed the simplistic revenge tale of the original but I found the story engrossing. As far as the violence is concerned there may not be quite the volume of bloodletting as first time around but when it happens it is suitably nasty with brutal scenes of torture graphic eye trauma and an overthetop final which involves hackedoff limbs and arterial spray.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

While the original had a more simplistic vengeance orientated plot this sequel unfortunately bites off a bit more than it can chew as it weaves Yuki in with the politics of early 20 Century Japan and the events of the RussoJapanese war. Overall it feels like the film is just cashing in on the popularity of Kaji Meiko generated by the first film.That said it still manages to entertain from the very start with a wonderful sequence of Yuki hacking her way through a load of bad guys. Meiko lost none of her charisma from the original which is really essential here as the film itself starts to trip of it's own plot after a while. The fact that politics is the theme here rather than vengeance doesn't give her quite as much to work with but her ability to convey almost all of her emotions through her eyes is still a joy to watch.Ultimately it is worth watching if you liked the original and find Kaji Meiko's presence to be enough to hold your attention. If you value a gripping plot over tremendous acting you'd be better of skipping this. The fact that the first film had both these elements and the sequel only has one makes it an inferior but still highly entertaining follow up.".

Fascinating history lesson but of course the more serious subject matter does mean less fun. The film itself looks beautiful with extravagant sets and costumes and an excellent music score and Meiko Kaji gets to show a more human side of her persona here. One thing that must be mentioned is that the violence factor in this sequel is more extreme although there is less of the theatrical arterial blood sprays here we get instead some thoroughly unpleasant and grisly scenes of human torture including stabbings burnings eye gougings savage beatings as well as one man being injected with plague which causes his skin to break out in nasty sores. A few scenes are kind of sickening and i wasn't really expecting such serious subject matter. The film does tend to drag a bit in the middle segment but comes back strong for the final third when Yuki gets her revenge on the corrupt officials who have looted and burned an entire village for their own financial gain.

First all the bad guys who needed killing were dead and her need for revenge was complete. Second she sure looked like she was dead or soon would be. Yet here we have Ykui showing up yet again. This time however instead of just killing off a few evil vermin she's apparently been quite busywith something like 37 killings to her credit. However when you see her fighting at the beginning of this film you wonder how she could have done this as the choreography and her skills were not especially impressive. The illusion of her great power was better in the first filmhere the sword play looks a bit rough at timesbut it's still worth seeing.This film finds her a wanted woman throughout Japanand oddly the film is set about a decade or more ahead of the last film though she looks exactly the same. Tired of fighting she eventually allows herself to be arrested. She's soon convicted of murder and sent to execution. However on the way she's rescued by some unscrupulous officials who want her to do their bidding in exchange for her release. It seems they want her to bring them a certain important document and then kill the man who is hiding it. However when she hears the intended victim's story she realizes that the government officials are much like the scum she killed in the last film and she refuses to act. What's next? Will they kill the man get the document or get Lady Snowblood to work for them or kill her? Tune in and see.Like the first film this one has a lot of bloodthough not the squirting and spurting geyserlike variety this time at least not until the very end. Unlike the first one this one also has some nudity. However whether either has nudity or not isn't that important in regard to whether or not you let the kids see themthe violence to me is much more of a deciding factor.As for an older audience the film is worth seeingjust don't expect it to be nearly as original or interesting as the first film. This one just isn't as good in every single waythough for fans of Japanese films it's still worth seeing. Very adequate.By the way in one scene Yuki throws a knife up into the ceilingimpaling a man's hand in the process. Yet despite this moments later you see a close up of the bloody hand and there clearly is no hole or wound of any kind. Now I am NOT suggesting they should have mutilated the guy in order to provide better continuityjust not shown a close up of the hand itself.".

Now I am NOT suggesting they should have mutilated the guy in order to provide better continuityjust not shown a close up of the hand itself.";

That one concentrated on the story of her revenge for deeds against her mother 20 years in the past.  This one uses the framework of the clash between the rising authoritarian nationalist movement under the first Meiji emperor and the rising class of urban poor led by intellectual nihilists.  It's pretty funny seeing kids skipping down the city streets singing songs about Japan being victorious over Russia in the 1905 war.  Our Lady is swept along by these events rather than controlling them.  After being sentenced to death for her deeds in the first film she is rescued on the way to the gallows by the emperor's secret police and recruited to infiltrate the nihilists who have documents that could bring down the government.  Lady Snowblood switches sides and we progress through torture bubonic plague as a weapon of mass destruction and class warfare.  The film is carried more by the characters around Snowblood than by her especially the two antigovernment brothers that Snowblood befriends as well as the police chief who can't get a break in this movie.  He's the bad guy but reminds me of Inspector Clouseau whether falling off his horse or getting his eye poked out.  However she does what she needs to do and provides the action we expect.  Altogether I enjoyed this one better than the first. 7 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Toshiya Fujita's Shurayukihime Urami Renga aka. Lady Snowblood 2 Love Song Of Vengeance of 1974 is a quite different but more than decent sequel to Fujita's bloodsoaked and beautiful 1973 gem Shurayukihime aka. Lady Snowblood. While the film does not nearly reach the greatness of its superb predecessor Love Song Of Vengeance is yet another original and highly entertaining film that no lover of Japanese Cinema in general and Chambara and Japanese Exploitation in particular should consider missing. The film sadly cannot compete with its predecessor's unique style and beauty but it is still stylish and furthermore delivers a good story and most memorably the wonderful Meiko Kaji who comes back with greatness as the eponymous antiheroine.As it was the case with several other sequels to popular Japanese 70s exploitation flicks the sequel adds some politicalsocial commentary to the mainly vengeancebased plot of its predecessor. Obviously the film is set several years after the events in the original Lady Snowblood. YukiLady Snowblood Meiko Kaji is captured and sentenced to death for the thirtyseven killings committed by her in the predecessor. She is then offered to carry out an assassination in order to escape her execution... I don't want to give away more but I can assure that the plot gets quite interesting for my fellow Chambarafanatics. Japanese ExploitationGoddess Meiko Kaji one of my personal favorite actresses ever is once again stunningly beautiful and brilliant in her role. My personal favorite Kaji role will always be that of female prison escapee Nami Matsushima in the brilliant Joshuu Sasori aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion films but the role of Lady Snowblood is also essential and no lover of Cultcinema could afford to miss her in the role especially in the original but also in the sequel. Meiko's presence alone would make any film worthwhile in my opinion and the film has a lot more to offer. The film's is once again filled with quite a bit of stylish bloodshed which is not quite as aesthetic but at some points even bloodier than in the predecessor. Unfortunately the score in this one is not as memorable as that in the original for which Meiko Kaji sang the theme song and yet it is more than decent. Nowadays the Lady Snowblood films are probably best known for being the main inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films but they sure deserve more attention for their own sake. The first film Lady Snowblood is brilliant and while Love Song Of Vengeance is not the masterpiece its predecessor was it is still a highly entertaining stylish and memorable film that I highly recommend to every lover of Chambara and Cult Cinema. My rating 7.510".

Lady Snowblood turns out to have survived the events of the first film but is hunted down by police forces for her numerous murders. She gets tired of living on the run stops fighting gets arrested tried and sentenced to death. On the day of her execution the secret police force frees her and offers her to work as spy and assassin for them. Lady Snowblood is supposed to work as maid for an anarchist who has a document that could lead to a turmoil in the fragile country. She is supposed to steal the document kill the anarchist and prevent a revolution. However the more time she spends at his house the more she questions whether she should complete her mission or switch sides. Lady Snowblood soon becomes a key character in the clash between ruthless government officials and desperate anarchists in the beginning of the twentieth century.Just as the first movie this sequel convinces with a solid dose of realism and social criticism as it shows the rift between rich and poor during Meiji period. Due to its plot historic setting and characters this sequel isn't a tale of revenge but rather a political drama with martial arts elements. On one side this change is quite interesting as this film offers something different from the first film but it also takes away from the first movie's gloomy atmosphere and more personal connection to the main character. The rest is business as usual on a very high level. The filmmaking is detailed precise and visually stunning the fight sequences once again find the right balance between elegance and violence and the acting performances are all excellent. If you liked the first film it's very likely that you will also appreciate the sequel because it kept most elements that made the first film particularly outstanding and added more historic political and social components to it.I can highly recommend the recently updated Criterion Collection including both the original Lady Snowblood and this surprisingly solid sequel as well as additional interviews and trailers. It's a shame that there weren't more Lady Snowblood movies because the feminist character is particularly unique and perfectly portrayed by a stunning Kaji Meiko. Martial arts fans and those interested in Japanese culture should be familiar with Lady Snowblood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the manga comic by Kazuo Koike 1973's Lady Snowblood is a simplistic raperevenge thriller pitting one woman with a mastery of swordsmanship against a hoard of faceless and disposable foes standing in her way.

	schema:reviewBody "The ending of the original Lady Snowblood left the fate of Yuki Kashima Meiko Kaji somewhat ambiguous. She was shot and severely gut stabbed and the movie closed with her lying motionless on the ground. Perhaps with an eye toward a sequel the film makers brought her back in another tale in which she embarks on a journey of vengeance. This time though the story is set amidst the political turmoil of 1906 Meiji Japan with Yuki captured and arrested for the murder of thirty seven of her countrymen. The reason for these killings wasn't adequately established except in a mention of murder for hire in the narrative in the first film she was on a personal mission of revenge for the death of her imprisoned mother.Something I noticed in the first film but didn't mention in my review of it was the point that Yuki didn't seem particularly skillful in the demonstration of her swordsmanship. She simply slashed and stabbed her way against opponents in a manner that didn't require any type of exceptional choreography. At any time when she was surrounded by authorities it seemed to me she should have been overtaken by sheer force of numbers even if Yuki did manage to wound or kill a couple. Considering that sometimes one of the authorities had a gun made it seem even more incredible so one has to wonder about the thought process put into the story.Be that as it may fans of Japanese martial films will probably accept most of these inconsistencies for the sake of a decently staged action thriller. The political subtext involved was an interesting departure from the first film with elements of ransom demands and threat of a plague infection thrown in for good measure. The bloodletting is toned down from the original though fans of such are treated to a requisite amount of the red stuff. As before Yuki suffers some bullet wounds in closing out the story but still having the presence of mind to put her benefactor Shusuke Yoshio Harada out of his misery upon request. Not to mention the bad guys only fitting as they had it coming.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shurayukihime is a wordplay on Shirayukihime the Japanese name for Snow White and comes straight from the manga the first film was based on. I don't have anything to add to that. It's just a fun bit of trivia. Anyway Meiko Kaji returns to her signature role of Lady Snowblood for this sequel even though the first movie implies she doesn't survive its events but her character is unfortunately pushed to the side as there are various other characters and subplots taking up the runtime. Also the trademark umbrella sword doesn't appear in the sequel. Lady Snowblood doesn't act fueled by vengeance in this movie despite its title but instead gets tangled in a web of Meiji era politics anarchism police brutality and the main villain politician's strange HQ with bright red walls an aquarium with koi fish and a stuffed tiger which demonically flashes its eyes in one scene.Unfortunately the sequel doesn't have Lady Snowblood's awesome title tune from the first movie but it does offer some neat instrumental music. The tone of the film is much darker and there are fewer violent scenes but they are more graphic and some of them are just plain unsettling like the scenes of torture of political prisoners. The story isn't divided into chapters this time around but the recognizable narration is still there not to mention the stock footage combined with scenes from the manga. Juzo Itami director of Tampopo and A Taxing Woman appears as anarchist Ransui Tokunaga.The cinematography is once again fantastic and Toshiya Fujita proves himself as a director who knows how to work with colors and framing. The opening sequence taking place on the beach is especially well done.Lady Snowblood 2 isn't as good as the original mostly because the plot is messier and Meiko Kaji's role isn't as significant and somewhat downplayed. The sequel is also more serious in tone and has more nudity. It's a moderately entertaining movie outside of the gory scenes and it's technically well done if you can overlook stuff like Lady Snowblood being wounded by two gunshots at the end and looking like it isn't even a big deal.".

	schema:reviewBody "The main reason why the original Lady Snowblood was such a big exploitation hit and one of my personal favorites of all time was because it brought a simplistic and undemanding story in such a fresh and imaginative way! It was the tale of young Yuki born and raised with the mission to avenge the death of her parents after 20 years of intense swordfighting trainings and she fulfilled this mission without keeping anyone alive. So obviously there was no real reason to come up with a sequel but since the original became such a success director Toshiya Fujita and leading lady Meiko Kaji were recruited for a follow up film. Lady Snowblood 2 is a lot less impressive and powerful than the original likely because the plot is MORE ambitious and the violence is LESS explicit. On the way to her execution for the various murders in her first adventure 37! Yuki is saved from the hangman's rope by the head of Japan's secret service and forced to serve as a secret weapon in the ongoing war with Russia. She's send undercover as the maid of public enemy n 1  Ransui Tokunaga  but she teams up with him against the malicious nationalist forces. The script offers a nice and educational slice of Asian history but it's a lot less exhilarating. You could admire this film for not further milking out the success of the first but it lacks a proper story itself. Yuki's character clearly cares less about patriotic issues than she did about her own personal vendetta and this sadly shows in her fights. There are less ingenious killings and bloodshed to admire and the performances aren't as passionate. Still this film contains several memorable moments as well most notably the scene where a fat evil bastard loses both of his eyes after a confrontation with one of Yuki's friends. This scene was unquestionably the inspiration for Elle Driver's cruel fate in Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 2. It's a very well made and entertaining film but don't except another outrageous masterpiece.".

I recommend this if you like the first one but the third one The Princess Blade is one that I recommend even more. It's great.410";

Both Kenjiro Hirose's funkythrobbing score and Tatsuo Suzuki's restless yet sumptuous widescreen cinematography are up to par. A satisfying followup.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Lady Snowblood has its place secured in history as one of the very best Pinky ViolenceFemale Samurai movies out there. This sequel however is not likely to be so fondly remembered and the reason for that is mainly that it just isn't good enough. It just seems like the scriptwriters couldn't really think of an interesting idea to follow the original up with and so decided to just dump the title character into a largely unrelated plot and just hope for the best. The film has basically made the same mistake that befell the excellent Female Convict Series a year earlier in 1973 that being putting the character into a plot involving rebelling against the Government. The film picks up sometime after the events of the first film and Lady Snowblood is a wanted criminal. After giving the police the slip a couple of times she is eventually captured. However she is later rescued by the secret police who offer the assassin a chance for redemption by helping them get rid of some rebels.The film gets off to a good start. We are treated to a couple of well done action sequences that see Lady Snowblood chop up some enemies but once the plot kicks into action properly things slow down a lot and it gets very boring at times a very unwelcome change from the original which remained engrossing for the duration. Toshiya Fujita the director of the original film takes the reins again and does another very good job in terms of the visuals. The film looks delicious and the fight scenes are all very well choreographed. Unfortunately there are not as many nice visuals as in the first film. The bulk of the film really lacks action and the fight scenes only really take place at the beginning and end of the film which is a shame. Still the scenes we do get are very good and there's some memorable gore which includes limbs being lopped and a very well done eye gouging sequence. Still this is not nearly as great as the original film and while it is least worth a look I think many fans of the original will be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is so wellestablished now in other comments I won't repeat that Robert Rodriguez made this debut film of his for a mere 7000. Regardless how much he did or didn't spend this is a very wellwritten and photographed story of a nice young man who only wants to be a Mariachi singer but is inadvertently caught up in a manhunt and several gunfights. The movie is not intended to be taken seriously. The crook with the guitar case full of guns is supposed to be part of the joke of the movie. Many people get shot and killed and of course that isn't funny in real life but this film is not intended to reflect real life. It is just an entertaining film. Sort of a cartoon come to life.I saw this on DVD which is real nice because the extra features contain a great insight into how Rodriguez shot and edited this movie. For example all the filming was done silently. Then armed with a tape recorder and Radio Shack microphone he had the actors redo the scene while he recorded the dialog and other sounds. Music was done the same way. Then when Rodriguez edited the movie he matched the taperecorded sound to the filmed action for the final cut. Watching the film you can notice some nonsynchronization and that's the reason why. It is certainly not distracting. He made the film with no crew no fancy equipment vrtally no lighting other than natural. Most of the actors were local Mexican businessmen bartenders or TV news men. Quite an achievement in moviemaking because it is a very entertaining movie on its own. I give it 9 of 10 partly because of the novelty of its origin.The other side of the DVD contains Rodriguez's followup movie Desperado which is actually a sequel to El Mariachi. So if you rent or buy this DVD you are getting 2 movies for one price.  Quite a deal!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Through the heart of independent cinema comes the bold and expressive first film by Robert Rodriguez. While he would go on later to give us some modern day classics this is the film that jumpstarted his career. Set in a gritty town of Mexico a drifter arrives ready to restart a new life and concentrate on his music. He soon learns that this will be a very difficult dream since the moment he steps foot in town he is mistaken for a murderous criminal named Azul. Azul is after his money that Moco the head boss has failed to pay him. Moco tries to have Azul killed but finds it difficult when he carries with him a guitar case filled with guns. After several gun battles explosions and a love story with a woman that gives the guitar player his first real gig our hero finds his life in the mercy of others. It is at this time our Mariachi is reborn.Rodriguez gives his best direction to date. Perhaps it was the lack of funds or the intensely gritty scenes but this film helped me realize why cinema is so amazing. It is the perfect story of the small fish making his big mark on a big pond. Rodriguez takes every resource he can and rebuilds the classic concept of mistaken identity. With the fastframed photography and interesting choice of camera angles he takes a straightforward story and builds a legend. I enjoyed watching this film because although it was made for just a simple 7000 the production doesn't look cheap. I have seen Hollywood blockbusters that have looked like they squandered their money more than Rodriguez did. I was just impressed with the quality of the film and the story that I suddenly felt myself totally immersed into the story.Oddly it is the story that never falters throughout this picture. Normally when you have a lower cost on budget a segment of a film will suffer. Sometimes it is the character development other times it is the story. Nothing is forgotten about in this film. There is plenty of violence for all you action fans out there some powerful drama dealing with his dreams and some comedy that will keep you grinning from ear to ear. By having this strong balance our hero emerges with the utmost confidence our villain seems diabolically evil and therefore leading into moments of sheer joy constantly wondering what will happen next. I was rooting for everyone in this film because I felt something for each. Only through the careful eye and artistic direction of Rodriguez could such a feat be accomplished.I have nothing negative to say about this film. From the moment the first turtle walked across the screen until the very end I enjoyed every aspect of this picture. I suggest this movie to anyone that has ever thought about making a film but was concerned about budget. I also suggest this film to anyone who loves a good story amazing action and characters that literally jump out of the screen like comic book heroes.Grade  out of ".

As Rodriquez had more and more money to spend on the sequels the stories got more and more carried away with too many explosions and specialeffects losing the charm of this first effort.Unlike the sequels this Mexicanmade so it is in Spanish with English subtitles. Don't let that scare you away. There isn't a great deal of dialog so keeping up with the subtitles is very easy.The movie has very interesting camera closeups and angles as Rodriquez showed he was going to be a stylish director. The story is simple but effective suspenseful and even with some humor. Unnlike his subsequent films in this trilogy the action is not overdone here. The length is also is a plus. At 80 minutes you can be thoroughly entertained in less than an houranda half. The only disappointment to me was the print quality on th DVD but I got an early edition. There might be better editions out since. It's not fuzzy but it's not sharp either. Anyway highly recommend for actionscrime buffs who like style in their photography or saw the sequels and would like to know the history of this particular Mariachi.".

Robert Rodriguez has such a knowledge of filmmaking that he makes this movie look like a million bucks easy.

The story behind the making of the film is even more interesting than the movie itself. You can tell from this movie that Robert Rodriguez had a bright future in the movie business.The story is about a musician who's trying to find work in a Mexican border town. None of the places he visits wants to hire a guitar player for their business. Meanwhile another man comes to town carrying a guitar case he's no musician. He's a notorious hit man for a local gangster. When their paths cross nothing but trouble lies ahead for the El Mariachi. Can the poor dude survive the week without being killed? Who is this guitar carrying killer? Why is he in town? What are the local crime boss' motives? To find out you'll have to watch EL MARIACHI!!!An interesting debut that showed lots of promise. The movie was followed by a pseudosequelremake a few years later with a bigger budget and a cast filled with a lot of named actors.Highly recommended.".

Then I bought the film 'Desperado' and learned it was a sequel to El Mariachi. Since I have OCD and everything must be in order I told myself I had to see 'El Mariachi' before I would allow myself to see 'Desperado'. I looked all over and ended up buying 'El Mariachi' not knowing the movie experience I would soon get...'El Mariachi' is a lowbudget movie and you can tell it is. But it is without a doubt much MUCH better than a lot of these excuses for movies they dump on us these days. The concept is simple enough a traveling Mariachi player is looking for work and gets mistaken for a killer. He has to fight his way out of this one. The cast was made up of Hollywood nobodies but they gave performances so realistic and Oscarworthy that you couldn't tell. El Mariachi the character was wonderfully played by Carlos Gallardo who should have gotten an award for his part. You sympathized and rooted for him throughout the entire film. The lead actress Domino was also professionally played by Consuelo Gomez. The REAL killer with whom El Mariachi is mistaken for Azul was probably my favorite character besides El Mariachi himself played by the talented Reinol Martinez. There's also the antagonists like the gringo mob leader who tried to kill El Mariachi and Azul and has a crush on Domino. The leader Mauricio Moco was played by the surprisingly good Peter Marquardt. There's also his main enforcer who is always after Mariachi and gives a great performance yet doesn't speak a word Bigoton played by Jaime de Hoyos. Given the small budget the usedlimited propsequipment and the cast Rodriguez created a cinematic masterpiece. Many probably do not like the movie because of its lower quality and the fact that its all in Spanish. But these only make the whole experience even better.Fans of Rodriguez will not want to miss this one. Rodriguez starts off his movie career on a very good note with El Mariachi.This movie gets a 1010. Check it out. Be sure to watch in Spanish with English subtitles and not in English audio.".

Rodriguez starts off his movie career on a very good note with El Mariachi.This movie gets a 1010. Check it out. Be sure to watch in Spanish with English subtitles and not in English audio.";

Generally speaking the minimalist philosophy is practically omnipresent in this movie. The story is simple most actors are amateur the scenario is real and efficiency and the use of the brain replace any needless effects. Just about everything is authentic and economical. Not a bad way of thinking makes it all the more realistic and at the same time keeps the costs lower.Nothing is overdone even the action in it  although I can't lie this is a very violent movie at times and there is some disturbing content. But even the most shocking violence is kept in an acceptable league  that is hardly more than the necessary. On the other hand despite being a crime story there is a good deal of clever humor natural humor instead of bad taste humor or forceful humor.Time shows that this movie has gone down in history as a great success. And rightfully so. It has aged with dignity and is now old enough to be considered a little classic.The story of a goodnatured mariachi who only wants to offer his music in exchange of very little money but is confounded with a violent criminal who looks nothing like him dressed in a similar style and carrying a guitar case just like his however with guns and knives inside is quite thrilling and involving.Peter Marquardt is great as Moco. Moco can be funny at times and yet he is so arrogant and cruel that you really hate him. But if he amuses you and at the same time fills you in hate that only means that the actor does his role very well. Carlos Gallardo is terrific as the mariachi. Consuelo Gmez is splendid as Domin. Domin is hot sexy beautiful and yet she has a strong personality she has a devilish sense of humor she can be aggressive in a sensual way she has that exotic but severe look and she is obviously a powerful woman a woman with guts. You gotta love her for all that. Domin is one of the hottest women in cinema ever although to be honest the woman who manicures Moco's hands is just as hot.I find it cute and funny that the little turtle of the movie is credited. Not that it doesn't deserve. Why shouldn't animals deserve such honor? Tito Tortuga is great in its minor role as the turtle that crosses a road.All in all an enjoyable movie. I only don't like the ending because Domin is killed and the mariachi gets his hand shot. At least Moco gets what he deserves but unfortunately too late for Domin and the mariachi. Title in Portugal 'El Mariachi'.".

The plot is a simple case of mistaken identity that is played out with a good pace and action that lacks multimillion explosions but still has enough about it to be exciting and engaging. The writing is not the best but then that is not what made this film so famous no what did was Rodriguez's unique style as director. He takes the simple story and injects it with humour and energy that make it much better than the budget or the written script would have suggested. He borrows heavily from others Sam Rami is one of the more obvious but it doesn't feel like he has stolen anything just used it to do his own thing.The cast aren't that great though and the method of dubbing everything is pretty evident in most scenes but not too bad for me personally because I was reading the subtitles anyway. Gallardo is solid lead but lacks his own style and charisma and it is obvious throughout that the visual style and comic air to the film is carrying him. Gomez is OK but not pretty or a presence enough to do it for me I'm afraid. Marquardt is a bit too hammy and lacking in teeth for the main villain but Martinez's Azul is a big man and fits the bill well.Overall this is an energetic film that works well despite the limitations of the budget and cast. You do have to forgive it some things but it is easily quite fun and flows forward well and is certainly worth a look and infinity better than the bigbudget excesses of its second sequel  Once Upon A Time In Mexico.".

El Mariachi hews closely to the Clint Eastwood Western conventions of its premise. A man in black enters a town and needs to fend for his life while mysterious gangsters try to do him in. It's a simple affair with a very streamlined execution and nary an unexpected turn in the film save for the final minutes.Even Justin Lin's debut Shopping for Fangs packs more energy passion and wit into its runtime. Rodriguez's film save for a few whimsical scenes is filled with a dreadful dullness. The action scene that opens the film has action too awkward y too cheesy and stilted and editing too lurching to be entertaining. Even after the slow cold open only a handful of scenes thereafter approach a sense of kinetic action. Watching our mariachi hero vault himself onto a stairwell or finally take up arms against his assailants contains a modicum of satisfaction mostly due to the topnotch gutpunch stuntwork and the commitment of the central performance. But the editing and the camerawork lack panache and it is not in a way that can be attributed to the admirably small budget. Each shot has a nauseating useless gimmick to it. Within thirty seconds Rodriguez and his team will squeeze in a crashzoom in an extremecloseup usually on nervous darting eyeballs a cutaway to the crowd a crashzoom out a closeup of a gun and a handful of other ridiculous movements. To say the camerawork and editing are schizophrenic is to understate the zaniness of the film.Few scenes genuinely affected me on my initial viewing and there are too many inconsistencies gaps of logic and overwrought moments say the film is of genuine worth aside from an interesting start to a career and a great example of lowbudget prowess. Great films can be made on smaller budgets and as a film student I can say they sometimes are. Budget does not correlate to the quality of the film which is why I maintain that Rodriguez's debut is more underwhelming than most critics and historians give it credit for.It's most poignant moment is also its it's most uncharacteristic  a bathtub serenade while the mariachi has a letteropener to his testicles. Even then some editing hiccups exclude necessary bits of action but the connection between our leads is palpable. We feel a relationship forming. The sound is dominated by a gorgeous song calmly and softly reaching out to us and to his bartender benefactor a lovely island of music amid a sea of overindulgent and pulpy slaughter.".

The shots may not be exactly beautiful but they are close to perfect. There's something enchanting about how they shot the film. And together with the narrating in the beginning the movie reminded me of some kind of 60's or 70's art films which is quite far from how the film really is. Also Rodriguez has used some very interesting effects in the movie but very skilfully. They weren't used too little or too much just the right amount.The music in El Mariachi is weird. It's weird and it shouldn't suit to any film  but it does. The soundtrack is a spoton. It's different and weird which is a good thing. All action movies tend to have one kind of soundtrack so it's great seeing well hearing something other for a change.The editing is also great. The movie is not very long but it doesn't feel too short. El Mariachi also uses both speed and slowness as interesting and effective stylistic devices without disturbing the pace of the movie.The story of El Mariachi is as simple as a plot can be. However usually action films make the mistake of wasting extra subplots to the movie to make the story seem deeper. El Mariachi has one story and it sure as hell is short but it still is thrilling and as interesting as it can be. It's good enough.El Mariachi is simple and almost modest yet it is skilfully made and one of the best action movies I've seen. This is the first movie I saw from Robert Rodriguez. I had high expectations for Rodriguez and I'd like to think he met them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's give credit where credit is due. Although this picture had an extremely lowbudget it goes to prove that a nice film can still be produced if the director has the imagination and talent to pull it off. And let's face it the sad fact is that there are all too many movies being made today that cost much more than this particular film 7000 but fail to deliver the same level of satisfaction. The director Robert Rodriguez deserves every attribute due to him. The humor was good and there were some social commentaries that I think some people might have missed. That is not to say however that this film was necessarily perfect. It wasn't. The acting wasn't great by any means. Neither was the script. But then the movie was originally produced in Spanish and the version I saw was dubbed in English so it is possible that some of the dialogue may have been lost in translation. The ending though was unexpected and abrupt and I didn't quite like it. As far as the characters are concerned I thought Reinol Martinez playing the part of the gangster Azul did the best. Consuelo Gomez Domino was attractive and put in a fair performance as well. Carlos Gallardo El Mariachi was average at best. The rest of the cast were pretty much forgettable. Having said all of this the fact that this film was produced with a low budget doesn't mean that a person should lower his standards and give it a higher score than it deserves when it comes to evaluating it. This wasn't Gone with the Wind so there's no need to give it an equivalent rating. The bottom line is that it was an enjoyable lowbudget film and it made a hefty profit. No need to argue with that.".

Having said all of this the fact that this film was produced with a low budget doesn't mean that a person should lower his standards and give it a higher score than it deserves when it comes to evaluating it. This wasn't Gone with the Wind so there's no need to give it an equivalent rating. The bottom line is that it was an enjoyable lowbudget film and it made a hefty profit. No need to argue with that.";

	schema:reviewBody "The latest film by Abel Ferrara Mary was without doubt one of the most eagerly awaited films of this year's Venice Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix.Mary will of course be linked to two other big 'relegious' films of the moment The Passion of the Christ and The Da Vinci Code. However the film stands firmly on its own merit.Mary can easily be read as Ferrara's reply to Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ a film which made great impact culturally and indeed commercially like one of the summer blockbusters of 2004 in the United States. However Mary does not derogate from the sulfurous tradition which characterizes the films of Abel Ferrara since the beginning and as such his film is significantly more intellectually provocative than Gibson's film if slightly less approachable.While giving us a completely revolutionary vision of the character of Mary Magdalene the director questions the cult of spirituality while once more questioning his faith with a rare humility. Mary takes as it's starting point the now almost mythical Mary Magdalene disciple of Jesus. The film then evokes three characters bound by her spirit and her mystery... Marie Palesi an actress who is playing Magdalene in a film. Tony Childress a director who is playing Jesus in his own film. Ted Younger a celebrity journalist creating a TV show about religious faith. Between fascination and spiritual search destiny will join these three together. Before Ferrara's Mary was even thought of Juliette Binoche had already been approached to play Mary Magdalene by the historian JeanYves Leloup who translated the Gospels according to Mary Magdalene and was working on a dramatization. At the time Binoche declined this offer. Today it is partly thanks to her and JeanYves Leloup that Mary exists. The historian's dramatization forming the film within a film. Due of this thoughtful and rich background Mary does not rest only on one simple reaction to the vision of Mel Gibson. The character of Tony Childress Matthew Modine director playboy and megalomaniac seems partly inspired by Mel Gibson but also by Ferrara himself  or his reputation at least. Tony is brilliant in his art but hopelessly poor in life. The message conveyed by Mary is subversive in that the film questions the basis of the mystic JudeoChristian teachings while approaching what can be regarded as one of the more taboo questions of religion namely the integration of the female into the Divine Word. From this point of view The Passion of the Christ failed and was even symptomatic of the commonly allowed representations of women in religion namely the worshiping mother Mary and the prostitute Mary Magdalene and the choice to entrust the role of Satan to a woman while the Word belonged fully to a man  Jesus. On the contrary Abel Ferrara who bases his film on the Gospels discovered in 1945 and in particular on the texts credited to Mary Magdalene herself provides us with another vision of Magdalene as the chief disciple. He thus returns to the female figure the capacity to spread the Word which women were dispossessed of through the centuries.The film opens with Mary Magdalene Juliette Binoche directly after the resurrection. The film is warm and glowing. Then Tony Childress Matthew Modine yells cut and the audience is plunged into the reality of the film. After the shoot finishes Childress prepares to return to New York. However his leading actress Marie Palesi Juliette Binoche is so affected by her role that she reuses to go with him. Instead she abandons her career and goes to Jerusalem in search of the true Magdalene and resolution for her faith.Back in New York Ted Younger Forest Whitaker approaches Childress to appear on his spiritual TV show. Younger's life is a mess and although his work has lead to his questioning of faith in his personal life he does no such thing. Instead he blatantly cheats on his pregnant wife Heather Graham. Childress' film This is My Blood has caused controversy with the far right and the Jewish lobby. The premiere is threatened with violence. Younger manages to contact Palesi in Jerusalem and creates a telephone confrontation between her and Childress on his show. This confrontation has major implications for all three.The history of Mary Magdalene such as it is suggested by the extracts of Childress' film is put at the same level as those of Marie Ted and Tony. However it ends up rising above theirs since its message will touch each one of them successively. The director films much in darkness and closed places  cellars studios a car or an empty apartment  leading an atmosphere of oppression supported by a throbbing musical score. At times this darkness is contrasted with beams of illuminating light. Rather than being a trite visual allusion this leads to a revelatory sense of change.The acting is sensational Juliette Binoche seems literally inhabited by her roles  both as Magdalene and Palesi. She goes from serene to distraught to serene again. Forest Whitaker delivers an upsetting performance and proves once more that he is one of the best actors of his generation. Finally the performance of Matthew Modine is cerebral and emotional work difficult since he could easily have become a caricature of Gibson or Ferrara.Mary is successful in the aim to embrace the complexity of the religious faith. Wiser seemingly than usually Abel Ferrara delivers a fundamentally subversive work. The film conveys a deeply human message with universal vocation which does not require faith in order to be understood or appreciated. In fact the film can be simply be read as a religious horror film  without the devil.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is far more ambitious in its scope than it is successful in delivering its message. Despite the illustrious cast there was nothing remotely spiritual in either the characters or the performances save perhaps Forest Whittaker's scene of repentance in church towards the end which nevertheless left much unresolved and was ultimately unconvincing. I think this is therefore inadvertently more a demonstration of the inability of the contemporary film industry to discuss spirituality than it is about Jesus the Apostles or Mary Magdalene. Juliette Binoche was feeble in her portrayal of Mary Magdalene delivering a confused slightly hysterical and nondescript portrait of a woman who is otherwise known to be both an extraordinary person and supposedly the film's central concern. The character played by Matthew Modine was the most convincing in his cynical hypocritical and totally materialistic egotism  and I think this fact alone says something about the 'spirit' which guides the whole movie. But even this admittedly interesting character was left sketchy and undeveloped.Discerning viewers should be warned not only is the film an attempt to justify heresies the church has known and rejected for valid reasons since the dawn of Christianity as well as some newfangled ones but it fails even in its heretical intent  the whole film is a series of loose threads leading nowhere. It leaves one with a vague feeling of religious unease and a sense of the demonic gnawing monotonously away at Christian tradition yet another rusty nail in the resurrected Body of Christ. I should mention that I'm not against free speech or even the misrepresentation of religious truth here ably conveyed in their fictional 'interviews' by the purveyors of error themselves Jean Yves Leloup and Elaine Pagels wouldbe academics prostituting their respective disciplines for the broader public but if you are going to make a movie with a heretical or blasphemous message at least make it good artistically. In all a waste of 2.5 hours.".

I really wanted to find something to recommend in this film but all I could think of was how unfocused it was how miscast and how dull. One particular problem was Ferrara couldn't decide if he wanted to make an investigative documentary or a inspiring religious drama. On the one side we've got real theologians yammering away about Jesus and Mary and clips of violence in Palestine. On the other side we have two stories about New Yorkers having spiritual identity crises and an actress still neurotically lost in her role wandering through the streets of Jerusalem looking for something to eat or something. In the end we get a murky arty film with meandering plot lines that don't really go anywhere.In addition we have a casting problem. Juliette Binoche as the ersatz Magdalene plays her role as a treacly newagey Christian proselytizer. She reminded me of the people who accost you on buses asking you if you've found Jesus yet.Modine and Whitaker both plainly uncomfortable playing their roles end up giving us melodramatic performances that when arriving at the moment of spiritual catharsis cause them to start chewing up the scenery. I couldn't help thinking that Whitaker's appeal to God in a hospital chapel made him look like a subject in a Goya painting but without the pathos that the artist's subjects engenders. Both actors were not able to evince any genuine feelings which is due mostly to a plot that doesn't allow them to develop their characters in the first place.Better to watch Kazantzakis or even Gibson. Or see Cammina Cammina by Ermanno Olmi.".

Although 'Mary' lasts only 83 minutes the screen time is too long so it is filled up with scenes of the biblical story from the film in the film or trying to convey some confuse metaphor? who cares? and an episode of a Jewish Passover celebration in Jerusalem interrupted by an act of terror with no connection whatever with the rest of the story.It is hard to grasp why this film was made what is it really trying to say and why actors like Juliette Binoche and the nowOscared Forest Whitaker got involved with it.

	schema:reviewBody "All is flux nothing is stationary.  Heraclitus Miami Vice The Departed and The Black Dahlia were all released in 2006. The Departed went on to do big business and win several key awards whilst Dahlia and Vice did nothing but annoy audiences tremendously. Their characters were ciphers the films had little action and despite their tremendous visual style their plots were a giant bore. I myself found both films almost painful to sit through when first seeing them in theatres.But time has a way of putting everything in its proper place. Today I find Scorsese's film intolerable and have since seen Vice and Dahlia over five times the later two films revealing themselves with subsequent viewings to be truly spectacular. But isn't that always the case with great films? You're unprepared they leave you baffled and your immediate response is always to react with hostility.The Miami Vice television series was renowned for its flashy cars cool clothes sexy women and glossy look. Police detectives Tubbs and Crockett were as interested in their designer sunglasses and exotic sports cars as they were in catching criminals. The TV series celebrated superficiality and vapid aesthetics.The Vice film however is one of profound numbness. This is an antiprocedural in which the characters are all desensitised to aesthetics director Michael Mann opening the film with Linkin Park's Numb Encore before throwing his audience headlong into a police story so dense and alien that we immediately become as suffocated as the characters on screen. Tubbs and Crockett have themselves been on the job for so long that everything has long lost its sex appeal. The clothes cars and exotic locales are now all completely banal.

	onyx:emotionText "All is flux nothing is stationary.  Heraclitus Miami Vice The Departed and The Black Dahlia were all released in 2006. The Departed went on to do big business and win several key awards whilst Dahlia and Vice did nothing but annoy audiences tremendously. Their characters were ciphers the films had little action and despite their tremendous visual style their plots were a giant bore. I myself found both films almost painful to sit through when first seeing them in theatres.But time has a way of putting everything in its proper place. Today I find Scorsese's film intolerable and have since seen Vice and Dahlia over five times the later two films revealing themselves with subsequent viewings to be truly spectacular. But isn't that always the case with great films? You're unprepared they leave you baffled and your immediate response is always to react with hostility.The Miami Vice television series was renowned for its flashy cars cool clothes sexy women and glossy look. Police detectives Tubbs and Crockett were as interested in their designer sunglasses and exotic sports cars as they were in catching criminals. The TV series celebrated superficiality and vapid aesthetics.The Vice film however is one of profound numbness. This is an antiprocedural in which the characters are all desensitised to aesthetics director Michael Mann opening the film with Linkin Park's Numb Encore before throwing his audience headlong into a police story so dense and alien that we immediately become as suffocated as the characters on screen. Tubbs and Crockett have themselves been on the job for so long that everything has long lost its sex appeal. The clothes cars and exotic locales are now all completely banal. Life has been bled of colour their toys have been bled of value and everything has a hollow empty feel.The film's plot  the detectives going undercover to infiltrate a criminal organisation  is both unoriginal and unimportant.

	schema:reviewBody "Due to Michael Mann's track record it was hard to go into this movie without very high expectations. After all we are talking about the creator of arguably the greatest crime dramathriller ever made with Heat as well as the highly entertaining Collateral. But Miami Vice fails to live up to Mann's past success in the crime genre.The plot is completely ordinary and doesn't offer up any unexpected twists and turns along the way. Because of this the movie lacks intensity through much of the first and second acts when everything that's happening is completely predictable. However pedestrian plot aside the biggest disappointment was the manner in which the characters were developed. Both Collateral and Heat were notable for the way in which they delved deep into the psyche of the central characters providing compelling personal drama to go along with the heists hits and gunplay. But in Miami Vice we never really get to know the characters or their motivations beyond the surface level. And to make matters worse Foxx and Farrell never develop the kind of rapport that's necessary to make a movie like this work on a high level. Compare Foxx and Farrell to Johnson and Thomas or Gibson and Glover and you'll see what I mean. Even though the Miami Vice movie aspires to be darker and grittier than Lethal Weapon which it is it fails to be as dramatic because we never really come to care about the characters all that much. While there was clearly a conscious decision to downplay the buddy elements of the movie the result is that Crockett and Tubbs seem so disconnected from each other on a personal level that it's hard to buy that they would die for each other which we are expected to believe. The only relationship that is at all convincing or fleshed out is between Crockett and Isabella. The rest seem decidedly distant and undercooked.What saves the film from being a bust is the visual splendor and great action sets. Mann once again proves that when it comes to creating a gritty atmosphere and staging shootouts he's among the best in the business. When it comes to style visuals and atmosphere Miami Vice is top notch.In the end perhaps what hurt this movie most was studio deadlines and delays while shooting. It's been widely reported that Michael Mann had to feverishly edit this film just to get it into theaters on time and in many ways that shows. There are multiple loose ends that are never tied up or explained and several plot threads seem underdeveloped. I'm sure some day we will see a director's cut which approaches the 3 hour mark just like Heat and perhaps that version will overcome of the issues involving character development and plot holes in the theatrical version. Until then Miami Vice is a movie that while far from being a total failure is nonetheless disappointing in that it had the potential to be a much more complete film than it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "A diehard Michael Mann fan I deeply respect all of his prior work and hold Thief and Heat in the highest regard. I essentially went into the theater to watch Miami Vice expecting a reaction similar to when I viewed Ali and Collateral on the big screen. I expected to see the big Mann pull off what I didn't think anyone else could pull off... restructuring the perception of a specific actor and producing an engaging and resonating plot in an otherwise skeptical script idea. In Ali I didn't believe Will Smith was the right choice but he worked and Jamie Foxx as Bundini was amazing. In hindsight I understood why he focused solely on the height of Ali's career. When Collateral was announced I had severe doubts as to the believability of the plot the choice of Tom Cruise as a villain and the decision to shoot on High Definition video. I've watched those two movies several times over and love them both. So it was with Miami Vice that I didn't think Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as a team were right for the roles. I also believed that the idea of recreating Miami Vice was a pure marketing scheme. I gave Michael Mann the benefit of the doubt considering he directed the TV series that I barely remember since I was only an adolescent. My only knowledge of Colin Farrell was that he was an Irish dude in Minority Report. I was afraid Jamie Foxx would be a continuation of his Collateral Max character after he finds his balls.Sure enough for the first time Michael Mann didn't sidestep my opinions. From the first scene in the nightclub Jamie Foxx has taken over the actions of Tom Cruise. Break a bodyguard step on him and look up past the camera. That was a great maneuver in Collateral now I think it's cheese. So he's a tough dude. Colin Farrell is a charmer we learn immediately. So we'll expect sex scenes. Yeah. Too bad the characters are in the same camera shot but miles apart chemistry wise. It's just emotionally cold sex. There's no sense of a symbiotic relationship between Farrell and Foxx either. Both of them just seem to immediately know how to get things done and don't really do anything together that one couldn't do alone or with a randomly assigned partner. Their characters dominate every scene of possible tension and diffuse it immediately. Which is what I consider to be the film's second greatest weakness the lack of tension and drama. We have to watch talk scenes. Characters talk to characters. Deceive characters by talking. Talk about deceiving by talking. Then fly or pilot a speedboat to talk somewhere else and talk over the phone. All quick witted and distant. It's all supposed to keep the audience wondering and guessing. Which is what it does makes you wonder why any of it matters and try to guess if there will be any action or resonance with a character. Which is the film's greatest weakness. You can't relate to any of the characters. All you are watching is a bunch of ethnically and gender diverse bad asses with cool cars helicopters and boats go about being bad ass talkers and shooters. All presented in very fantastic heroism jumbled by dialogue dialogue and more dialogue. The only excitement comes from basic shootouts with shock value due to the timing of action and subsequent gore. But I'm not sure they're exceptional other than how they effectively remove you from the slow anxiety of watching the film not mean anything. The final one in particular seems like a low budget night rehash of the Heat shootout in the dark on grainy video with subpar sound effects. There's no need to care for the characters. Gong Li is the film's only redemption. She acts with her body. Probably because she's not very good with English. It seems like one of the movie's major intents was to instill minority actors into invincible heroic roles. The white FBI agent is incompetent. White trash and jealous Latino dudes are the baddies a random black pimp is just left to be. Come watch them get graphically shot to pieces by men and women of color. There's no internal development or conflict. They all talk and stare like Max at his turning point in Felix's club in Collateral. There's no fear. Come in get the job done. Get er done! And we as the audience have to admire them for their cool cars and cool actions. Maybe only cool people like this movie. There's no depth or passion to any of it. Just cool people being cool in coolly stylized shots. And you won't even care about the questions it leaves unanswered cuz it's not cool to stress out over it. You might feel jealous or passionate and get shot in your inner medulla by a bullet going 2750 feet per second. I hope this isn't the start of Mediocre Michael Mann. The idea pains my heart.".

There are no 'buddy cops' wisecracks car chases or O.T.T action so the casual movie goer is going to be a little bemused by what they are seeing. But fans of Michael Mann's work will be in seventh heaven because this has all the director's trademarks.There's some stunning camerawork A lot of it digital and some beautifully rendered sequences in this and some explosive action But don't go expecting 'Lethal weapon' style action. The trailer park stand off with the white supremacists was my favourite scene and an abject lesson in how to put suspense on screen.Performances are all very good right down to the smaller parts and the plot demands attention. I found the films running time flew by. Its so refreshing to see a cop thriller for adults with no silliness and one that doesn't insult the audiences intelligence.Best film so far this year.".

	onyx:emotionText "While this is called 'Miami Vice' and has the same names as the characters from the TV show thats where the similarities end. This is a no nonsense undercover cop thriller. There are no 'buddy cops' wisecracks car chases or O.T.T action so the casual movie goer is going to be a little bemused by what they are seeing. But fans of Michael Mann's work will be in seventh heaven because this has all the director's trademarks.There's some stunning camerawork A lot of it digital and some beautifully rendered sequences in this and some explosive action But don't go expecting 'Lethal weapon' style action. The trailer park stand off with the white supremacists was my favourite scene and an abject lesson in how to put suspense on screen.Performances are all very good right down to the smaller parts and the plot demands attention. I found the films running time flew by. Its so refreshing to see a cop thriller for adults with no silliness and one that doesn't insult the audiences intelligence.Best film so far this year.";

Pulls you in with its stylish direction and flamboyant visuals but the two leads have poor chemistry character development is almost nonexistent and the film drags on from one convoluted plot twist to the next.

Which I did almost.Miami Vice was a slick cop story with a shaky plot and cool visuals. But if you're looking for any references to the series then forget it aside from a crap cover version of In The Air tonight thrown on during the end credits originally sung by Phil Collins in the series pilot.What was great about the series was the style the attitude the music.

	schema:headline " Miami Vice is a cool stylish and quite frequently intense thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing you need to know when you see Miami Vice is that it's hardly anything like the trailers. While the insanely cool trailer makes this out to be a big loud mindless shoot em' up action movie filled with car chases explosions and damsels in distress the movie is actually anything but. They had to advertise the movie this way if they wanted to make money but the fact is if you go into this expecting what it was advertised as you will be bored to tears and most certainly hate the movie. I myself found the movie unbearably boring the first time I watched it. However after a second viewing that I forced upon myself in my unwilling to be disappointed by such a cool looking film I felt completely different about it. I was thoroughly entertained. Miami Vice is a gritty intense and often brutal no nonsense suspense drama that rewards patience and attention.The plot is fairly simple but the realistic way it's executed makes it feel complicated. It follows Miami cops Sonny Crockett Colin Farrell and Ricardo Tubbs Jamie Foxx who are given a most difficult assignment. They are assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a major drug cartel led by the ruthless Jose Yero and find out who killed two undercover federal agents. Crockett and Tubbs under fabricated identities enter a world where their badges mean nothing danger and violence is waiting around every corner and if they show any signs of their real intentions they will be killed on sight. It doesn't exactly help that Crockett falls in love with one of the cartel's most important members Gong Li. Miami Vice is a very intense film which maintains a consistent tone of imminent danger. Although Crockett and Tubbs or any characters in it for that matter are never really developed we fear for their lives when things get too far beyond their control. The knowledge of what would happen to them if their identities were to be uncovered keeps us on the edge of our seat from the moment they begin their assignment. Employing nonstop action which many people complain about the lack of wouldn't make sense in this movie because it's about characters trying to avoid anything that could set it off. There is action in the film and whenever it occurs it is not glamorous or stylish. It is gritty and often disturbingly brutal. The characters aren't in control of it they are just as confused and terrified as any normal person would be if they were caught in a chaotic shootout.The action scenes as gritty as they are are still executed in a good enough way that they get your adrenaline flowing and the climactic shootout includes one of the single best bad guy kills I've ever seen. The most suspenseful moment in the film comes from a hostage situationstandoff in a trailer park where the tension becomes nearly unbearable. The scene culminates in one of the most badass cop movie moments that I've seen in a while.The cinematography and music in the film are excellent and any fan of cinema has to appreciate it. There is little if any artificial lighting in the film. There are beautiful shots of Miami lit only by the lights of the city itself and breathtaking scenes of planes in the air soaring through the clouds. There are times when the movie almost comes to a complete halt just to bask in the beauty of the imagery and while many people find these scenes boring and unnecessary I found them to be hypnotic and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Personally I found the numerous sex scenes more boring and distracting than these. And the music perfectly fits the tone of every scene it's used in. The opening nightclub sequence is a great example of both of these elements one of the single coolest moments to a film I've ever seen. As for the acting it isn't easy to comment on as the actors do very little of it. Most of the time all their roles require is for them to talk in a serious nononsense voice and never smile. Gong Li really needs to work on her English and subtitles would come in handy for her scenes. Actually I strongly recommend that you watch the whole film with subtitles due to the fact that the way the characters talk quite often makes it difficult to understand the dialogue. Miami Vice lacks character development and substitutes atmosphere and tense dialogue for mindless action. It never dumbs down it's story for the audience's sake and plays exactly as it would in real life. If you're looking for a good police thriller that doesn't insult your intelligence I strongly recommend Miami Vice to you. I love this stylish underrated film and give it a 910.Miami Vice is rated R for strong violence language and some sexual content.Sex 810 Violence 810 Swearing 610 Drugs 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Flashbacks of a white suit worn to the wedding of an exgirlfriend's sister went through my mind when I saw that there was another Television show Turned Movie. Go ahead and laugh but I am sure more than one of the men out there had an Angel's Flight suit or some other Don Johnson wannabe be piece of 80's kitch clothing.I was very doubtful of the outcome until I saw they handed Miami Vice to directorwriter Michael Mann. Mann who brought us Heat Ali and Collateral adds another action film to his collection of hits with this version of the Miami Police Department's vice detective team of James 'Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. They're the guys who show up and make happen what the CSI folk figure out later.In this Vice story our heroes are about to break up a prostitution ring when they get a call from a nonactive informant saying that there is something major going down and he is leaving. That this first story line goes away is good because it will give you a chance to get up to speed with the movie which starts above the speed limit in the very first frame and you need to get ready for the ride. This informant leads them to be assigned to an FBI task force investigating a drug ring that is going to involve Russians Skinhead Nazis Colombians and anyone else that can be thrown in. But that's not the important part. What is important is that the FBI task force has a leak that is getting agents killed. And since Miami PD is not part of it Crockett Colin Farrell from Phone Booth Daredevil and Tubbs Jaime Foxx from Jarhead Ray Collateral can be trusted to help the Feds get to the bottom of it.Part of the charm of Vice is that it doesn't stop to explain things to the slow kids in the audience. To Mann's credit he doesn't dumb down the dialog to let us know the intricacies of what the main characters are talking about. There's no Gee if there is a bullet in his brain he was probably killed by the impact of it pabulum that invades television cop shows. The characters all know what they are talking about and expect us to keep up or catch up during gunfire scenes. Also to Mann's credit he does not throw in a stupid twist like Crockett and Tubb's boss is part of the conspiracy. That would have sucked. Don't worry their boss is a good guy like them.The violence of Vice is another thing that is not dumbed or numbed down in this film. You don't just see a man getting shot and flying backwards from the impact you see his insides come outside as each piece of lead tears apart the body. This is an Rrated film and it earns it. A strong warning to parents here if you think that the kids have seen cop shows and this is going to be the same..... NO.... This is lots of violence and it's not hidden by quick cuts and editing. And for those parents who don't mind their kids seeing bodies being ripped apart sinew by sinew there are people having SEX too! Good sex. With a 228 mile boat ride full of foreplay.And speaking of those racing boats I have a quick side note here. This may be a plot problem but I am not sure. You know those GoGo boats? The really fast racing ones? Do they have enough range to get from Miami to Havana? I didn't know the answer to that one and it might be something that needs 'xpalining. But by the time you see this scene you will probably be completely entrenched in the story and can't wait to see the two characters in the boat get to Havana for a mojito and sex that you won't care.I had been dreading this movie because if Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx were expected to act at all like their predecessors it would have been a long couple of hours. But that did not happen. Farrell gets more screen time than Foxx but they are both terrific. In looking back at Foxx's career it was in another Mann film ALI that his career truly turned and he began getting away from the dufus parts to the serious Leading Man roles that he has had since. It was good to see him team up with Mann for the third time. He is an actor who is honing his craft and has become a reason to see a film. The best acting in the movie is turned however by John Ortiz who plays Jose Yero a midlevel management type in the crime syndicate. He is smart and not so much evil as ruthless in running the business. Yero has been a lot of crime movies  The Opportunists Narc Ransom  but never anywhere close to top billing. This film could and should get him a lot more work higher up the cast list. The Farrell love interest there always IS one  it's in his contract is Li Gong last seen as the bad ass hooker Hatsumomo in Memoirs of a Geisha. I feel she was a little stilted and tight but that might be the language block. When she is in scenes where she does not speak  and just relies on her body language we see more of her abilities The soundtrack and sound are also terrific. Gunshots are loud and jarring and the background music makes you feel the heat on screen.I enjoyed Miami Vice. It was much better than I expected and that does not happen enough for me. You need to like action flicks. Or watching Foxx and Farrell and Gong. But that is not difficult  Let it be your own little vice.".

	onyx:emotionText "Flashbacks of a white suit worn to the wedding of an exgirlfriend's sister went through my mind when I saw that there was another Television show Turned Movie. Go ahead and laugh but I am sure more than one of the men out there had an Angel's Flight suit or some other Don Johnson wannabe be piece of 80's kitch clothing.I was very doubtful of the outcome until I saw they handed Miami Vice to directorwriter Michael Mann. Mann who brought us Heat Ali and Collateral adds another action film to his collection of hits with this version of the Miami Police Department's vice detective team of James 'Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs. They're the guys who show up and make happen what the CSI folk figure out later.In this Vice story our heroes are about to break up a prostitution ring when they get a call from a nonactive informant saying that there is something major going down and he is leaving. That this first story line goes away is good because it will give you a chance to get up to speed with the movie which starts above the speed limit in the very first frame and you need to get ready for the ride. This informant leads them to be assigned to an FBI task force investigating a drug ring that is going to involve Russians Skinhead Nazis Colombians and anyone else that can be thrown in. But that's not the important part. What is important is that the FBI task force has a leak that is getting agents killed. And since Miami PD is not part of it Crockett Colin Farrell from Phone Booth Daredevil and Tubbs Jaime Foxx from Jarhead Ray Collateral can be trusted to help the Feds get to the bottom of it.Part of the charm of Vice is that it doesn't stop to explain things to the slow kids in the audience. To Mann's credit he doesn't dumb down the dialog to let us know the intricacies of what the main characters are talking about. There's no Gee if there is a bullet in his brain he was probably killed by the impact of it pabulum that invades television cop shows. The characters all know what they are talking about and expect us to keep up or catch up during gunfire scenes.

Colin Farrell tends to play the same character over and over and Jamie Foxx despite his talent is often cast as the new Wesley Snipes. Strangely both of those tendencies carry over into Miami Vice but somehow the movie manages not to suck. Quite the opposite. It's really really good.Over 130 minutes and somewhat thinly spread dialog means that an attention span is required. Also it helps to have an appreciation of the visual and aural potentials of the filmvideo medium as the movie is absolutely stunning in both respects. Furthermore Mann uses a digital camera instead of celluloid so the narrative action seems more real or at least more apprehendable somewhat like cinema verite or the show COPS.What is truly amazing here is the feat Mann has accomplished whereby the production  the shots the soundtrack and sound quality the editing  is so masterful at once brand new in technique but nostalgic in content that it manages to endow what would otherwise be another cop drama read Lethal Weapon with all kinds of emotional layering narrative originality and character dynamic the things that make movies great.If you look for movies to appeal to your endocrine system rather than your brain then maybe you'll be disappointed by Miami Vice.

And how about this for corny dialogue...'probability is like gravity...'? er..yeah like dog crap and cheese are identicial???It seems Michael Mann is a one HEAT hit wonder and simply adding a 10 minute gunfight lifted straight out of HEAT at the end of the movie is not going to save it.If you want to watch a decent cop thriller check out the little known 'Dirty' a superior film by a lesser known director.Avoid this Miami VICE and buy the TV series instead.".

The film was just one sub plot over another and a zig zag of labyrinthian proportions of where the film should be going. And how about this for corny dialogue...'probability is like gravity...'? er..yeah like dog crap and cheese are identicial???It seems Michael Mann is a one HEAT hit wonder and simply adding a 10 minute gunfight lifted straight out of HEAT at the end of the movie is not going to save it.If you want to watch a decent cop thriller check out the little known 'Dirty' a superior film by a lesser known director.Avoid this Miami VICE and buy the TV series instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years Miami has been the set of many television hits most recently NipTuck and of course CSIMiami. The most popular show remains Miami Vice which started breaking the barriers between big and small screen. Now thanks to writerdirector Michael Mann who produced the series back in the '80s Miami Vice receives the Hollywood treatment. However that doesn't mean the movie is a ridiculous remake Charlie's Angels or a funny if inspired homage Starsky  Hutch. This is a dark strong ferociously adult blockbuster which doesn't flinch for a second from letting us know it's some ugly territory we're visiting.In terms of style Mann nails it from the beginning with a beautiful opening sequence set in a disco fans of Collateral will be happy. It is here that we first meet the film's protagonists Sonny Crockett Colin Farrell and Rico Tubbs who are supposed to lead a minor drugbust operation. That is until they receive a phone call from an informer Deadwood's John Hawkes who tells them he messed up then kills himself. At this point the FBI represented by Ciaran Hinds' strict unpleasant handler decide to hire the two police officers to infiltrate a powerful organization that uses Miami as a transition point to bring in drugs from South America.Saying exactly who does what inside the organization is a waste of time for two reasons a roles can change depending on the circumstances b it doesn't really matter. The important thing is our heroes' assignment gets increasingly more complex and dangerous as Tubbs realizes his girlfriend might get killed and Crockett decides to spice things up a little by seducing the bad guy's mistress Isabella Gong Li in her most convincing Englishspeaking part. Business as usual then? Don't think so.Looking back on Mann's CV Miami Vice can be considered a perfect companion piece to Heat and Collateral having inherited the latter's looks and the former's pacing the really seminal events occur only in the last part of the movie. What it also has picked from both and dramatically increased is an everlasting ambiguity. One of the reasons Crockett and Tubbs infiltrate the drug world is the presence of a mole hence the inevitable question who is trustworthy?Furthermore the two protagonists' behavior is an example of ambivalence at its best Tubbs and Crockett know the law yet they're not unwilling to break it if such a thing is required. Crockett in particular played by a sublime Farrell it's his best performance since Phone Booth is a rebel who irreversibly crosses the line with Isabella he knows it's wrong and so does she and that's probably not the only thing she knows but there they are regardless of the consequences. It's a relationship that perfectly symbolizes the duplicitous nature of the world we live in and in this specific case the city where the events unfold.Because of the conspicuous ambiguity Miami Vice doesn't have a proper ending. In fact it almost feels as if we're watching the first episode of a new season of the TV show. Now given the director the chances of a sequel being made are extremely thin. But what we have seen for two hours remains pure Mann artful exciting and undeniably gripping. And that's exactly what we asked for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mann what happened?????!!! This movie has me split on two levels. First Vice is iconography at its best. I mean lets face it to have Miami Vice you have to have a Ferrari a cigarette boat clothes and a black and white cop named Tubbs and Crocket. If you take those elements and attach Michael Mann to it you get Vice rightWRONG!!!!!!! WRONG WRONG... Second damnit I am just completely let down by the acting of both leads... This was in my opinion rushed so Universal could start their own TV to Motion Picture franchise market. This simply did not sell to me. These characters the 06 incarnation lacked heart. The characters were not developed there is at best pseudo empathy for the heroes. To me if I could recast the leads as Crockett would be Jason Statham and as Tubbs Terrance Howard. To me that's a more believable combination than what I saw on screen last night. Where this fell down dramatically was in thrusting the audience into the action without any retelling of the backstory. Who are these two and how they met really was the foundation of what drove the show and made people comeback week after week for four years. There is no element of fidelity between the two partners and the chemistry really appears to be forced between Foxx and Farrell. But with what I saw and please do not let my opinion sway you one way or the other but it looked like Heat met Collateral in Miami. That just didn't look right. To me this boiled down to a shutem up in Miami that was thoughtless and mindless. No real calculation on anybody's part. I mean what I was a video game. Visually this is a breath taking version of MV. I especially enjoyed seeing the updates of the many of the characters Tubbs is a pilot Trudy intell operative Gina SWAT Team weapons expert Castio a more active role in the takedown.. But what happened to Crocket? Crocket looks like an unpolished southerner. I really hate to say it like this but this Crocket looks like he missed casting for last year's Dukes of Hazard. What I liked best about the TV Crocket is that he appeared to have real problems which grounded him to some sense of reality. He was in the midst of a divorce and would have switch between the two roles. In Heat this was executed flawlessly as we saw Deniro's character tip toe between a normal life and his life as a criminal. Pachino did the same thing with his character Vincent Hanna he's trying to maintain a marriage while having to switch into his police mode which actually flirts on the razors edge of right and wrong. I didn't see that here the edge not the edge of action but the edge of identityfabricated identity was the term used in the movie and they talked about it but they didn't execute it....".

If you want to see the top of the genre watch The Sicilian Clan 1969.In Cop's Honour the scenario is very flat and predictable. A group of not well defined extremists opens fire on young people. There is also a scene where what it seems black immigrants are also shoot at. During this spree they kill Delon character daughter.

Just when I was about to find an excuse and proclaim Chow as an untapped talent I came upon Curry  Pepper.Although it shies away from his later established fantasycomedy sequences it provides handful of fast spoken gags. I wouldn't go as far as to say that Chow and Cheung had the greatest chemistry in the history of buddycop movies not like many others have anyway but they had enough focus to effortlessly deliver their goods over and over again. Chow tries to come off as a hardboiled bullet loving cop with a short temper while Cheung does a fine job playing a softspoken ladies man with similar to Chow's tendencies. Their conflict of interest is over Ann Bridgewater who really doesn't do much except look good and proper.The end result is satisfying and this movie manages to become one of Chow's best offerings from the late 80's to early 90's era. What ultimately helps this film is that not too many characters are crammed into the story and the routine that Curry  Pepper perform as a twomanshow simply works.".

The movie is well aware of this among parodying other typical elements which personally was one of the reasons it was so charming.

Curry and Pepper is nothing more than a plot less Hong Kong actioncomedy movie. There is very little in the way of a plot and it is mostly focused on two parters who are best friends and are torn apart by a girl they call soccerballs I won't say why. As is typical the comedy is quite clever and the movie still delivers quite a lot of laughs even though it has been translated.There are a few incidents that hold this movie together such as a couple of American counterfeiters a pimp named Ten Soccerballs and a gun deal. It is the gun deal that takes out the end of the movie because Soccerballs disappears entirely when Curry realises that they are from different social classes and there is no way they can make a relationship work. The counterfeiters are met twice and then taken away but the rest of the movie is tied up with the gun runners. What we finish up with is a tough assassin chasing Curry and Pepper around and a huge gunfight on a ship. The gunfight isn't as spectacular as a John Woo film such as Hard Boiled but it is enough to make this movie go off. As I said to my friend afterwards a typical Hongkong action movie with no plot whatsoever that is why I liked it.".

The idea of this bodyguard WongKom who gets fired after the death of his client is just of those clichs.But then later on WongKom realises that a group of assassins are after the client's son so that they can their hands on the fortune..There were some funny scenes good one liners.. Fights scenes and shoot out scenes they were great.. Just like what you may've seen in another film ONGBAK..I think with this guy Petchai WongKomlao.. I think he'll be Asia's next Jackie Chan. So he used to be a comedian unlike another Asian favourite Takeshi Kitano.. But now as he takes the director's chair.. He really gave the film a good going over.. with all the thrills and spills of any action movie and combined with a bit of a slapstick humour just to add to all the fun..I manage to see the behindthescenes featurette which basically looks at the film on how it was made as well as having the cast and crew interviews.. Well not much crews.. But I must say I've enjoyed it..It was very good! A thumbs up! 9 out of 10!".

The Bodyguard doesn't fall into the excellent category. It falls into what the hell is going on and why are all the Thai people laughing category. This movie is supposed to be a comedy. The English subtitles were particularly bad I speak more than a little Thai and many times I knew the English was not good because I understood the Thai. I didn't laugh once with the rest of the audienceall Thai I was the only Caucasian farang. Then there were the 3 or 4 times I did laugh out loud and I was the only one laughing! This movie is of almost the slapstick variety chock full of inside jokes being on the inside in this case means being Thai or understanding the Thai language better than I do and silly humor. It stars one of Thailand's most popular comedians Piphat Apiraktanakorn more commonly known by his nickname Mahm usually spelled Mom but he's a guy and not a real mom that I know of... I think this guy is great and funny. This lends credence to my theory that the English subtitling was just awful. Mahm has a 3 minute cameo in Luang Phii Theng that is the funniest part of the movie. Try one of the other Thai films before going to this one. Especially OngBak probably the best martial arts film I have ever seenAnd Tony Jaa is the best martial arts movie fighter I have ever seen and he does it all without stunt double wires or computer effects. If you see one Thai film this year make it OngBak not the Bodyguard!".

After changing my expectations while I was watching the film I found myself laughing sometimes hysterically at a couple of jokes. Not bad if I think that I'm not so easy to laugh. But what I primarily liked was the relation between the young heir and the girl from the suburbs and her family and neighbors. That was a nice touch obviously not very developed in a movie like this but anyway nice and likable. Not bad at all yes... Sometimes it's silly but it has its moments too. My two sons liked it probably more than me. But I didn't dislike it either so I give it 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I picked up this film in a market is that on the front cover it promised 'the return of Tony Jaa'. Having seen Ongbak and warrior king I saw this is a good thing. Only what I ended up with was a film write directed and starring Petchtai Wongkamlao the costar from the other films.From the onset of the film you get the impression that the film may be a decent action flick with all the slow motion dressed in black leather gun fights aplenty. However this soon cools off very soon and you end up with the main star not talking for the first 22 minutes gun fight scenes occurring with all the action being offscreen yes I mean people getting shot without any real action and jokes which really are not funny.A major half of the film contains now action and is mainly about Wong Koms association with Pok which to be honest I couldn't be bothered to watch and skipped to the end I was getting that fed up with the film.At the end where you expect a huge fight what you end up with is the main guy getting beat up for 15 minutes showing absolutely no fighting skill and yet some how each person he's fighting ends up defeating themselves in some foolish way. This is stupid is not funny and in the end I was rooting for the bad guys as the lead character was really annoying me.The film was 95 minutes long and yet I want 93 minutes back. Why? Because during the film Tony Jaa appears for about 2 minutes and actually does some martial arts very very well!. What a missell! This film should have been done by having Tony Jaa in the lead role and Petchtai Wongkamlao taking Tony Jaas that way he probably would have been killed early on and there would have been a decent number of fight scenes at the end.This is not a martial arts film it is not a comedy it is 2 minutes of good film hidden within 93 minutes of film that makes Chuck Norris look good.I gave this a 2 which would have been 1 of Tony Jaa hadn't appeared.".

	schema:headline " Hit and miss Thai action comedy with film references for fans";
	schema:reviewBody "This Thai comedy features that county's biggest standup comedian Petchtai Wongkamlao as a bodyguard who gets embroiled in a war between his employer and a rival businessman. Now Wongkamlao will be familiar to most Western audiences as the bald sidekick in ONG BAK and the policeman in WARRIOR KING and here he attempts to reinvent himself as his country's answer to Jackie Chan. While a lot of the surreal humour evident from Jackie's films is evident and there's a Chanstyle chase scene where a buttnaked Wongkamlao is chased through the streets by a gang of guntoting thugs just like in THE ACCIDENTAL SPY Wongkamlao is never going to be success in the West because the humour is just too far out here! Many of the jokes require knowledge of Thai culture and customs and as such they fall flat and to make matters worse there is a monotonous subplot involving the lives of the poor which really drags the movie down.The comedy is so broad and unusual that you'll be wondering what on earth you're watching. Humour comes from a bad guy henchman with Down's Syndrome and another henchman who keeps wearing the wrong clothes to work and misunderstanding his boss  that's a joke that is repeated about ten to twenty times throughout the entire film. While Wongkamlao does his best to keep up with the humour he underplays his role and that sits oddly with some of the supposed comedy scenes. Bits involving the supporting cast are entirely dull and the romantic subplot with ONG BAK's Pumwaree Yodkamol only serves to reinforce my impression that she's an utterly annoying actress.The film is bookended by a couple of decent scenes. The first is a shootout in a restaurant which is so overthetop that it absolutely kicks ass wirework is used in abundance as Wongkamlao flips shoots and flies across tables gunning down the bad guys as he does so. Meanwhile the film's climax is set in a warehouse as our eponymous hero battles various bad guys one at a time. There's a Thai boxer the aforementioned Down's Syndrome guy who turns out to be supertough and a periodset fighter. The comedy here is broad and cheesy recalling the type of humour in the SCARY MOVIE series but at least it's more acceptable and understandable than that found elsewhere. The bit where a naked Wongkamlao has his butt squirted with a water pistol seems to go on for an age and makes for uncomfortable incomprehensible viewing.However the film does throw in some references to other movies which are fun if you're in the know. There's a mad homeless man who keeps saying that Bang Rajan is about to fall an amusing reference to the ultrasuccessful Thai historical epic BANG RAJAN which was released in 2000. One fighter at the film's climax adopts Jet Li's style from ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA complete with blatant wirework and OUATIC's theme tune playing over the action which is very funny indeed. However the best part of the film for most Western audiences will be Tony Jaa's cameo he plays a supermarket fighter who gets to kick some ass in a few very quick fight scenes. Passing Wongkamlao as he leaves he calls the actor 'Humlae'  Wongkamlao's name in ONG BAK. Wongkamlao's response? Wrong film dickhead!. Unfortunately these genuinely funny moments come few and far between and the film as a whole drags with the whole everythingbutthekitchensink approach to the comedy quickly becoming tiring.".

We actually don't mind watching some these corny movies every now and then as long as we are prepared for it. Although we enjoy watching some these actors in some of the other movies they've done don't expect the same type of caliber in this movie.

He is talented in speaking and spins arguments to defend the cigarette industry in the most difficult situations. His best friends are Polly Bailey that works in the Moderation Council in alcohol business and Bobby Jay Bliss of the gun business own advisory group SAFETY. They frequently meet each other in a bar and they selftitle the M.O.D. Squad a.k.a. Merchants of Death disputing which industry has killed more people. Nick's greatest enemy is Vermont's Senator Ortolan Finistirre who defends in the Senate the use of a skull and crossbones on cigarette packs. Nick's son Joey Naylor lives with his mother and has the chance to know his father in a business trip. When the ambitious reporter Heather Holloway betrays Nick disclosing confidences he had in bed with her his life turns upsidedown. But Nick is good in what he does for the mortgage.";

The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise I've ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire its wit biting dogooders and dobadders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you don't laugh out loud your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.Young Jason Reitman's direction and screenplay are deft and light. He is never heavyhanded or worse condescending as may have happened more than once in WAG THE DOG. Based on a novel by Christopher Buckley the son of William F. Buckley the script is the star here. The double triple and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a starstudded ensemble cast who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Every reviewer opines that this will be Aaron Eckhart's breakout role. With his DudleyDoRight face and that guy who always gets the girl on crack charm and glibness his Nick Naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctor's prescription the means justify the end.The casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director. Rob Lowe as the genius behind Hollywood EGO a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement is noteperfect in a small role. With William H. Macy the Vermont Senator who takes on the tobacco industry Maria Bello a fellow Merchant of Death lobbyist and Robert Duvall the Captain of this particular industry the cast is jawdropping and sublimely funny. Katie Holmes preTomKat is gorgeous seductive and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her story.Nick Naylor's relationship with his son is the lens which focuses Nick on his own behavior. Even that relationship is not treated as a clich or completely reverently by the satirist who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our selfrighteousness. It is a breath of fresh air. I not only recommend it I intend to see it again.".

Aaron Eckhart holds the picture together with a witty charismatic performance as a tobacco lobbyist. The film is basically about his profession as he spins the news pitches a movie idea dodges a subpoena has an affair with a reporter Katie Holmes tries to spend time with his son Cameron Bright and has lunch with an alcohol lobbyist Maria Bello and a firearms rep David Koechner  where they literally compare body counts. The performances are excellent across the board from William H. Macy's crusading Senator to Rob Lowe's smirking Hollywood agent who struts around his office in a kimono. Even Adam Brody is enjoyable as Lowe's hyperactive assistant whose injoke with a coworker earned one of the biggest laughs of the movie.The majority of the credit however needs to go to firsttime feature director Jason son of Ivan Reitman. Adapting from Christopher Buckley's novel Reitman has fashioned an enormously clever script consistent and strong in character yet not forgetting to be incredibly funny. The style is also perfect  brisk lighthearted with impeccable timing marred only by a tangental subplot including Sam Elliott that is sadly not very funny. Overall however the pace is fast enough where the laughs keep coming.Reitman also does the unthinkable he keeps the satire dark and funny to the very end. While most comedies stray blindly into the sentimental Thank You avoids unnecessary emotional tripe and  thankfully  avoids sermonizing about the dangers of smoking or of the flaws of the political process. Eckhart's flawless performance and Reitman's wonderful screenplay anchor an uncommonly perceptive comedy provided you take yours black. If you need a little cream and sugar Fun with Dick and Jane might still be at the dollar theater.".

And by spoilers I don't mean the Bruce Willis is dead type but Bruce Willis is bald types. sighSome jobs are harder than others but Nick Naylor Aaron Eckhart tobacco industry spokesman handles his with effortless skill. Along with two other spokespeople for the alcohol and firearms industry respectively he is part of the selfappointed M.O.D. squad Merchants of Death whose main objective is to talk. To BS. To spin. To confuse and convince their opponent and charm their audience. A job of such nature naturally requires a certain moral flexibility and with smoothtalk and sex appeal it is apparent that Nick is incredibly gifted in this area.He goes on TVshows verbally battles U.S. senators deems the Cancer Research Foundation arseholes  all the while trying to set an example for his 10yearold son. This is naturally very difficult doing what he does. So as Big Tobacco for whom he is a lobbyist launches a campaign to reinstate the cool smoking image into mainstream Hollywood and sends Nick to work a producer for the proper productplacement Nick decides to bring his son along for the ride to see how daddy works in hopes to bond with him.Good satires are hard to come by but Reitman's Thank You For Smoking is so wet with sarcasm and dripping with humour that it is impossible not to enjoy. It navigates the fastpaced industry the art of talking and spoofs the antismoking camp with their chich cancersick boy in a wheelchair front as seen in the opening scene of the film and it explores the moral flexibility of Americans without preaching too much in doing so. Only once does it fall prey to predictable moral messages as when Nick starts reevaluating his work and has moral qualms following his kidnapping by an antismoking group only to swoop down into tongueandcheek mode again and return twice as biting  and twice as funny.Although the film is evenly peppered with fun oneliners and perfect delivery from its cast the best scene is when the M.O.D. squad are at their usual restaurant hangout at the end of the day and brag to each other and argue over whose business kills the most people per year. Nick How many alcoholrelated deaths per day? 100000? That's what... 270 a day? Wow. 270 people tragedy. Excuse me if I don't exactly see terrorists getting excited about kidnapping anyone from the alcoholindustry. Maria Bello who plays the detached funny Moderate Spokeswoman for alcohol has great inyourface aptitude and attitude That's stupid arguing. Aaron Eckhart is also hilarious throughout in a shady businessman way I now have a major crush on him. Out of all the cast only Nick's little kid Joe chokes on the wellwritten lines.In fact even the cinematography is wellcrafted in the film... just the way a scene cuts to another deserves credit opening with a rapidfire ironic note. Speaking of which Thank You's opening montage of cigarette packages as credits is a stroke of genius on Reitman's part. So are the various casting choices  the amount of respected actors that have been crammed into supporting roles in impressive Robert Duvall Sam Elliot William H. Macy and give rise to an almost familiar and feelgood tone in the film. That said I wouldn't call this laughoutloud worthy exactly and I didn't care for the ending but it is clear that a lot of thought has been put into Thank You For Smoking  every line is a wellarticulated kick up the arse to something and delivered by the bucketload. A very enjoyable little satire.8 out of 10".

Aaron Eckhart the single leading man with the WORST haircut in Hollywood full disclosure  I'm damn near bald matches very well with the direction of Reitman. From the getgo it's a fastpaced sendup of everyone and everything in the tobacco war. The entire cast does a good job w the exception maybe of Katie Holmes. Rob Lowe is hysterical in his cameo but I have to say Eckhart  his MOD squad buddies Maria Bello  David Koechner really light up the screen. Their scenes of discussing the dealing out of death through the industries they represent over drinks are a real strong point of the movie.The fact that this movie doesn't take sides  and really could be about any issue because it's more about the MAN behind the spokesperson  but makes fun of all sides in the tobacco issue. The interaction bw Nick Naylor Eckhart  the old Marlboro Man Sam Elliot is priceless as is the backandforth between Naylor  Senator Ortolan Finistirre William H. Macy towards the end of the film it's basically good actors doing what they do well  and it's very funny.The movie's also a little bit touchyfeely focusing for a bit on the relationship bw Naylor  his son Joey Cameron Bright  the kid's good  some of the lines written for him are priceless.There was one odd stupid thing  and my wife agrees w me on this so I'm not just being a guy there are 2 'sex' scenes w Eckhart  Katie Holmes but zero nudity. Nada. Not even partial. We see them having sex in multiple places  positions but they're almost completely clothed. It just took away from the credibility is all I'm trying to point out here  as I said my wife actually made the comment before I did.Bottom line it's a great movie  well worth the price of admission. It's funny it's entertaining  it moves what more could you ask for?".

I don't think i've laughed this hard in a long long time. this movie isn't really intended to be antismoking propaganda but there is some of it. Its more of a satire on the reality of people and how much we're willing to believe or willing to be dooped. I see it similar to liar liar not being about about the legal system but the moral and ethical decisions of people within society. overall I would have to saw this is a great great movie. Highly recommend it. And could not imagine this movie to turn out any better than it has already been with the perfect cast and great story line. I think the best way to encompass the movie is paraphrased in the movie's catchy advertising line the main character Nick Naylor doesn't lie he filters the truth.".

At first I was a bit worried that this was going to be the old hat anti smoking movie that makes all smokers victims of the eeeeevil tobacco companies but then I saw that it was based on a Christopher Buckley novel and I relaxed a bit! This pokes fun at all sides of the issue from the tobacco lobbyist's insistence that there has been no conclusive proof that tobacco is harmful to the legislator's thinking that putting a warning label on cigarettes will actually make someone pick up a cigarette package read the label and decide not to smoke...as if ANYONE with half a brain doesn't know that inhaling smoke into your lungs will harm you.Aaron Eckhart did a fine job in his role as did Sam Elliot Rob Lowe Katie Holmes...I could go on and on. It's fascinating to watch Eckhart's character spin and spin so that he brings people around to his way of thinking. He has to be representing one of the most hated industries in the United States yet he is able to convince people as to the opposite! I highly recommend this film!".

Nick somewhat sympathetic makes his argument that it is in his best interest to keep people like Robin alive so they can continue to smoke cigarettes. Nick proclaims that the Tobacco Industry will spend 50 million on campaign to educate kids against smoking. Nick wins over the entire studio audience for his humanitarian stance. A young woman sitting by also watching the movie voices that I am very annoyed. She might have been clued in by the movie audience laughter that satire lives and thrives in Jason Reitman's Thank You for Smoking. Reitman's screenplay based on the book by Christopher Buckley son of William Buckley Thank You for Smoking is painfully hilarious and a clever dark comedy focused on the multibillion dollar Tobacco Industry. Writer and Director Rietman has a similar conceit as his main character Nick Naylor as he tells his story in the context of freedom and the consequence of choicehowever skewed the context. Aaron Eckhart is amazing as Nick Time Magazine's Sultan of Spin. As Nick describes himself Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk. His Nick Naylor is the VicePresident of the Academy of Tobacco Studies or in English he is a Tobacco Lobbyist. He is a master at what he does. Nick is also the political target of Senator Ortolan Finistirre William H. Macy who wants to stamp all cigarettes with a poison label.Every week Nick has dinner with the MOD squadthat would be the Merchants of Death. Polly Bailey smart and sexy Mario Bello is with the Alcohol Lobby. Bobby Jay Bliss classic good old boy David Koechner is with the Firearms Lobby. Big dog Nick reminds Polly that she is only responsible for two deaths per day only. It turns out that Nick is scheduled for an interview with reporter Heather Holloway hot and lethal Katie Holmes who according to Bobby Jay has spectacular ts. Of course Nick is never over his head. At the same time Nick's boss BR absolutely funny JK Simmons arranges meeting with entertainment agency EGO's CEO Jeff Megall played by Rob Lowe at his comic straight man best in Los Angeles. Nick is after getting smoking back in the movies reestablishing it as sexy and cool. Nick makes a case to his exwife Jill Kim Dickens that this would be an opportunity for him to spend quality time with their son Joey kind of eerily played by Cameron Bright. He fails however Joey presents a winning argument that gains him a trip to Los Angeles with his Dad.In a signature scene reporter Heather Holmes asks Nick Eckhart Why do you do what you do? Unflinching Nick says Population control. Then he cops to Everyone's got to pay the mortgage This is funny and dead on. Director Rietman maintains this absurdest ecologythere is no envelop for his material and at the same time he generates genuine sympathy for his characters. And in the business world it is all about the bottom line. In another classic scene Nick delivers a brief case with 25 million to the lung cancer stricken Marlborough Man a great Sam Elliotwho can either keep the money for his family thus shutting his mouth to the media or give it all away to charity. The offer is nonnegotiable. Everyone has to pay their mortgage. Walking on the Santa Monica Pier with his son Joey Nick advises on the virtues of being morally flexible. The writing in Thank You for Smoking is so smart and drop dead funnyso to speak.The performances are equally stunning starting with Aaron Eckhart as Nick. Eckhart is a great looking leading man who is edgy and has impeccable comedic timing. He plays Nick with the innate charm that tempers his arrogance and aloofness. His Nick is doing his best to spin the tobacco industry's aftermath and still raise his son to make up his own mind as he grows up. Not easyeven without the cigarettes issue. Cameron Bright is smart and strangely endearing as Joey who really has the choice of despising or admiring his father. Robert Duvall is at his caricature best as the Captain of the Tobacco Industry. Rob Lowe is another standout as the totally affected EGO head Jeff Megall. There is comic genius when the kimono attired Jeff calls Nick saying that It's 4 am in Japan. I'm calling from the future. Director Rietman goes where few dare and makes us laugh at our darker nature. He also tells a story of the responsibilities of freedom and choice and the consequences all with a sense of humor. See Thank You for Smokingit is one of the year's best.".

That one wasn't really a boxing movie it was about a man realizing what was important in his life and boxing was just a means to an end. Thank You for Smoking isn't trying to convince people to smoke or not to smoke. It's about choice. Well that's what the characters are lobbying for quite literally. Maybe since this is a dark comedy it doesn't really have any moral high ground. But Aaron Eckhart who plays the lead role of Tobacco industry spokesperson Nick Naylor and is playing a character who himself smokes doesn't actually light up a cigarette on camera.Nick Naylor's job is spin and he's damn good at it. As he tells his 12 year old son who idolizes his father you're never on the wrong side of an argument if you can support your facts and most importantly prove the other person wrong. And it's not that Naylor thinks cigarettes are the greatest invention ever he does what he does for the challenge. His tasks in this film include getting cigarettes back into movies preferably being used by Brad Pitt and Catherine ZetaJones right after a zerog sex scene and to convince a congressional subcommittee to not include a new poison icon on all packs of cigarettes.The movie is full of subplots and great supporting characters but the movie doesn't seem weighed down by them. It still moves along rather briskly and clocks in at about 90 minutes. But at the same time it never loses its dual focus that of Naylor's relationship with his son where he's still trying to be a good role model despite how hated he is by others for what he does and with the other focus just being the brilliance of Naylor's spin. Eckhart shines in this film. He never rambles. He always gets his two cents in and more. He's clever throughout and no matter what evil it is that he may be defending you can't help but like and admire him.And I must go over some of this supporting cast. Maria Bello and David Koechner join Naylor for lunch once a week and as respective representatives for the alcohol firearms and tobacco industries they refer to themselves as the Merchants of Death and have quite a lively mealdebate. William H. Macy is Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre who loves his state of Vermont's cheese and is one of the most outspoken adversaries of Big Tobacco. I loved J.K. Simmons as BR Naylor's boss. He just has such a loud mouth I love hearing him swear and rant in movies. You also have Robert Duvall as The Captain the guy BR has to run policy through and who is idolized by anyone working in Big Tobacco Sam Elliott as a former Marlboro Man who is deadset against not shutting up in anger until Naylor spins a few things Katie Holmes as a reporter Naylor falls for Rob Lowe as a movie producer who'll take funding from anyone and can spin as well as Naylor and Dennis Miller as thankfully himself.So then I don't think this movie takes sides at all on tobacco. It's a movie for people actually capable of looking at an issue from both sides and to find humor in it all. I guess that means it's not for Republicans. And even if you go into this movie thinking you won't be impressed I think Naylor will work his magic and convince you otherwise.".

He defends an industry I despise so it's credit to the film that he struck a chord as such a savvy and charismatic guy who carries the film to the beat of his own tune. Great performances all round also do the film no end of favours guided along by a screen play that dishes out witty and sparkling dialogue by the bucketload making the film a seemingly neverending glee ride.Thank you for Smoking Please come Again.

This balance is thrown off a bit sometimes  David Koechner's portrayal of an NRA lobbyist is great but feels out of place as if it belongs in a comedy in the vein of Anchorman. And ultimately this uneven mix of the deadly serious literally with offthewall gags does catch up with the film it eventually falls back upon its very strong script which supports it a lesser film might be affected more drastically with a weaker screenplay but some scenes probably should have been toned down a bit to comply with the subtler and more realistic scenes. For what it's worth the wacky scenes are extremely hilarious but they seem to contradict other portions of the material.Jason is a better director than his father though and shows a lot of potential here I'd say the direction is almost deserving of a more serious film. I'd love to see what he could do with a drama in the future.The movie also boasts an excellent lead performance by Aaron Eckhart who oozes with sleaze greed corruption and a hidden sense of morals. He knows what he is doing is wrong but he's not a stereotypical Hollywood motion picture good guy  even the closing of the picture without spoiling it isn't the moralistic copout I had expected the movie isn't a blackandwhite painting of the smoking controversy it doesn't take sides on either side of the debate.This is really being marketed incorrectly as the next 40YearOld Virgin right now but the film  for the most part anyway  really isn't as hilarious as it is thoughtprovoking and engaging. Apart from a few aforementioned moments of utter absurdity the majority of the film's duration involves some pretty serious topics and it handles them well. It's not a bustyourgutfunny movie and it's perhaps not as strong as some reviews would lead you to believe but it's one of the better satires in recent memory and certainly one of the more effective since Wag the Dog.".

There were about 2 good laughs that were new to me but the other 7 I had already seen in those marvelous trailers. I would have probably enjoyed Thank You for Smoking a bit better if I had not seen the trailers. So the lesson is to avoid trailers. Trailers are spoilers. The story was good maybe because there haven't been any movies about a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. Still you'll find some possibly Hollywood clichs even if this is supposedly an independent film. I'd think the mainstream audience would enjoy this film more so than Transamerica. Its style of jokes perhaps is the reason. For example subtitles or symbols are introduced to add humor which of course aren't seen by the characters. It doesn't make the movie any worse but the type of humor is why I'd think casual film goers would enjoy this movie and the satire is in some ways similar to what is on TV now a days. Sure it had some good jokes and was an interesting story but as the film ended it just didn't fit together. Don't want to spoil it but there were some mix messages of what the movie was really about? Thank You for Smoking was a nice film which seemed to have a unique story but had some Hollywood influence.Spoilers Why didn't I like the ending?The movie was a satire on the people in charge of the tobacco industry. However it did show the good in the people at least the lobbyist Nick Naylor. The message was delivered that people had to do their jobs to get by in life to have money to support it. Another was to decide for yourself and not let a higher power tell you what to believe. Yet in the end the tobacco industry lost and Nick decided not rejoin the industry. Tobacco was seen as the enemy once again. Nick should have rejoined and the industry should have continued. It's contradictory of what the start of he film was. The movie basically told the audience tobacco was bad directly not through satire. It seemed as if a Hollywood producer got hold of the script and changed it to be morally correct. It just didn't fit. Unless the ending was a satire on how Hollywood movies end good guys win. I doubt it. Well it was based on a book I don't know how it ended but either way I didn't like the ending of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jason Reitman's 'Thank You For Smoking' is a remarkable satire about successful 'BSting'. Oh the things one can get away with the things one can turn around and twist just through words charisma and a smile. All the characters arewere hypocrites. Even in the relationship between Nick and his son we see how his own traits brush off on his son. Not only that he teaches his own son how to get away with things just by using words. Reitman's execution and screenplay are very intriguing. He uses clever humour and the lines spoken by the actors are absurdly amazing and hilarious. The multiple meanings of the lines particularly standout. Also Reitman's intentions in making this successful satire seem very genuine as the film is not pretentious nor condescending as is the case with many of the socalled recent satires. There's a stellar cast of which all the actors except Katie Holmes naturally fit their parts. Aaron Eckhart carries the film. It's difficult to describe his performance in words as the actor seems to pulls it off with ease. Nick Naylor was meant for him. Acclaimed actors like William Huffman Macy Maria Bello Rob Lowe and Robert Duvall all do nothing short of excellence in their acting. Even Adam Brody provokes laughter. Katie Holmes is the weakest link but this can be easily overlooked as she's not there for long and the other actors compensate enough. The cinematography and background score are very effective and the visuals are impressive. The sepia tone and brightness gives the feeling of a classic movie where things are positively exaggerated. While some people find the film offensive because they think it promotes smoking but 'Thank You For Smoking' is not really about smoking. It's pretty much about politics. Political Incorrectness. I'll be watching this movie again because it deserves so.".

Once the arguments like everyone is entitled to a fair trial and everyone is presumed innocent are swept aside it usually gets down to well I've got a mortgage to pay. So it is for lobbyists for unpopular industries. There is no legal industry more unpopular than Big Tobacco and in this film Aaron Eckhart plays with great relish Nick Naylor a superb operator with absolutely no shame who prosecutes Big Tobacco's cause at venues ranging from grade school classes to congressional committees.First time director Reitman derived his screenplay from Christopher Buckley's 1994 book and in the book there is a deeper motivation than the must pay the mortgage defence. Chris Buckley happens to be the son of the wealthy rightwing columnist and political gadfly William F Buckley and Chris shares his father's politics to some degree. If you are against the state telling people what to do ie not smoke it is logical to support the tobacco companies who after all are only providing a substance people are free not to use. The problem with this libertarian position is of course externalities  others are affected by the smoker's actions through passive smoking and the state will still have to foot the bill for the smoker's medical treatment. So unless our smoker is going to smoke only with other smokers or alone and is prepared to pay for their medical treatment the state has an interest.This issue is only lightly alluded to in what is a very clever witty snappily directed and rather superficial satire on lobbyists for pariah industries. The film does come close to being serious when Nick takes his perceptive 12 year old son Joey wonderfully played by Cameron Bright to various work engagements. How can a lobbyist for big tobacco justify what he does to his son? He does it but I won't spoil your enjoyment of the movie by telling you how.The satire here is not subtle and some of the performances border on caricature. William H Macy however as the antitobacco Senator for Vermont home to cheesecreated cholesterol manages to avoid farce and produce a believable character.Christopher Buckley was reportedly pleased with this film though I think his message was obscured somewhat by the pyrotechnics of Aaron Eckhart's performance. Perhaps those champions of individual freedom are actually sociopaths using liberty as an excuse for doing bad. I don't like being told what to do or telling other people what to do but sometimes there is no other choice.".

After watching movies like The Insider and many Michael Moore movies which show how big businesses trick the world by making them think that they are doing right by buying there products it's good to see a lighter side to the subject. It's very well written and entertaining from beginning to end. Enjoyable!RoundUp Judging by the money that this movie made it must have touched all audiences smokers and nonsmokers and the relationship between the leading character and his some gave it a human touch. I've seen this movie a few times on TV so I knew what to expect. In a lot of way this message is politically incorrect but once the spin had been applied by the spin doctor you does twist your mind. By the way the director cleverly didn't show anyone in the movie smoking so he obviously put his own message across. Budget 6.5million Worldwide Gross 40millionI recommend this movie to people who want to learn about the spin doctors who work for the tobacco industry. 610".

You would think that from the title and movie image that the movie is about cigarette smoking. Cigarettes are not the main agenda of this movie. It really is about a well crafted creative Spin Doctor named Nick Naylor. Nick is a lobbyist for cigarette companies. He is a master of talk and spin that could argue and charm anyone about a subject and this is really what the movie is about. I thoroughly enjoyed the Rasputin likeness of the character but he was also sprinkled with human qualities being a father and loving his son. So while we actively see him working as a lobbyist his son questions his motives and methods and uses the same skill to work for him. I loved this about the movie.I particularly liked the merchant of death conversations and the extreme realness of language spoken by all characters. I have not had the pleasure of reading the book but look forward to looking it up and reading it when I get the chance.The movie is really about the freedom to think I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Why Can't They Make Comedies Like This in the U.S.?";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching a movie like this made me realize all the qualities that the majority of comedies coming out of Hollywood lack real human characters instead of buffoons whimsy subtle interactions between people comedy that comes straight from the characters in the movie rather than some screenwriter's contrivances or slapstick  and all of this without one scatological reference at all. From the bravura opening reminiscent of silent comedy to the heartfelt closing radio soliliquy the movie is a gem. The whole film in its structure tone and details is probably completely foreign to an American audience yet at the same time it is totally accessible because the characters and situations are absolutely universal this storyline could probably be tweaked slightly and set in any other country.Anyone expecting a fastpaced movie will be disappointed Comfort and Joy takes great pleasure in setting up scenes which most other comedies would put on the cutting room floor but are beneficial in helping us to understand the characters. Like real life a bunch of unrelated things just happen one after another. For example the several scenes with Dickie Bird interacting with the daughters of his married surgeon friend. There's no sly wit cutting irony or anything of the sort in this scenes they are simply there to show how Bird really does out of the bottom of his heart want to help others and may even feel bittersweet about not having children of his own to take care of. The same goes for his short scene with the bedridden old woman in the hospital. In this way we understand why he is willing to go to such absurd lengths to find a compromise between two battling ice cream proprietors. In addition if this were a Hollywood movie there would be greater concentration on the relationship between Dickie and his girlfriend Maddie  possibly even having a wrapup in which they get back together all so producers could pitch this under the romantic comedy label. But that would ruin the movie because this is in essence a character comedy about Dickie and his personal growth.The tone of this movie is perfect from veteran Chris Menges' gloomy cinematography to Mark Knopfler's moody musical score. I must mention that I have never seen any of Bill Forsyth's other movies. They may be stylistically very different from this one possibly more pungeant  I'm not sure  but people seem to look unfavorably upon this one in comparison to the others. In my opinion this movie stands superbly on its own. Yes it is simple but the best comedic material is always simple like Dickie's solution for the warring families the movie is ingenious in its utter simplicity. Two scenes in particular are priceless the scene showing how the ice cream truck music is produced and the look on actor Bill Patterson's face when a psychiatrist asks him if he and his girlfriend had any unusual sexual practices. You don't find acting much better than Patterson's in this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching a movie like this made me realize all the qualities that the majority of comedies coming out of Hollywood lack real human characters instead of buffoons whimsy subtle interactions between people comedy that comes straight from the characters in the movie rather than some screenwriter's contrivances or slapstick  and all of this without one scatological reference at all. From the bravura opening reminiscent of silent comedy to the heartfelt closing radio soliliquy the movie is a gem. The whole film in its structure tone and details is probably completely foreign to an American audience yet at the same time it is totally accessible because the characters and situations are absolutely universal this storyline could probably be tweaked slightly and set in any other country.Anyone expecting a fastpaced movie will be disappointed Comfort and Joy takes great pleasure in setting up scenes which most other comedies would put on the cutting room floor but are beneficial in helping us to understand the characters. Like real life a bunch of unrelated things just happen one after another. For example the several scenes with Dickie Bird interacting with the daughters of his married surgeon friend. There's no sly wit cutting irony or anything of the sort in this scenes they are simply there to show how Bird really does out of the bottom of his heart want to help others and may even feel bittersweet about not having children of his own to take care of. The same goes for his short scene with the bedridden old woman in the hospital. In this way we understand why he is willing to go to such absurd lengths to find a compromise between two battling ice cream proprietors. In addition if this were a Hollywood movie there would be greater concentration on the relationship between Dickie and his girlfriend Maddie  possibly even having a wrapup in which they get back together all so producers could pitch this under the romantic comedy label. But that would ruin the movie because this is in essence a character comedy about Dickie and his personal growth.The tone of this movie is perfect from veteran Chris Menges' gloomy cinematography to Mark Knopfler's moody musical score.

Likewise Bill Paterson's Dickie actually Alan Bird comes across as someone so wrapped up in his radio persona that he cannot see what's happening around him.

What makes Bill Forsyth's film so endearing is the way he shows so many people making mountains out of emotional and personal windmills. Glasgow is sufficiently big to accommodate both the McCool cartel led by the Mafiastyle boss Roberto Bernardi as well as the more flyby night outfit led by Trevor Alex Norton. It is simply pride  as well as other issues  that prevents them from arriving at a deal.As the action unfolds however so AlanDickie undergoes something of a change of character.

He manages to find a particularly satisfying resolution to bring the two sides in the ice cream war together leaving him ready and willing to face the world with renewed vigor. He might be on his own on Christmas Day but he understands the importance now of maintaining relationships both personal and public.Shot in muddy color in perhaps the most antiThatcherite of cities COMFORT AND JOY offers a glimpse of life beyond the mid1980s illusion of prosperity and individual selfimprovement. People struggle to survive in this city in whatever way they can even if it means selling ice cream for a living. Their world deserves to be recognized even though very different from English life at the same time.The film is replete with memorable cameos from Scottish actor Rikki Fulton's Hilary  Alan's smoothtalking boss who thinks his star employee has gone barking mad  to C.

This is a movie where the narrative flow and selected incidents are so finely judged and juxtaposed that the movie could never succeed on TV where that flow was constantly interrupted by commercial breaks. True the last half of the movie tends to be less ingenious and original. But there is no mistaking our sympathy and continued interest in the central character so well played by Bill Paterson.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a lifelong Glaswegian I have a natural interest in pretty much all of Bill Forsyth's early works centring as they often do on my hometown. Reviewing after many years this successor to the commercially successful Local Hero this was the director's last UKbased movie before his shortlived relatively unsuccessful tenure in Hollywood. It boldly retracts from the Hollywoodaspirant feature that was Local Hero and returns him to the mean streets of Glasgow in an altogether more sombre affair redolent as much as anything of his offbeat debut That Sinking Feeling.Nevertheless I can well remember the buzz around town as his first four movies were released to immediate critical and later commercial success and even though this particular movie has not surprisingly dated somewhat it still entertains and is interesting if nothing else for the likes of myself to forever pause the action and screw my eyes up to try and identify some usually sincechanged background location.The film is dated not only by the storyline itself surrounding a then topical turfwar over icecream van routes which in real life turned very nasty indeed with as I recall fatalities as gangland criminals muscled in on each other's territories but by the use of for example 80's rock band Dire Straits' music as the soundtrack the thinlydisguised reference to the then very popular local independent station Radio Clyde 261 the now quite different Glasgow cityscape apart from the motorway route into the city centre over the Kingston Bridge which is pretty much unchanged but above all Forsyth's quirky humour was by now palling with overfamiliarity and forcedness.The story while based on fact perhaps overreaches itself by placing as its central protagonist the early morning Metro DJ Alan Dicky Bird who singlehandedly tackles the icecream war and eventually comes up with a somewhat facile solution at odds as I said earlier with the reallife outcome of the actual events in the mid80's. Half examination of the emotional makeup of this jilted DJ and half documentary on the events of the icecream war itself the whole is about as unconvincing as the idea of an icecream fritter.Yes there is some clever typically amusing Forsythian dialogue particularly in Bird's foodydescription of his and Maddy's relationship culminating in the wellremembered line that we went together like chocolate mousse but the film is a little too long is guilty of over and underseriousness by turns and is not helped by poor acting by the assembled troupe with the honourable exception of the everreliable Bill Paterson thankfully in the central role. The rest of the cast is a motley selection of Forsyth regulars and biggername Scots like Rikki Fulton and Patrick Malahide none of whom manage to convince they're reallife characters at all.It is a real shame that Forsyth ended up writing himself into a stylistic deadend with his Scottish films in fact arguably he never bettered his very amusing debutfeature That Sinking Feeling. Although he has more recently returned to his native land with two fairly unsuccessful features including a pointless sequel to Gregory's Girl nevertheless those first four movies including Comfort and Joy even if one of the weaker entrants were part of the growing up in Glasgow experience of the late 70's and early 80's. Even if looking back at them now shows too clearly perhaps their failings it was different then and it's hardly Forsyth's fault that times and tastes have moved on and passed him by in the meantime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Bruce Robinson got robbed! Would have been nice if the film company put into their budget advertising. This movie has it all folks.First the cast. Excellent. Several budding stars in the making. Lance Hendriksen is just fabulous. Like any great film actor there is little time to develop a character so casting must be spot on. Lance is believable from the first seconds of the opening scene. Sets the tone of his character Freddy Ross. Uma is great. Her eyes are eerie. She plays this role with softness and depth. All the characters are well thought out. Graham Beckel is just a scary dude. We don't know his name but he plays the bad guy perfectly. Those eyes! All the supporting cast hit the bullseye like watching Seinfeld...memorable from the getgo.Secondly the atmosphere. Blind girl in a school for the blind in the cold mountainsrain and snow. What more could you ask for? Thirdly the first little nugget. Christopher Young. The soundtrack is amazing. Haunting. Beautiful. When I first saw this movie I actually searched to buy the soundtrack. I never do this. It's that good! Lastly the gold nugget. This is a movie with a twist of an ending. Remember it is 1992. This was not done to my recall at the time. Rent this buy this movie and watch with close friends late at night when it rains. Trust me! A great movie for malefemale company. OK...the actor I never saw before had one core scene and just for this it is worth watching. Enter the brilliance of Mr. John Malkovich! We have all seen many movies where FBI agent interrogates suspect. But Malkovich takes extremely well written dialogue and it comes alive off the page. He should have won something for this performance. What I thought was just another actor for a pivotal scene made the move. His nuances tone pace timing...just being Malkovich is acting at the highest level. This should have been another scene in the movie and he now becomes a main character stealing the scenes. Incredible performance.Watch this movie. There are so many little details that are engaging. The time clock that speaks freaks you out. The empty light sockets. The sound of the mattress in the house. On and on...".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Bruce Robinson got robbed! Would have been nice if the film company put into their budget advertising. This movie has it all folks.First the cast. Excellent. Several budding stars in the making. Lance Hendriksen is just fabulous. Like any great film actor there is little time to develop a character so casting must be spot on. Lance is believable from the first seconds of the opening scene. Sets the tone of his character Freddy Ross. Uma is great. Her eyes are eerie. She plays this role with softness and depth. All the characters are well thought out. Graham Beckel is just a scary dude. We don't know his name but he plays the bad guy perfectly. Those eyes! All the supporting cast hit the bullseye like watching Seinfeld...memorable from the getgo.Secondly the atmosphere. Blind girl in a school for the blind in the cold mountainsrain and snow.

It is a beautifully filmed haunting movie that showcases some very fine performances. Uma Thurman is remarkable as the blind Helena and one would be hard pressed to find fault with her very realistic performance as the wouldbe next victim for the serial killer. Likewise Andy Garcia is excellent as the tough big city cop who is working through his own personal issues. One of the most compelling performances is that of John Malkovich. Arguably one of the best actors we have today his commanding depiction of the hardgrilling FBI man is superb and worth the watch just for his few cameos alone. But don't get me wrong. This movie is very very good. It will leave you guessing to the end. Overall beautiful cinematography beautiful score great thriller. Highly recommend this underrated gem.

Dead Aim 1987 Whispers in the Dark 1992 Blink 1994 and Copycat 1995 are several that come to mind. The movie may be broken down into three parts 1 the mystery buildup 2 the romance and 3 the recovery back to the thriller. Andy Garcia stars as LAPD cop John Berlin who relocates to an old farmhouse in Eureka CA to flee his cheating exwife and to lick his wounds. Fred Ross Lance Henriksen is Berlin's partner and brotherinlaw. On his police radio Berlin learns that the local cops are at a dump examining the body of a derelict. He arrives and soon the police discover a severed human hand and a bra with dried blood later they deduce that the fingers were severely scratched because the person was a young blind woman who had used Braille. Learning of seven unsolved cases involving murdered blind women dating back to 1985 that drained police resources to no conclusion Berlin becomes convinced that the deaths are all related. He wants to reopen the old cases. Of course no one in the PD believes him. Berlin and Ross drive to the blind people's institute to interview the roommate of Amber one of the missing women. The roommate is cello teacher Helena Robertson Uma Thurman who earlier had been in the dormitory room briefly with the bad guy called John while he moved out with Amber. Helene remembers just a few details like the sound of the car engine. Berlin comes to believe that Helena is Jennifer 8 the eighth intended victim nicknamed Jennifer. Helena resembles Berlin's former spouse. In this second phase angry darkeyed Berlin and soft blueeyed Helena eventually fall in love.Berlin wants to go back to the dump but Ross says to him No way. I'm not going back. You might find someone's p in a hot dog roll. But go they do and find a clue. But police chief Citrine Kevin Conway and others are adamant to close out the case because the evidence is so scanty. Of course you know that Berlin like a pit bull will not let go. There will be other trips to the institute and the situation will be even spookier for Helena as most folks would have departed the grounds to spend the Christmas holidays at the residences of their families. Even when she stays at the farmhouse the atmosphere is eerie. Then on a snowy and fateful Christmas Eve at the institute a main character is bumped off and suspicion falls entirely on Berlin. Enter FBI agent St. Anne John Malkovitch  smug unyielding insufferable but effective. What a scenestealer! Chomp! Chomp! Then again you know that Berlin will clear his name in the end.There are lapses in credibility like Berlin's release while charged with a capital offense murder one! his odd motive to rummage through an Oakland house and even his atypical second arrest. Minor plot holes or some crude editing do not really detract from the movie because we can visualize that such and such happened although it was not shown. The climax appropriately creepy is somewhat turgid. Although some have questioned Uma Thurman's interpretation of a blind woman the acting is commendable. Michael O'Neill as cop Angelo Serato seems miscast. Does he really look like an Angelo? Then again that is just a tertiary role. A big plus for Jennifer 8 is the onlocation wintry shooting for Eureka is cold dreary and darkly atmospheric. The ominous background music adds to the eeriness. But with some better editing and a better ending the movie could have been even greater. So is it worth seeing? Of course!".

It is a compelling portrait of a professional on the edge and a longstanding codependent relationship collapsing under fire.  The acting is uniformly superb and the script up to the task.  A genuine insight into the limits of human relationships is Robinson's forte and he doesn't disappoint here.It's important to remember that small towns protect their own.

Robinson succeeds with 'Jennifer 8' in ways that Sam Raimi failed in both 'A Simple Plan' and 'The Gift' Robinson convinced me that willed blindness get it? hindered the search for a dangerous killer.As with his classic 'Withnail and I' Robinson scores with textures tones and very subtle attitudes.

First that's part of the point about Garcia's character.  He's a bitter adolescent guy.  Although fans of Garcia's might not want to embrace it he's not a very nice person in this film and remains substantially unredeemed.  Perhaps this resolution explains some of the hostility to this film.  John Berlin Garcia is not an antihero but his is fundamentally weak in some critical way.  His healing has made him rigid not clear in his thinking selfrighteous but not necessarily right.Second the dream about God is a very telling moment in the film because Robinson keeps it so small.  It's almost a throwaway scene but it gives great insight into both the despair and the essential shallowness of Berlin's selfreflection.

	schema:headline " Decent complicated thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a long and complex movie. Complex not because there are too many subplots. There are only two interwoven plots the solution of the mystery and the mating of Andy Garcia and Uma Thurman. It's just that we follow events in considerable detail. That's okay in itself but the climax itself  the revelation and killing of a serial murderer  isn't well adumbrated. The climax pivots on the finding of an antihistamine capsule and everything falls together in the last fifteen minutes without any previous hints.The director follows most of the rules. Nothing fancy. He does give us two outstanding scenes. In the first Uma Thurman who has been blind since childhood and sequestered in a bleak institution is taken to a Christmas party by Garcia the detective investigating serial murders in one of which cases she is a witness. A friend dresses her up and covers her with makeup for her debut. I liked her better as a lean lankylooking Bohemian with a cello. Dressed up she looks a little whorish. The party begins well. But later she finds herself standing alone in the middle of a dozen drunken guests who bump into her from unexpected directions. The record player is blaring Louie Louie and everyone ignores her. Her anxiety is manifest as she is slowly encircled by the camera and we are as confused and frightened as she is. Thurman and the director do a polished job here.Another memorable scene is the interrogation of Garcia by John Malkovich. Malkovich hams it up as usual. He seems to be constantly sniffing and speaks as if he had a cold. You got mbarried but byew had a bad mbarriage didn't byew? But that's okay too. It must have been a hard scene to shoot. It's full of tight close ups of the two faces sometimes only inches apart. Sometimes Malkovich even whispers into Garcia's ear. Garcia is tense grief stricken and angry. Malkovich is sly and insinuating. There is no music in the scene. Aside from the dialogue everything is perfectly quiet except for the squeaking of wheeled office chairs or the harsh breathing of the actors. One wrong move one errant jactitation one delinquent vocal chord and everything goes back to Square One.

Why is a police laboratory so dark we can hardly make out the faces? There is no contrast between interiors and exteriors. Somebody turn on the lights!The director should get no more than a gentleman's C for the introduction of the institute's janitor. An elevator door opens. We see a man's back. The man turns around. Jump to a close up of his bald head and gargoyle face with glasses like cokebottle bottoms. It would have been fine in a movie with a title like I Dismember Mamma. There us some gratuitous nudity too. I found it objectionable for two reasons. One is that there wasn't enough of it. Second is that a body double is used. Much better to have had a long long scene of gratuitous nudity using the lissome blond herself.Maurice Jarre evidently had his score thrown out. The replacement is pretty good. This murky and rather solemn film is unimaginable with a loud actiony score full of electronic percussion and unceasing in its torture. It's nice that Thurman plays a music teacher at the institute but I kind of wish the instrument we had seen her with had been something other than a cello. It must be played in an undignified position and is the second most preposterous instrument in an orchestra the first being the Glockenspiel.Oh  and by the way Garcia tracks the murderer down by following a trail of clues to a house many hours' drive away in Oakland. While he's riffing through the drawers he's caught by the murderer and framed. How did the murderer know that Garcia would be there?Eureka's not a bad little town although it's rainy all winter and foggy all summer. It keeps the riffraff out.

	onyx:emotionText "It's a long and complex movie. Complex not because there are too many subplots. There are only two interwoven plots the solution of the mystery and the mating of Andy Garcia and Uma Thurman. It's just that we follow events in considerable detail. That's okay in itself but the climax itself  the revelation and killing of a serial murderer  isn't well adumbrated. The climax pivots on the finding of an antihistamine capsule and everything falls together in the last fifteen minutes without any previous hints.The director follows most of the rules. Nothing fancy. He does give us two outstanding scenes. In the first Uma Thurman who has been blind since childhood and sequestered in a bleak institution is taken to a Christmas party by Garcia the detective investigating serial murders in one of which cases she is a witness. A friend dresses her up and covers her with makeup for her debut. I liked her better as a lean lankylooking Bohemian with a cello. Dressed up she looks a little whorish. The party begins well. But later she finds herself standing alone in the middle of a dozen drunken guests who bump into her from unexpected directions. The record player is blaring Louie Louie and everyone ignores her. Her anxiety is manifest as she is slowly encircled by the camera and we are as confused and frightened as she is. Thurman and the director do a polished job here.Another memorable scene is the interrogation of Garcia by John Malkovich. Malkovich hams it up as usual. He seems to be constantly sniffing and speaks as if he had a cold. You got mbarried but byew had a bad mbarriage didn't byew? But that's okay too. It must have been a hard scene to shoot. It's full of tight close ups of the two faces sometimes only inches apart. Sometimes Malkovich even whispers into Garcia's ear. Garcia is tense grief stricken and angry. Malkovich is sly and insinuating. There is no music in the scene.

	schema:reviewBody "The pounding monsoon here in Vancouver today reminded me of the slightly forgotten excellently dour serial killer mystery Jennifer 8. In a torrential downpour the body of a blind girl is discovered in a scrapyard in one of the film's best sequences. Freddy Ross sergeant on scene Lance Henriksen in a rambunctious really underrated performance calls in his old friend big city Detective John Berlin a haggard Andy Garcia to help investigate. Henriksen and Garcia strike up a believable buddy rapport that becomes the backbone of the story and is nice to watch. They suspect that someone is specifically preying on blind girls when they find related cases and they must narrow down suspects before he strikes again. They find a lead in blind Helena Uma Thurman a cautious fragile girl who may be able to help them and who John very quickly falls in love with. Soon the killer orchestrates clues that lead straight to John and he has to deal with an obnoxious internal investigator John Malkovich in full Christmas ham mode showing up for maybe five minutes but chewing scenery like the Cookie Monster. Time starts to run out as the killer gets closer. Now I guessed the identity of the killer halfway through the film but that's mostly because I know the actor quite well and could just tell by certain distinct features but don't worry the surprise should remain intact for you. There's nice work from Lenny Von Dohlen Kathy Baker Graham Beckel Bob Gunton and Kevin Conway too. The film relies on its two leads to get the job done and they don't disappoint. It also has an advantage in its gloomy rainy northern setting much of it was filmed here which gives that distinct atmosphere that these type of movies need to succeed. Well done.".

At the local police department he meets up with his old friend Sergeant Freddy Ross Lance Henriksen and immediately gets embroiled in a case involving a severed hand which was found in a garbage dump. His investigations reveal that the hand belonged to a blind woman and further computer checks suggest that the nature of her murder was similar to a series of others in the same locality which were never solved.Berlin's enquiries bring him into contact with a blind woman who could potentially be a useful witness. Matters become more complicated however as he falls in love with Helena Robertson Uma Thurman and soon recognises that she could be the serial killer's next victim.Berlin's senior officers aren't convinced by his findings and are also dubious about the value of a blind witness. His determination to continue with the investigation brings him into conflict with his colleagues and then things get even worse when he's accused of murdering a fellow cop. Berlin eventually discovers the identity of the serial killer before the culprit's activities are brought to an end in an unconventional way.Jennifer Eight is a dark and moody film with a great deal of suspense interesting characters and a number of unexpected plot developments. The cinematography by Conrad L Hall is absolutely magnificent and the strong performances by Garcia Thurman and Henriksen are complemented by John Malkovich's memorable cameo as a weird FBI agent and consistently good contributions from the supporting cast. The pace of the movie is considered and thoughtful and this fits perfectly with the carefully created atmosphere of the piece.".

The plot is very convincing the acting by Uma Thurman Andy Garcia and Lance Hendriksen are excellent. The supporting cast is excellent. There is violence and action but it is highly believable. I am so tired of overthetop action and violence. Many a good movie is spoiled by heroes they can get buried alive hung by a rope his hand smashed by a huge monkey wrench  stabbed in the kidneys and shot in the head and still they come back teach scores of heavily armed bad guys a lesson. This is a actual plot of a 8 rated movie . The music is good the mystery believable and deepening. Just great. You will not were regret the time you spent watching this movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time. I liked the ending a lot. It is very hard to guess how it ends to solve the mystery before it's over. I didn't see it coming. This movie is something that could conceivably happen in real life rather than your cyborg werewolf vs. ninja vampire affair geared toward sixthgraders. It seems like many of these get high ratings these days. The wilder it gets the more people like them.".

The film deals with familial relationships now and as such presents a refreshing and forward thinking outlook on the nature of the family unit in the 21st century. Hashiguchi lets us watch these intimate relationships as they build up and in some cases break down without feeling intrusive. There are some wonderful scenes of extended dialogue the sort of meandering conversations that go nowhere but that are incredibly involving nonetheless. All the performances are spot on and there's just the right balance between the humour and the heartache. It's a slow talky film but still highly rewarding.".

One becomes like a third partner she wants a baby from them and the other has a typical young girl infatuation. What really caught my attention was how both these guys do things together at home and outside the home. They care about each other know each other and do spontaneous things together.

This film is just the third work of the director Ryosuke Hashiguchi who continues to shoot marvelous films which certainly have something to do with homosexuality quite casually and most importantly quite naturally. I am looking forward to his next film whose theme is homosexuality or heterosexuality.".

Director Ryosuke Hashiguchi's radical upending of the typical Shoahimin Eiga home drama movie genre is refreshing and hilarious as his satire Hashiguchi wrote the scenario goes after just about all the stale components of standard Shoahimin Eiga especially those repeatedly exploited by socalled classical Japanese movie makers in the past. Hashiguchi's film is also touching as he explores the many road blocks encountered in contemporary society by a lonely gay couple wishing to start a family child adoption is not an option. Added to the mix is a female protagonist who for medical related to multiple abortions and psychological plain loneliness reasons is seeking to start a family with a man who looks like a father. In a chance encounter she feels that one of the gays has this look! The director is highlighting the partially hidden ongoing cultural clash between heretofore standard family formation structure and values at least as conjured up in movies and the reality of modern times one gay's mother is pushing hard for a traditional marriage process and family structure the other gay's older brother but not his wife seems open to new types of family structures at least on the surface and then there is the emerging twodadsonemom family model depicted in this photo play. Hashiguchi penchant for long single takes a good five minutes or so in duration without a cut channels Hitchcock's usual methodology. But unlike Hitchcock Hashiguchi's long scenes often end up becoming tedious and ultimately boring. Acting is okay. Subtitles can not be turned off and tend to be a bit long given their rapid flash rates. Not all dialog is translated. The video formatting used for this DVD seems to be targeting oldstyle square TV screens. It looks pretty bizarre on modern monitors. Rather than expanding the image to full video screen size at least horizontally thick black bars surround a miniaturized version of a semiwide screen. The black borders take up about 50 percent of the video screen's real estate! Just sit closer! Concluding scenes seem to be lining things up for a sequel which has yet to emerge. Recommended.

This although featuring a slightly awkward introduction of the 3 protagonists at the start is smoother and more commercial in feel. The sort of thing Hollywood would buy the rights to for a bland adaptation with major 'stars'. Not sure if Hashiguchi felt the need to broaden his appeal this time around. As other reviews have mentioned it centres on a gay relationship between two men from their first meeting they casually run into each other outside a gay pub to starting to live together when unexpectedly a lonely woman barges in with the startling proposition to one of the men Katsuhiro to father a child with her because she likes him and thought he had a 'father's eyes'. Side strands of each of their familial relationships are woven in. The one involving the closeted gay character Katsushiro's visit to his family home to visit his brother is as masterful as anything by Ozu. There are a couple of melodramatic plots as well one involving a female coworker of Katsushiro's who develops a Fatal Attraction like infatuation with him. Katshushiro played by Seiche Tanabe is tall handsome and has an inner quietude and you can understand why all all these people want to throw themselves at him including his lover Nagoya played by Kazua Takahashi. Reiko Karaoke plays Asako the woman who wants a child. Her performance is the most compelling in a way showing a complex mixed up confused woman with a good heart behind her gruff exterior. The scenes of the three of them together especially a montage in the latter half of the film are marvellous! This film is 2 hours long but is filled with incidents made up of everyday life it never drags. I have now watched it a couple of times and can say it is a film I can easily revisit with pleasure!".

After the initial request for what we would consider a very private and personal matter the film bogs down in sheer boredom. I'm not blaming the actors. They play their roles well. It's just that nothing really happens. There are no dramatic climaxes. Admittedly the characters have some big decisions to make but they seem to get nowhere as the film drifts on.I think the problem is that the film is too even and becomes too monotonous.On the whole I find this film rather disappointing.

	schema:text "    In the year 2092 one hundred eighteen year old Nemo is recounting his life story to a reporter. He is less than clear often times thinking that he is only thirtyfour years of age. But his story becomes more confusing after he does focus on the fact of his current real age. He tells of his life at three primary points in his life at age nine when his parents divorced age sixteen and age thirtyfour. The confusing aspect of the story is that he tells of alternate life paths often changing course with the flick of a decision at each of those ages. One life path has him ultimately married to Elise a depressed woman who never got over the unrequited love she had for a guy named Stefano when she was a teenager and who asked Nemo to swear that when she died he would sprinkle her ashes on Mars. A second life path has him married to Jean. Their life is one of luxury but one also of utter boredom. And a third life path has him in a torrid romance with his stepsister Anna the two who...";

Questioned about his life on his death bed by a journalist that sneaked in the hospital he tells the stories of his lives. Yes lives his three lives his three destinies between which he was unable to choose from. Three love stories three very different existences conditioned by apparently meaningless decisions. Three paths three wives three families three fates.This genuinely mind blowing movie is an experience revolving around the notion of choice the importance or futility of decisions a complex story that questions randomness and what our lives are made of. Illustrated by bribes of a science documentary enlightening us about concepts like time before and after the big bang the extremely interesting superstition of the pigeon the eventuality of the big crunch the complexity of quantum mechanics and string theory. This is a journey into the human psyche and the ability to create and explore in our imagination all the possible moves like a chess player that would lead to different paths different existences. Exceptionally imaginative acutely funny and startling this production reeks of intelligence and craftsmanship breaks down linear storytelling into bits only to shuffle the whole thing in a brilliantly orchestrated masterpiece. It reminded me of so many great experiences from David Lynch movies to Jorge Luis Borges books it's an exquisite bundle of intellect and emotion.Choices their meaning why we choose this or that road through our lives their consequences whether we are aware of them of not. How many different lives could we be living ? Through the infinite possibilities facing each and every one of us the good and the bad choices every turn taken creates a new life the most interesting of all is being alive. Chaos theory and butterfly effect to remind us how small we are in the randomness of the universe and yet so able to actively manifest the reality we desire. Nemo Nobody has to choose between leaving with his mother or stay with his father the starting point of the exploration his available destinies. Unable to decide he chooses both and takes us for a ride through an immensity of possible.The filming is smooth and sequences linked in a flow of event that jumps back and forth through time brilliantly edited with great attention for rhythm. The music score is so adequately put together that it adds to the already stunning staging efficiency of the directing by Jaco Van Dormael. I dare to say this is the very best movie of 2009 and will most likely go see it a second time next week one can never get enough of these absolutely mind blowing experiences. Confusing and dazzling at the same time it manages to spark the most interesting discussions about the meaning of life in an attempt to pinpoint why we live it. Whatever you got planned for this week end just drop it and go see that movie you will not regret it.There is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others. I refer not to Evil whose limited realm is that of ethics I refer to the infinite.Jorge Luis Borgeswww.radiostationexp.blogspot.com".

I haven't seen too many arthouse films but I was pleasantly surprised by the tone which wasn't too serious or pretentious. There were laugh out loud moments during a movie with themes concerning choice destiny and metaphysics.I was enamoured by the love story it was feel good without being Hollywood.The visuals were amazing. I believe that Jaco explained that he used different DP's to film the different possible lives of Mr. Nobody. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen.I found the soundtrack to be awesome. Any movie with Mr. Sandman and Where is my mind? is alright by me.The movie was extremely imaginative original funny and will probably have me thinking about it and my own life for days after viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "How to review this film without giving too much away? Throughout the film I was constantly surprised and amazed. I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply it's a philosophical scifi film but it's so much more than that. It's about choices destinies astrophysics dreams and memories just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man 118 years old on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice it means that this is a very nonlinear experience in terms of time and space real and imaginary showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess but it's surprisingly cohesive gripping and even quite touching. I'm sure some will find it confusing but that's part of the point Mr. Nobody's memories seem confused and appearances might be deceiving. I found it extremely romantic despite the fact there are 3 very different love interests. One might say that sometimes the dialogue in romantic parts was corny but I think that the most beautiful declarations of love can be the simplest as long as they are sincere. They felt that way here. The acting was topnotch all over the board with no weak performance in sight. Mr. Nobody's makeup and voice as an old man were perhaps a little distracting but nothing major. It's not a special effects extravaganza but what was seen was quite imaginative and beautiful to behold. I think the contrast with the more mundane stuff going on makes them even more impressive. Visually it has an incredible number of different angles and viewpoints all extremely well shot. What's amazing is that the often brilliant transitions flow so well from one to another without being jarring.There are so many story threads most fascinating so many changes of tones whimsical to tragic and so much range from intimate to grandiose. I think people who like to analyze films would have a field day with this one although it's possible they would nitpick on the borrowed elements. There's also lots of food for thought and should provoke very interesting discussions afterwards especially on what might have happened if choices in your life had been different. Contrary to most films where I tend to think of what I will write in my review as the film is going on it did not really happen here. I was totally absorbed and that's rare. The choice of songs and musics mostly known was excellent and added a lot especially in romantic parts. I'm even considering buying the soundtrack. Mr. Nobody is a challenging but very rewarding film to watch . I don't think it's for everyone mostly because of its nonlinear structure but those who appreciate unconventional films like Brazil Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Vanilla Sky or Big Fish should be quite pleased. I loved Mr. Nobody and it has become one of my new favorite films. To be quite honest I wish I could see it again right now... Very highly recommended particularly with someone special. Rating  9.5 out of 10 not full 10 because ending could have been better".

	schema:headline " A Wonderful Film  From Start to Finish";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most beautiful cinematographic masterpieces that I have seen in recent years. The photography music cinematography cast special effects and script creates a highly visually and intellectually stimulating movie.The film is very complex between how the movie is fragmented and its timeline you are left in a state of confusion. A confusion which expands over the length of the movie and much is left to your own interpretations of certain events. You try to hang on to a fragment telling yourself that this is the right fragment this is the right time lapse but before you know it you are introduced to another sequence of fragments which at the time may not necessarily make a lot of a sense and may create more confusion. In time you start to understand that each fragment becomes a life of its own each fragment appears to be real and so each fragment is potentially the correct fragment there is no right or wrong answer because there is no reality. Each fragment represents a choice each choice represents a series of circumstances and each circumstance represent the possibilities which this person is subject to in his life.You are introduced to many ideas and many possibilities which in themselves are a small selection out of all the possibilities that life may give. The possibilities are the ones given by a 9 year old child full of ideas full of freedom completely and entirely boundless. This creates an enticingly magical combination of possibilities. Boundless and so free in every concept. This is a journey in our character's imaginative mind seeing his future being dependant on this one immediate decision leading to future decisions and potential circumstances that may arise in his future based on his first decision. But the movie also states If you don't choose then you don't limit yourself to that one decision therefore the possibilities are endless. The movie encompasses our lives the life of anyone and how that life is lead. The circumstances in which you live and how you deal with certain events is represented via our character's perception of the future and circumstances.This is a very highly intellectual movie which is not only stunning but also very interesting. Some points about the life and philosophical questions are raised these points may be easily applied to your own life and so in turn give more of your meaning to the movie.This movie will not appeal to everyone  because the concept is very complex and the content is very intellectual. Some people will not even understand a little bit of it because it requires the viewer to apply his or her mind to understanding how it all interlinks. This movie would appeal to the more intellectually able people who enjoy complex films and using their minds to apply meaning to the film. It is not just an enjoyment movie like any blockbuster  it is a contentfull movie which required careful analysis of events to comprehend its entire meaning. You do need to be in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy the movie.You want a distraction? Go see a blockbuster... You want intellectual and visual stimulation? Go see Mr. Nobody!!I have to say that it really is a pity that this film has not yet been set a release date in most countries in the world including the UK because this movie is truly incredible. I had to travel to Paris France in order to catch a screening. Please see it in English Original Language  translation of films never conveys the meaning of films correctly so imagine what it would do to this very intellectually demanding film?".

You do need to be in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy the movie.You want a distraction? Go see a blockbuster... You want intellectual and visual stimulation? Go see Mr. Nobody!!I have to say that it really is a pity that this film has not yet been set a release date in most countries in the world including the UK because this movie is truly incredible. I had to travel to Paris France in order to catch a screening. Please see it in English Original Language  translation of films never conveys the meaning of films correctly so imagine what it would do to this very intellectually demanding film?";

How could they be so blind ? Mr. Nobody is a unique cocktail of drama love story  science fiction. It's an odyssey about making choices and the effect it has upon our lives. The songs  Buddy Holly ! Pixies ! Satie !  are well chosen and the acting  Jared Leto ! Rhys Ifans !  is outstanding. Some might say that this is a difficult movie and a bit arty farty... I agree that you won't understand everything that's for sure but what the heck just sit back and enjoy the ride ! This breathtaking tale of imagination leaves you astonished in your seat.

I haven't heard about this french director but Mr Nobody really blew my mind in all its images dreams romance and complexity. The movie has similarities to films by Michel Gondry but i think this film was more magical. Dreamlike and existential films. Some might think Mr Nobody is too complex too demanding. It is not for everyone but I loved it. Like other surreal movies Peter Jacksons The Lovely Bones and Synechdohe New York Dr. Parnassus Micmacs these dreamlike and difficult films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions? These flicks never generate big box office money. Im amazed that they still make this kinds of demanding visual movies for cinema. And glad.I discovered the greatness of Jared Leto as an actor when he played John Lennons Killer in Chapter 23. That was a truly disturbing and amazing acting of a disturbed fanatic loner. Mr Nobody is however the role of his life! If you like this kinds of movies I recommend Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind Synechdohe New York and THE FOUNTAIN. They really make you think!".

It's an existential tale of the power of choice to create the environments that reshape the persons who then choose from what life presents in their consequent environments ad infinitum. It's a romantic tale in both the historic sense of quixotic picaresque adventure multiply envisioned including into distant time and space and the modern sense of a quest for the idealized romance of heart and soul.The alternate lives Nemo envisions ultimately hinge on a quest for one thing mutuality of love in marriage. No clich in that rather a truth of human want and need borne out of the anguishing pain of a 9yearold caught in rupturous divorce. Desperate to make the choice no 9yearold should be asked to make in such a way that it will be the right choice for his future especially to find rapturous enduring love not recreating his parents' fate he engages a daunting will to prediction and a timetravel suspension and projection that allow him to see three futures before making the fateful choice.So to me Nemo's three lives  represented by three girls and the wives they become in his predictive imaginings and rememberings  depict three points on the continuum of mutuality in love loving more than being loved with Elise who marries him on the 'rebound' keeping the torch alive for the old flame being loved more than loving with Jean who he marries as fated by a dance thus a kind of 'arranged marriage'These two reflect shoeontheotherfoot variations on the torturous I love you but I'm not in love dynamic where Nemo thinks a marriage can work but discovers it cannot.  and mutually impassioned loving with AnnaAcross scenarios we see his one mutual love Anna as someone he'd meet in various contexts as if destined as if his scriptwriting mind is trying to relieve him of the paralyzing thought that any one choice could preclude finding his true love yet also revealing that some timings for crossing paths with Anna could be inopportune that perhaps only one timing might lead to the sustainable love life he cravesfirst as children at the beach who we wind back to in the final shot sitting in innocent harmony on the dock an age seen in first draft as too awkward for Nemo's selfconsciousness that makes him hide his truth and blurt relationshipkilling statementssecond as adolescents brought together by parental merger a merger that eventually reinforces his 9yearoldself's pain about the fragility of imperfect love while exiling his and Anna's mutual pledges of soulmatelikepassionthird as adults passing in a crowd  train depot city street funeral  where timings are off where too much accumulated adult pain caution and distrust interfere making all but the final draft of such adult encounters  the miracle in the chalk circle  come to a dead end and last as aged fellow travelers to Mars i.e. destined to meet even if Nemo initially married Elise upon honoring Elise's wish for her ashes.Old Nemo claiming that these depicted lives are equally meaningful doesn't mean equally nurturing or vital his emotion betrays where his truth lies  with a mutual love that's to die for among all the traumatic deaths  by water fire or firearm  that he envisions  and at age 118 worth living for  long enough to see Time reverse and be able to wind his way back  back to the chalk circle when chance or fate or miracle rescues an allbutlost hope of reconnection or back further to childhood on the dock as playmatesweethearts who might never have lost each other perhaps the maximal dream of the 9yearold's quest for a love that endures all change.When old Nemo lives long enough to reach time's reversal he laughs a victory laugh for having found the scenario that miraculously returns his one mutual love to him in the nick of time now presumably together in some time and space for as long as both shall live.Some suggest the moral of the story carries a negative verdict about wealth or career. But I think it was not wealthboredom that made the Nemo who married Jean seek an alternate identity that got him assassinated rather it was the restless boredom of never truly loving reflected in Jean's questioning whether he even liked or knew her even whether she took sugar in her coffee missing the passion of two lovers who mutually attune to their beloved's every desire. Nor is marrying 'trouble' Elise grappling with mental instability what undoes love  Nemo stays committed to the most trialbyfire of marriages  as long as the love is mutual but Elise's romantic fantasy is elsewhere. It's asymmetric unrequited love that smothers marriage with Jean or Elise not the fact of an easy life or a hard one.This message points back to the tale's beginnings for the very 'die' the 9yearold Nemo must cast and that traumatizes him is the result of a broken marriage a love that was not mutually for better or worse. Whichever of the 9yearold's Hobson's choices he makes what he scripts enough drafts to realize is what matters most to sustainable eternal love and how to make his heart recognize treasure and hold it when he finds it. His last gasping word Anna evokes Citizen Kane's dying cryptic Rosebud but the latter portrays a self pitying sense of boyhood loss whereas Nemo's Anna portrays a transparent selfrealizing sense of a boyhood dream found.".

The response of the audience was amazing. I was in Flanders and so the film wasn't dubbed.The film is magical and surreal. And yet it makes sense. Not many have achieved this but Jaco Van Dormael seems to have done it with ease. It did take him 13 years however. If you liked Toto Le Hro you should love this film too. Switching between the UK and Canada works brilliantly and Jared Leto Toby Regbo and Juno Temple steal the show. Ifans and Little are also fantastic. Diane Kruger's strong German accent is unfortunate as the film needs no unintentional surrealism added to it. I think her role needed a stronger actress she looks very beautiful though.In all I recommend everyone to go and see it. The only reason the film gets an 8 and not a higher score is because towards the end it seemed to go on a bit. I will go and see it again however. The story really draws you in and I need to go back to search for some answers. I also want to see it again because it is so beautifully filmed. Van Dormael is an artist.I enjoyed this film as much if not more than a David Lynch. And that truly is a compliment.".

If you've seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Butterfly Effect you'll find yourself on similar territory with this one. Without spoiling too much main character Jared Leto tries to regain his lost memory through hypnosis which uncovers a lot. The only problem is he reexperiences more than one linear life.Sounds promising? Unfortunately people responsible for this movie fail to squeeze any serious quality out of this potential. Jared Leto plays very well all the time and the movie is shot with interesting style. First problem lies in the script. It just doesn't make much sense. For example we are introduced to Superstring Theory which doesn't have any relation to the movie which is explained like a methhead would explain it after being sober for 36 hours. Throughout the entire movie we are shown various little science facts and theories all making no sense in the contexts and making impression like a late night 2 hours google search put into movie to add to the overall credibility.There's a great love story in the movie which resembles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and really improves the experience but unfortunately it's just one of many plots. Half of the movie it grows on the viewer and promises a very unique experience. The other half it fails fails and fails to deliver again until a very unsatisfactory finish. If it would have been more organized in structure instead of random lazy scene by scene mash up ultimately leading nowhere it could have been so much more. Still many people find it entertaining so it might be worth checking for yourself ".

After this movie I'll never forget. Mr Nobody was a movie with many questions and theories. Confusing but still dazzling. The shooting was really great I love the type of filming when you cross from scene to scene with a continuent flow of events. When Nemo the lead character switched from dimensions it was often expressed by him waking up from a dream. This was very interesting but I don't really know what to make out of it. Life is nothing but an illusion perhaps?".

The shooting was really great I love the type of filming when you cross from scene to scene with a continuent flow of events. When Nemo the lead character switched from dimensions it was often expressed by him waking up from a dream. This was very interesting but I don't really know what to make out of it. Life is nothing but an illusion perhaps?";

First of all the set design and cinematography were excellent. Visually the movie was colorful vivid and imaginative. Also it has a wide variety of period music which I thought fitting in the scenes they including it in. The scene with the space elevator ship and mars colonies were also visually a nice touch.That's about all the pleasure I took away from this movie. For the acting writing and directing I found it extremely tedious. The pacing of the movie was terrible. The alternate realities that Nemo experienced while varied did not justify the huge expenditure of time devoted them nor did I feel like they moved the movie along in any significant way. The storytelling was so fragmented that I was unable to feel any connection between Nemo and his many loves and even less for his children which were so insignificant they just felt like filler and could have been left out of the movie completely. And for the ending what I guess some people would consider a twist I saw as just plain stupid if you think deeply into what it suggested. In summary I found it boring and pretentious and just not worth it. The movie aimed high trying to captivate the viewer in parallel realities immortality quantum mechanics and good old fashioned space exploration but failed at the basics of storytelling and proper editing.".

In three different dimensions he marries them while he is only happy with his 'true love' while in these other realities he feels miserable with his fashionmodel women. Why if you are unhappy drag on with it? And he has all these childrenand never cares about them.

In three different dimensions he marries them while he is only happy with his 'true love' while in these other realities he feels miserable with his fashionmodel women. Why if you are unhappy drag on with it? And he has all these childrenand never cares about them. And what about friends?This film pretends to be open minded while nothing in the story really is. especially the religious notes that subconsciously are interlaced in the story This film pretends to be original while it is filled with clichs only.";

Unfortunately interesting visuals and cinematography doesn't make up for a movie which doesn't hold our interest as this was one of the most boring experiences I ever had. I tried my best to focus on the weird events and connect with the characters but this just doesn't happen. There are multiple time lines and life possibilities for the main character which are individually not that interesting. As soon as you somehow get track of what's happening in one time line the director just throws you in another meaningless direction which follows the main character until his death. At the end the message I got was Our life is the sum of the choices we make. There is no problem with the message but the way we got there is totally unappealing. It may also discuss philosophical ideas such as What would you make if you knew the outcome of a certain action? but in the end it's just not worth the journey. The big bang and crunch were for me the most interesting aspects of the movie but they didn't seem to correlate to the main character in any way other than that he knew when the big crunch was going to happen. Strangely enough It will bring order in our messed up everexpanding life!. I would rather have these theories examined from a religious point of view. As a consequence of our choices and actions we will be then judged and either rewarded or punished without relating to any religion in particular. In conclusion the movie had a lot of potential in its basic premise visuals and cinematography but wasted it all mainly on a boring unfocused love story and mixing elements which does not correlate to each other in any meaningful way.".

In the meantime Josh and Buddy explore the sport of Football and they decide to join the school Football team. Buddy of course performs as the sports wonder dog and gains the team fame. In the meantime two crooks a man and a woman plan to steal buddy for the circus along with other animals.Air Bud is a good story and it's great for the kids it has no violence and no inappropriate scenes. It is made by Disney and is Disney friendly. Me and my wife watched it for our Disney marathon and we both loved it Sadly I had a Golden Retriever named Rufus who passed away not to long ago and Buddy reminds me of him so much I even got a little emotional watching the film but my wife was there to comfort me. I loved Air Bud Golden Receiver and I am sure all those who see the true value of this tale will too.

	schema:headline " An insipid sequel  out of ";
	schema:reviewBody "Air Bud 2 Golden Receiver is a very bad rehearse  in making a sequel in the course of a single year.  The first film was cute cuddly and charming. The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. Even the human story had some explanation to it. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash so he is sad. And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.Now for the poorly made sequel. It is terrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequel the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way this time the K9 plays football instead of basketball. No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter benefit of a doubt walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh who is in eight grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb. In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident which the audience can relate to most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. In this movie the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating once again. He and Buddy his dog who can play basketball don't like this at all. Why? If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life especially one this nice. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan and Josh's mother Jackie met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy.The animal story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team the Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like something from America's Funniest Home Videos the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other. So when Bud shows up one day he proves he can play as a receiver for them and is no doubt the team's best player.Buddy's extremely cute in his football costume. Oh he is enough to melt the heart. The dog is the best in this movie as well. Too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.There is a very bad subplot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals of course they try to catch Buddy. But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a Home Alone scenario to them.Air Bud 2 Golden Receiver is much more goofy than the first too. The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that I have to admit made me laugh at the stupidity of it all. There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movieto see a dog play football.The performances were also quite the embarrassment. I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic.There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers but that isn't even worth mentioning. Will children enjoy this movie? Perhaps but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep. They will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in and loath over the fast changing script and protest against the boring performances and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al Air Bud as I did.I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable.".

Soon he finds out Buddy the dog likes to play football and he and his friend Tom who played basketball with him on part 1 join the team so Josh can get away from the new guy Patrick. Soon Buddy ends up on the team and Josh can't take someone trying to replace his dad so he runs away from home. A bunch of Russian circus freaks are kidnapping animals and kidnap Buddy and the coach finds Josh and tries to talk him out of leaving and to come back and play in the big game even though Buddy is no where to be found.Same as part 1 basically. Wow my dog can play a sport and oh no someones trying to take Buddy away...the only new factor is Patrick. I hate how they tried so hard to be like part one and offered nothing new. I hated that they ripped off scenes from 101 Dalmations and stole dialog from 2010 with the Russions saying piece of pie instead of piece of cake..I hate like on part 1 you can tell Buddy uses a soft ball and not the kind of ball the team uses thats very obvious. I liked the coach here but hated his lame pep talks to the team. The dog is less impressive here too all he does is fetch basically. I hated also that Josh had runaway and the family was terrified Patrick knows its his fault so he leaves.. If you were a good man you would stay at least until the child is found then leave...stupid writing. I also hate how you know the team will win and it'll be a cheesy happy ending.Acting was OK here Kevin Zegers is back as is Cynthia as the mom. Robert Castanzo did a great job as the coach and Tim Conway and Dick Martin did great as the sports announcers.Part 1 is okay for kids but part two is just the same story over again with football in place of basketball...210 stars".

Both roles are standard but it is obvious that mother's new beau will struggle to win over Zegers until that last moment when he is needed. Robert Costanzo plays the coach who is gifted with the worst dialogue in the film with lines like He's not a Golden Retriever.

	schema:headline " Resnais adapts novel L'Incident by Christian Gailly";
	schema:reviewBody "The 87yearold French New Wave veteran directs his longtime star and companion Sabine Azma 27 years his junior and regular costar Andr Dusollier in this adaptation of an idiosyncratic novel by Christian Gailly about a man and a woman who become fascinated with each other when the man finds the woman's stolen wallet.The essence of the piece is that the principals are hesitant indecisive and a mite crazy. Their experience is the kind that falls through the cracks of wellordered existence. Hence the new title replacing Gailly's The Incident to Les herbes folles crazy grasses. There's a recurrent image of wild grass growing high among stones.The comfy suburban house of Georges Dusollier feels rather like that of JeanLouis Trintignant outside Geneva and like Kieslowski's 'Red' this film is about trying to connect and has a protagonist who's both respectable and an outlaw. Georges is paranoid about being recognized by police as if he's done something wrong or been in jail. Yet he has two charming grown children Sara Forestier Vladimir Consigny and a loving and equally appealing wife Susanne Anne Consigny familiar to US French film fans from Schnabel's 'Diving Bell' and Desplechin's 'Christmas Tale'. Georges never acquires a full backstory but Dusollier is brilliant at depicting his mercurial temperament and a continual pleasure to watch as is the equally livewire Azma.Marguerite Muir Azma is a dentist who shares an office with the offbeat French film diva Emmanuelle Devos. Another big French film actor Matthieu Amalric plays the cop in the station to whom Georges delivers the found wallet. Strong newcomer Nicolas Duvauchelle a former boxer plays Georges' daughter's boyfriend and he invites Georges to come watch him fight as well as to use the familiar tu with him but Georges doesn't do either.Muir has put off till tomorrow reporting the pursesnatching that happened after she bought an expensive pair of shoes. Georges looks up Marguerite and has her phone number and address but can't bring himself to call her. Georges and Marguerite wind up stalking each other and the police become involved to call Georges off.One can see how this could be a quirky amusing novel and the innumerable missteps oversteps and hesitations would work well verbally. This kind of convoluted mental quirkiness is hard to translate which is why idiosyncratic literary masterpieces like Sterne's Tristram Shandy have defied the impulse to adapt them cinematically though Michael Winterbottom made a sporting try shown in the 2005 NYFF and reviewed by me here. Resnais' task is to find a visual equivalent. The highly mobile camera of Eric Gautier is a considerable asset. On the other hand the jazzy music of Hollywood composer Mark Snow is sometimes merely obtrusive as at a family gathering where the sax pointlessly overwhelms the scene. But on the other hand it's warm and enveloping in an oldfashioned way in the opening sequences when the two main characters are introduced and we're meant to be charmed and drawn in and we are.Resnais and Gailly did not collaborate at Gaillys' request he wanted to be left alone to work on his next novel. One of the ways Resnais portrays confused intentions is to show cameos of imagined actions in frames where the character is doing something else and another is that most obvious interjection of the literary into the cinematic the use of frequent voiceovers. The production is expensive for a French art film involving fairly lavish sets and scenes involving small airplanes. One of the links between Georges is that his father wanted to be a pilot and he loves aviation while Marguerite actually has a pilot's license.Though Assistant Director Christophe Jeauffroy may have done a lot of the work for the aging master there are many of the latter's familiar touches including a lot of rapid cutting early on that recalls his 1963 'Muriel ou Le temps d'un retour.' A director but not a writer whose early fame was due to adaptations of Marguerite Duras 'Hiroshima mon amour' and Alain RobbeGrillet 'Last Year at Marienbad' which represent totally opposed sensibilities Resnais here tries on yet another one. The result is far more conventional than those Sixties films and on the glossy and mainstream side veering between farce and melodrama. 'Wild Grass' is full of assurance and engages from the start. It may disappoint viewers in search of something more profound more meditative or funnier but it's still a work of considerable accomplishment and doubtless may reward repeat viewings by devotees.Show as an official selection of the NYFF 2009 at Lincoln Center.".

	schema:headline " Welcome Back to the Wonderfully Confusing World of Alain Resnais";
	schema:reviewBody "WILD GRASS LES HERBES FOLLES is based on the novel 'L'incident' by Christian Gailly a writer who delights in taking simple incidents and pushing them to the extremes of climax beyond which few would ever dream. But Alain Resnais has taken this novel adapted by Alex Reval and Laurent Herbiet infused it with his own characteristic joy of playing reality versus imagination memory versus illusion and has come up with a film that will likely have a limited audience but for those who delight in letting go and simply flying along with the imagination of a genius or two then WILD GRASS will satisfy and more. The story is a romance in the manner of a hesitation waltz. The story is narrated by Edouard Baer to give the opening aspects of the story momentum. Marguerite Muir Sabine Azma a dentist and Spitfire pilot has just purchased shoes and leaves the store when her handbag is snatched by a running thief. Later the aging Georges Palet Andr Dussollier finds a red wallet in a parking lot examines the contents struggles with the burden of what to do and finally turns the wallet in to the police Bernard de Bordeaux Mathieu Amalric who takes his name in case there is a reward. Georges returns home to his wife Suzanne Anne Consigny who understands that Georges' strange behavior since his father's recent death may be enhanced by a new predicament Georges is worried about the incident. He places telephone calls to Marguerite visits her home writers her letters  all of which confounds him as to his obsession with the woman he has never met. Georges family he has two children find his preoccupation strange and indeed Georges seems to have a dark secret from his past that causes him to have minor verbal explosions that seem wholly inappropriate.

	onyx:emotionText "WILD GRASS LES HERBES FOLLES is based on the novel 'L'incident' by Christian Gailly a writer who delights in taking simple incidents and pushing them to the extremes of climax beyond which few would ever dream. But Alain Resnais has taken this novel adapted by Alex Reval and Laurent Herbiet infused it with his own characteristic joy of playing reality versus imagination memory versus illusion and has come up with a film that will likely have a limited audience but for those who delight in letting go and simply flying along with the imagination of a genius or two then WILD GRASS will satisfy and more. The story is a romance in the manner of a hesitation waltz. The story is narrated by Edouard Baer to give the opening aspects of the story momentum. Marguerite Muir Sabine Azma a dentist and Spitfire pilot has just purchased shoes and leaves the store when her handbag is snatched by a running thief. Later the aging Georges Palet Andr Dussollier finds a red wallet in a parking lot examines the contents struggles with the burden of what to do and finally turns the wallet in to the police Bernard de Bordeaux Mathieu Amalric who takes his name in case there is a reward. Georges returns home to his wife Suzanne Anne Consigny who understands that Georges' strange behavior since his father's recent death may be enhanced by a new predicament Georges is worried about the incident. He places telephone calls to Marguerite visits her home writers her letters  all of which confounds him as to his obsession with the woman he has never met. Georges family he has two children find his preoccupation strange and indeed Georges seems to have a dark secret from his past that causes him to have minor verbal explosions that seem wholly inappropriate. The incident becomes his life. Meanwhile Marguerite shares her 'stalker' with her fellow dental assistant Josepha Emmanuelle Devos who attempts to manage Marguerite's change in behavior. Marguerite now is the one who needs to know more about Georges and stalks him. Ultimately Marguerite invites Georges to accompany her and her fellow pilots on a practice flight and a wildly entertaining practice flight game ensues both Georges and Marguerite navigate the social protocols of giving and acknowledging appreciation and this bizarre catch as catch can romance comes to a Hollywood end  complete with flashbacks to old films etc. The audience is left to figure out just what has really happened  is this a wild love story on a collision course or is it simply a pair of fantasias played by two strange emotionally isolated and bored people longing for life to perk up a bit?

Based on Christian Gailly's novel The Incident from a screenplay by Laurent Herbiet and Alex Reval Wild Grass treats its characters with respect and humor yet the film winner of the Jury Special Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival stands out more for the colorful cinematography by Eric Gautier and fine acting from Resnais' regulars Sabine Azma and Andr Dussollier than for its puzzling narrative.The couple Marguerite Muir Azma and Georges Palet Dussollier meet after Marguerite out shopping for a new pair of shoes has her purse stolen by a thief on roller blades and consequently loses her red wallet filled with money credit cards and identification papers. Georges however recovers Marguerite's lost wallet beneath the wheel of his car and returns it to the police. Interested in aviation and intrigued by a photo of the wallet's owner dressed in a pilot's outfit Georges decides that he wants to meet her.After the police inform Marguerite that her wallet has been turned in she calls Georges to say thank you but he is expecting more and his longing for connection is not satisfied beginning a pursuit that soon becomes an obsession. He sends her letters leaves messages on her phone and slashes her tires to keep her at home but she wants nothing to do with him. Ultimately he persists until she informs the police of the unwanted intrusion in her life. Typical of the screwball relationship however she suddenly begins to pursue Georges on her own making visits to his house late at night and waiting for him in a caf outside of a movie theatre where he is watching a favorite film from his childhood The Bridges at Toko Ri. You love me then Georges exclaims when he sees her for the first time.Throughout it all there is an underlying hint of danger with suggestions made about Georges' possibly violent past which outbursts of temper seem to underscore. Even so everything is handled with a light touch and one never fears for Marguerite's safety and elements of danger or even horror are quickly replaced by rapid shots of romance and even snippets of musicals. Like other aged directors swan songs Rohmer's The Romance of Astrea and Celadon Bergman's Saraband and Kurosawa's Madadayo Resnais' in his latest work continues to grow and experiment although some may say that the styles of these octogenarian directors have basically remained consistent throughout their careers. Far removed from the seriousness of his most famous films Hiroshima Mon Amour and Last Year at Marienbad just when you think you have figured out Wild Grass Resnais' whimsy keeps shifting into new territory and its bizarre twists and turns fake endings and character reversals will keep you off balance right up until the film's final frame. Like the wild grass in the title which grows where it is least expected nothing is predictable in this playful but often too cutesy little film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great master of the French cinema Alain Resnais has produced this bizarre brilliantly made and intensely surrealist 'crazy masterpiece'. It is based upon a novel entitled 'l'Incident' 'The Incident' with which I am unfamiliar so it is difficult to know how much of this film originated from the febrile brain of Resnais himself. The story and its treatment carry on the longstanding French traditions of two literary movements surrealism and 'unanisme'. The surrealist input is immediately obvious because the story itself although realistically portrayed is inherently entirely surrealist. It begins with an 'incident' namely the theft of a purse from a woman who has been shopping in the Palais Royale in Paris. For several minutes we do not even see her face but only the back of her head and her face only appears for the first time floating in a bath. It was Andr Breton's famous surrealist novel 'Nadja' which focused the minds of the entire French intelligentsia upon the importance of chance events which lead to chains of further complications and create a whole alternative future to that which might have been. Kieslowski and other film directors have exploited this motif in numerous films. This story commences in just such a way. And then further chance events ensue such as the man finding the stolen purse and becoming obsessed with the woman who owned it especially because she has a pilot's licence in the purse and he is obsessed by airplanes and female solo pilots. The influence of 'unanisme' on this story is shown by the intense portrayals of only tiny portions of the backgrounds stories and motives of the characters with the emphasis being given to them acting as a group and we the viewers being left to imagine the rest. In other words exposition is below the minimum and we never do learn what is wrong with all these crazy people and it is their interrelations which dominate. These techniques were above all pioneered and demonstrated by the French novelist Jules Romains who founded the literary movement known as 'unanisme'. Having read 27 novels by Romains I have more than a passing familiarity with his work. It has been more influential than people tend to realize. It must be kept firmly in mind that this Resnais film contains a great deal of gnomic humour and sly jokes. It is not meant to be taken any more seriously than life itself. Some of the references are incomprehensible as they are doubtless meant to be why do we keep seeing the camera moving over swaying wild grass in a field? Why do we see so many pavement cracks with tufts of wild grass growing out of them? We shall never know. Many of the shots editing compositions angles and moods are so outstanding that we can see clearly that Resnais has lost none of his genius in his long career. As always much in this film is never meant to be explained but is only suggested and we can make of it what we will. All of the leading characters are eventually shown to be seriously mentally unbalanced and I take this as Resnais's view of humanity generally. And who can say he is wrong? There is a lot to be said for the theory that everybody is insane. That would then explain everything about the world. In fact the only sane person in this film seems to be the little girl who asks about the cat munchies. And we do not even know who she is. This film is funny sad shocking upsetting provocative thoughtful disturbing incomprehensible deeply meaningful irrational profound and many other things besides but why use up all the adjectives when there is a compulsively fascinating movie to watch instead.".

This is a thinking man's movie which complements 'The Seventh Seal' where that Ingmar Bergman classic is overt about death this is more subtle and confounding. This is not a surface entertain us plot line rather it's subterfuge for the real intent. SPOILER ALERT! Rewatch this film and view the female dentist as Death. It explains the way the main character reacts the entire movie especially to the police when they arrive to speak with him what he says about his neighbor committing suicide. You'll notice throughout the film how the MC alternates between reaching out to embrace 'death' and angrily spurning 'death'. I did not clue in on this until the last two minutes of the movie when the wife asks 'death's dentist colleague if she wants to join them and she says absolutely not! You'll notice at the end the MC kisses death accepting his fate That's when I knew and sure enough the MC's soul soars into the heavens until the plane crashes and it is received back into the grave of wild grass or is the soul reincarnated as the little girl asks if she becomes a cat in her next life? Yes at the end I can see the woman writing a novel and all this is in her imagination but this plays like David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' with multiple interpretations. No one will be truly satisfied with one interpretation or another but it does make us think and for that the director did his job.".

I am no stranger to antirealist surrealist and experimental film. I thought it would be interesting to see a recent Resnais film that was actually available at Redbox! I was wrong. Wild Grass is neither amusing nor interesting. It is tedious ridiculous and nonsensical and not in a good way. It hints at many aspects of the main character's past and personality playfully suggesting he was a convicted murderer or rapist who has served his time. In addition to that he acts in completely contradictory ways is usually irrational and petulant and is lecherous dumb and abusive to women. He slashes the woman's tires and she eventually finds this kind of behavior irresistible? He sexually assaults her business partnerfriend in the latter's car and the friend enjoys it? Can you say misogyny? And we're supposed to believe this beautiful young woman is his wife? I kept thinking I must have gotten it wrong this must be his daughter who is for some reason pretending to be his wife. A colossal casting error this alone. Maybe she was identified toward the beginning of the film as his daughter but I couldn't bring myself to care enough to go back and rewatch the beginning. The main characters seem to have a lot of money suggesting some level of responsibility the woman after all is a dentist but they act worse than teenagers and even more irrationally and selfdestructively. I felt compelled to see how it would end but was predictably annoyed with myself for having wasted so much of my time. This is a very stupid film and I would not recommend it to anyone. And one reviewer here gave us the key to the film the dentist represents Death! Wow. As if Ingmar Bergman never existed? If I have to read the film metaphorically in that way then it depends entirely on a secret key that 99 percent of viewers will not get. I could think of nothing more pretentious than that.

	schema:headline " The joy of cinema Resnais at 87  whimsical fanciful in vivid delight with comparable verve doses by his cinematic collaborators familier";
	schema:reviewBody "WILD GRASS aka Les Herbes Folles in French is aptly titled naturellement. Such grass that grows wild is unpredictable in how it blooms and affects its surrounding neighbors. It can be amazing or annoying subtle or gregarious. Consulting my FrenchEnglish dictionary 'herbe' is grass while 'folle' does mean mad wild foolish. Either way veteran French filmmaker Alan Resnais emboldened by his worthy age and years in the world of cinema gave us quite a treat to what the joy of cinema can truly be a film about a pair of 'madman and madwoman'  'folles' foolish tremendously so or otherwise.The story is a series of events string together seemingly easy to follow with the comfort of a narrator voiceover interjecting certain rhyme or reason  the varying plot points converge yet without notice diverge also. Scratching your head? Don't mind that  ignore the inquisitive curious why's  why ever not!

	onyx:emotionText "WILD GRASS aka Les Herbes Folles in French is aptly titled naturellement. Such grass that grows wild is unpredictable in how it blooms and affects its surrounding neighbors. It can be amazing or annoying subtle or gregarious. Consulting my FrenchEnglish dictionary 'herbe' is grass while 'folle' does mean mad wild foolish. Either way veteran French filmmaker Alan Resnais emboldened by his worthy age and years in the world of cinema gave us quite a treat to what the joy of cinema can truly be a film about a pair of 'madman and madwoman'  'folles' foolish tremendously so or otherwise.The story is a series of events string together seemingly easy to follow with the comfort of a narrator voiceover interjecting certain rhyme or reason  the varying plot points converge yet without notice diverge also.

Without even knowing the woman Georges finds himself inexorably drawn to her and he'll stop at nothing to insinuate himself into her life. In turn Marguerite a single woman who appears to have been boycotting beauty salons her whole life develops mixed feelings for this man who has essentially become a stalker and who has even gone so far as to slash the tires on her car. And before you know it Marguerite has become so unstrung and neurotic in her own right that she's sleeping in the cockpit of her plane and has become such a sadist with the dental drill that she would give Dr. Christian Szell  or the Marquis de Sade for that matter  a run for his money in a paininflicting sweepstakes.The offputting nature of the film comes from the fact that the characters often feel more like the product of a writer's imagination than organic outgrowths from the real world. Their motivations and responses are almost maddeningly preposterous and unclear at times and as a consequence our patience with their behavior wears decidedly thin after awhile. There are other distractions as well such as Marguerite's extraordinarily unmanaged Little Orphan Annie coiffure we find ourselves wanting to cry out Why don't you run a damn comb through that thing? and the selfconscious cinephilia that is ohsotypical of French filmmakers.On the positive side Resnais manages to achieve a hypnotic rhythm with his fluidly flowing tracking shots and there are definitely some elements of style and theme from some of Resnais' bona fide classics like Hiroshima Mon Amour and Last Year at Marienbad running through this work the nature of intimacy between strangers and nearstrangers being just one of the issues touched upon in all three films.However these few virtues are not enough to overcome the unlikable nature of the storyline and the two loony and selfabsorbed folk who serve as its protagonists. So I guess it's only appropriate that the movie culminate in a spectacularly stupid and laughable intothewildblueyonder finale that literally as well as figuratively crashes and burns on its way to that much delayed but highly appreciated fin signaling the end of our ordeal.

At least it matches the unpredictability of their characters' actions which is the kindest way I can say that the script is still in draft stage abruptly changing tack several times in the course of the movie.When the script fails Resnais resorts to cinematic devices such as repetition reverse direction vignetting and the everpopular shrinking circle closing in on a character's head. It's annoying.I am really struggling to say something positive about the movie. Mathieu Amalric's dead pan and humane portrayal of a desk cop is the strong point here.

The French are its most skilled producers look out also for Celine and Julie go Boating I've given it 2 stars because I thought the acting was really quite good. Unfortunately the plot was utterly implausible nonsense and I got a distinct feeling that the scriptwriters had painted themselves into a corner by the end. Hence a not very convincing finale to a not very convincing story. I sometimes think French directors are stuck in a timewarp endlessly trying to recreate the next Jules and Jim but failing miserably. Funny thing is I once saw a film by the same director made 50 years ago called Last Year in Marienbad. It was equally plot less none of the characters had names and nothing really happened. For some reason it worked and I loved it. Maybe it's just me getting old. . . .".

The French are its most skilled producers look out also for Celine and Julie go Boating I've given it 2 stars because I thought the acting was really quite good. Unfortunately the plot was utterly implausible nonsense and I got a distinct feeling that the scriptwriters had painted themselves into a corner by the end. Hence a not very convincing finale to a not very convincing story. I sometimes think French directors are stuck in a timewarp endlessly trying to recreate the next Jules and Jim but failing miserably. Funny thing is I once saw a film by the same director made 50 years ago called Last Year in Marienbad. It was equally plot less none of the characters had names and nothing really happened. For some reason it worked and I loved it. Maybe it's just me getting old. . . .";

Cinephiles who have never been really concerned with scripts in the first place have lapped this up and praised it as a sign that the octogenarian Renais still has it. And as an aside it is totally badass that him and Godard are both still making films at this point. And that's not wrong. The actual film has all of the charm the script lacks it looks gorgeous and between the lead actors and Resnais's idiosyncratic directing the film manifests most of the charm its script tries for.And that's all well and good but a film cannot subsist on charm alone. It's no a long movie but the back half felt like an eternity to me. If you like movies where people wander around Paris and talk about old movies this one is for you. If you don't this is pretty to look at but it's best not to look beneath the surface.".

But besides the inappropriate tone of the movie the script is horrible and at least two of the actors seem miscast. Andr Dussollier's character is described as being about 50 he's 64 and Anne Consigny who plays his wife of supposedly 30 years is only 46 it's possible they've been married that long but not likely. Sabine Azema's character behaves in a totally irrational way that is likely to infuriate and should American women. When the movie ended the applause was polite at best but there was a mad rush for the exits and the general discussion afterward was negative.".

Sometimes the resultant pastry is delicious other times barely edible. Throwing around his movie aficionado weight Resnais delivers a piece verging on farcical pretentious but ultimately with enough selfawareness to avoid ridicule.A tale of two zany but unforgivably underdeveloped protagonists who through a random mundane crossing of paths become almost neurotically obsessed with each other. 50 year old Georges Andrei Dussollier a tired man with a dark past never revealed throughout the movie and the slight suggestions as to the nature of his mishaps just muddle the story finds a stolen wallet belonging to 40something Marguerite Muir Sabine Azema a fuzzy redhead dentist. Within it he gets infatuated with her picture in a pilot's license which suggest certain frivolous freedom and a fulfilment of childhood fantasies. After returning the wallet via the police Georges starts compulsively stalking the woman sending her letters phoning her and in sheer anger slashing her tyres. Inexorably once Marguerite cuts this off by informing the police she in turn becomes unstrung and overpowered by a drive to get to know the wouldbe stalker. Flung in the midst of all this is Georges wife Marguerite's coworker and a wellmeaning policeofficer. All leading to a misogynistic wet dream with a suitably cinephile double ending Fin.All of the above placed within the confines of a Amelialike narrator who attempts to push forward the action and expand the context but ultimately tires and dissuades attention. Characters themselves lack any foothold in real life seemingly more like a conjecture imposed onto a movie reel with grownups acting like crazed lovestricken teenagers on permanent entactogenic drives. Actions and reactions are borderline asinine this includes everyone detached from normalcy not helped by the dissoluted plot which forgoes attempts to build up character motivations. The motive of obsession seems to be the theme but when a woman falls madly in love with a stalker another female gets all gooey and blissful from being sexually assaulted while his wife understandingly accepts all this unmistakeably points to pseudoartistic masturbation of Lars von Trier proportion...Adding to this Resnais' comedic jabs and nods the movie feels like extrapolated absurdity posing as serious nouvelle cinema. This movie actually ends in the lalaland of blue skies and romantic endings juxtaposed with Georges being unable to close his fly zipper after taking a peepee. Much too my frustration the viewer has to sit out through two appearances of the word FIN before they actually fly off into the blue yonder...Some of the experimentation during various shots was also pretty irritating felt misplaced and added a further layer of ridicule.".

He often deals with the layers of memory yearning oblivion and death in man. He throws his characters into a story and sees what the fuss occurs. His latest film Les herbes folles or Wild Grass is a psychotic version of the conventional genre of romantic comedy. Les herbes folles is a new kind of comedy it challenges the limitations of cinema and the fantastic imaginative narrative is something we haven't seen in decades.A pickpocket steals a wallet of a woman. A man finds the wallet and since it has an ID card within he decides to return it to its owner. After a series of difficulties the woman gets her wallet but the man seems to be hoping for something more between them.The characterization of the film is simplified but strong it makes us question the role of a character in fiction. Marquerite the woman is purely a fictional figure red haired dentist who loves flying. Georges the man is an ordinary suburban dad who has got a dangerously unstable personality. He thinks about murders and crimes but is it all fantasy or could he actually do it? The character remains elusive and I loved it.Les herbes folles was Alain Resnais' first adaption from a novel even that he has worked with many famous writers such as Marquarite Duras. Les herbes folles is based on a novel L'Incident by Christian Gailly. Alain Resnais has always adored cheap literature and the things he got from this small unknown novel amaze me. What I've heard is that Gailly's narrative is minimalist but the narrative of Les herbes folles in obviously the opposite. The 'miseenscene' is filled with precisely considered items that yet appear as ordinary furniture. An important addition Resnais made for the novel is the wild grass which grows from the gaps of the asphalt streets. Just as the grass so do the passions and desires of the characters run wild.The visuality of Les herbes folles is imaginative and enchanting. Already in 1959 Resnais made innovative use of flashback in Hiroshima mon amour and in Les herbes folles he mixes flashbacks delusions and fantasies in a very unique absurd way  overall the film is a courageously playful story. Both the editing and cinematography overwhelmed me they just make this a very aesthetic experience. The scene with the cops is full of closeup stylized editing and quick zoomins and this absurd use of camera just reinforces the Kafkaesque in the entire scene.Les herbes folles is a new beginning in a way it's something Resnais has never done before and I hope we will see many great ones by him in the future as well. It's a film which plays around with cinema narrative with stylized editing and simplified characterization. In the end it grows out to be a mature antithesis for brainless romantic comedies and a wonderful aesthetic experience.".

The queen of the title seems to be based on Bodicea bloodthirsty queen of the Britons. Still she is a Viking even though she is supposedly British and queen of the Druids even though they all worship the Greek god Zeus. Whatever. Said queen is played by International Beauty Carita in a style so rigid that wooden doesn't even cover it. This was her only filmI believe she was actually a hairstylist and did Jane Fonda's astonishing do's in the EuroPoe flick Spirits of the Dead. Starring opposite her as her hotpanted eyelinered Roman love interest is Don Murray a long way from Marilyn Monroe and the Bus Stop.Still my favorite scene is where the BritishVikingGreekDruids are sacrificing Romans to the fiery pit and there's this great awkward moment where some kind of assistant priest has to climb down from the big rock and stoke the fire for the next human sacrifice while all the other BritishVikingGreekDruids stand waiting impatiently.

He plays the Roman ruler of a Celtic tribe in ancient Britain.  The Celtic King dies and appoints one of his three daughters to rule in his place even though she is virtually a figurehead because of the Roman occupation.  He picks Carita and because her mother was a Viking she is dubbed The Viking Queen.  Apparently she picked up her mother's accent along the way even though she was raised in Britain?  Murray and Carita have an affection for one another but it is put to the test when he leaves to fight an enemy and his secondincommand starts wreaking havoc on her people.  Finally she's had enough and rises to battle the Romans even at the expense of her relationship with Murray. Carita is lovely as any former model should be but her acting inexperience shows much of the time.  Murray couldn't possibly be more miscast and he and Carita have only adequate chemistry at best.  They do have their own little miniBen Hur chariot race which ends up in a swamp but their great love is not aptly demonstrated in the film.  Corri and Pagett play her sisters.  One looks old enough to be her mother and dabbles in the occult while the other has a tentative love affair with a local bruiser played by Caffrey.  Houston is a raving rabblerousing Druid priest who at times makes Victor Buono look subtle.  Actors like Keir and Troughton attempt to give real performances but are done in by the pedestrian script.  The ad copy for this film promised all sorts of wild events on screen but most of them are presented in a morethantame manner. There is also a heavy dose of hilarious feminine pulchritude on display as scantilyclad ladies show off their bodies with strategic arm pasty and hair placement to cover the naughtiest bits while they lie around stroking and petting the various men of the cast.  One in particular referred to as the Nubian slave is an obviously Caucasian girl in blackface with Star Trek make up who probably has more costume changes than the lead!  It's not the dullest film ever made and has a few intriguing moments and some eyecatching scenery and costumes but doesn't hold up as history nor as titillation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a bit surprised at some of the low reviews for The Viking Queen I've watched it three times now and my appreciation for this 1967 Hammer flick has increased with each viewing.The biggest criticism is that Salena is a Celt and the movie should therefore be titled The Celtic Queen. Yet this is explained right at the beginning of the story Her father chooses her to reign after his death and says Like your mother you shall be called 'the Viking Queen.' So Salena is the Viking Queen simply because her mother was of Viking ancestry.One may argue that the Vikings didn't exist for another 700 years the story takes place shortly after the time of Christ but Viking is simply a collective designation of Nordic people  Danes Swedes and Norwegians. And even IF the word Viking didn't exist at the time of the film's setting so what? Just imagine Salena's father saying You shall be called the Nordic Queen. Another major gripe is that the Druids improperly pray to Zeus a Greek God. Although this is a legitimate beef the filmmakers obviously chose to do this because the Druids lacked a recognizable deity. This problem is rectified by simply supplanting the word Zeus with the Druid deity of your choice when hearing the Druids pray in the film Bet you can't think of ONE Druid deity can you?.The story is roughly based on the historical Boudicca queen of the Iceni a British tribe. Her impressive revolt against the Roman occupants included the sack of London then Londinium and the death of some 70000 Romans !. The Roman governor of Britain ultimately destroyed Boudicca's force in despair she killed herself by taking poison in 60 AD.In The Viking Queen you'll certainly get a good glimpse of what this era was like. The story is ultraserious and the actors perform their roles accordingly. Salena is played by Carita who although very beautiful is completely believable in the role. Be on the watch for her in a breathtaking purple miniskirt near the end speaking of such be on the lookout as well for Salena's supercute sister Talia played by Nicola Pagett. Needless to say it's too bad this was Carita's sole excursion into acting terrain.The locations Ireland costumes and sets are all of the highest order for a Hammer film of the time period.One other complaint is that it is unbelievable that Salena falls in love with the Roman governor played by Don Murray and vice versa yet isn't it realistic to assume that more than one Briton babe fell in love with a Roman occupant particularly if he was in a command position? Besides the tragic ending is emotionally compounded by this love story.FINAL WORD The Viking Queen is a movie in the vein of Braveheart Gladiator or Attila. If you're a fan of such films you'll likely enjoy The Viking Queen. Personally I feel Braveheart is overrated and I'd pop in The Viking Queen before Gladiator any day.If like me this film inspires you to research the true history of Boudicca then the filmmakers have accomplished far more than mere entertainment. Enough said.The movie runs 91 minutes.GRADE B".

Sword and sandal flicks were one such subgenre that was favoured in the 60's and that led Hammer to make The Viking Queen. Set in 1st century Britain it involves machinations between three sets of inhabitants of those islands  the indigenous Iceni people the ruling Romans and the Druids. The drama revolves around the queen of the Iceni and the Roman governor who fall in love but whose relationship has dark consequences.This movie is historically about as accurate as Hammer's earlier One Million Years B.C. in which dinosaurs coexisted with wellgroomed cave people. In this one we have a Viking queen  a few hundred years out and in the wrong country  lead the Iceni people  who were from a completely different part of the country  while the druids seem to worship Roman gods! But the film is hilariously unconcerned with such matters so neither should you be. And to be fair if you roll with it this is a pretty successfully entertaining bit of hokum. The Viking Queen herself is played by a Finnish actress called Carita her heavy accent makes her somewhat strange as the leader of the Britons but she has the requisite beauty that puts her into the same bracket as several other Hammer heroines. Like is normal for Hammer too there are some pretty good character actors underpinning things including Andrew Keir as the nasty Roman Octavian and Patrick Troughton as the progressively minded Briton Tristam. Also like Hammer the film looks really handsome despite its low budget. The locations look great and the sets and costumes are all nice also. There's some salacious material included too to enliven things further such as a human sacrifice ceremony and a violent assault on the Iceni village by the rampaging Romans. It might all be nonsense but its pretty good nonsense.".

The script is so silly one simply has to laugh at it but I'll get to that in a moment. At least it follows in the tradition of Hammer and is exceptionally good looking with decent battle scenes and lovely female cast members.The viking queen of the title is Salina played by Finnish beauty Carita in one of only two film roles a young Briton living under the rule of Roman conquerors in ancient times. Her father King Priam Wilfrid Lawson is sure that his people can peacefully coexist with the Romans and conveys this belief to Salina who inherits the role of queen when he passes on. But there's more. These Britons are part of a group of Druids  who pray to the Greek god Zeus. Salina embarks on a romance with nice guy Roman governor general Justinian Don Murray of Bus Stop but their happiness will be short lived thanks to Justinians' hateful and power hungry second in command Octavian Andrew Keir and the restlessness of the natives.Carita looks stunning so some viewers may not care if her performance isn't all that hot. Murray looks quite out of place and the excellent supporting cast Niall MacGinnis Donald Houston Adrienne Corri Patrick Troughton et al helps to keep this watchable although it's sluggish at times. It attempts to be funny with a chariot race that ends in falls into the drink. With Don Chaffey in the directors' seat the film does serve up doses of sex violence and sacrifice enough to maintain our interest for a while. Gorgeous Irish scenery complements the physical charms of the actresses. While one couldn't take it seriously it does have an endearing camp factor going for it.In any event we have to hand it to Hammer for making this kind of thing as we sure don't see much like it anymore. As long as people go in knowing it's absolutely no history lesson and just accept it as escapist entertainment they can find it diverting enough.Six out of 10.".

Despite the title it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Vikings. The misleading title is the sort of thing I'd expect from Roger Corman not Hammer. It's all very dull.

Once again Chaffey is called upon to provide seminaked and very beautiful women bloodthirsty battles woefully inaccurate history and sensationalised plotting all in the name of entertainment. Alas the trick doesn't work twice and The Viking Queen emerges a curious historical folly more memorable for the wrong reasons stupid dialogue continuity errors overthetop acting etc. than the right ones.In Celtic times a dying king of the Britons makes a final wish that his daughter Salina Carita should take control of the Iceni tribe after he has passed away. His request is for Salina to forge an alliance with the honourable and honest Roman Justinian Don Murray. As requested Salina tries to uphold her father's dying wish. indeed she even finds herself falling in love with the Roman. However the druids  who believe it is their right to advise and guide Salina in her decisions  are not pleased by this growing bond between Iceni and Roman forces and forbid them to consummate their relationship via marriage. Similarly some of the more aggressive and attackminded Romans are just as troubled by Justinian's actions so they too try to set up obstacles in the path of his plans of love. Octavian Andrew Keir in particular is hellbent on preventing a meaningful comradeship between the two tribes and he does everything he can to stir trouble. While Justinian is away fighting a battle in Anglesey the Romans take advantage of his absence to abuse and mistreat the Iceni people. Ultimately things come to a head and much blood is shed as Salina is forced to put the pride and passion of her people before everything else. She leads her tribe into a fatal battle against the Romans sacrificing her chance of love in order to protect their way of life..The fact that Salina is actually a Celtic queen living in an era some 700 years before the Vikings had any meaningful link with British history is a sore point that has been discussed by other reviewers already. Not that scriptwriter Clarke Reynolds seems particularly bothered by it evading the issue by adding a halfline to explain that her mother was a Viking and therefore she is technically of Viking ancestry. The attractive photography by Stephen Dade on Irish locations is one of the film's few pleasures. Bad movie as it is it still looks colourful and eyecatching throughout. The overthetop acting is also enjoyable in a cruel and twisted way I guess it's that idea of revelling in the misfortune of others  taking pleasure in watching good actors in terrible trouble and all that. Donald Houston is perhaps the guiltiest of all giving a performance that is embarrassingly unrestrained as the troublemaking druid Maelgan. Carita on the other hand is an amateurish nonactor given the responsibility of carrying the picture when in actual fact she is simply incapable of doing so she never starred in another film. See The Viking Queen if you're a fan of Hammer and you don't mind history that is camp and inaccurate. avoid it if you want something serious enlightening and believable.".

Her command of English was quite good though the accent a bit thick and unlike anyone else in the film. And I must say that when she was being tough and warlike as she swung her sword I thought it was adorable...though hardly scary or inspiring.The film is set around the year 100 give or take a week. The Romans are occupying part of Britain and the locals not surprisingly are not at all pleased. For a while the Queen Carita and Roman Governor Murray get along great and it seems they like each other and corule well. Eventually however their queen a localnot some Viking despite the title leads a revolt because of mistreatment of her people by some evil Romansmuch like the real life one Queen Boadicea and her people the Iceni waged against the occupiers. Why then they keep calling her a Viking is beyond me as the Vikings didn't arrive until about the year 800. Perhaps it made the film more marketable or the folks making it just knew nothing about history. Or perhaps The Viking Queen simply sounded better than The Iceni Queen! And why do the Iceni keep referring to Zeusthe Greek god?! The film comes off as not only historically inaccurate but also suffers from two other serious problems. First it's incredibly talky and often the dialog is horribly bad. Second although the battles with Rome were epics with tens of thousands killed the film seems to show that both armies numbered in the dozens! And mostly the soldiers just stand theredoing very little. As for the Queenshe seemed about as scary and powerful as a Teletubby. The overall effect is cheap and a bit silly...and quite titillating at times which only increases the cheese factor. And it may well make you laughit sure did with me.By the way some of you might recognize Patrick Troughton in the film. He later played one of the Doctors from Dr. Whoone of the more obscure ones.

To say that I enjoyed the beautiful expressions that I observed that day is to put it mildly. To see such a large crowd of beautiful proud and peaceful African Americans celebrating our musical heritage was an event that I will cherish to my grave. I can only give thanks to everyone who participated in making this such a seminal event in my life. I was fortunate enough to be able to tape the movie when it came on cable TV but of course I am anxiously waiting for it to come out on DVD. You know the thing that really impresses me is that this came about as the aftermath of a very violent occurrence and there were at least to my knowledge no acts of violence during this event. What a great testament to us. Be proud black folks be very very proud.".

	schema:headline " Snapshot of Early 1970's Soul";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not just a concert film it's a documentary about AfricanAmerican life in Los Angeles in the early 1970's.  The concert is to commemorate the Watts riots of 1965 and some of the positive changes that took place in the area.  Although there is a lot of humor to be found in some of the comments that the residents make about changes in their area it's sad to realize that the lingering problems of racism and unequal opportunities still exist to this day.  However there's a lot of joy and hope expressed throughout the film.  This is one of Richard Pryor's earliest appearances on film and he is pure genius.  Ted Lange The Love Boat and Raymond Lewis Woodrow on Sanford and Son are some of the Watts residents who give their thoughts about the political changes.  Thespian couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee can be glimpsed in the stands during a quick shot.All of the musical performances are solid.  The movie opens with The Dramatics' What You See Is What You Get which serves as a commentary on Watts itself.  Some of the musical acts perform away from the concert area. The Emotions do a heartfelt rendition of the gospel song Peace Be Still in a local church and blues great Little Milton does a classic Walking The Back Streets Crying while sitting near a railway.  The late great Johnny Taylor sings Jody Got Your Girl and Gone to a nightclub audience populated by players and hustlers in full regalia.  Back on the concert stage Rufus Thomas appears in an outrageous outfit and mixes comedy along with his music. The Staple Singers The Barkays Carla Thomas Kim Weston Albert King Rance Allen please the audience.  Issac Hayes caps the night off when he struts in to the Theme From Shaft and The Rev. Jessie Jackson gives him a king's welcome.I saw this film during the Chicago International Film Festival this year and afterwards the director Mel Stuart explained that legal entanglements continue to keep this film from being released on video.  That's a shame because this film is an excellent time capsule of a piece of 1970's culture.".

In fact the non concert footage could stand alone as a separate film due to the fact that they show various aspects of AfricanAmerican life. Also it is quite sad to see Richard Pryor in this film. This was before the years of abuse began to take their toll and probably helped contribute to the Multiple Sclerosis which would contribute to his death years later. However the concert footage is what pushed this film over the top especially the footage of Issac Hayes.

I should mention the scene when Rufus Thomas comes on and the crowd literally 'bumrushes' the field in what today would be considered a riot but as the swarm of people descend from the stands to the sound of Rufus's opening number 'Funky Chicken' the riot is a dancing feel good frenzy! I don't think anywhere in the world in today's society could so many people swarm into a small space like that and there not be any violence. They were just itching to dance and boy did they ever!!! Then after Rufus wrapped it up he playfully instructed them to kindly move back to the stands and like angels every single one of them did as requested in unison! OK one drunk guy stayed but Rufus joked with him and then told the crowd to 'go get him' and on cue some of them rushed the field to 'playfully' scurry him back to the stands.You've really got to see this movie!

It's amazing to see how smoothly he works crowd control completely eliminating the need for police intervention by appealing directly to the masses. And of course it's always a treat to see the Staple Singers perform.I recommend this movie first for the fabulous musical performances and second for its capturing of the feel of the time and place. I give it an 8 instead of a 10 simply because I wish I could have seen ALL of the performances in their entirety.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this gem of a documentary on black culture in the early '70's one night on cable in '98 and was blown away. Having been born in 1972 and growing up in that era it warmed my heart to listen to people talk about what they loved about our culture and to be reminded of how we took care of ourselves and each other back in the day. That is something that is terribly lacking in all communities today. And the musical performances were nothing short of spectacular. Watching the Emotions rendition of Peace Be Still I'm not ashamed to say brought tears to this big ol' Southern boy's eyes I also enjoyed the late great Rufus Thomas' renditions of Breakdown and Do the Funky Chicken and the singing of the black national anthem Lift Every Voice and Sing as they showed the audience filing into the stadium. I recorded it onto VHS the next time it came on and treasured it like the Hope Diamond but a few months later the tape popped and I have never been able to find it anywhere else since. So I say to the producers of this great film if you are reading this message please do yourself and the rest of the world a favor and release this classic on VHSDVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "On August 20 1972the seventh anniversary of the Watts riotsa 7 hour concert of various musical acts from the Stax Records roster was held at the Los Angeles Coliseum in honor of that event. Among those artists put in the film include The Stax Golden 13 warbling Old Time Religion The Staple Singers chanting Respect Yourself Kim Weston performing Lift Every Voice and Sing The BarKays doing Son of Shaft Albert King singing I'll Sing the Blues for You Carla Thomas warbling Picking Up the Pieces Rufus Thomas performing The Breakdown and Do the Funky Chicken Luthur Ingram wailing If Loving You is Wrong I Don't Want to be Right and Isaac Hayes doingof courseTheme From Shaft. In addition three young women called The Emotions perform in a church with Peace Be Still. All are surrounded by Richard Pryor doing some hilarious monologues about growing up black as well as many Watts residentsone of which I recognized as Ted Lange later Isaac on The Love Boatalso talking about pretty much the same thing. Director Mel Stuart also provides lots of documentary footage of the area as it was at the time and during the events this film addresses. The performances I saw were great and I was especially glad to see the Hayes sequence since it wasn't in the airing on Cinemax in the '90s when I first watched this. The version I saw just now was on YouTube with the first 49 minutes from a French broadcast and the other an Asian one though it cut off after Luther Ingram in the middle of Pryor's next segment so I had to look elsewhere on the YouTube site for Richard's remaining monologues and Hayes' restored performance I've yet to see his other number Soulsville. Nonetheless this was a great documentary with excellent musical performances all around. So on that note Wattstax is well worth seeing. P.S. Both The Emotions and The Staple Singers were native to my birthtown of Chicago Ill. Luther Ingram was the cowriterwith Mack Riceof the Staples' Respect Yourself. It happened to be Hayes' 30th birthday when he performed at this event. And I also noticed Ossie Davis and wife Ruby Dee among the audience members. Update 6813I've now seen Hayes' Soulsville performance and it's a nice serious number about the struggles of his people living below their means with pertinent footage accompanying it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wattstax is a concert film based on the performance of the same name which was held in the summer of 1972. Held in the Los Angeles Coliseum then home to the NFL's Rams team the concert was the climax of what was then an annual weeklong festival held in the AfricanAmerican community of Watts commemorating the rebellionriots that took place in 1965. All of the music performers involved were from the nowstoried Stax label which gave the American pop landscape such acts as Sam  Dave Booker T.  the MGs and the Otis Redding. A diverse selection of performers gives viewers a nearcomplete glimpse of the black music experience circa 1972 Gospel blues RB and funk artists all on the same bill. Promoted as The black Woodstock the full concert was six hours here condensed to roughly 90 minutes.The concert was hosted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson who speaks his nowlegendary I Am Somebody sermon. Highlights of the show include the Staple Singers Respect Yourself The BarKays Son of Shaft Johnnie Taylor Jody's Got Your Girl and Gone Albert King I'll Play the Blues for You and Rufus Thomas The Funky Chicken. Shaft composer and future South Park icon Isaac Hayes got to close the show and the DVD restores his full performance Warner Bros. Pictures controlled the copyright to the Shaft movie songs and refused clearance for the film which was originally released through Columbia Pictures the original movie footage of Hayes was rather brief which perhaps damaged its box office run.Interspersed between the concert footage are manonthestreet interviews with assorted locals who get to opine without censorship on various issues of the day. A preLove Boat Ted Lange is among them his prematurely graying mustache lending unintentional humor to his youngguy rants. Also bookending many segments is Richard Pryor whose similarly uncensored dialogue make some affecting points about uncomfortable subjects from slavery to police brutality to unemployment. That he manages to find humor in the brutality of racism speaks to the genius of the late comic.Wattstax released in the midst of the blaxploitation movie trend was a thenunheard of snapshot of the state of black America as buffered through the music of its artists. There are many establishing shots of storefronts in black neighborhoods ramshackle churches abound as well as other starkly blighted structures. As one resident puts it some things have changed for the better some for the worst a lot of things have stayed the same.. Whatever the physical costs of the civil rights movement there is brief footage included of Dr. Martin Luther King's final speech the emotional wounds were still fresh. Black is beautiful was the catchphrase of the day and Afrocentric styles of hair and fashion were at a predisco peak however the flamboyant 'players' who come to see a nightclub show anticipate the me decade excess that was to come. Based on footage shown the assembly team who put together the stage in the middle of the field is mostly white however according to commentator Rob Bowman Stax boss Al Bell insisted that the private security be black as well as any LAPD involved.".

It was a totally eyeopening experience.Now over 30 years later Wattstax is finally out on DVD and it's beautiful. It's probably the best music documentary ever made. Seven years after the riots in Watts a concert was thrown at the LA Coliseum where 100000 people came out to remember the event. The film covers the concert with amazing sound quality and some of the only live footage I've ever seen by amazing groups like the Staples the Emotions the totally amazing BarKays You also get the criminally underrated Carla Thomas with one of the greatest voices of all time coming through crystal clear in this new digital release.Along with the music you get the classic between song banter with Rufus Thomas and the audience you get Richard Pryor at his peak you get Melvin Van Peebles doing his thing and you get Jesse Jackson hosting. Most fascinating to me however are the many interviews with just regular folks in Watts. Completely engrossing the comments are sad funny and let you emotionally know what the concert was about.".

I have looked on various websites including the sites of AmazonSam Goodyand even selected music shops for this album which was released back in the early 1970's. But as for the movie is concern this is a picture that needs to be seen again and I wonder what is the holdup on getting it released on video. They say its something elsebut from other people's minds I don't dig it since it has been in commercial tieups lately with studio executives and its directorMel Stuart who has been pushing hard to get this movie out on video. I got the chance to see this seldom seen picture only once when they showed it on Cinemax back in the early 90's. This is a movie and a concert documentary that showcased some of the biggest and baddest as well as some of the soulful groups and RB singers of their day. This is also a true picture about US as a people too when we didn't act so CRAZYand it shows. The overall beauty of this film is at the impact of seeing our beautiful brothers and sisters when we had some dignity as well as pride about ourselves and our culture plus we have a lot of soul and self respect in being what we were. We were one with our own music and we were able to express that individuality by feeling what was deep inside us. Wattstax was based on a two day event which was the Woodstock for AfricanAmericans that was held in 1972 at the L.A. Coliseum. This was the kind of show that made you stand up and dance up a storm if you wanted to and also to express yourself. Some of the people that are in this are a very youthful and radical looking Rev. Jesse Jackson who was incredible to watch and he gave various speeches as well as providing laughs from a young looking Richard Pryor. The acts that performed was straight up soulkicking entertainment and it shows. You had acts that included The Staple SingersThe EmotionsCarla ThomasRance AllenJohnnie Taylor as well as one of the greatest acts ever...the incredible Issac Hayes. Like the title of the group The Dramatics used to sayWhat You See Is What You Getand it shows. It a crying shame that we lost two of Stax's greatest entertainers that were featured..the late Rufus Thomas and the late great Johnnie Taylor as well as Pop Staples. It remains to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a pleasant surprise this movie was! I remember hearing about it on NPR a couple of years ago when the DVD first came out and prior to that I had never even heard of Wattstax either the concert or the movie. Boy was I missing out! Fast forward to 2006. I rented this puppy at my local video store and had the pleasure of watching one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in years.The closest comparison I can make is to the Woodstock movie as Wattstax is also a concert movie in a similar vein. It's very of its time 1972 but somehow doesn't feel as dated as the Woodstock movie. It's both a concert film an exploration of Watts itself and a document of the black culture of the time  the purpose of the concert being to celebrate both black culture and pride as well as the seventh anniversary of the Watts riots.It features lots of footage other than performances  crowd shots interviews with the man on the street a gospel performance at a local church some Blist celebrities etc all of which help add to the atmosphere of both the concert and of Watts itself. There's even some very funny and casual footage of Richard Pryor in his prime as he raps about all sorts of topics in a local bar.Now on to the music...This movie contains some of the greatest soul blues RB and funk performances that you'll ever see. Every performance is great in its own right. The Staples Singers find a relentless groove and keep on rocking...Carla Thomas proves that she has one of the most powerful pure voices in the business...The BarKays dazzle with both their outlandish attire and their funky grooves...Albert King brings a touch of the blues with his inimitable guitar style....the list goes on and on.For me however the absolute highlight of the show is Rufus Thomas's performance. Sad to say but I had only a passing acquaintance with Mr. Thomas' work prior to seeing this movie but Wattstax changed everything. Resplendant in white gogo boots and hot pink shorts shirt and cape Rufus proceeds to tear the roof off the joint with a relentlessly funky and hilarious performance. The crowd clearly eats it up and there's a great montage of various audience members boogeying their hearts out and asses off. I don't know if I've ever seen a performer with as much presence and charisma as Rufus Thomas he's a rare bird indeed.So long story short if you haven't already seen this movie you're wasting your time. Go out and watch it right now!!!".

As a musical event the five hours concert on the Olympic Stadium in LA was shorter and less representative even of the the whole scene of black music of the time while Woodstock was the big music event of a generation and gathered much of the cream of the rock music. From a social perspective while Woodstock was THE event of the hippie era to be talked about 40 years later Wattstack got lost in a period rich of events that took the AfroAmerican society from segregation to equal political rights.This does not mean that this documentary is a bad film quite the opposite. The model of the Woodstock documentary is pretty well learned and followed and we do feel the atmosphere of the day. The shots from the life in the black neighborhood of America are well chosen and give documentary value to the movie. Pryor's monologues are fun kind of a standup show avantlalettre best in dealing with the realities of life in black America from a humorist perspective. Some of the other interviews seem a little artificial part of the guys talk like Jesse Lackson the politician while Jesse Jackson himself looks more natural as he had not become a politician yet.Music is of course supposed to be the big prize of such a film. I felt somehow disappointed not only because of the too many missing names who could have joined such a show but also because the concert does not seem to have been in the focus of Mel Stuart when he made the film he lets us guess too many times who are the singers or maybe relies on a familiarity with the faces that went lost in 35 years and some songs are cut in the middle for some more spoken words. Music could have made a better case even on the social issues if it was let to have more of its saying.".

It is a political sociological cultural and also a sporting document of the greatest footballer who ever lived on this planet. It is like Kusturica movies exuberant and full of life. It is sad funny exciting and controversial.Geroge Bush whom Maradona refers to as murderer is definitely not one of his favorite people. He greatly admires Fidel Castro  Hugo Chavez with both of whom he is shown with in friendly conversations. When asked about his famous goal against England in the 1986 World Cup named Goal of The Century by FIFA he explains that he was motivated by revenge for the Argentinian soldiers killed in the Falklands War by the British. He feels that his ban for doping in the world cup was politically motivated and he likens Havelange  Blatter respective FIFA presidents as The Arms Dealer and Bullet Seller respectively!Maradona is philosophical about his cocaine addiction and full of regret that he could have offered so much more to the football world. The footage of his exploits on the playing field from when he was a kid to his world cup triumph are truly dazzling no matter how many times you may have seen them before. The movie is full of touching moments especially those concerning his marriage and his family and friends. Kusturica is clearly a big admirer of his subject and Maradona also seems to be completely at ease with him. Whether you like Maradona as a person or not  after seeing this movie you can not deny that he was a footballing genius and you are also very likely to be moved by his life story. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Born and raised in Brazil and like everybody else here I was taught to say Pel is better than Maradona even before they taught me how to walk or wipe myself. As I grew older I kept believing this was true. But the more I got to know both men the more I thought this was probably applied only to football skills  Pel kept giving me reasons to believe he was the perfect moron while Maradona's subversive stance on everything found sympathy on anybody in South America more or less haunted by our CIAsponsored anticommunist military dictatorships. Even on my early years as a notsosubversive toddler I knew there was something wrong about Pel's easygoing attitude towards the establishment.Not only that but coming from a family which dealt with addiction for generations I learned very early that Garrincha was by far a better player than Pel. Brazilian media and FIFA can keep ignoring Garrincha because he was never the Mr. Nice Guy Pel pretended to be but one just has to watch how Garrincha made 2 players on the other team sit on the pitch without even touching the ball probably one of the best moments on the World Sport's history.Unlike many of my fellow countrymen and women my family didn't think one's accomplishments should be overshadowed by his or her tendency to abuse psychoactive substances. Nevertheless I just couldn't ignore what Pel did on the playing field  even though Maradona Garrincha and probably the 2 Ronaldos were actually a lot more magical.But I digress.This was the first Kusturica movie I've ever seen and I was surprised to find out the auteur's got such a faithful audience like others I've had the pleasure to know  like Trier and Tarantino yes you heard me. I guess my ignorance towards Kusturica was probably a good thing since I've been reading here many of his disappointed fans complaining that ironically enough he was too much of a fan boy on MaradonaKusturica.I'm not so stupid as to think that socialism is the root of all evil. South America lacks true heroes so I love when Cinema gives me and others the opportunity to know more about the life stories of such controversial people like Fidel Che and Maradona.I just couldn't stop watching this movie ingenuously hoping the final takes would give me some extremelyneeded closure to the big mess that was Diego's life. As most of the greatest movies ever  and Dogville comes to mind  you never get closure. You go out with a lot more doubts than certainties. And that's a good thing. In my humble opinion feelgood movies are no different than cocaine. They shouldn't be called movies for starters. They're a drug made to make you numb and feeling good about yourself. That's not what the Art of Cinema is about for me. I don't want to feel good about a movie. I want to feel challenged. I want to have my brain building new synapses no matter how painful might the process be.MaradonaKusturica did that for me. Surprisingly enough as much unlikely I thought it would be I ended up getting what goes on on the minds of those wackos at the Church of Maradona. I understand now and I admire them  this is the kind of rupture of a concept that amazes me pretty much as Hooligans2005 made me see through the vandalism and admire those poor guys whom at least found strength to believe in something.Maradona is not a genius outside the playing field. He's just a guy. A very real guy that does good things and bad things like anyone else. Not even the pope gets to be nicknamed The God nevertheless Diego does his best to cope with such a fanatic crowd everywhere his visit to Naples was outofthis world.Many people will just ignore this movie because it is likely to praise the deeds of a cocaine addict. The kind of people that thinks that cocaine abuse or any other drug for that matter should remain as taboo should keep watching Titanic or Desperate Housewives. As my dentist once said you should keep touching the wound instead of trying everything to pretend it's not there.I sympathise with people that screw up because I feel they no longer wear their masks. One could think Maradona was just a selfish bastard after all. A guy who cared for nothing else than just putting more snow on his nostrils. Funny. You get to see how his daughters even though carrying a lot of grief love him and like many people also think he's their god.Pel FIFA's Mr. Nice Guy in the other hand... Married an underage girl barely used his fame to help not even Brazil's football institutions let alone the country as a whole. Later on he could come and tell that 1970's World Cup was a gift to the Brazilian people so we could have at least a little bit of happiness through all that was going on. But that doesn't change the fact that bringing Jules Rimet Trophy home helped the dictatorial government ease the alwaysgrowing social instability. Neither that he shook hands and will keep shaking with every and each man in power because after all it's so much easy than thinking about your symbolic role for a nation's populace.I pity for Edinho  the King Pel's imprisoned and addicted son. If only his father had been more of a moron like Maradona was he could be the one jumping on a stage and singing how his father was a god.Oh and about football and movies... I can only hope that Kusturica ever gets to love Garrincha as much as he loves Diego and decides to make a movie about him. That guy's certainly worth the title of Wizard of the Ball.".

	schema:reviewBody "6to Festival International de Cine Contemporaneo de la Ciudad de Mexico Maradona by Kusturica Emir Kusturica 2008 230209 Two days ago was the first Saturday of FICCO and a free screening was programmed at the Zocalo of Mexico City Maradona by Kusturica. I saw this film for the very first time on DVD exactly the same Saturday in which I saw Steven Soderbergh's The Argentine so that day I had a revolutionary Saturday with two Argentineans and with Fidel Castro in both films. Last Saturday I went to the Zocalo it was a really good number of people in the audience and for sure some persons wearing Maradona shirts. I love football and if you ask me who is the greatest football player of all time you will not hear Pele or any other name either you hear Diego or Maradona or Pelusa or simply God. And that's a fact and sure Pele is the king but Maradona is God and sure there are many people that are antiMaradona but I doubt if those haters can stop looking at Diego playing. So I saw for the first time a film standing in the Zocalo and of the FICCO and I'm very very glad I came I knew the film certainly and it was great to watch it on a big screen it was great just to watch it again. When I first saw it back in January of course I knew pretty much everything about Maradona certainly you don't have to know a lot about Diego to enjoy this film but for fans this is just a mustsee. The God the Bad and the Ugly unforgettable and wonderful score we hear part of the main theme Emir Kusturica  The No Smoking Orchestra I really liked Super 8 Stories recommend also played and there Emir was introduced as the Maradona of cinema later on Kusturica will mention both Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah for him at the time when he meet Maradona this looked like a character from a Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah film or like from the Mexican Revolution almost impossible to think that he played football like God. Here we have a recovered Maradona talking about his drug addiction about his regrets about those birthdays in which he was not with his daughters Dalma and Giannina about the player that he could have been if only he had stayed out of the drugs about the player that we all lose. Probably the most touching and memorable moment of this film is when Diego sings what for me is the very best of the songs composed to him the song by Rodrigo the song La mano de Dios. Here Maradona sings it in first person and at one point during the performance he ask to his daughters to join him that moment is really memorable after the worst Diego was finally there to enjoy his family. We can hear other of those Maradona songs we see here Manu Chao another memorable part and we can hear the song Para Siempre Diego at a bar a bar that functions as sponsor or something like that for the Iglesia Maradoniana the Maradonian Church. The stuff with the members of the Maradonian Church is simply fantastic I knew about its existence yet this was the first time I actually saw stuff of the Maradonian Church if you get married by that church you have to add the name Diego to your name and not only the husband but also the wife! And their Lord's Prayer! A lot of fun and certainly just a proof of that infinite love to Diego. As I guess you know unlike Pele Maradona does played for European teams he played for one of the greatest teams not only of Spain but of the world FC Barcelona and for sure he had great games here Maradona travels to Belgrade he meet Kusturica's son is really fantastic when Kusturica's son says something like I never wear a shirt before but today I'm going to meet God and more familiars of Emir including his wife and his grandson who for Maradona has legs of a football player. Will be certainly unforgettable for Emir the fact that Maradona was the last person who spoke with his mother before she passed away. Also during this trip Emir takes Diego to the Stadion Crvena Zvezda home of the football club Red Star Belgrade certainly that footballrelated stuff can't missed but is very special since Kusturica suffered a really great goal of Maradona while he was playing for FC Barcelona and here Kusturica indicates to Diego to which goal he shoot that day also Kusturica show us his abilities to dominate the ball he is pretty good actually but nothing like those from his times in Italy in the South of Italy in Napoles. The only way to defeat a great power football and Argentina won that football war against England in 1986 and a team from the South of Italy came to not only defeat but to humiliate a Northern team when Maradona leaded Napoli but certainly not only that 2 Scudettos the first one was not only the first Scudetto for Napoli but also for any Southern team 1 Coppa Italia 1 Suppercoppa Italiana and the first major European title the UEFA Cup. Here we can the return of Maradona to Napoles and you can imagine the people there's only one thing to do when Maradona is present and here we can how even Hugo Chavez jumps and stuff. Stop Bush says a tshirt of Diego the Sex Pistol of football and yes Sex Pistols' music is here only one song God Save the Queen and we hear it each time we are just mesmerized by the playing of Diego all certainly lead us to the masterpiece of Diego the goal of the century. I think even the British has to celebrate.".

When I first saw it back in January of course I knew pretty much everything about Maradona certainly you don't have to know a lot about Diego to enjoy this film but for fans this is just a mustsee. The God the Bad and the Ugly unforgettable and wonderful score we hear part of the main theme Emir Kusturica  The No Smoking Orchestra I really liked Super 8 Stories recommend also played and there Emir was introduced as the Maradona of cinema later on Kusturica will mention both Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah for him at the time when he meet Maradona this looked like a character from a Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah film or like from the Mexican Revolution almost impossible to think that he played football like God. Here we have a recovered Maradona talking about his drug addiction about his regrets about those birthdays in which he was not with his daughters Dalma and Giannina about the player that he could have been if only he had stayed out of the drugs about the player that we all lose. Probably the most touching and memorable moment of this film is when Diego sings what for me is the very best of the songs composed to him the song by Rodrigo the song La mano de Dios. Here Maradona sings it in first person and at one point during the performance he ask to his daughters to join him that moment is really memorable after the worst Diego was finally there to enjoy his family. We can hear other of those Maradona songs we see here Manu Chao another memorable part and we can hear the song Para Siempre Diego at a bar a bar that functions as sponsor or something like that for the Iglesia Maradoniana the Maradonian Church. The stuff with the members of the Maradonian Church is simply fantastic I knew about its existence yet this was the first time I actually saw stuff of the Maradonian Church if you get married by that church you have to add the name Diego to your name and not only the husband but also the wife! And their Lord's Prayer! A lot of fun and certainly just a proof of that infinite love to Diego. As I guess you know unlike Pele Maradona does played for European teams he played for one of the greatest teams not only of Spain but of the world FC Barcelona and for sure he had great games here Maradona travels to Belgrade he meet Kusturica's son is really fantastic when Kusturica's son says something like I never wear a shirt before but today I'm going to meet God and more familiars of Emir including his wife and his grandson who for Maradona has legs of a football player. Will be certainly unforgettable for Emir the fact that Maradona was the last person who spoke with his mother before she passed away. Also during this trip Emir takes Diego to the Stadion Crvena Zvezda home of the football club Red Star Belgrade certainly that footballrelated stuff can't missed but is very special since Kusturica suffered a really great goal of Maradona while he was playing for FC Barcelona and here Kusturica indicates to Diego to which goal he shoot that day also Kusturica show us his abilities to dominate the ball he is pretty good actually but nothing like those from his times in Italy in the South of Italy in Napoles. The only way to defeat a great power football and Argentina won that football war against England in 1986 and a team from the South of Italy came to not only defeat but to humiliate a Northern team when Maradona leaded Napoli but certainly not only that 2 Scudettos the first one was not only the first Scudetto for Napoli but also for any Southern team 1 Coppa Italia 1 Suppercoppa Italiana and the first major European title the UEFA Cup. Here we can the return of Maradona to Napoles and you can imagine the people there's only one thing to do when Maradona is present and here we can how even Hugo Chavez jumps and stuff. Stop Bush says a tshirt of Diego the Sex Pistol of football and yes Sex Pistols' music is here only one song God Save the Queen and we hear it each time we are just mesmerized by the playing of Diego all certainly lead us to the masterpiece of Diego the goal of the century. I think even the British has to celebrate.";

After all the 'El Magnifico' Pele never scored a goal like that. But you can't not be drawn from Maradona's skill but also verbal skill off the ball managing to also draw in the viewerlistener. From his dalliances in drugs incidentally blaming America for the drugs problem not the Colombian mafia for the USA consumertype market for the stuff coupled with his meeting and loving it with Fidel Castro this is an amazing insight into an amazing man. Candidly also reflecting many times on politics his hatred of George Bush refusing to seeshake hands with Prince Charles claiming he had 'blood on his hands' over the Falklands war. Indeed many of the Scottish fans who admired him were simply pleased at 'the hand of God' because England is Scotland's 'old enemy' too. Whether the Scottish regiments in the British army would support that over the Falklands War is a matter of conjecture. But Maradona along with his skill on the ball has an equally infectious personality making this an extraordinary programme but you're left thinking no not really this is what we DO expect from the man. An intensely watchable unmissable film not just about a footballer but a polished personality. One thing I didn't get was why The Sex Pistols' 'God Save the Queen' was played. It seemed to be used in the animation showing the royal familyBrits being taken the p out of. Mind you I didn't mind really I am a fan of the Pistols! I'd seriously like to meet this man. Not to challenge him but you can't help admire his honesty. Still I'm glad the Germans knocked Argentina out of the 2010 World Cup even though they were one of my teams I most liked watching  it seemed to cap Maradona's bragging before he gets out of hand a bit!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I hated this in every way. I'll be honest I hadn't heard of Kusturica before seeing it but I've since learned he's regarded as a genius in filmmaking.Even though Maradona is a cheating egotistical little fool there's no escaping the fact that he's a colourful individual and was one hell of a footballer.However I learned very little more than I already knew about him. Everything was done so obviously on Maradona's terms. It was nothing more than an arty Maradona lovein. He hates the USA he hates Britain he loves Castro he loved cocaine he played a good game of football. That much we did learn. However I and anyone else who follows football already knew that. But let's not forget he cheated time and time again. Whilst he comes across as remorseful for the effect him doing drugs had on his family he clearly sees himself as a victim for the effect it had on his career. The man was a professional sportsman an idol and role model for millions around the world yet he's bitter and feels harddoneby about the fact that he was one of those to get caught out.Any cheating on the pitch namely the infamous 'Hand of God' against England was portrayed as no more than a schoolboy prank he got away with. How did Maradona get away with it? According to Maradona it was because of God further proof of Maradona's deluded mind! Then frequently during the film Kusturica depicts the second goal in the same game reputedly the best goal ever scored as some sort of political comment on the Falklands War with a cartoon Maradona slaying Prince Charles the Queen and Margaret Thatcher to name a few. Sorry but whilst the goal was a stroke of genius it was no political comment it's just convenient to suggest it was.A footballer surely doesn't justify such an arty piece of filmmaking. If a filmmaker's intention is to profile a footballer then surely a chronological study from the start to present day is what's needed not philosophical ramblings over what made him what he iswas. If these ramblings taught us anything then fine but they didn't. He wasn't a revolutionary although he clearly believes he is he wasn't the great ruler of a nation I'm sure he believes he's this too. He was a footballer and a cheat. A brilliant footballer yes and arguably the best to have ever lived and his life off the pitch is thought to be equally as if not more so fascinating as his life on it. That's why I'm so frustrated to have learnt so little from this. I wanted to hear him discuss in greater detail his humble beginnings his rise through the ranks in footballing terms his experiences with drugs more details around his time at Barcelona and Napoli etc. The lack of facts and the general sycophantic tone that shrouded the whole film left me none the wiser and even less enamoured by Maradona than I was to begin with.It's amazing and again very odd to see just how revered he is in Argentina but I wished the film would have stopped dwelling on the fact and get on with some steadfast facts on the man himself. I don't wish to see some weird looking Argentine couple supposedly getting married at the church of Maradona nor do I want to see Maradona singing a song presumably about himself for what seemed like an eternity. This was just further evidence of his God complex. I found both these scenes to be really peculiar.Aside from it being mindnumbingly dull I found the whole thing a bit sinister really. Kusturica especially so. His voiceover was horrible his bedraggled appearance horrible and then you get him fawning all over the supposed great man.Maradona's autobiography El Diego whilst interesting at times was like reading a true Rock 'N' Roller's autobiography without any mention of the sex drugs and excesses that go with it. Whilst a different approach was taken here it was by no means a more interesting one.Total garbage.".

Van Looy's greatest accomplishment is avoiding the sin most of the movies in this genre make neglect the characters. Without losing pace we manage to really get to know the pawns in our chess game and as each one's motivations start to sink in even the most unlikely become suspect.We see here assembled a who's who of Belgian stars the dream team cast even the smaller roles are given to top class actors Jan Decleir. The film's lighter on it's feet than Van Looy's previous we on first sight get to deal with far less tortured souls which makes some room for humorous intervals I fear a lot of these will get lost in translation.As in all stories but even more so in plotdriven thrillers the end's the most important part. It delights me that they didn't choose a ridiculous nonsensical ending as so much postmodern thrillers shamelessly do these days. I can't give anything away of course but I for one didn't see it coming at all and yet it adds up when you replay previous scenes in your head.Go see it it merits national and international attention.".

Then include the wives and the mistresses it's a real challenge to think who DID it.Apart from that and without giving out any clues it's so well acted and the LOFT where most of the scenes are shot feels like a tremendous dangerous being. The LOFT has an extra role in this movie believe me.This movie as a good friend told me is not The Usual Suspects but it's close... very close. I thought about this a lot and then I think of course it is not the Usual Suspects nobody wants a remake of that movie.Loft is different but you will like the characters not one second bores you except maybe the knife combat which takes a bit too long.I especially enjoyed the Dsseldorf bar and the Casino scene. Great cinematography.For people who enjoyed this I recommend the movie Shades with Mickey Rourke I preferred this one a lot more than The Alzheimer Affair. But then that's me...".

Luckily giant relief soon replaced my skeptic approach. Hollywoodstyle? Yes but not an inferior copy. One of the first scenes bring to mind the opening sequence of 'Inside Man' a man dead on his feet grilled by two unrelenting policemen he stammers a fogy story a story that makes less and less sense with each new sentence uttered the intrigues spreads through the audience let the games begin!The gorgeous stylized look captured my attention immediately cinematographically 'Loft' without a doubt means a new high for production values in Belgian cinema. The exploration of the murdersite with the camera's eye not during the initial discovery of the dead body but a handful of minutes later astonishes impossible angles a sensually swinging camera death and sex captured in a few seconds of film. The cool modern design of the loft and just the fact that we're dealing with a loft here symbolizes the decadence of which every character's guilty of beautifully and the coldness buried in most of the characters. Predictability can rapidly transform a promising thriller with tons of Ascenes to a Bfilm beyond redemption the antimetamorphosis of the butterfly from neargodly winged creature back to fat caterpillar. Predictabillity and plot randomness. what I like to name 'the Perfect Stranger phenomenon arrange for multiple plausible endings as a result of the vagueness of the plot and then choose the one that test audiences prefer. 'Loft' is neither! The script is sly en never insults the audience's intelligence. You can see head writer De Pauw spent a lot of time perfecting a diamond in the rough into a three carat one. I personally prefer this more minimalistic less locations less movement in the scenes more plotdriven film over Van Looy's previous. But naturally this is anything but an insult for 'The Memory of a Killer'. Now let's get to the acting department. There's loads to admire on the silver screen Filip Peeters gets the most substance to chew on Bruno Vanden Broucke descends deep into his character one that heavily contrasts with his usual type of character only Koen De Bouw pales in comparison to his performance in 'The Memory of a Killer'. Again this is not an insult that performance easily ranks among the best of 2003. The part of Filip Willems played Matthias Schoenaerts interested me the least but his presence is unavoidable for the plot. Now the small shortage of psychological depth is a minor blemish certainly because the believability of the plot exists only by the strength of the believability of the characters' motivations. A few extra scenes possibly could be of use to solve this problem but more than likely would mean a loss of some tension.My heart rate went up adrenaline pumping and those icy looks of Bruno Vanden Broucke will not soon fade from memory...".

First of all this thriller has an ingenious plot that keeps you on the tip of your seat from beginning to end. Considerable value is added by the play of an impressive number of Belgium's greatest actors and actresses. 'Loft's picturing is adequate at least too supporting its plot rightly by creating a tense mood.Also pretty characteristic for this film is its very Belgian pace. Relaxed and unhurried it allows you a fair amount of time to follow all its twists  turns.The 100 Belgian 'Loft' no doubt will rank among the great films from the Low Countries. It certainly stands out in all their releases from the last ten years.".

He decided to convert the loft on the roof of the structure as a bachelor pad for himself and his pals so they can have their fun in complete privacy. To that effect when he gathers the men he distributes one key to each one there are no duplicates so each person is responsible for his own key which they must never give away or even lend to anyone else.This exclusive sort of club includes Stevens and his yuppie comrades. Only one of the friends is a bachelor but that soon will change when he marries a wealthy heiress. The men are all married although not too happily as it turns out. The friendship among all these men are put to a test when a woman is found dead on the huge bed that dominates the apartment. All of them are in some way connected. The truth about the slaying comes out as all the men are questioned by the police. Anyone of this group could have committed the crime yet nothing is clear in the narrative until the surprise ending.Eric Von Looy the director of Loft has explored the kind of people at the center of the film before with his Yuppies. This new venture proves Mr. Von Looy is a director with a great visual style in the way he presents the story about loyalty and betrayal. This film should be seen by a wider audience. We were lucky to have found a copy of this Belgian film but we don't think it had a commercial run that we know of.The director gets great acting from all the principals Koen De Bouw Filip Peeters Matthias Schoenaerts Bruno Vanden Broucken and Koen De Graeve are all excellent as the friends that share the loft. Veerle Baetens is fine as well as Ann. Marie Vinck who plays Sarah Delporte impressed with her take on her character.Of course Mr. Von Looy was lucky in working with the fine Danny Elsen a good cameraman that captures all the nuances of the action in vivid detail. Wolfman De Marco's contributed the soundtrack that plays well with the narrative. We shall be looking forward the next project of this talented director and so will be the lucky viewers of his films.".

And let's not forget about the wonderful screenplay written down by Bart De Pauw to whom i've been a fan of since Buiten de Zone.Everyone already knows the setting of 'Loft'... 5 guys share a loft to bring their mistresses to without their wives knowing. But like all happy songs this doesn't last long. Pop quiz hotshot what would you do if you find a dead woman in the loft one morning ?? What would you do ?I'm not giving anything away about this movie cause this would ruin the experience... but I'll just say that you will be amazed about the ingenious plot turns that this movie takes... you think one think it goes another way  etc.The reminds very much of The Usual Suspects in a way and it deserves this praise!Of course for Belgian standards this is top of the line cinema. You cannot go any better than this. Overall it's a lot better than Erik Van Looy's previous movie  'De Zaak Alzheimer' although here you don't have the acting one man show that 'Jan Decleir' gave in that one.Matthias Schoenaerts and Bruno Vanden Broucke show their talent in this one as does Filip Peeters.If go for International standards this is still one of the better movies that you can go see in the theater. But for it to be totally perfect it does has some flaws.. which are realism.. some things happen so fast that don't think it's realistic anymore. Sometimes the acting is a bit off but that negligible...Overall this is a great a movie and hope it will make the trip abroad to the states or what not so it can be acknowledged by everyone !!Best regardsRaf".

This is the most acclaimed both publicly and critically movie ever to be made in my home country Belgium and it instantly broke all historical box office records over here. I don't really have a valid excuse for waiting so long perhaps didn't want to jump into the momentarily hype? but I'm glad to announce that Loft is a solid and suspenseful thriller that can easily compete with the large foreign offer of similar movies. The film deals with typical Hollywood themes adultery murder conspiracy theories and implements the contemporary popular narrative structure of flashbacks and messed up continuity but luckily enough the atmosphere and character drawings remain oldfashioned Flemish. Under the influence of the sleazy architect Vince five men in their late 30's and with a typical yuppie mentality secretly share a luxurious loft in the center of Antwerp where they can go with their mistresses andor prostitutes without having to explain hotel bills and Visa expenses to their wives. When one of them stumbles upon the barbarically butchered corpse of a young girl in the morning they gather together in the loft to discuss the situation. There are only five keys to the apartment and the doors where locked when they discovered the girl so logically speaking one of them has to be the culprit. Through a series of flashbacks and deeper character elaborations the script illustrates that the five perhaps aren't the loyal and close friends than they might think and that their lies unfaithfulness and deception will finally bring them down. The scenario spawn from the creative and versatile mind of Bart De Pauw practically unfolds like a mystery thriller with Giallo allures. The plot grows increasingly convoluted with each flashback and each new red herring and just when you think all the revelations are made there's another new and unpredictable plot twist. The final twist is perhaps even one too many but then still the events remains plausible and very wellwritten. Numerous sequences in Loft are very powerful and display a genuine sense of craftsmanship. The roughly edited and fast paced sequence inside the casino where all protagonists are gathered not only with their wives but also with their mistresses and personal opponents is nailbitingly tense and atmospheric. Some of the characters are stereotypical like the lightly inflammable badboy Filip and the nerdy Luc but those aren't obstacles. Despite of the easily exploitative themes the amount of gratuitous sex and explicit violence is kept low in favor of suspensebuilding and intrigue. This is particularly praiseworthy for a Belgian film rest assured.".

	schema:reviewBody "My friend from Belgium recommended this movie back in November 2008. And now one year later I have finally seen this Belgian movie entitled Loft. I do not know any of the cast but she mentioned that these are some of Belgium's greatest actors and that was enough for me.Loft tells the story of five male friends who each have a key to plush penthouse loft in a snazzy apartment complex. They use this loft to consummate illicit romantic affairs away from the prying eyes of their wives. But one day their neat little arrangement gets a wrench thrown into it. A dead girl was found handcuffed to the bed one night. So the movie delves into the coverups lurid secrets and doublecrossing that are revealed as the friends try to extricate themselves from their tight situation.The look of the movie is very stylish very Hollywoodlike. This is the same loft we see in American movies like Sliver or Basic Instinct. Same is true with the editing music and cinematography. However I felt that the scriptwriter tended to overreach towards the ending. The plot could have already ended neatly but still he decided to push for another one making matters too convoluted.Overall this movie is good to watch exciting and tense as it went along. But do not try to analyze too much watching it as this would cause you to discover a lot of questions about the plot and its various holes especially when it comes to the sequence of events.".

Here Each character can have several motives but not necessarily those you may think the film will have you in its grip the whole time as you will keep guessing and of course most of your guesses won't come true!As in many other murder mysteries one of the themes here is that NO ONE can be trusted. Another is that nothing is absolute. It may even remind you of Rashomon in a wayI especially enjoyed the lighting and set locations and I won't forget Flip's naughty looks at his wedding when he is presented with his key! if I am not mistaken he's the one that says now we must look for someone to take to the loft!the film has a welldeveloped plot. Every piece of it seems to fit into the other well but by this I don't mean that we can't find holes. with all those short cuts The film moves so fast that at some points you may not even have the time to think about the plot itself!! and maybe that's one of the reasons that most of the viewers praise the plot. In fact it has so many details that a week after watching the film you will probably forget half of them and what you will remember of it is the feeling of thrill that made you enjoy it. Now that I think about it I understand how those friends lost trust in each other but I don't know why they trusted each other in the first place!And I should also admit that the ending did not satisfy me as it did not match the dynamic plot of the film But overall I enjoyed the film and look forward to learning more about Belgian cinema".

	schema:headline " WellCrafted But Weakened By Its Own Premise";
	schema:reviewBody "Late one evening in a quiet corner of a Brussels suburb a body suddenly plummets from the top of a residential tower block onto the roof of a parked car below. Earlier that same day five friends sharing a loft apartment for their extramarital conquests discover the bloodstained body of a woman sprawled across the bed where the affairs take place. Is one of them responsible or are they being framed by a jealous lover? So begins 'Loft' an exploration into the uglier side of sex and the psyche. It is as much a commentary on male attitudes to infidelity as it is a murder mystery where the joys of conquest reign over reason and consideration for anything other than animal lust. While the championed phrase 'It didn't mean anything' is employed as the clichd band aid over the wound of trust the five protagonists who cling to it are not equal in their desires for inconstancy. When architect Vincent Stevens hands his four friends the keys to the sky parlor through which they may indulge themselves in secret it is here that the unraveling truly begins and we discover whose declarations end at posturing bravado and who truly believes that adultery is an honest acceptance of male desires.All of which give 'Loft' its light and shade. With the story told out of sequence we flit back and forth across the lives of the five men the choices they made leading to their current predicament and the way in which they deluded themselves so as to justify their actions. The placing of the murder inquiry in the precredits teaser makes it clear that the slaves of lustful extracurricular activity cannot escape their fate but the real intrigue lies in precisely how the drama plays out and whether or not the man sitting in the interrogation room really deserves to be there. The outofsequence intersections spanning several months add layers of deceit  both within the group not so tightlyknit as they try to believe and to all who come within their orbit. The grotesque parody of civilization held together by expensive suits and champagne cannot disguise the descent into carnal imprisonment.Indeed if grotesquerie is ultimately the point of the film then 'Loft' succeeds with flying colours for I found myself struggling to sympathise let alone care about any of the poor fools and the fact that their clandestine infidelity had at last come to haunt them. I certainly can't fault a single character on the grounds that he is depicted unrealistically for the overconfident Lotharios before the camera will easily remind any viewer of the expert seducers we've all met at some point whose undisputed skill at drawing women to them like moths to a flame is matched only by their deep vainglorious neglect of empathy. If redemption is on the cards 'Loft' is not concerned with winning the audience over to their side and in the end this is my biggest problem with it  not a desire for some tired shoehorned play for morality before the end credits as Hollywood typically insists so as to keep the audience's fantasy of human virtue intact but simply the fact that in human drama a cast of unlikable characters is the true act of murder for the audience their empathy dead and buried for the duration of a film that demands two hours of attention.Doubtless there are many fans of the modern crime thriller who revel in the selfdestructive antihero seeing him or her as the truly honest figure driven to be nothing more than earnestly human in an uncompromising world. The fun lies in watching their raw emotion explode onto the screen in a celebration of chaos and drama. Perhaps 'Loft' has simply failed to bring out the best of this premise. I admit to not being a devotee of crime fiction and my Tarantino is rusty.There is still the mystery element however and in that arena 'Loft' is compelling. As we peel the layers from our five antiheroes so the plot shifts and twists as expertly as the men themselves wriggle through their doublelives. Revelation follows revelation and the final sequence is almost amusingly that last desperate attempt to redeem those still battling their consciences. Remorse sails in like a charging cavalry whose alarm clocks failed to sound on time. It feels tacked on as a last desperate twist yet given what carnal descent into hell writer Bart de Pauw has presented beforehand better to let the film remain in that melancholy storm of Dante's second circle where it can at least stand with its own selfprescribed dignity.Of director Erik Van Looy I would praise his creation of a suitably dark and forebodinglylit story. The cold light of day has no place here and Looy confines his characters to the shadowy realms in which they belong and yet one of the standout scenes takes place at a daytime wedding where the men's egos are in full flight. He also chooses a fine cast from the confident presence of Filip Peeters as suave seducer Vincent Stevens to Bruno Vanden Broucke as the nervous Luc Seynaeve  Broucke creating within him a man whose face tells far more than his lips will. Wolfram de Marco's tense soundtrack reminded me in places of Hans Zimmer's score for 'The Ring' punctuated by earnest strings and softened by echoing piano never overused but doing much to set the tone.This then is 'Loft' a shadowy discourse on what happens when one succumbs to their desires and the way in which one lie compounds another. Within all bright lights are diffuse leaving only shades of grey misery clawing desperately at excuses and no real victors. In amidst this gallery of the fallen stands the film itself aiming high in terms of plot twist and drama but sinking slowly through the ground for failing to engage the viewer on the most fundamental level empathy.".

Don't read the summary of the film at IMDb as it gives away a bit too much. Actually you should never read the summary of a film 'cause they always give away too much.Even though I don't understand the language in the film the actors manage to convince me and entertain me. The female lead character Veerle Baetens is especially enchanting. I first got a glimpse of her in another great film called The Broken Circle Breakdown where she was equally electrifying. Matthias Schoenaerts is perfect as a simple brute a role which he has to some extent repeated in other films like Bullhead and Rust and Bone.The Loft is shot beautifully with lots of different lenses crane cameras and lighted in a way that underlines the tension and the feelings of the actors.I had a good time watching this one and I believe you will too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Low Bottom Feeder final sequel to the Herbie the Love Bug series the Spanish version albeit. This was playing on Turner Classic Movies channel yesterday and I still can't figure out how it got on there in the first place. Certainly not a classic but the exact opposite total bomb. Even the title is stupidthe car goes bananas in every movie it's in however there is a scene in which Herbie is covered in bananas but it takes place near the end of the movie and lasts about 5 minutes. The plot involves a very irritating young Mexican boy bumbling crooks a desperate pathetic Helen Roper type love starved slut played by Cloris Leachman and her niece a goofy ships captain and two young typical guys who want to race the car. The young Mexican boy befriends Herbie who by the way never gets called Herbie except for one time in the beginning of the movie. The cars number is 53 so of course in Spanish 53 always means 53 stupid. Now we have the very irritating boy yelling ochoSpanish for 8 at least 200 times in the movie. Come on ocho  ocho ocho. Good god I wanted to sew his lips shut. They race around the world on cruise ships and through ghetto South America  with Cloris Leachman trying to get into Harvey Korman's pants in these stupid subplot scenes which have nothing to do with the main plot of the movie and this is a Disney flick?. It gets even worse why do some people think the bull fighting scene is funny etc it's very stupid with the car holding a cape in its hood and driving around backwards with the bull chasing it meanwhile the people inside yell and scream and the kid yells toro ocho toro ocho  how can i keep watching. The kid also plays taxi driver and becomes the race car driver too  oh sure yeah disney was on something for this movie most kids i watched it with when i was young were probably bored. In the end  a very bad irritating finale to the series. Harvey Korman is wasted in a role so beneath him its sick he is like a stupid Captain Stubing love boat style with the worst most unfunny dialogthe writers should have been shot for the preschool humor the rest of the cast chews scenery and the stupid horny Cloris Leachman overacting every time she looks Kormans way as if she thinks Korman would want anything to do with her gross comeons. I've never liked her in anything shes been in shes a terrible actress how she won awards who knows. After the final scene we get treated to a very syrupy irritating ending song about friendship complete with a Spanish word thrown in every few verses like i bet you a banana maana charro amigo etc. Is this Spanglish? Oh and did i mention the above bananas are also sold by the kid to passersby yeah id like to buy bananas that were touching a smelly rusty car and the fact they drove 600 miles in the hot sun with the bananas on the outside of the car. these little subscenes added no doubt to amuse small children and annoy parents. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to turn your kids into numb minded dregs. Of course this may keep your 3 yo amused for ten minutes while you run to the video store to shoot the owners for carrying this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Low Bottom Feeder final sequel to the Herbie the Love Bug series the Spanish version albeit. This was playing on Turner Classic Movies channel yesterday and I still can't figure out how it got on there in the first place. Certainly not a classic but the exact opposite total bomb. Even the title is stupidthe car goes bananas in every movie it's in however there is a scene in which Herbie is covered in bananas but it takes place near the end of the movie and lasts about 5 minutes. The plot involves a very irritating young Mexican boy bumbling crooks a desperate pathetic Helen Roper type love starved slut played by Cloris Leachman and her niece a goofy ships captain and two young typical guys who want to race the car. The young Mexican boy befriends Herbie who by the way never gets called Herbie except for one time in the beginning of the movie. The cars number is 53 so of course in Spanish 53 always means 53 stupid. Now we have the very irritating boy yelling ochoSpanish for 8 at least 200 times in the movie. Come on ocho  ocho ocho.

I thought there should have been a story where Douglas and Applegate continue on their racing quest to a country like Germany or Italy. These writers probably thought that the racing idea was too tiring to be used anymore. I did read on some site that Dean Jones did read the actual script for the Bananas movie. He said no because of the story's new twist itself. I can't blame him for that. Even if he was in that storyline the movie might have been a bit better but still the worse. If the movie was about racing again then Jones returns but probably not as good as Monte Carlo. Instead new story with new characters that made no sense. Therefore this is where the movie went wrong. This is also where the movie had the twist of fate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amusing and funny following with the Wolkswagen Love Bug racing the tracks and going to South America . Love Bug's outing in which Herbie one again doing antics  it is full of pranks and car stunts that are great fun to see . Herbie goes bananas 1980  or Herbie Torero by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman  among others results to be an agreeable though inferior Disney's love bug Wolkswagen plenty of action  slapdash  laughs and entertainment .Pete Stancheck Stephen Burns inherits from his Uncle Jim Douglas a race car being stored in Puerto Vallarta. With his friend Davy Johns Charles Martin Smith accompanying him to Pete is dismayed to learn that the car is an older model Volkswagen Beetle. But when Pete and his friend watch what the car can do and learn that it somewhat has a mind of its own they decide to enter it into the Brazil Grand Prize formula one race. The adorable little VW helps its owners break up a counterfeiting ring in Mexico. The road to Rio has never been bumpier  as en route to Rio De Janeiro Herbie gets the two friends have one problem after another as it attempts to help its new friend a streetwise orphan named Paco Garay . Meanwhile  at a boat Pete fall in love for Melissa Elyssa Davalos and all of them are pursued by a trio of villains John Vernon  Alex Rocco  Richard Jaeckel .Herbie goes bananas is a delightful Disney comedy that displays great loads of amusement  fantastic cars antics  slapstick  fun  giggles  chases are great fun to watch and being pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps carried out by Herbie . In the sequence where Herbie walks the plank a real Volkswagen Beetle was cast out into the sea  however it was never recovered. Herbie The Love Bug was a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle deluxe ragtop sedan painted in Volkswagen L87 pearl white. Under normal circumstances the interior would be a matching white. However Herbie's interior was painted a special nonreflective grey color so the camera and studio lights would not reflect . The actors seem to enjoy immensely  as Charles Martin Smith and Harvey Korman as a silly captain play of sympathetic manner and the meanspirited villains performed by John Vernon  Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel are top notch . Colorful cinematography by Frank Phillips  being the only classic Herbie film to not be shot at the Golden Oak Ranch. Jolly soundtrack by Frank De val  Robert Aldrich's usual  including the lively leitmotif  usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film  the original entry was The love bug by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones  David Tomlinson and Buddy Hackett  followed by  Herbie rides again 1974 also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry  Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes  it's followed by Herbie goes to Montecarlo with Dean Jones  Don Knotts and Julie Sommers  followed by Herbie goes bananas 1980  or Herbie Torero by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman  among others and a 1997fortelevisionmovie with Bruce Campbell and John Hanna and a TV series  the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan  Justin Long and Matt Dillon  being directed by Angela Robinson. This first version  Love Bug  results to be the best version  it is amusing story with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture was professionally directed by Vincent MacEveety . He's an usual craftsman from Disney productions and a filmmaker of several TV episodes such as Diagnosis Murder  Colombo  Pensacola  Airwolf  Dallas  Cimarron  Star Trek  Gunsmoke and many others . This Herbie goes bananas is an amusing and engaging film with effective combination of primitive special effects  live action  adventure  fantasy and humor . The children will get a kick out of this typical Disney film it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . Worthwhile seeing  typical Disney slapstick  though isn't of the best in Herbie series .".

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I don't know why so many people dislike this movie. I'm 27 and don't usually like fairytale type stories much anymore but I find Herbie goes Bananas to be a lot of fun and usually very enjoyable. Some things about it are rather ridiculous like a kid driver and other items but after all it's a fantasy movie just like all the other Herbie films for that matter. Some parts don't exactly fit together or make sense like how Herbie knows where Paco is when he's left behind in the jungle why Herbie would be let up into the Pannama Canal and other things. But if you just forget about the parts that wouldn't work in real life and enjoy the story and events that take place it's a lot of fun. Of the now 5 main Herbie movies The Love Bug Herbie Rides Again Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo Herbie Goes Bananas and Herbie Fully Loaded this isn't my favorite one but it's not my least favorite either. Personally my favorite is probably Herbie goes to Monte Carlo and my least favorite is definitely Herbie Fully Loaded. I admit that when I first saw it there were plenty of things that didn't seem right but after seeing it a few times and getting used to it I got to really liking it. Some things I found to be a bit unpleasant confusing and sort of mixed up. I didn't like it that Herbie rusts in the water and nearly drowns but after all this isn't the first time Herbie is damaged and later fixed. Sometimes it's confusing all the different items going on at once. I do think it could have been better with perhaps a few less characters. There are plenty of things that could have been better I wouldn't argue with that at all and it is considerably different from the other movies. But after watching it a few times and getting the feel for it I learned to really like it. I think it just takes some getting used to the more I watch it the more I enjoy it. One of the only things that I never like is the rude selfish and annoying behavior of the pirate like Captain Blythe.Many parts I find to be very funny especially the scene that the movie is named after where Herbie is throwing Banana's at the crooks near the end. Maybe it's just my opinion but I find this to be hilarious. However I don't think the movie title should have been named after this.Anyways I think it's a great movie once you get used to it. Some parts could have been better but I find it to be just as good as the other Herbie movies.".

So Pete and engineer Davy Johns collect the car to enter it into a race but they first have to contend with little pickpocket Paco. Despite the look of the car they take it on the cruise ship with them when they leave  not knowing that Paco has sneaked onboard as well to escape the wrath of one of his victims who are part of a gang planning to steal Aztec gold.This was supposedly the final entry in the series but I suppose that the new 2005 film means that it is number 4 of 5 so far. The characters and locations have all changed but essentially the formula is still the same  physical comedy from Herbie romance from the driver a crime subplot although no race as such. In this regard it doesn't do anything particularly special or go anywhere other than you expect it to but it is inoffensive and not annoying or boring. The comedy is soso with plenty of Herbie action for kids apparently they went through over 20 cars making this and acceptable humour for adults.The cast are mixed  in some regards they carry the movie but in others they are terrible. The lead cast are mostly poor. Burns shows how enjoyable Jones was because he is totally lacking in charisma or screen presence. Smith does his best to impersonate the usual engineer sidekick Knotts by mugging and pulling faces but it never gets past the stage of impersonation to become his own work. Davalos is terribly dull although her wooden uninspired delivery does quite compliment Burns. Garay the third would you believe is OK but if you hate cute kids in movies then you'll hate his squeaky little performance however I suppose it is quite cool that the car gets to act opposite an orphan  very like Chaplin. Thank goodness for the support cast then because they do a lot of the work that the lead actors fail to do not saying that they are that good but at least they are lively and interesting. Korman overacts with little material to work with but he is very funny at times. Leachman is a lot more bythenumbers and not as interesting. The criminal gang don't have much to do but the faces will be interesting for adults  Jaeckel and Rocco for example.Overall this is a fairly obvious entry in the series but it is still enjoyable. The overuse of the kid will put many adults off because it brings out some horrible cloying sentiment but mostly the film is lively and quite enjoyable. Children will enjoy it and adults will be able to watch it without feeling bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "You're not supposed to dislike Herbie films. They're from a more innocent era a time when cars having a soul didn't seem such a farfetched idea because of the amount of acid you were dropping. Hating Herbie films is like hating a sixyearold for not being able to do algebra. But I had my fears that Herbie films would run out of gas in subsequent films but this one this wretchedly boring addition to the series is running on fumes. Devoid of any of the charm humour and speed of any of the previous three films it's a tragic way to close a series that had at least been fun up till now.Herbie's new owner this time is squarejawed American Pete Stephen W Burns and his mechanic buddy DJ Charles Martin Smith who inherit the car in Mexico. After befriending streetwise pickpocket Paco Joaquin Garay III they decide to head to Rio De Janeiro to participate in the Brazilian Grand Prix. Boarding a cruiseliner to Rio they meet eccentric Aunt Louise Cloris Leachman who intends to match up Pete with her shy and bookish but incredibly goodlooking niece Melissa Elyssa Davalos while keeping her eye firmly on Captain Blythe Harvey Korman. Amid all this Paco is being hunted by a couple of villains from Mexico John Vernon  Alex Rocco who are after some lost Inca treasure and pretty soon Herbie decides to intervene in the only way he knows how...Given that the plot is hopelessly muddled we don't even find out how they get on in Brazil by the time the film ends! Herbie Goes Bananas is a prime example of what happens when a film has only a couple of decent ideas behind it but runs out of steam very quickly and struggles to fill out its running time. Very little ever seems to happen and when it does it's so mindnumbingly dull that it never recovers your full attention. Herbie himself lacks the personality of previous movies being little more than a car that does tricks such as the scarcelybelievable matador scene. Combine that with possibly the most annoying kid I think I've ever seen in a film and I'm included Shortround from Temple Of Doom and it's no wonder you're not interested. Throughout most of the film Herbie's called Ocho and one of the characters is so stupid he can't work out why. For a film principally about a car with a mind of its own it's ironic that there is no drive in the movie at all  nothing feels exciting dynamic or amusing which is something the three earlier films managed at some point. Even the actors looks bored although Korman hams it up somewhat as the caricature naval officer.In truth there was no reason to make this movie other than for Disney to flog a dead horse even more and wring the last few dollars out of a dying franchise. Even the weakest sequel up to this point  Herbie Rides Again  had one or two moments that were worth watching but this has none. But what could they have done that hadn't been done before? The only thing that's different in this movie is the location offering the filmmakers a whole bunch of dodgy accents and racial stereotypes to plunder in the search for some familyfriendly laughs. Alas they have come back emptyhanded. This is the film that ushered Herbie into the pits for the last time although Disney still put out a couple of halfhearted sequels later and even a TV show and frankly this film is very much like its star  out of date rusty all over and in serious need of scrapping.".

The rest of the time it moves at a snail's pace odd for a Volkswagen that's supposed to win Grand Prix events.By the way little Joaquin Garay calls him Ocho because he adds the five and three painted on Herbie's side and that's eight in Spanish.

	schema:reviewBody "'Herbie Goes Bananas' is a severely injusticed and misunderstood lighthearted comedy. The major mistake of this film was coming after the 3 older Herbie's films which sealed its doom from the very start. Had it been made before them and maybe things would have been different it probably would have been more successful and appreciated. But then we wouldn't have Joaquin Garay III in it. Back when the 1st Herbie film 'The Love Bug' came out 1968 Joaquin Garay III was just coming to our world. Without taking off merit to other kids I don't know if this movie would have been so good without Joaquin Garay III. He cheers me up so much in this movie.This film is so unique and feels so different from the previous ones that it's more than just another sequel. I think of it almost as one that doesn't belong to the same family of movies.This movie is a jewel. I dare to say it's worth gold. They don't make them like this anymore. Now there are a few minor flaws but otherwise there is lots to like it's delightful charming timeless entertaining nostalgic and the way the story is told is funny. There are lots of moments of great fun but really funny humor classic humor and absolutely no dirty humor.Concerning the soundtrack the only song I find nothing special is Look at me. Aside that I adore the cheer song I found a new friend and the cheer music with no singing played at the opening credits and other parts.The locations are a major appeal beautiful desirable and exotic destinations like Mexico and Panama perfect for some unforgettable Summer vacations and even better if it's in a voyage by cruise ship.Harvey Korman portrays the pirate maniac Captain Blythe  crazy but funny at the same time. The actors who play the bad guys are pretty good either. Stephen W. Burns makes a very convincing Pete Stancheck.Joaquin Garay III is excellent in his overactive performance as cute little Paco and his chemistry with Herbie is perfect. There's something special about this unusual friendship between this lovable but mischievous little boy and the world's most charismatic Volkswagen Beetle. The way how Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is funny and reminds me of Pete's Dragon because we can't understand the dragon's language but the boy does and continues talking to him normally as if it's no big deal to understand. The same happens to Herbie and Paco.Herbie is called Ocho by Paco because he doesn't know the car's real name and misunderstands the meaning of the number 53. Apparently he interprets them as separate numbers possibly because of that line in the middle of the car's hood which results in one number at each side. What he does is plain and simple he adds both numbers et voil!A very appropriate movie for children with everything they can wish in a movie and no inappropriate stuff for them. It's a shame that children of this generation do not appreciate this kind of movies so beloved by children of my generation. Despite being very childish it's also very appropriate for adults as long they appreciate good old classics and have no qualms with this one in particular.Title in Portugal 'As Novas Diabruras de Herbie'.".

The way how Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is funny and reminds me of Pete's Dragon because we can't understand the dragon's language but the boy does and continues talking to him normally as if it's no big deal to understand. The same happens to Herbie and Paco.Herbie is called Ocho by Paco because he doesn't know the car's real name and misunderstands the meaning of the number 53. Apparently he interprets them as separate numbers possibly because of that line in the middle of the car's hood which results in one number at each side. What he does is plain and simple he adds both numbers et voil!A very appropriate movie for children with everything they can wish in a movie and no inappropriate stuff for them. It's a shame that children of this generation do not appreciate this kind of movies so beloved by children of my generation. Despite being very childish it's also very appropriate for adults as long they appreciate good old classics and have no qualms with this one in particular.Title in Portugal 'As Novas Diabruras de Herbie'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Herbie Goes Bananas is way too underrated. Quite honestly I don't see any reason why so many people dislike it. It's a lighthearted comedy in the oldfashioned Disney style great fun and cute. It's a harmless movie without violence or bad stuff. I know I'm in minority but I consider this a classic.Despite being one of the sequels this one can be considered a movie apart. It is original and different from the 3 previous movies. It's not a ripoff which is a benefit. Plus unlike the other movies which are dated this one has that timeless nostalgic feeling. The movie is much better than its cheesy title suggests.Herbie Goes Bananas takes us to exotic locations such as Mexico and Panama but also to a cruise ship the Sun Princess a bullfight Inca ruins Panama's Canal...Soundtrack is nice. I found a new friend is a very charming and cheerful song and I also like the instrumental musics.About the characters I generally like them. My favorite is Paco along with Herbie. Paco is cute and lovable but also comical and one of the nicest and smartest movie kids ever. He always keeps his cheery disposition. He is polite cool he really likes his car friend Herbie and he always says the car looks good even rusty. He is so much different from the obnoxious Maggie Peyton from Herbie Fully Loaded or even Jim Douglas himself in the beginning of The Love Bug.Captain Blythe is very surly yet hilarious. Imagine having an explosive captain like that aboard a ship...Herbie the lovable VW Beetle is a charismatic car in the world of cinema while the VW Beetle itself is a legend in car industry. I love how he's always there for Paco when he needs help and that Paco does the same for Herbie. I just love their friendship.The bad guys are likable for villains. They always remain calm and delicate without showing signs of aggressiveness.Joaquin Garay III steals the show. His performance as Paco is just so energetic so lively and terrific. He must have had great fun making this movie. Other talents include Stephen W. Burns Charles Martin Smith Harvey Korman Cloris Leachman John Vernon Richard Jaeckel Alex Rocco and Vito Scotti.It's really cute that Paco calls Herbie Ocho eight in Spanish because he believes Herbie's 53 number means 538. The way Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is so cute. Not less cute is to see Paco acting like a taxi driver Herbie is disguised as a taxi later and the painting smiling flowers with the word taxi which Paco paints on Herbie. Curiously Herbie's name is never mentioned in the movie except one single time by the garage owner.One of the most hilarious parts of the film is Herbie as a matador. The entire sequence is just so funny! Also the part when Herbie throws bananas to the bad guys is just hilarious! But there are plenty of other moments as funny as these of course...This should definitely be on Top 250.".

Finally I was able to find a DVD copy on EBay apparently it is not currently available on DVD through normal means and I am glad I did so.  This movie has stood the test of time.  It is both fun to watch and has some depth to it  it is not just a piece of fluff.   The casting is excellent  not a single actor is unfit for the part. Redford's looks and charisma coupled with the fact that while he is still pretty young he does have a few visible age lines make him perfect for the part of a debonair flyboy ten years removed from World War I who is stubbornly resisting the increasing regulation of flying as a profession. Bo Svensen is a great complement as the slightly older more experienced and more evenkeeled Axel Olsson.  Geoffrey Lewis' Newt Potts Pepper's old squadron commander represents the future that Pepper is trying to avoid. Ed Herrmann is the embodiment of the seat of your pants spirit of the early aircraft producers.  Phil Bruns is a convincing carnival barker as Doc Dillhoeffer.  And the Swedish actor Bo Brundin puts in a great turn as Ernst Kessler German fighter ace turned barnstormer who has long since realized that the bravery and chivalry he found in the air both among comrades and opponents is rarely found on the ground.   Kessler is based on Ernst Udet the secondhighest scoring German ace of WWI.  Udet barnstormed after the war had a shortened version of Lola painted on his Fokker DVII and had a fight similar to the epic battle that is an important subplot in the movie.  Thus it is a nice touch that Udet is shown in the opening photo montage.  It's also good that no sequel was made  I'd hate to see the Kessler character return to Germany join Hitler's Luftwaffe and commit suicide.   This is also notable on a personal level as the first place I ever saw Susan Sarandon.  I've been a fan ever since.  Hell she still looks great.   The flying sequences are magnificent.  There's no CGI here folks.  These are real aircraft  beautiful replicas of Curtiss Jennies Standard E4's and of course the Sopwith Camel and Fokker Triplane plus a few others  doing real stunt flying.  The talented stunt pilots are credited under the umbrella of Tallmantz Aviation which I'm guessing was formed by legendary stunt pilots Frank Tallman and Paul Mantz.  Tallman himself flew in this film and died in a crash three years later Mantz died making Flight of the Phoenix another of my favorite flight movies in 1965.  And the climactic sequence while it may seem unlikely to some is actually based perhaps loosely on a similar incident that occurred during the filming of either Hells' Angels or Wings in the late 1920's.  The only possible anachronism that I can spot is Kessler's stunt plane which looks a little too advanced for 1928.  But I could be wrong there.   Beautiful aircraft great flying sequences fine acting and even a real plot  what more could you want?".

Aviation stands for freedom. But even in the title scene the constant fear of being forcefully grounded becomes evident  the main character aviator Waldo Pepper talks an overawed boy into getting a canister of gas for him with the promise of a free tour above the landing strip. Cute at first sight but also curiously grim. It immediately started me wondering how the boy could manage to carry the full canister over the required long distance.The wish to be free and be able to fly off sets ever more demanding conditions. People get bored with acrobatics they want to see blood. The artists comply because they are ambitious but also because they know that it is the only way that allows them to continue. Time moves on and it becomes evident that commercial air service will put an end to the adventurous phase of aviation. Hollywood seems to be the only way out. Acrobats are needed as stuntmen there. The grindhouse routine of the dream factory is not to their liking but what else can they do? On a set Waldo Pepper meets a famous German flyer he idolizes. Much to his surprise this Erich von Stroheim character is deeply in debt. In the air I see heroism chivalry and a spirit of comraderie rasps the German but on the ground ... He just limply shrugs. The final quixotic showdown between Pepper and the German is a natural and very good ending of this surprisingly deep and rather pessimistic movie that offers far more than nostalgia.".

He and Redford are intense competitors and the competition between the two is fun to witness especially with humor thrown into the mix.This film is noted for sporting a very young and beautiful Susan Sarandon who makes a very memorable exit from the film!

These entertaining almost playful scenes where we witness Pepper's goodnatured rivalry with fellowflier Bo Svennson not only for the patronage of the target awestruck thrillseeking populace of littletown Americans but also for of course the girl Susan Sarandon in an early role have a touch of whimsy even sentimentality as Pepper takes a heroworshipping young tyke up for a spin.However the film grows more serious as it continues as we are made aware that in the end this is a business and that to make money and outdo rival companies for daring the Barnumtype ownerentrepreneur Dilhoeffer well played by Philip Bruns exhorts Pepper and his confederates to ever more dangerous stunts with nary a thought for the consequences health and safety doesn't get a look in here!. The outcome is predictable as first of all Sarandon and later Pepper's friend boffintype aircraft designer Stiles die horribly in stunts which go disastrously wrong leading the film to its ultimate and overriding motif about the otherness of people like Pepper gifted with a rare talent but with a bent for living on the edge outside everyday society.Such people are of course rarely long for this world as is tacitly underscored at the end where we learn of Pepper's death at a young age from a commemorative picture on a wall but are overall left with a great admiration for all those risktaking individuals from those times unforgettable photographic images of whom you know the ones I mean wingwalking or even playing tennis on biplanes workmen casually eating sandwiches on girders atop the underconstruction Empire State Building etc can still draw gasps of admiration from people like me living our ordinary mundane earthbound lives.The cinematography is fantastic thirty years before The Aviator the air stunts are brilliantly pulled off and photographed. Redford is at his winning best as the outthere Pepper and he's well supported by his band of highflying misfits. Part of me was repelled however by the seeming disregard for the deaths of Mary Beth and Stiles by Dilhoeffer Pepper etc not to mention the rubbernecking general public and believe a little more humanity could have come through in the writing.On the whole though this is a charming greatly entertaining movie not without its darker side and for me belongs in the same airborne formation with Only Angels Have Wings and The Aviator as a classic movie celebrating the lives of those fascinated by andor who make their living in the skies above.

	schema:headline " The Surly Bonds of Earth";
	schema:reviewBody "Now that flying seems such a mundane everyday way of getting people from A to B it is strange to recall that there was a time not so long ago when it seemed far more magical. In the twenties and thirties aviation represented what space travel came to represent during my childhood in the sixties and seventies mankind's most thrilling new adventure. The aviatorpoet John Magee was able to write in his sonnet High Flight that while flying he had slipped the surly bonds of Earth and put out my hand and touched the face of God.The Great Waldo Pepper is a film which like the more recent The Aviator captures some of the excitement of those days. It is set in the world of the barnstormers troupes of pilots who would perform stunts to entertain the crowds. This was a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and many of the barnstormers were former fighter pilots from the First World War the troupes became known as flying circuses after the squadron commanded by Manfred von Richthofen Germany's greatest ace. At first their stunts were relatively simple ones but as time went on the crowds became more demanding and the pilots were expected to perform increasingly dangerous manoeuvres sometimes verging on the suicidal. The proprietor of the flying circus featured in the film puts it simply. I'm not selling good flying. I'm selling sudden death. The film charts the exploits of the title character and his two great rivals Axel Olsson an American but presumably originally from Scandinavia to judge from his accent and Ernst Kessler a German loosely based upon another reallife flying ace Ernst Udet. Pepper's rivalry with these two men stems from the fact that they both had distinguished combat records during the war whereas he served in the American forces but was employed as an instructor and never saw active service. His rivalry with Olsson however does not prevent them from becoming close friends.At the beginning of the 1920s flying was an almost entirely unregulated activity but during the decade it became more commercialised as the first airlines and air mail services were launched and tighter regulations were introduced in the interests of public safety. After a young woman is killed in a dangerous stunt that goes wrong Pepper loses his pilot's licence and is forced to abandon barnstorming. He is however unwilling to give up flying altogether and travels to Hollywood where he becomes a stunt pilot under an assumed name. He learns that Kessler and he are both working on the same film a wartime aviation drama and that they are due to reenact a famous dogfight between British and German planes. Somehow they manage to turn their film sequence into a reallife duel.The film was directed by George Roy Hill and starred Robert Redford who had previously worked with Hill in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. Unlike those two films however this one does not costar Paul Newman. One of Redford's greatest assets as an actor was his amiable boyish charm and that is much in evidence in this film especially during the more comic first half. He plays Pepper as charming and debonair with an insouciant devilmaycare attitude in contrast to the more levelheaded Olsson and the gloomy saturnine Kessler. Kessler has fallen on hard times after Germany's defeat his pessimistic attitude is due to the fact that he was a hero in wartime but has become a nobody in peacetime. Something similar happened to the real Udet who went on to join the Nazis and ended up committing suicide. His character comes more to the fore in the second half of the film which is notably darker than the lighthearted early scenes.There are excellent performances from Redford and from Bo Brundin as Kessler. Olsson is played by Bo Svenson are there any other Englishlanguage films where two major male characters are played by actors named Bo? The main attraction of the film however is not the acting but the magnificent flying sequences all of which were performed using real aircraft not models or special effects. It is said that the actors performed all their own stunts including wing walking which must have given the film's insurers some nervous moments. It is these exhilarating scenes which give the film its excitement and much of its emotional power making it a fitting tribute to the pioneers of aviation. 710".

	schema:headline " Spectacular story about WWI fliers turned barnstorming aerial stunt pilots including superb flying sequences";
	schema:reviewBody "The film's opening title card read Nebraska 1926 and shows the old blackandwhite Universal Pictures logo presentation which features an old early 20th Century plane flying around the orbit of the planet earth . The Second Greatest Flyer in the World . The war was over  and the world's greatest flyers had never met in combat . But Waldo was going to change all that  even if it killed him . The era the picture is set in is mostly the Roaring Twenties  specifically the period is between 1926 and 1931  in which bitter pilots are reduced to defying death in air flying circus such as Waldo Pepper Robert Redford  Axel Olson Bo Svenson and Ezra Stiles Edward Herrmann. As a disillusioned biplane pilot named Waldo who had missed flying in WWI takes up barnstorming and later he carries out a movie career in his quest for the glory he had missed . After that  the pilotbecomebarnstormer gets hired as a stuntman for the Hollywood movies . Eventually getting a chance to prove himself in a film depicting the dogfights in the Great War . Waldo believes the honor of the best WWI fighter pilots and he deems to be the German Ernst Kessler Bo Brundin who is working in Hollywwod as an aerial stunt .This attractive drama about flying results to be an elegiac homage to WWI fliers . It features impressive vintage aircraft flying sequences made by expert stunts and professional pilots . However  there are no studio takes in airplanes  all closeups of actors being airborne were done for real sometimes with George Roy Hill a former Marine pilot himself flying the airplane while directing  as scenes with Robert Redford and Bo Svenson climbing out on the wing were done without any security harness or parachutes . The film reunited three successful Hollywood professionals of the sixties and seventies  actor Robert Redford  filmmaker George Roy Hill  and screenwriter William Goldman  the latter Oscar Winner for The Sting . All of them got a big hit with Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid . Breathtaking as well as overwhelming flying sequences  intelligent plot and brilliant scenes are major assets in this stunning flick . Robert Redford gives one of his best acting  along with Bo Svenson and Bo Brundin  both actors are Swedish . The notorious secondary player Geoffrey Lewis also gives an admiring interpretation  as always . The movie represents an early screen role of actress Susan Sarandon  the film was one two 1975 movies that Sarandon appeared in that were released in that year  he other one was The Rocky Horror Picture Show 1975 which is considered to feature Sarandon's breakthrough film role . The yarn features actress Margot Kidder who became famous for starring in the Superman franchise with Christopher Reeve . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by the great cameraman Robert Surtees  a photographer expert on superproductions . Lively and enjoyable musical score by Henry Mancini  Pink Panther's composer . The movie is pretty well but had a commercial flop . The motion picture was compellingly directed by George Roy Hill . This is third and final of three films that as an actor Robert Redford made with director George Roy Hill he first two were The Sting 1973 and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid 1969 . George Roy Hill had a long career from the fifties until the eighties with hit smashes such as The world according to Garp  Slap shot Butch Cassidy The Sting  Hawaii  The world of Henry Orient and commercial failures such as The little drummer girl  A little romance  Slaughterhouse five Throughly Millie  Toys in the attic  Period of adjustment and this The great Waldo Pepper  however  the latter being today better considered than old times .

It reminds me of my childhood dreams of becoming a military pilot and the joys and terrors of flying. As a teenage in the mid1930's I saw Ernst Udet drag the Oakland Airport with his sweptwing biplane inverted and pick a handkerchief off the runway with his wing tip. And about 8 years earlier when I was about 6 I lived in Rio Vista on the Sacramento River midway between Sacramento and San Francisco when a mail plane crashed in a grain field just outside of town. I ran out with a crowd of town folks and other kids. By the time we got to the plane it was burning fiercely with the pilot trapped in the cockpit and no way the men in the crowd could have rescued him. Everyone was grimfaced and silent except for one smart alec who said he wished he'd brought his knife and fork because the burning pilot smelled good. I have often wondered if this gruesome event inspired The Great Waldo Pepper's scene where Waldo's friend crashes and burns. But I expect this was a common occurrence.".

The idea that Kessler was a man who only felt at home in the air forwhom nothing worked out well on the ground resonated with me as it didwith Pepper who felt the same way.In closing I'd like to mention the beginning of the movie when WaldoPepper lands at a small town in Iowa to offer airplane rides.

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford got one of his best roles in The Great Waldo Pepper which was directed by George Roy Hill who did right by him with Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid and The Sting. It does a wonderful job of capturing a bygone era of the Twenties when after World War I the airplane was a big toy played with by some big kids.The airplane got invented just in time for use in the war to end all wars. But no one figured out quite what to do with it. In point of fact it didn't have the capacity to drop bombs on the enemy to do that much damage. In the trench warfare days the real function was scouting those enemy lines to see and report on troop dispositions. But the other side did the same thing. So when they met dogfights happened. They were colorful and exciting but didn't really do much militarily.Aces got their reputations like the real life Baron Von Richtofen and Hermann Goering and the fictional Ernest Kessler as played by Bo Brundin here. Waldo Pepper in the Great War came up too late to show his stuff even though his former squadron leader Geoffrey Lewis says he was the most natural flier he ever saw. He had a brief encounter with Brundin days before the Armistice where Brundin let him off. He never got a chance to prove himself. Now he proves himself every day in the various flying circuses doing daredevil stunts. People who fly do it for the love it and won't be happy going 9 to 5 on the ground. Redford is at the height of his abilities and this is his frustration that he never got to show his stuff in the arena where it really counted. Redford did a wonderful job in fleshing this aspect of his character.But his world is changing if the military has put aviation on hold there are lots of commercial uses. And a guy named Herbert Hoover who Secretary of Commerce at that time spearheaded the creation of the Civil Aeronautics Agency to regulate air traffic. Airplanes would be hauling mail and people and would soon be large enough to haul freight. Not a world that calls for daredevil daring.The Great Waldo Pepper is one of Robert Redford's best films and roles. The Great Robert Redford has this part really nailed down. Some other folks in the cast are a tragic Edward Herrmann who hasn't got the skill as a pilot that Redford has and shows it. Susan Sarandon plays a budding wing walker who also perishes tragically in one of her early roles. George Roy Hill assembled a great supporting cast to back up Redford.In the end it's Redford who makes The Great Waldo Pepper great.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've long been impressed with the variety of films in which Robert Redford starred during his prime years. He took chances tackling roles that few others would accept and there was always a sense of quality in his films.That being said it almost seems as if this film didn't quite know what it wanted to be. A sort of lighthearted look at stunt pilots? Well that's in there. A serious look at the psyche of aerial daredevils? Well that's in there too. The first half of the film and the last half of the film seem almost like different stories. The most interesting part of the film is the relationship that develops between Waldo Pepper Redford and a German flying ace from World War I but again what exactly is the point. Oh and yes some of the flying is quite stunning. I couldn't help but think how differently this film would be made today with all the computerized special effects. However from my perspective it's quite a depressing film...including the ending.There's certainly nothing wrong with the acting here. Robert Redford is flyer Waldo Pepper and is very believable in the role. Bo Svenson no favorite of mine is quite good here as another stunt flyer. Bo Brundin is interesting as the clearly moody German air ace. I never cared much for Susan Sarandon but she does well here as the slightly ditzy girlfriend of one or both of the American stunt pilots. Geoffrey Lewis a reliable character actor does well here as he pretty much always did. Edward Herrmann has a somewhat small role and is almost unidentifiable this seems before he was typecast in later roles.I have quite a few favorite Robert Redford films but this is not one I want to watch again. Once in 1975 and once in 2015 is plenty for me. Of course if you are into aeronautics you might warm up to this film more than I did.".

I saw it aged 13 and it absolutely thrilled me. Waldo's friend's death in a crash and fire may correctly need a PG warning but the film will still give most kids a love of flying. For the next 10 years I knew I would be a fighter pilot! There are obvious comparisons with The Blue Max made 9 years earlier. I like the civilian side to this film. Susan Sharendon's sudden exit was a real shocker which took me months to get over. In conclusion I think that this was the first film that I watched thinking I am an adult enjoying an adult story. It made me feel great and I've had a fascination with film ever since. All thanks to Waldo!".

	schema:headline " Good Aviation Adventure Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Great Waldo Pepper in its first theatrical release back in 1975. The story revolves around Waldo Pepper a flight instructor from the postWord War I era who along with his buddies have a passion for stunt flying. Desperate for money they preform numerous barnstorming stunts at various airshows such as Wing Walking sometimes with tragic results. There are two noted aviation deaths in this movie one in particular at a county fair that is very painful to watch.The cinematography is stunning. Robert Redford as Waldo Pepper preformed all of his own stunts for the movie. Actual aviation and stunt pilots assisted in the production of the film with real aircraft used. There are no models or computer generated sequences of any kind in this movie. The result is a very realistic experience.The problem with TGWP seems to be an apathetic approach that many of the characters have when a tragic circumstance occurs in the film. Although Waldo shows great emotion in the tragic airshow accident where his friend burns to death in a haunting scene that you will remember for the rest of your life there are many quick shifts in the movie where the attitude becomes business as usual where What are we going to do about our careers? becomes more important than a person's life. There's a certain degree of arrogance about Waldo's character. But this is not in regards to how Redford plays him. Maybe the attitude of barnstorming pilots at the time was to become apathetic to tragic death because they just accepted the risks associated with stunt flying and barnstorming as a way of life.The film sputters a bit in the second half with the Hollywood stunt sequences after Waldo is grounded by the aviation authorities following a girl's tragic wingwalking death. The ending is memorable. But there seems to be something missing from The Great Waldo Pepper to make it great. However it is still strong enough to be good. One precaution is that very small children may have some problems with the death scenes.".

But the sport survived and still thrives people are doing wilder stunts now than back then so I guess all came out well in the end.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember 1975 well I was living in the New Orleans area and my 4th child was born a cute little daughter. That daughter is 38 now. And I remember this movie by title only but never saw it. For some reason the title didn't draw me in. Now in 2013 I found it on Netflix and find it to be a very nice very enjoyable movie.Being a guy I never identified with the star power of Robert Redford but I know why many of the ladies did he was a really goodlooking guy in his 30s. But could he act? Well in fact he was a very good actor and I witnessed that over the years in other movies.Here he is Waldo Pepper the story starts in 1926 after WW1. He is a pilot apparently a very good one but had spent the war as an instructor and had missed the aerial battles. But he spoke of them as if he had been there as if he were the war hero. That comes to an abrupt halt when he encounters the hero he was talking about Bo Svenson as Axel Olsson. Eventually they form a friendship and fly for one of those traveling aerial carnivals doing stunts and giving rides.This was the time of transition planes were getting more common and the government was stepping in to regulate planes and pilots to make sure there was a baseline safety factor. Waldo Pepper did not deal easily with those new regulations. The other key character is Bo Brundin as Ernst Kessler the famous German fighter pilot of WW1. Everyone knew he was regarded as perhaps the best while he also knew of Waldo Pepper and knew he was one of the best. The climax of the story is when Ernst and Waldo are hired in a moviefilming job they are to simulate an aerial battle. But the two rivals once in the air were determined to see who was best and with dummy guns resorted to close passes and physical contact.The last few scenes pay off very well first as the two men discuss the famous WW1 battle and then the aerial battle of the biplanes. It was also nice seeing a young Susan Sarandon and a young Margot Kidder a full 3 years before her famous role as Lois Lane in one of the Superman movies.Allinall a fine example of a 1970s movie and Redford was already at the top of his form.".
