It isn't an overproduced Hollywood movie that takes itself too serious and that's exactly where its charm is in it for me. I loved to see Brad Pitt as the clumsy criminal who always is able to do something wrong. The same for Julia Roberts as his hysterical girlfriend and James Gandolfini as the gay hit man who has kidnapped her. I know it's not done to say that you liked to see Julia Roberts play a certain role and Brad Pitt can never be good as a comical actor...

	schema:reviewBody "A couple working on the giveandtake aspects of their relationship an exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and some questions concerning who is working for whom all figure prominently in The Mexican' a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach Pitt a somewhat less than astute young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated is given a seemingly simply assignment  He is to go to Mexico where he will rendezvous at a bar in a small town at which time he will take possession of an invaluable handmade pistol he will then transport the item to the States and deliver it to his boss.  But there's a problem his girlfriend Samantha Roberts expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time and their plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain in a memorable scene with her on the second story balcony he on the ground looking up that if he doesn't do this job they will well KILL him it doesn't make any difference.  After all their trip to Vegas had already been planned and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a rock and a hard place.  And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy James Gandolfini. Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie eliciting noteworthy performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using specific landmarks a traffic signal and a crossroads in the middle of nowhere for example that give context and definition to what is happening sometimes offscreen as in the opening scene when you only hear' a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story.  He avoids slapstick and plays up the natural subtle humor that drives the film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty You Forrest Gumped' your way through this...' and often very droll.  And he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing to see in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us are often viewed in stereotypical terms so there is no reason to portray it otherwise in a film especially when care has been taken to present it in an inoffensive manner as it is here. Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role Roberts nevertheless creates a lively character with Sam imbuing her with plenty of spunk and of course that trademark smile.  It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth but she makes Sam likable and fun to watch and she makes her banter with Jerry and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt as well for making the most of what is actually a leading mancharacter role Jerry isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted but like Sam he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their relationship believable especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini meanwhile not to be outdone by his charismatic costars makes an indelible mark as the sensitive psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an enigma. The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban Nalin David Krumholtz Beck Luis Felipe Tovar Luis and Gene Hackman Margolis.  A lively romp that takes some unexpected turns The Mexican' has a dark side but manages to remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There's a natural flow to the film and the laughs generated by both the situations and the characters are never forced but prompted rather by the spontaneity of it all.  It's a movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is which is pure entertainment.  It'll leave you with a smile on your face some chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that my friends is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE MEXICAN  2001  out of fourThe title of Gore Verbinski's new romantic comedy adventure refers to the name of an extraordinarily valuable but cursed pistol possessed by a young man living in urban Mexico. Brad Pitt stars as Jerry Welbach an errand boy forced to work for a local mob boss Bob Balanban after accidentally causing a powerful kingpin named Margolis Gene Hackman to be sent to jail. His last job is to go to Mexico and retrieve The Mexican and its beholder. Jerry's spiteful girlfriend Samantha Julia Roberts wants Jerry to keep his promise about traveling to Las Vegas with her but she does not realize that he can either accomplish this task or be killed. Since Samantha is such an understanding lover she packs her bags and heads to Vegas alone dumping her selfish long time boyfriend. Unfortunately for her she is in the middle of a complicated situation whether she likes it or not. While traveling to her destination Samantha is almost killed by a hitman Sherman Augustus but saved by another coldblooded killer named Leroy James Gandolfini who has been assigned to kidnap her just in case Jerry gets any deceptive ideas while on his journey.Once in Mexico Jerry locates the person and the pistol but things go terribly wrong when the man is accidentally killed and several locals steal his transportation. Becoming suspicious Jerry's accomplice Ted J.K. Simmons is sent to find Jerry and declare the rising stakes at hand. Meanwhile Samantha and Leroy become emotionally candid and share useful information of their past experiences involving love. While Leroy is a homosexual he still lusts for romantic fulfillment as the sentimental killer gives Samantha some advice of her own.The Mexican is not really a romantic comedy like many audiences will expect it is a somewhat coarse violent adventure with undertones dealing with forgiveness and the strength of love. Actually the relationship between the characters of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is quite trite. Except for the third act whenever on screen together the two characters do nothing but bitterly argue and fight. The performances keep the romance alive clearly Pitt and Roberts are the right choices for the parts. Brad Pitt progresses into a somewhat comedic role and he often struggles with it. But I certainly thought his performance was funny. He gives his character the perfect amount of charm and sweetness. Julia Roberts is a little annoying but puts an effective edge in her character. We actually end up caring about both of their fates.There are a lot of little things to like in The Mexican like the scenes in a Mexican bar shuttered with a dark atmosphere and authentic cinematography by Dariusz Wolski dim lights give the rooms a greenish tint creating a realistic and believable mood for the scenes. The soundtrack furnishes the movie with a genuine zest. A lot of the dialogue is witty and smart with scenes that are wellwritten often funny and keep our attention. The comedic elements keep the movie interesting and fresh. The film does an excellent job with informing us about the history of the pistol and the plot's complications are curiously intriguing. Leroy's homosexuality introduces relationship issues that give his character depth. Although often bloody and shockingly profane The Mexican is not meanspirited or nastybut enlightening and whimsical.The film is directed by Gore Verbinski who also provided us with fastpaced entertainment in the 1997 family comedy MouseHunt. The Mexican is much different from that film but still has the energy and stride to keep us engrossed. Although not what many people will expect I found The Mexican to be a surprising delight.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE MEXICAN  2001  out of fourThe title of Gore Verbinski's new romantic comedy adventure refers to the name of an extraordinarily valuable but cursed pistol possessed by a young man living in urban Mexico. Brad Pitt stars as Jerry Welbach an errand boy forced to work for a local mob boss Bob Balanban after accidentally causing a powerful kingpin named Margolis Gene Hackman to be sent to jail. His last job is to go to Mexico and retrieve The Mexican and its beholder. Jerry's spiteful girlfriend Samantha Julia Roberts wants Jerry to keep his promise about traveling to Las Vegas with her but she does not realize that he can either accomplish this task or be killed. Since Samantha is such an understanding lover she packs her bags and heads to Vegas alone dumping her selfish long time boyfriend. Unfortunately for her she is in the middle of a complicated situation whether she likes it or not. While traveling to her destination Samantha is almost killed by a hitman Sherman Augustus but saved by another coldblooded killer named Leroy James Gandolfini who has been assigned to kidnap her just in case Jerry gets any deceptive ideas while on his journey.Once in Mexico Jerry locates the person and the pistol but things go terribly wrong when the man is accidentally killed and several locals steal his transportation. Becoming suspicious Jerry's accomplice Ted J.K. Simmons is sent to find Jerry and declare the rising stakes at hand. Meanwhile Samantha and Leroy become emotionally candid and share useful information of their past experiences involving love. While Leroy is a homosexual he still lusts for romantic fulfillment as the sentimental killer gives Samantha some advice of her own.The Mexican is not really a romantic comedy like many audiences will expect it is a somewhat coarse violent adventure with undertones dealing with forgiveness and the strength of love. Actually the relationship between the characters of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is quite trite. Except for the third act whenever on screen together the two characters do nothing but bitterly argue and fight. The performances keep the romance alive clearly Pitt and Roberts are the right choices for the parts. Brad Pitt progresses into a somewhat comedic role and he often struggles with it.

I also like unexpected love stories. This film has both.This is two hours long with lots of characters and fairly complex plot. If you think it makes no sense like some reviewers here try a little harder. It all ties together but it doesn't condescend to make it bleeding obvious.By far Gandofini is my favorite. His character is so passionate and conflicted. So human. So tragic. I really enjoyed his conversations with Sam. They are so honest. Made me cry.My only complaint is casting Julia Roberts as Sam. Good actress bad casting. Sam is a 19 year old silly whimsical romantic girl. But Julia is a 30 mature woman. Such as when she says Are you going to rape me? if she were 19 it would be funny but from Julia it sounds insane. A 30 year old woman doesn't think like that. Also when she answers the when is it enough? question on the curb. It seems weird coming from a 30 year old woman.Likewise Brad is a bit too old for his part but it is less distracting.".

The trailers do this film no justice at all since they imply that it will be another 'Pulp Fiction' type movie with stylish characters witty dialogue dark humor and over the top violence played for sinful pleasures and shock value.  This film contains the last of these promises and that's about it.My roommate and his girlfriend who love this movie made me watch it one night.  Being a huge movie buff and a fan of Brad Pitt I had incredible expectations for this flick but they were all shot down beginning with Julia Roberts' annoying scene where she tosses all of Brad Pitt's stuff out a window in a fit of rage.  As I sat there watching this film the other couple in the room kept laughing hysterically at the jokes and slapstick in this film.  Needless to say I sat bewildered as to how anyone can think this movie is funny let alone enjoyable.  Now I am one of those people who enjoy most movies with over the top silly humor like Monty Python Road Trip or Deuce Bigalow and I love to laugh for the simple point of laughing even if the material isn't exactly up to Python brilliance but how can someone think that I need a rideo in your trucko to the el towno is the least bit funny?  There's a fine line between juvenile humor which even the most serious of us enjoy even though they don't admit it and a pathetic attempt at juvenile humor Enter The Mexican.  Trust me this is coming from a guy who finds humor in almost anything.  This movie had me sitting there hoping that something entertaining would happen.  No such luck here.With a film with Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini and though I don't like her Julia Roberts one would think that the movie would be good if not great.  But once again Hollywood proves that even big budget stars 'owe favors' to producers from time to time In other words if the script is bad the 'bigger' the movie the harder it will fall.  Pitt is an incredibly annoying and incompetent wannabee gangster who tries to provide humor for the film but fails miserably in perhaps his most embarrassing performance to date.  James Gandolfini was probably the best part of this film though not saying much as the hitman with hidden secrets.  Julia Roberts made me want to take the television and throw it out the window she played the most annoying character I have seen in quite some time.  The acting and the script are so awful it will bother you for a while afterwards and leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It's one of those films that tries too hard to be good and wants you to want it to be good or hopes that the viewer will be incompetent enough to think it's good as well thinking that big budget stars and a misleading trailer will make up for a cheesy plot bad acting a horrible script and bad direction.  Come on guys believe it or not people are not stupid.  All in all this is a flick that is a total waste of time.  This movie sucks so bad it draws all the air out of the room and then closes all of the walls around you until you suffocate from the suckage as well as the large quantity of crp that is hurled at you from your television set.  I have said this for maybe three or four movies in my life but this film is pure torture to watch it provides no entertainment and leaves you upset afterwards after you were looking forward to a nice evening at home with a fun movie. I rarely say this on IMDB but AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!! 110.".

Julia Roberts made me want to take the television and throw it out the window she played the most annoying character I have seen in quite some time.  The acting and the script are so awful it will bother you for a while afterwards and leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It's one of those films that tries too hard to be good and wants you to want it to be good or hopes that the viewer will be incompetent enough to think it's good as well thinking that big budget stars and a misleading trailer will make up for a cheesy plot bad acting a horrible script and bad direction.  Come on guys believe it or not people are not stupid.  All in all this is a flick that is a total waste of time.  This movie sucks so bad it draws all the air out of the room and then closes all of the walls around you until you suffocate from the suckage as well as the large quantity of crp that is hurled at you from your television set.  I have said this for maybe three or four movies in my life but this film is pure torture to watch it provides no entertainment and leaves you upset afterwards after you were looking forward to a nice evening at home with a fun movie. I rarely say this on IMDB but AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!! 110.";

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface this might appear to be a relatively entertaining film since it stars two big names  but stop to consider the careers of both Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt . Roberts was unbelievably lucky to have won the Oscar for ERIN BROCKOVICH while Pitt is obviously a film star due to his sexy boy looks . You're right i'm slightly jealous of Pitt's physique and his face and even more jealous still that he's made a massively successful career out of it and like everything else he's appeared in THE Mexican shows Pitt is not much of an actor The plot revolves around gangster Jerry Walbach being sent down to Mexico by the mob to collect an antique firearm called  The Mexican  and while he's away his girlfriend Samantha is kidnapped by a hitman called Winston Baldry who also wants to get his hands on The Mexican . I'm not sure if the premise would have allowed for many laughs but what's obvious on screen is that Roberts and Pitt try and milk the humour for all it's worth . This is a mistake because the comedy should come out of the situations the characters find themselves in not by Roberts and Pitt mugging for the camera  shouting or waving their arms about trying to convince the audience that this is a funny film . Even worse is the casting of James Gandolfini as Winston since he's written as a gay version of Tony Soprano  effectively we've got Gandolfini playing a distractingly similar role that he's best known for . Thankfully we don't see JK Simmons playing the head of The Ayran Brotherhood but his character is such a wimp I found myself wishing he'd say something like  From now on Jerry your ass belongs to me  while craving a swastika onto his victim's flesh . It's probably also a mistake to have Gene Hackman in here since his scene seems to have been written just so we'd get a cameo from a living legend . Anything that prolongs the running time of this movie receives harsh judgement from me THE Mexican is a comedy that I found to be far from entertaining . The casting of such big names must have cost a lot of money and more time and attention should have been taken with the script and you do get the irritating feeling that the producers thought having a couple of big names in the movie everything would have taken care of itself . Obviously it didn't . Some people on the message boards have complained that this is the worst movie ever when in fact it's not even the worst movie Brad Pitt has appeared in  but unless you're a die hard fan of either Roberts or Pitt there's not much point in seeing this amigo".

Actually I think this is the weakest movie Verbinski has done. Not that his direction is bad it's mainly because of poor script that fails to provide really good black comedy and it's because I must say bad casting. Why? Well I really respect Brad Pitt's work. He's not some handsome guy who is here only because of his looks. He knows how to act and he proved that many times Kalifornia Se7en Twelve Monkeys Fight Club Snatch but this is movie where he just couldn't fit in. His colleague Julia Roberts is also working this movie off so the only person who's actually acting is James Gandolfini. Gandolfini is very good in his role emotional vulnerable but still strong and convincing. I forgot one thing about Pitt  Roberts I just cannot put two of them together as a pair. Although we have here some universal messages about love hitman who's very emotional strange for hitman even though he's gay and cameo role from great Gene Hackman this is really movie that you can easily skip unless you're in love with Brad Pitt or you just want to watch a movie without innovative story.".

Apparently an overlong boring mix of comedy romance and violence  which in this case is a rather lackluster result considering the potential.Jerry Brad Pitt is one of the most inept criminals in history. Five years ago he crashed into the back of a crime lord's car and as a result found himself working off the accident by running errands. Jerry's last retrieval before retirement involves skipping the border into Mexico finding a rare and beautifully crafted pistol The Mexican returning it to Margolese Gene Hackman and walking away from everything happily. But Jerry's girlfriend Samantha Julia Roberts is tired of Jerry's continual lying and criminal feats so she dumps him and heads for Las Vegas.After arriving in Mexico unscathed Jerry soon finds himself at the wrath of thugs murderers and hit men intent on stealing The Mexican from him. Meanwhile Samantha finds herself taken hostage by a gay hit man with a heart named Leroy James Gandolfini of Get Shorty and TV's The Sopranos who  by following all of the Hollywood cliches  is an amiable likable guy who wouldn't harm a fly.The advertising for The Mexican had it all wrong. The studios advertised it as a sweet funny comedy starring two of Hollywood's biggest stars. The major copout is that Pitt and Roberts share most of the film far apart from each other  which isn't a huge problem anyway as it provides a pleasant twist on the repetitive buddy formula. But the movie's twisting turning violent harsh style soon grows weary  especially as the second hour draws nearer. The end almost redeems the rest of the film but not quite.The Mexican is primarily interested in doing things that have already been done before such as culture clashing. Take for instance the scene where Jerry spends a good minute or so trying to tell a band of traveling hombres that he needs a ride to the nearest town. Somehow Jerry confuses carro for deniro and the driver's eyes suddenly light up. Robert De Niro? he asks with a big gaptoothed grin. Another joke that indicates foreign countries know more about Hollywood than actual language. Harhar. It'd be funny if it hadn't been done before.If you're looking for something harsh The Mexican may very well be too sweet. And vice versa. The movie is too wishwashy  sometimes it wants to be the next gritty comedy Trainspotting and sometimes it's aiming for cute gimmicks and completely silly characters.And then even worse than trying jokes and failing The Mexican never even strives to give us funny moments. In that scene where Jerry tries to hail a ride to the next town the punchline is never delivered. All road travel movies are about confusion usually resulting in two people misunderstanding each other. What should have happened is this Jerry has a hard time explaining to the Mexican driver that he wants a ride. Finally they both understand each other and Jerry thinks everything is OK but soon finds himself being left in the dust by the car which continues driving on. Because confusion is funny and The Mexican never understands this. That is one of its most fundamental flaws.".

Finally they both understand each other and Jerry thinks everything is OK but soon finds himself being left in the dust by the car which continues driving on. Because confusion is funny and The Mexican never understands this. That is one of its most fundamental flaws.";

	schema:headline " The passage of independents";
	schema:reviewBody "The only other Schlndorff movie I was aware of having seen before this was Palmetto a hypertwisty neonoir made in the States . I liked that movie a whole lot but it didn't prepare me for Homo Faber which is very dense well made and literary. Definitely not the man with hot pants type of neo noir like Palmetto The Hot Spot Body Heat Romeo is Bleeding c. Indeed it's not that obviously noir because it's steers free of many of the cycle's clichs whilst keeping what is perhaps the essential ingredient fatalism wherein an initial mistake spirals out of control and controls your destiny. The film is not conceptual film noir it doesn't wallow in the plot arc or the destruction of a character. The only film I feel I can truly compare it to is the English Patient. Both movies have romantic themes have extremely good literarybased scripts contain educated wellspoken protagonists excellent location shooting unobtrusive period recreation and take place in eras not too far apart in time.So Homo Faber is a man Walter Faber a prodigal engineer who seems like a laid back cross between Fitzcarraldo and Brunel. He's too caught up in his romance with engineering to seize the moment and the girl. He is reminiscent in this sense of Dominic in Youth Without Youth and Zetterstrm in Allegro excellent films both loveblind men caught up in their pursuits linguistics and piano playing. As Cupid is the real God and reigns over drama these men must be punished.Homo Faber is Latin for The Man Who Forges His Own Destiny which is ironic because in the film Faber is subject to a series of extremely rare coincidences seemingly manipulated by Providence. There's a duality though because in a very real sense he has forged his own destiny it's just that it's inescapable.The movie is a luscious wonder it takes place all over the world in often exotic locations and the recreation of late 50s period details works really well there are far too many look at me type films where the production team feel the need to introduce absolutely superfluous period details. I mentioned the phrase the passage of independents in my title which needs explaining. You come across many characters in the movie who are independent. Even when Faber is in love and travelling in Europe quite often he will go off on his own or she will go off on her own. The folks here are extremely insulated from the manipulations of others. Faber even has the annoying habit of ignoring questions put to him. I think the movie is very ambivalent on the subject of independence which is displayed as being quite heartless however on the other hand you can see for example that if Faber had maintained his cloying New York relationship that would clearly have been the wrong move. So the film allows you to make up your own mind on that subject and really in the process becomes elegiac.To be more forthright on the subject the film may indeed be best described as being about the folly of existentialism. Although as mentioned there is a large level of ambiguity to this. Faber the intellectual Philistine at one point draws a blank when Sabeth mentions Camus and his existentialist although Camus rejected this term novel The Stranger and then makes a joke when Sabeth asks him if he knows about Sartre and existentialism aren't those the guys who dress in black and drink espresso quote from memory. This is despite him being what I would describe as a textbook existentialist himself. He is an authentic person full of enthusiasm for his own interests who lives for himself whilst recognising his level of duty and its strict limits. When he truly starts to understand love and although he feels absolutely nothing in the presence of art is able to appreciate the happiness of Sabeth whilst she appreciates art it is too late for Faber.Couldn't recommend it more highly would help a lot if you liked The English Patient. Is currently available via DVD from Germany.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps the saddest love story of the 1990s";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely moving and tragic tale of hopeless love between a middleaged man and a young girl who ultimately discover that they are really father and daughter. Such situations do arise. Many stories are known of brothers and sisters and less frequently of fathers and daughters who have been separated all their lives meet when adult fall in love and even marry. It is because they are irresistibly drawn to each other for reasons they do not comprehend and they have no previously existing incest taboo. In fact it would be more usual than not for such a couple to end up in love. This story is taken from the novel HOMO FABER published in 1957 by the famous Swiss author and playwright Max Frisch 19111991. Several grumpy reviews have been written by people complaining that the film is not sufficiently faithful to the original novel. Films rarely are and we just have to get used to that. The only time a novel was perfectly translated to the screen was in the case of that work of genius THE FOUNTAINHEAD 1949 where the novelist Ayn Rand not only wrote the screenplay but was given total creative control overriding even King Vidor as director and was able to choose her own leading man Gary Cooper as well. But otherwise it has never happened. As someone who has not read Frisch's novel I am free of the angst which so assails the distressed reviewers who have. The film is made magical by the performance of the enchanting Julie Delpy who at that age had stepped straight off a canvas by Botticelli. She achieves shadings of mood and emotion of infinite hue and shows a true genius whether it be purely instinctive or by design but it was impossible for me to watch this even for the second time without being spellbound at what she brings to the screen. Perfectly cast as her father is Sam Shepard though he is annoying for two reasons first that he never takes his hat off indoors which is simply infuriating and second that despite being supposed to be Swiss he cannot pronounce the name Joachim properly. Those two sins are hard to forgive. Otherwise he is splendid. But the main credit for this dazzling creation must go to the director the brilliant Volker Schlndorff who has achieved a true work of art. Delpy's mother is played by Barbara Sukowa who is a very famous actress in Germany despite her Polish name. She is always fascinating. In this film however she is required to play an extremely irritating character so she is far from sympathetic. But she does it very well. Shepard got Sukowa pregnant when they were young but she hysterically overreacted when she imagined him to be marrying her without sufficient enthusiasm and walked out on him just before the wedding and disappeared. She then married a man she didn't love and gave birth to Delpy who ended up fatherless because Sukowa left the man anyway. The whole tragedy was thus caused by Sukowa's headstrong and irrational behaviour. Twentyone years later Shepard meets Delpy on an ocean liner and they are irresistibly drawn to one another. He fights it but she is determined that she loves him and who could resist Delpy then or now? So love happens. They slowly make their way to Athens where Delpy's mother is working as an archaeologist and just before they get there it becomes clear that Delpy is Sukowa's daughter but Shepard still does not know whether she is really his daughter yet. Then a tragedy occurs. Delpy is bitten by a horned viper I didn't know they had them in Greece I thought they only had adders but I must be wrong and there is a desperate attempt by Shepard to get her to hospital and save her life. At this point Sukowa turns up. She is extremely unfriendly to poor Shepard before she even realizes there is any reason to be. They both worry together about Delpy and Sukowa confirms that she is really his daughter so the tragedy of his love for her becomes unescapable. Delpy survives the snakebite but further tragic events unfold and things get sadder still. I shall not reveal more. This is a long and deeply engrossing film made by a master perfectly cast and infinitely sad. What really makes it such a classic is the angelic waiflike quality of Delpy. She really is unique in the cinema and now she is also a director producer editor and composer as well. She did all that for 2 DAYS IN Paris 2007 see my review. So she is a phenomenon. But as an actress this film is one of her greatest achievements perhaps the finest.".

In my opinion for someone who has read the book and analysed it it will be easy to see all the awful flaws in the characters interpretation and actions. The hole set is nicely developed and explored but a few details in Hanna's apartment for example don't actually match with the characters personality. The book has a high quantity of symbols and metaphors and they are almost not shown in the film at all. The importance of small details like Walter constantly shaving in the book is superficially explored in the movie. Walter's disgust to Nature isn't shown at all! I think the movie could be more exciting. The plot has every spice it needed to be really great. Maybe if the actresses could have been better chosen since Ivy is just to old Hanna at the end just too young.. Only Sabeth fits perfectly into her role. Congratulations to Julie Delpy for once again performing so beautifully. About Walter Walter's interpretation of the role is unreal and unfaithful to the book. In the film Walter is a man full of charm seductive and caring. Where is all the distance coldheartiness of the book's character..? The controlfreak the workaholic character? While having sex with Ivy Walter usually thinks about planes and turbines but in the movie he is an amazing lover. Hanna's importance in Walter's love life is also not given enough importance. In the book walter says that only with Hanna wasn't sex absurd. She was afterall the true love of his life. The End of the film is an open ending in the book Walter eventually dies with Cancer after a huge change in his vision of the world. His relation towards nature totally mutates. He becomes a different man. Important details such as symbols that warn Walter about Sabeth's death and his own death as well are inexistent in the film.But in an overall and ignoring the fact that i've read the book by Max Frisch.. I've rated the film with 6 points knowing how old it is and how the budget might have been it's a nice Sundayafternoon film that let's you reflect about destiny.".

With her charm and outspoken personality he is soon drawn to her. The passion of their love affair and strong physical attraction makes this story all the more tragic as it unfolds. It is heartbreaking to witness the coolness and detachment which consume Faber as the realization of who this woman really is hits him. I almost cried to see how devastated Sabeth was at Faber's rejection of her. This is a truly great performance and have always admired Sam Shepard as one of the great actors of our time. Julie Delpy does a fantastic job portraying the young woman. Also her mother gives a good performance.I would highly recommend this film but to a more mature audience who is not easily shocked.".

On the other hand the movie brings across the immediacy of the tragic events much closer to home and resonate with a receptive audience. The novel and this movie try to show that life cannot be reduced to a simple formula and that the mind is not equipped to deal with the matters of the heart.

	schema:headline " Stays true to the book in every aspect  SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Books and movies have a strange relationship. It seems somehow necessary to turn every halfpopular book into a movie no matter if it works or not. The strangest thing about it is that most of the time it is not a genuine idea which gives the reason for making the movie but simply that a lot of people read the book.Consider Homo Faber based on the popular book by Max Frisch. Well it is mainly popular in German literature classes where students are forced to read and interpret it until every word is turned around and every meaning is squeezed out as it happens with all literature in school. Personally I thought Homo Faber was a rather unneccessary book boring dull complicated the meaning squattered all over the pages with abstract metaphors. The last 40 pages are simply a dread.So how could I possibly like the movie? Well I couldn't but at least I could stand it because it is easier to watch this strange story than to read it. The story is let's face it really absurd. A man crashes with a plane meets someone who is the brother of an old friend and finds together with him the friend who killed himself. Then he goes on a journey with a ship meets a beautiful woman falls in love travels with her through Europe and finds out she is his daughter. She has an accident he meets the motherhis exlover they argue the daughter dies the end. If this sounds like I gave away the ending I'm sorry but Faber the title character doesn't hesitate to say it himself quite early in the movie and the book.The story is full of implausible coincidences which aren't so obvious in the book with its complicated narration but in the straighttold movie it becomes very obvious how ridiculous this is. The movie is a typical checklist movie checking everything in the book and bringing it to the screen without any new ideas or innovation. It just straightens out the storytelling leaves away the awful last 40 pages and remains to be quite boring anyway.Schlndorff doesn't try anything new he just films the pages or maybe at least the surface of the pages. Technically the film is wellokay although the music gets quite annoying in the end and far too dramatic in the dramatic scenes. The blackwhite effect could have made sense if it would have been used constantly and with some kind of logic. The flashbacks are hurried away and leave the viewer confused.The acting is quite okay Sam Shepard does the best he can and he can be really good. Julie Delpy is another case for the Love or Hatefile while I have to admit I don't love her. Barbara Sukowa as Hanna leaves us with no emotions for her character and August Zirner as Joachim is nothing more than a silhouette.So if you liked the book it is pretty likely that you will like the film. If you didn't like the book or haven't read it it is more unlikely that you will like it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Books and movies have a strange relationship. It seems somehow necessary to turn every halfpopular book into a movie no matter if it works or not. The strangest thing about it is that most of the time it is not a genuine idea which gives the reason for making the movie but simply that a lot of people read the book.Consider Homo Faber based on the popular book by Max Frisch. Well it is mainly popular in German literature classes where students are forced to read and interpret it until every word is turned around and every meaning is squeezed out as it happens with all literature in school. Personally I thought Homo Faber was a rather unneccessary book boring dull complicated the meaning squattered all over the pages with abstract metaphors. The last 40 pages are simply a dread.So how could I possibly like the movie? Well I couldn't but at least I could stand it because it is easier to watch this strange story than to read it. The story is let's face it really absurd. A man crashes with a plane meets someone who is the brother of an old friend and finds together with him the friend who killed himself. Then he goes on a journey with a ship meets a beautiful woman falls in love travels with her through Europe and finds out she is his daughter. She has an accident he meets the motherhis exlover they argue the daughter dies the end. If this sounds like I gave away the ending I'm sorry but Faber the title character doesn't hesitate to say it himself quite early in the movie and the book.The story is full of implausible coincidences which aren't so obvious in the book with its complicated narration but in the straighttold movie it becomes very obvious how ridiculous this is. The movie is a typical checklist movie checking everything in the book and bringing it to the screen without any new ideas or innovation. It just straightens out the storytelling leaves away the awful last 40 pages and remains to be quite boring anyway.Schlndorff doesn't try anything new he just films the pages or maybe at least the surface of the pages. Technically the film is wellokay although the music gets quite annoying in the end and far too dramatic in the dramatic scenes.

Schlndorff's most known movie are all based on works from famous authors and this one here is no exception. The cast includes Oscar nominee Sam Shepherd who looks like taken right out of a Hitchcock or film noir movie Julie Delpy probably the most stunning most natural and most beautiful actress out there in the early 90s and Barbara Sukowa who is a really weak actress usually with her constant overacting but bearable in here even if the European Film Award nomination is an utter joke.The story is about a man who on a business trip falls in love with a much younger woman. After some initial struggles about how even if a relationship may work out the two are truly happy but luck may not be on the protagonist's side this time after early on he survives a plane crash without any injuries. He seems to be very cold and calculating but when he meets Delpy's character he offers us and his love a totally new side emotional and caring until the ghosts from his past come back to haunt him. Won't go any further into detail to avoid major spoilers but this was such an unrealistic development but I guess Frisch had it in his base material so they had to include it here too. Also everything before he meets Delpy's character is fairly forgettable to me and I could have done without it even if the film may not have crossed the 90minute mark this way. Overall despite occasional criticisms I thought this was a really good watch for the most part and I can definitely recommend checking this one out. Oh yeah you may also find it under the title Voyager.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this film sounded interesting but as it went along I found it annoying. A film should play on different emotions within the audience but annoyance isn't one of them.I think Voyager is the most pretentious piece of twaddle I've seen in a long time. And I say this because it is actually well enough made and the filmmakers went to some trouble and expense to make it but it takes itself incredibly seriously based on little substance.The story which starts in 1957 is built around coincidence. On a trip from South America an engineer Walter Faber Sam Sheppard encounters a number of people with connections to his past. As he travels from place to place the connections bring him back to a preWW2 relationship.Sam Sheppard plays Werner with such an air of fatalistic detachment that it is almost as though he is on heavy medication for depression. By the end of the film I felt I should get some of that for myself because there aren't many light moments in Voyager it's heavy going all the way.Werner has an affair with a woman who could be his daughter. This element of the story had the potential to be a bit icky and is. The plot of Voyager goes into an evertightening spiral until Werner just about disappears up his own backside.Mind you I don't mind a challenging movie or even an obscure one. We've had movies told from the point of view of people who didn't know they were dead and ones where everything is seen from the viewpoint of someone suffereing from schizophrenia but the obscurity in Voyager is heavyhanded.The film produces the unexpected death card twice. The first time was effective the second was annoying. To try the same plot device twice was simply misjudgement. The film ends with more fuzzy musings from Werner on the meaningless of his life. I've got no use for suicide it doesn't alter the fact that one has been in the world. What I wished was that I had never existed at all.What the? Werner's motivation throughout seems odd but the script has him flatulently expounding on just about everything without saying anything remotely profound.Despite a great deal of technical competence and earnest performances Voyager takes us on a journey where we are led around in circles. My annoyance comes mainly from the expectation that it would be a work of greater depth.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Other Boleyn Girl hit theaters today and of course I was in for the first showing. I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now ever since I first heard it was in production. Why can't directors seem to get it right when it comes to this time period?I understand completely the Hollywood concept of dramatic flair for the big screen. But there is a difference between dramatic flair and complete revisionist history. This movie makes the HBO series The Tudors seem like a BBC documentary as far as factual information is concerned.Now the director is not all to blame. Phillippa Gregory does a damn good job of distorting the truth in this alternate interpretation of the story of Anne Boleyn. Her portrayal of Anne as ruthlessly ambitious and downright devilish is at odds with the softer portrayals favored by Jean Plaidy and other authors of this period. Anne's own diaries would suggest her true personality to be more of the unwilling victim and royal pawn in the schemes cooked up by her ambitious male relatives. Only when she discovered that her path in life would be to submit or face death or exile does she succumb to Henry's advances. The opening scenes of the movie concern how Anne and Henry met. Well there is debate on this the movie selects Hever. I'll allow that. But this first it was most certainly not in front of the whole court and followed by a hunt in which Henry takes a tumble to be nursed back to health by Mary Anne's OLDER sister the movie and book portrays her as the younger sisterthis is false. Anne's ambitions are apparent from this very day she indeed seems to find her father and uncle's schemes appealing and agrees to hunt his majesty. Hardly the case in reality. Anne was in love with and betrothed to Henry Percy at the time of her first meeting with Henry. The movie has it backwards. She does not settle for Percy only after Mary has stolen Henry. Another extremely annoying point of order here.Cardinal Wolsey is completely absent from this film. This is such a blaring error as to render the movie completely abominable. Wolsey is such a force in the entire drama from the arrangement of the marriage AND the divorce to all matters of state and religion in betweento leave him out is both amateur and foolish not to mention a missed opportunity for much needed plot thickening.Running through the laundry list of other inaccuracies.Anne was not EXILED to France because she fumbled her attempt to seduce Henry. This is utterly ridiculous. It is well known that both Anne and Mary practically grew up in the French court from the time they were 12 to their late teens. Only then did the sisters join the English court much less begin their dramas with the king. And she was not brought back to entertain Henry whilst Mary lay in with his child. AgainAnne most strongly wanted to marry her first love Henry Percy Duke of Northumberland. But once Henry had set his eyes upon her and chose to make her his own then and only then were her uncle and father's schemes put into motion. Their original intentions were to milk the longgoing affair of her sister Mary for all it was worth.Now as for the incest theory. Gregory is taking a huge risk here by suggesting that the allegation levied upon Anne and her brother George was indeed founded in truth borne out of Anne's desperation to get with child after her miscarriage. I do believe Anne was desperate to get pregnant quickly and she was very close to her brotherbut this is a huge leap and one true historians would never make. It also suggest that something other than Henry's brute desires were at play here when he charged them with treason which is not the case. He simply wanted to be rid of Anne to beget a male heir off of his next mistress.And good graciouswhat of the rape scene? Not only is this disturbing but so far fetched. Although Anne resisted for years when she finally gave in to Henry she did believe herself to be in love with himor at the very least resigned to accept her fate. And Henry was completely besotted with her.why else would he break from Rome Catholicism and risk his kingdom for anything less? No he would not have raped Anne for their first sexual encounter. He was a brute but he was most concerned of his image of the romantic courtier when it came to women's affections.Finally a note on the characters. Portman does an acceptable job portraying the character from the bookeven though this character is not the true Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes a lovely Maryand probably quite close to the real woman. As for Banaa sore disappointment. Bad casting bad acting. Is this the same Bana of the acclaimed Munich and Troy? Where was the range? He comes across as flat and not well studied. Jonathon Rhys Meyers of the HBO Tudors blows him out of the water on all levels.sensuality intensity and evil as Henry the 8th.Why can't I just watch these movies and leave feeling entertained? I don't quite knowI care too much about 15th century England for some reason. It became hardwired in me after watching Anne of the Thousand Days as a young girl. No Tudor movie since then has gotten close in accuracy or sheer entertainment since then. Burton and Bujold are classic and untouchable. But after watching this hack job I have to say I am looking forward to the new season of the Tudors on HBO.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes the Truth is Stranger Than Fiction";
	schema:reviewBody "A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of madeformovie material but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language beautiful sets and costumes and some Alist names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy but nearly drowns in melodrama.And it's not entirely the movie's fault. Boleyn Girl follows the story of both Anne Natalie Portman and Mary Scarlett Johansson Boleyn and their relationship with the English court. King Henry VIII Eric Bana has trouble producing a male heir so the Boleyn family offers their daughter Anne to bed. When Henry has a hunting accident due to Anne's carelessness he is nursed and subsequently charmed by innocent Mary. But Mary is already married so the King promotes her husband and sends the couple to court where he can meet with Mary whenever he pleases. Mary falls in love with Henry and becomes his mistress. Anne the elder sister is scorned by what she believes is her sister's ultimate betrayal and plots revenge. The two continue on in these roles for some time swapping places in bed with Henry and spurting out babies while their relatives egg them on. This isn't quite how things went down in reality but the changes are minor and seem necessary to condense the timeline and create at least one sympathetic character.The Other Boleyn Girl fares best when it's exploring the relationship between Anne and Mary. This isn't the first story of sister rivalry but the dynamic between Anne and Mary is extraordinarily wellplayed. Their previous roles and their public images make Portman and Johansson perfect fits. We believe Portman to be intelligent and coy and Johansson to be naive and desired. More  we believe these roles might be easily reversed. As sisters their relationship is deeply disturbing they love each other they hate each other they're unable to escape the expectations placed upon them by their family. As an older sister with an admittedly notasscrewedup relationship I found this portrayal very realistic  rich with emotion and complex meaning.I wish I could say the rest of the movie was as artful. There's constant allusion and foreshadowing to the Boleyn demise through use of visual and editing metaphors. If some details were twisted other details might have been cut out  too many tearfilled scenes means that this eventually feels like a soap opera. At one point in the movie Anne is sent off to France and comes back wearing a very distracting B charm which she sports until the end of the movie. When I finally finished inventing what else B might stand for besides Boleyn there are plenty of other fits I wondered about Anne's character. She's now praised as being changed and thus back in play but I don't see it  she was smart and ambitious before and only gained a bit of wit during her trip to France  certainly not the drastic change everyone seemed to be making it out to be. There are some very poorly done scenes where supporting cast spell out the politics of the situation for you. This is a little condescending and probably unnecessary if not repetitive. The costumes are beautiful but the matching dresses become unbelievable and even plain in places. PETA must have a field day with this movie and its use of fur and meat. You won't get to see Scarlett Johansson naked in this movie in case you were wondering  just lots of fuzzy sex montages weirdly full of backlit hair and fur. Katherine of Aragon Henry VIII's first wife is given some of the most powerful lines in the movie but they're delivered with such woodenness that my disappointment must be made known.The Other Boleyn Girl could be so much more. As a hyperdramatic costume flick it does stand out. There's more than meets your eye and the costarring performances are not to be missed. There's a lot of material to cover in this story but a simplified script would have helped keep this film farther away from melodrama. Especially with a true story as wild as this there's not a lot that needs to be changed or added to grip the viewer. Any embellishments verge on destroying believability and creating situations we can't relate to.".

	schema:reviewBody "All and all not a particularly enjoyable film.This movie sacrifices all that was interesting about the novel in the first place just to squeeze in all the historical aspects. All of the page turning scenes in the book that would have been interesting to see translated to screen Anne's bloodstained dress the deformed child the courtship between Mary and William were cut.Fortuanatly I expected that. With such a long book I had to expect most of my favourite scenes were going to get the axe.What I didn't expect was for the narration to change from that of Mary aka. The Other Boelyn Girl for which the book was named to yet another story about Anne Boelyn. The film started off well if rather slow with the story being told from Mary but it quickly changes gears as the audience is suddenly following Anne's courtship of Henry and Anne's trials emotions and desperation. Mary is quickly delegated to little more then a secondary role with many key moments happening while she isn't on screen.The story of Anne was told well she was portrayed brilliantly by Portman and had several fun and emotional moments. But that's just the problem I've seen that all before. There have been dozens of films series and books written from Anne's point of view. If I wanted to see a story about Anne I would have watched Anne of the Thousand Days or maybe The Tudors HBO series. What made this story special was it told the story behind Anne and Henry and it was mostly fictional which added to the drama. Unfortunately the movie ignored this and thus failed to create the same reaction I had towards the book. Another problem is that of characterisation I expected that the movie would make the two sisters friends as it creates more drama towards the end as opposed to them being not particularly close like in the book. Same with the enormous changes they made in the personalities of the parents and honestly almost every characterI expected it. Many of the characters in the movie were actually more twodimensional then the callous characters from the book. It wasn't as though this movie was badly acted or written...it was just bad.The person I was most disappointed about was George one of my favourites in the book who was given a woefully small role although the actor who portrayed him did it brilliantly. Also The character of William Stafford seemed to be added in as an afterthought which confused the audience who hadn't read the book the two main questions I heard were Is that the guy she married in the beginning or What happened to the guy she married in the beginning and left those of us who had read the book wondering why he was portrayed as such a pansy?And the editing where to begin. Horrible the particularly poignant scenes few and far between as they were were not given enough time to sink in before the audience was whisked off to another scene. Even having read the source material I was lost so I can only imagine how it must have been from those new to the story. The only bright side of this tedious film were the beautiful costumes but even the bright colours and swirly dresses couldn't distract anyone with more then a 10 second attention span and despite them the movie soon became unbearably boring.All in all this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was apparent there was too much story to tell in two hours it had miniseries written all over it. But seeing as it had to be made for the film industry to cash in the the books success it could have been done a lot better.".

Watching this film with this attitude really helped me enjoy it rather than be upset that all the historic characters' personalities were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable. I suggest anyone else going to see this movie adopt this attitude too.Sitting back I proceeded to enjoy the scenery the costumes the beautiful actresses portraying the Boleyn girls and the over the top acting.It was a fun movie and it moved along quickly. Scarlet Johansson and Natalie Portman were excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Eric Bana played a very conflicted Henry VIII who is continually frustrated by not getting a male heir. Eric Bana was not very good in this movie I'm not sure what it was maybe it was the way how the character was written or that he was just not comfortable in the role. He was extremely miscast as King Henry.The one to watch in this film is Natalie Portman who seems to have a grand time playing the evil scheming Anne Boleyn.I am pleased to see that all the women in this film like Lady Boleyn Anne Boleyn Mary Boleyn and Queen Catherine of Aragon were portrayed as having strong characters and not easily pushed around. Even Mary Boleyn who seemingly always acquiesce to the wishes of her father and uncle decided in the end to run off and marry someone who truly loves her.It's a very entertaining film. Just remember that it's only someone's version of the Tudor history not the real history and you won't run into trouble!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters Anne and Mary.Natalie Portman Anne and Scarlett Johansson Mary are outstanding as characters engaged in both sibling rivalry and sisterly bonding. In the central relationship of the sisters the film develops the social roles and imposed limitations on women in Tudor England.One of the film's most moving character portrayals is the mother of the two Boleyn Sisters. In the heartbreaking performance of Kristin Scott Thomas Elizabeth Boleyn can only watch helplessly as her daughters become pawns of the greedy men Thomas Boleyn and the Duke of Norfolk who use the young women much like pimps in order to line their pockets and further their own advancement at court. Another sterling aspect of the film is the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon Ana Torent another victim of the men due to the obsessive pursuit of Henry VIII to beget a male heir leading to his momentous divorce from Katherine and England's break with the church of Rome.While commentators may point out the omissions of many of the details from the novel by Philippa Gregory the film is still true to the spirit of the book. It is also a faithful representation of the role of women in Tudor age. The film effectively presents the gender issues from the perspective of many of the remarkable women of the age along with the reminder of the greatest legacy of Anne Boleyn which was the indirect result of her relationship of Henry VIII. That legacy was the future ruler of England...and also a woman Elizabeth I.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I will admit that since I am descended from Mary BoleynI do have a bit of family honor at stake here....I knew the film was going to take liberties with historical truth but REALLY. The Other Boleyn Girl is almost PURE FICTION from beginning to end. Why did they bother to tack on SOME accurate historical outcomes in written sentence form of the characters at the end just before the credits rolled? Just to name a couple of examples Mary Boleyn was married to William Carey as depicted and Henry took her as his mistress with Carey's approval as he was richly rewarded. Maybe emotionally conflicted approval I don't know. I rather doubt it. Anyway in the film Mary marries a commoner at the end. The film never explains what happened to Carey it would seem to suggest she is committing bigamy! In the closing writeover we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy in fact her family coldly rejected her because she brought down their status. She suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage but was still glad she finally married for love. Other things that are totally false Anne and Mary did not hang out all the time as is suggested in the film I understand that serves the plot well so maybe I will let that one go. Can't let this one go Henry raping Anne before she surrendered to him. That is ridiculous. And Anne convincing her brother to have incest with her so as to produce an heir? That is even more ridiculous. She would never have broken the incest taboo also if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time as Anne suggests in the film then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower! Speaking of being sent to the Tower in real life Anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution likely she was trying to protect her daughter Elizabeth and better secure her daughter's future relationship with Henry. She was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed. This is not at all how Anne is portrayed in the film. Cardinal Wolsey is left out of the movie entirely and he played a MAJOR role in the whole drama of the divorce from Catherine of Aragon and Henry's desire for Anne Boleyn. I just don't see why this same type of movie could not have been made with FICTIONAL kings and queens and other charactersno authentic names. Then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating. Of course it could not then claim to be based on Gregory's book about Mary Boleyn. I don't plan to read that there are too many accurate books about Henry VIII that are no doubt more interesting and I can read about poor Mary Boleyn in those.".

	schema:headline " The Other Boleyn Girl A Rulebook for Serious Films";
	schema:reviewBody "The Other Boleyn Girl is one of those films that is so boring that you start picking out the logical errors with the plot. To begin with Henry VIII's private life has been the subject of countless films. Unless a movie can provide a fresh take on this familiar subject matter then there is no point in making it. Yet aside from this criticism The Other Boleyn Girl also suffers from the fatal flaw of being stupid. The beginning of the film sees Henry VIII Eric Bana impregnate Mary Boleyn Scarlett Johannson with a son. You would think that Henry VIII would then divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Mary thereby legitimizing his son's eventual succession to the throne. Yet for reasons that are not at all clear Henry VIII acts like the cad who who breaks off all contact with a girl he had just impregnated rather than a monarch who is desperate for a male heir. So even within its own logic this film breaks down.If this is not bad enough we have an even more illogical episode to follow that one. After spending a pleasant holiday in France Anne Boleyn comes back to England with a mission to seduce the king. But her plan is to treat Henry VIII like dirt and be snobbish and obnoxious to everyone else. Of course I do not hold any of these things against Anne necessarily because it is nice to see the titled aristocracy getting taken down a couple of pegs. Yet what does not make sense is that Henry VIII would marry her afterwards especially considering that there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. I also do not understand why Anne Boleyn was devastated when the king lost all interest in her. She did become queen after all and it was not as if she was in love with Henry. With this many illogical scenes Anne's deep seated anguish comes across as forced rather than sincere. The film makers asked Natalie Portman to cry a river and she cried a river for them. At the end of watching The Other Boleyn Girl I came to the realization that this movie should have been made into a softcore sex comedy of the 1970s variety. The execution scenes can be cut extended sex scenes with Scarlett Johannson can be inserted and the dialogue can be lighter and feature more sly wit and humour. That way this film will not have to live up to its unrealistic pretensions to greatness and can be a rousing entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't Elizabeth The Golden Age awful or the television series The Tudors softpornographic trash then it is The Other Boleyn Girl the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film Longford and the Oscar winning for its lead actors The Queen and The Last King of Scotland his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast including Eric Bana Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So why is it that this film which is filled with great talent and potential delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year right in the middle of the awards season. Yet for some reason it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known but as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.That's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it the film is for an hour and a quarter perfectly pleasant with intrigue scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in Lost in Translation and The Girl with the Pearl Earring. The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.It is a perfectly bearable watch but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through the film's focus continually shifts failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might or should be. He is more driven then driving whilst his first wife Catherine of Aragon Ana Torrent is given very little time on screen thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with halfanhour to go with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene which seems to be the start of the culmination with so many points of interest going on in it proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes whilst quite stylish are drawn out and slow and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.It's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer. It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon but it won't live long in the memory.".

For those of yous who don't know your Tudor history don't worry you don't need too on second thought it'll probably be better if you don't know the story just treat this as a FICTIONAL eyeopener and yes it is extremely historically incorrect OKay...disturbing themes and historical inaccuracies aside the movie has brilliant acting by it's leads. Johansson is very capable and believable as Mary yes I know...I'm shocked too whilst Portman is psychotically intense as Anne I'll explain later. The supporting cast is decent Kristen Scott Thomas is morally intune in the Boleyns' mother and Jim Sturgess is BRILLIANT as their tragic brother George.The story on the other hand is WAY too rushed you can SO CLEARLY tell that sonypictures butchered this movie up...BADLY thus I'll be waiting for a director's cut indefinitely.OK...first half of this movie is DULLer than the movie's godawful cinematography the audiences' disinterest is NOT helped by Peter Morgan's lazy script. The first half drags and drags....UNTIL the director and writer decides to go all HAPPY TREE FRIENDS on the lead characters and I don't mean in the bloody fun way either.Whilst Scarlett Johansson's Mary remains the movie's 'somewhat' moral center....Natalie Portman's Anne goes bloody bizerk yes in the crazy psychotic bitch sense...kudos to her for bringing such intensity and whatever realism she can to the clearly bias role although at points you may what to strangle Anne for her conniving ruthlessness you nevertheless feel for her and especially her brother in the end.Make no mistake this is NOT a movie for the softhearted as I explained before the second half contains MANY series of disturbing stomachwrenching events that will leave you clutching your seat or packet of Orange TicTac in my case making the first ELIZABETH movie seem like the most feelgood movie of 1999. SO CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED! All in all bad direction awesome acting and melodramatically disturbing story with a beautiful score by Paul Cantelon and gorgeous costumes by Sandy Powell. A would overall give it a generous 7 stars out of 10.I hope I left this review as spoiler free as possible.".

	schema:headline " Inaccurate historical detail";
	schema:reviewBody "This story is not close to being correct. First off Anne was the younger sister born in 1510. Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover. She became pregnant and was married off to William Carey. The King NEVER acknowledged her child as his. Anne was STILL in France with Queen Claude. She was never banished to France. She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain. When Anne returned she fell in love with Harry Percy who was NOT betrothed to anyone It was a love match. The King saw Anne and became besotted. He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot. Henry adored Anne. He was never anything but generous to her and she hated him only a little less than she hated The Cardinal Wolsey. She blamed them for separating her from her love Harry Percy. The King pursued her and she refused him this went on for 6 years. she finally fell in love with him. They married after he split from Rome and were happy. Elizabeth was born and Henry changed the Act of Succession to make Elizabeth his heir. It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough. The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end. One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower when I no longer hated him he began to hate meThis is a great story if told correctly. This movie was awful. Anne was not guilty of adultery and the scene with her brother never happened.In fact it was the situation with Mark Smeaton a court musician that caused Anne's downfall. She was accused with him he was tortured to admit guilt and with all of Henry's friends from the time he had first met Anne her brother was thrown in to make sure there was no sympathy for the Queen. Interestingly even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused. Jane Seymour was no longer a secret. I am amazed that such an inaccurate movie would be made and the worst part of this is that in a time when women had little to no power a young girl changed the face of the world.By refusing the greatest man in the land..The King. Her end was tragic and not her fault. It was the doing a spoiled and old man who was always looking for the greener grass. The movie was shot horribly and the costumes were seen too often. Katherine of Aragon was not an ugly woman but one worn down by lost children and a philandering husband.The best movie on this subject was Anne of The Thousand Days. The Tudors on Showtime is good but also rife with historical inaccuracies. Mary was not the saint she was made out to be but a whore who gave everyone everything and asked for nothing. She did live a quite life after the death of her sister.And her children were honored by Elizabeth I".

His part was small but his performance was big. I wished there had been more of the brother.The costumes also should win something anything. They were amazing and really stood out.All in all it was a a pretty good movie. It really grabbed you and kept you in their world for two hours.

Eric Bana didn't really have a lot to work with either pity because I had a high regard for him after the castle and the nugget. The cinematography was also terrible with the majority of the scenes being very poorly focused It wasn't soft focus or pull focus it was just rubbish and very poorly done. In fact it was on a par with the script as one of the worst things about the movie.Some of the comments I heard when exiting the theatre mirrored my thoughts but used a few more expletives...Unfortunately I would neither recommend it to a friend or my most feared enemy.I am sorry to say that the only thing I can say in it's defence was that 'the costumes were quite well done' but even they were not exceptional...I was happy when it was over but would have been happier if I'd seen the scriptwriter and the director get executed rather than the boleyn family.Did I mention how rubbish the cinematography and the script were?

Yes Renaissance invented the Love but not lonely. There supposed to be growing artists poets sculptors etc. Where are they?

I am a huge history buff especially in the time of England's dark ages I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more oomph sort of speak like most other pictures but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.The Boleyn has quite a family a mother father a son and two daughters. After failing at several attempts for Queen Catherine to have a son heir to King Henry's thrown he wishes for a mistress. Sir Thomas Boleyn offers his daughter Anne but when King Henry sees Thomas's other daughter Mary he is smitten with her and wants her as his mistress. She gives birth to a son but they are not married and she is looked down upon. Anne is given a second chance to come back after a marriage that was not granted and then annulled but King Henry then falls for her and wishes her to give herself to him but she puts up a fight and tells him not until she assumes the crown and to be his wife. But she fails to give him a son her life depends on it as well sadly.The true story of Anne Boleyn is very sad but extremely interesting I wouldn't recommend the book just go for a regular history book when it comes to this story. But for the movie The Other Boleyn Girl I liked it it had good acting beautiful costumes and sets and a very good story. If you are looking for a history lesson this is not the film for you but if you are looking for a good movie then watch it. Just like the film Elizabeth they make the story a little more juicy it's for the sake of some audience members who don't understand why England has the system it does but it still makes for good drama.710".

Leaving out baby Catherine showing William Stafford as a smiling fool screwing up Henry Percy's story completely and forgetting to mention Catherine entirely after her trial was over was a poor effort.One of the things that annoyed me most was when Henry raped Anne. There is no historical evidence whatsoever to show that he would have done this and every suggestion to the contrary. He either loved her with a passion or ignored her entirely. With Henry there was rarely any middle ground. The other incredibly annoying scene was at George's execution where the crowd shouted and jeered as he had to be dragged to the block. In actual reality he stood calmly before the crowd and announced his innocence and respect for the queen. The producer's effort in 'spicing things up' by making things appear worse then they actually were was degrading to the fine lives of these characters most of who died with dignity.".

In actual reality he stood calmly before the crowd and announced his innocence and respect for the queen. The producer's effort in 'spicing things up' by making things appear worse then they actually were was degrading to the fine lives of these characters most of who died with dignity.";

	schema:headline " The Writers Need to go back to British History Class";
	schema:reviewBody "The Other Boleyn Girl probably marks the debut of an adaptation of the most intriguing tale of English Royal history. However very poorly does the film actually describe the events. I must say that probably the only accurate part of this movie is the inevitable endingwhich I won't give away because there may be a few who don't actually know what happens.I am quite the Anne Boleyn fanatic. She is one of my favorite historical figures due to her intelligence wit and ambition. But this film completely let me down. Obviously Ms. Gregory and the people working on the film are partial to Mary Boleyn for they idolize her throughout and scorn Anne. What for? Mary Boleyn was a naive and vain young woman who only wished for the king's attention for as long as any ordinary mistress could have it. She was unintelligent. Anne however used strategy to get what she wanted. She did not wish for love perhaps not a noble thing but at least she was honest about it she wished for power. And she got it. Because of her refusals she became Queen of England. It was only her growing ego and ambition that destroyed herquite the theme however the writers ignored it and decided to go with the clich love conquers all. Of course that is a noble truth but Anne's downfall is much more interesting. I recommend reading her biography and the somewhat fictional diary by Carolyn Meyer.The one thing I despised about this movie was how terribly inaccurate it was. Not only was it shown that one sister was favored over another by the writers but also the historical portion was completely wrong. For one Anne Boleyn was not the elder more social and beautiful of the two. On the contrary Mary was older by two or three years and she was welcomed in by society because of her beauty and popularity. Anne was younger darker and she had two imperfections A mole on her neck believed to be Devil markings and a sixth finger on her right hand. When she went to France she learned how to cover these imperfections and make herself seem flawless. Her wit was always present. And although I adore Eric Bana he was a poor choice to play Henry VIII one of the most morbidly obese men in all of history.Also it is quite evident throughout that Anne was vying for Henry's affections all along however Mary was the one who wanted to be his mistress. Anne was busy with a poet and musician in court until Henry began to take interest in her. Perhaps because I am partial to Anne I found this movie so horrible. But I understand that she was a flawed human being who fell because of her ego. Still the movie represented almost all of the characters horribly exaggerated. Anne was too bad Mary was too good Henry was too brutal etc. I believe the only accurate characters in the film were the girls' mother father and uncle. their parts were true to history and made for an interesting relationship to follow. I suppose I don't see the necessity of changing fact to fiction. The true story is already interesting enough. Even if the writers etc. have differing opinions there are many ways to illustrate a character as good or evil without altering history. People need to learn that history itself is a story that needs to be told ACCURATELY. It makes more sense it's more believable and it's much more entertaining for people like me who obsess over such inconsistencies. Historical Accuracy aside the movie was way too melodramatic for my tastes. there were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen really understood their characters. Kudos for playing not just an historical figure but also for playing another person's opinion of an historical figure. It is not always easy. the action was very repetitive and most of it not very good. I'm sorry but I'd have to say no on this one. Even if you don't care about historical authenticity the movie itself isn't great.If you do care about the facts?? Run away. Fast.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suspect that had Dashiell Hammett never written a successful comic pot boiler detective story called THE THIN MAN William Powell's best remembered role would be as Florenz Ziegfeld in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. Here he captured that brilliant showman's vision and drive with just the right degree of sophistication. I can't think of few others  maybe Robert Montgomery but I sadly doubt it he seems too young  who could have done as first rate a job.It is really rare for a theatrical presence to maintain himself or herself decades or centuries after their death. Prior to the invention of motion pictures it was impossible except for the late 19th Century crowd starting with Edwin Booth Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry  they had some phonograph recordings for actors to preserve their personas. Photo stills helped but did not leave much. Occasionally one would accomplish something for good or ill that people would recall i.e. John Wilkes Booth but that was a rarity. Movies changed that by allowing the audience to stretch from the contemporaries to the future ones. There are actual movies of Flo Ziegfeld at work on Broadway. Unfortunately he did not look like Bill Powell Flo was somewhat fat but those surviving newsreels showed his energy with his casts and productions. Powell got that side of him right. THE GREAT ZIEGFELD traces the showman from his start as the publicity manager of Eugene Sandow Nat Pendleton from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 to his rise as a major Broadway impresario from 1900 until 1930. Only the Great Depression destroyed Ziegfeld's career he lost most of his fortune in the crash. Significantly his fall is showed by the lights of his four currently big shows including SHOWBOAT RIO RITA and THE THREE MUSKETEERS all fading out one after another. It not only destroyed his career but it helped kill the poor fellow he died in 1932. But by that point his historical reputation was established by his series of spectacular Broadway Follies shows with the likes of Ed Wynn Fanny Brice W.C.Fields Will Rogers Bert Williams Walter Catlett Leon Erroll as the comic leads and music by such composers as Jerome Kern Victor Herbert Irving Berlin and even the Gershwins. But better was Ziegfeld's use of women  his Glorifying the American Girl reviews did precisely that affecting taste in theater spectacles and taste in what beauty in women should be. He had his rivals as pointed out in other reviews here. Among them were the Shuberts possibly the most successful in the long run but only because there were several of them and they did not go bankrupt. Earl Carroll did produce his Vanities and George White did do the Scandals but in retrospect for all the talent they brought to their shows these were pale imitations. In Carroll's case he skirted the level of decency by suggesting his chorus girls were naked in some of the sketches. Ziegfeld was no saint but he knew what was acceptable behavior in theatrical production on stage.This film had a good cast. Besides Powell the women in his life Anna Held his chorus girl girlfriend and Billie Burke are played well by Louise Rainer Virginia Bruce and Powell's movie wife Myrna Loy. Rainer as the betrayed Anna got her first Oscar for this role most likely for the emotional telephone scene. Her part is actually a substantial one but due to the size of this film it has always been seen as a short supporting bit. This is a trifle unfair. Virginia Bruce brings a nice calculating eye to her performance undermining the Ziegfeld  Held relationship but slowly losing the showman due to her increasing alcoholism. Loy was really lucky. Once she got the role she contacted the living and active Billie Burke and had discussions about how to accurately portray the second Mrs. Ziegfeld. She wisely does not try to imitate Billie's familiar syrupy upper register voice. Frank Morgan appears as a friendly rival or Ziegfeld's both in business and in the boudoir. One likes him as one usually likes Morgan's comic characters. My favorite performance is that of Fanny Brice playing herself. The film was made the year after the death of Will Rogers so that he was not around he possibly could have been borrowed. Fields was out  Ziegfeld had had plenty of trouble with that curmudgeon on Broadway and MGM probably knew that Fields would have demanded equal billing to Powell. Wynn was mostly still on Broadway. One does wish Catlett and Erroll might have been used. But we have Fanny in her glory culminating in her singing her most famous number  My Man. That alone is worth watching the film for. As for the showcase production number on the spiraling tower it is quite impressive I doubt if Ziegfeld could have put it on the stage of his New Amsterdam Theater but I agree that the dubbing of Dennis Morgan's voice by Allan Jones is totally inexplicable to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like some huge lumbering Paleozoic beast with a heart nothing like this film has existed in a long time. And I doubt that there will be anything like it again. The Great Ziegfeld is a grandiose three hour BW cinematic opus that chronicles the true story more or less of the professional life of legendary producershowman Flo Ziegfeld played convincingly by William Powell. It is an interesting lovable film because it is so historically ... quaint.Structurally the narrative takes a chronological approach. However except for the film's starting year of 1893 and the ending soon after the 1929 stock market crash no dates are given a shortsighted flaw in the screenplay. But during this roughly fortyyear period we see Ziggy's ambition unfurl into a successful career of producing some of the most extravagant musical shows in history. And throughout the theme remains the same to glorify the American girl that is to say to glorify the early twentieth century stereotyped image of the American girl.Despite his success as a showman Ziggy was constantly plagued with financial problems and embroiled in relations with women the two most important being the humorously indecisive Anna Held and the lovely Billie Burke.More interesting to me than the biography is the lavish grandiose production numbers. In the most grandiose of all Dennis Morgan sings A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody as the camera ascends a slowly revolving spiral staircase adorned with Ziegfeld girls in outlandish costumes. The set resembling a wedding cake is about as tall as it is wide with the stage curtain rising to what seems like stratospheric heights.The film's strengths are its humorous script the dazzling sets the glamorous costumes the music a cameo appearance by Fanny Brice and a great tap dance routine by Ray Bolger. My main complaint is the film's length. Also I find it curious that this big budget beast with its theme of wealth and beauty came out right in the middle of the Great Depression. MGM must have been on a colossal ego trip.Overall The Great Ziegfeld is fun and definitely worth watching especially as a time capsule to an entertainment era that is gone forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GREAT ZIEGFELD MetroGoldwynMayer 1936 directed by Robert Z. Leonard and choreography by Seymour Felix stars William Powell as the legendary Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. 18691932 in a factandfiction musical biography that can be summed up from its opening credits suggested by romances and events. From the very start with its very impressive theatrical lighted title credits lasting over two minutes one would expect this to be a lavish scale production and it is. So lavish that it leaves the impression the initials of MGM actually stands for Mighty Grand Musical considering its great length of three solid hours 180 minutes or two movies for the price of one. What an impression THE GREAT ZIEGFELD must have made in 1936 becoming an Academy Award as Best Picture for that year. Since the Ziegfeld name was still in recent memory it assured box office appeal. The name of Anna Held 18731918 might be one for the history books. Because of Luise Rainer's carnation of this popular actress whose fame was the early part of the twentieth century the Held name is most associated with Rainer than as the first Mrs. Ziegfeld.The plot traces the career of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. William Powell starting as a carnival barker at the 1893 Chicago Fair his discovery and exploitation of Sandow the Strong Man Nat Pendleton his departing for Europe where he competes with his best friend and rival Jack Billings Frank Morgan for not only obtaining the services of his servant Sidney Ernest Cossart but beating him to the punch by signing a popular French actress named Anna Held Luise Rainer to a performing contract with him back in America. To be sure he wouldn't lose his prize star Ziegfeld marries her. During their somewhat stormy marriage Florenz Ziegfeld stages extravagant shows that makes him world famous. Constantly surrounded by gorgeous show girls Ziegfeld has his share of problems especially with Audrey Dane Virginia Bruce a temperamental showgirl responsible for his divorce from Anna. Ziegfeld later meets and later marries Billie Burke Myrna Loy an accomplished actress in her own right who not only bears his a daughter Patricia Jean Holland but stands by him during his theatrical downfall and setback after the 1929 Stock Market Crash.On the musical program combining old and new songs by Walter Donaldson and Harold Adamson features I Wish You'd Come and Play With Me and It's Delightful to Be Married both sung by Luise Rainer If You Knew Susie sung by Buddy Doyle imitating Eddie Cantor in blackface A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody by Irving Berlin sung by Dennis Morganvoice dubbed by Allan Jones You Gotta Pull Strings sung by chorus girls She's a Follies Girl sung and danced by Ray Bolger You sung by chorus You Never Looked So Beautiful Before sung by Virginia Brucechorus Yiddle in the Fiddle by Irving Berlin Queen of the Jungle and My Man by Channing Pollack and Maurice Yvaine all sung by Fannie Brice Look For the Silver Lining by Jerome Kern and A Circus Must Be Different in a Ziegfeld Show sung by chorus performed by Harriet Hoctor Montage score to Broadway shows RIO RITA WHOOPEE THE THREE MUSKETEERS and SHOW BOAT briefly playing Ol Man River on the soundtrack. A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody an authentically reproduced eight minute musical segment is certainly the film's true highpoint.The granddaddy of all Hollywood's musical biographies THE GREAT ZIEGFELD is a very impressive film with an impressive cast. While consisting of Ziegfeld headliners as Fannie Brice Ray Bolger and Harriet Hoctor appearing as themselves it also features A.A. Trimble and Buddy Doyle authentically duplicating Will Rogers and Eddie Cantor at best. This doesn't go without some regrets by not having the likes of W.C. Fields or Marilyn Miller recreating what they did best under Ziegfeld. Another letdown is having Fanny Brice singing her signature torch song My Man in incomplete form while the story moves to another scene. Rainer's role of Anna Held did win her an Academy Award as Best Actress for her performance based of her famous telephone scene congratulating exhusband on his marriage to Billie Burke as she holds in her true emotions. While Billie Burke 18851970 then currently a well known film actress could very well have portrayed herself Myrna Loy steps in for box office appeal. Frank Morgan the fictional Billings gives a performance worthy for Best Supporting Actor category while William Powell the main focus from start to finish was strangely overlooked by the academy.In 1978 there was another tribute to Florenz Ziegfeld a TV movie titled ZIEGFELD THE MAN AND HIS WOMEN starring Paul Shenar as Ziggy but it failed to live up to the expectations to the 1936 original. At 156 minutes it seemed longer than the original. Unlike the Powell version the 1978 biopic is pretty much forgotten. Unlike similar musical biographies of this nature made popular in the 1940s THE GREAT ZIEGFELD captures the spirit of its time frame with costumes and women's hairstyles being historically accurate. A movie at this extreme length tends to have its slow spots which it does but overall a large scale production that only MGM can recreate. Distributed to home video by MGMUA in the late 1980s the roadshow version consisting of entre and closing music deleted scenes and intermission title has been inserted into the 2005 DVD release. THE GREAT ZIEGFELD can also be found on Turner Classic Movies especially during its annual Thirty Days of Oscar. ".

Loy doesn't come across as either but she has never given a bad performance so she is believable. But Louise Rainer as Anna Held is the one to watch here. A beautiful dolllike creature she enchants you with her performance. The famous telephone scene may be overrated somewhat but it worked for me....and obviously for the Academy...it garnered her an Oscar. The music is so wonderful and the Pretty Girl is Like a Melody with Dennis Morgan is eye candy. One glaring fault is that there is a very short sequence with the great Fanny Brice in which she is singing My Man  probably one of the greatest torch songs of all times and it is just cutoff in mid warble as the story goes on to another scene. An unforgivable sin!! There could have been a little less talk and a little more singingdancing in the movie but since it is a biography and not primarily a musical all except for the Brice faux pas is forgiven!".

	schema:headline " One of the Greatest Musicals Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you see classic films and they disappoint. I had the opposite reaction here it far exceeded my expectations. I had seen Ziegfield Follies and I thought it was a great variety show but nothing much more than what you could have seen on television in any week in 1963 when Bob Hope Jack Benny Red Skelton Ed Sullivan Jerry Lewis Danny Kaye Jackie Gleason and Judy Garland all had weekly variety shows. I was expecting The Great Ziegfeld to be on the same level. It is not. The staged musical numbers are as spectacular as anything Busby Berkeley ever did and it is an absorbing biographical story with many excellent performances.The movie has a great deal in common with Wizard of Oz. Frank Morgan who played the Wizard plays Ziegfeld's rival and friend Billings with the same warmth he put into the Wizard character. Ray Bolger who played the Scarecrow does an incredible Scarecrowesque dance number. We have Myrna Loy doing a nice turn as Billie Burke who played Glenda the Good Witch. It would have been nicer to have had the real Billie playing herself but she apparently did a lot of behind the scenes work to insure that Ziegfeld her late husband was treated well in the bio. The art director Cedric Gibbons and costume designer Adrian Greenberg also did Wizard of Oz.It is delightful seeing Fanny Brice in a small ten minute part. Virginia Bruce does a surprisingly good meangirl golddigger role. William Powell plays Ziegfeld with a charming light humorous touch. However actor honors has to go to the amazing Louise Rainer who won the Academy Award for her performance as Anna Held Ziegfeld's French commonlaw wife. It is a performance that looks back to the expressionist performances of German cinema and looks forward to the naturalistic method acting performances of the 1950's. This performance is a link. Despite it only being a relatively small part of about 25 minutes she did deserve the Academy Award for it. Incidentally Ms. Rainer turned 101 this year.Each of the dance numbers are fanciful and extravagant capturing hopefully the actual stagings of Zeigfeld's shows. At least they seemed authentic to me. There is one number Pretty Girl that is done in one take and involves a revolving stage for about 10 minutes. Apparently it cost 200000 and took months to film. It is one of the great shotsdance numbers in cinematic history. It has an hypnotic effect.To sum up a witty intelligent script great art direction great costumes a dozen excellent dance numbers with one fantastic one and half a dozen fine performances and one amazing one.The Great Ziegfeld is great and a must see for any real film buff. I would put it in the top ten of all time film musicals and right next to Yankee Doodle Dandy Golddiggers of 1933 and SwingTime as the best of the golden age of Hollywood.".

Clocking in at about 3 hours THE GREAT ZIEGFELD is one of MGM's biggest attempts at creating a blockbuster musical and it won the Oscar for best film.Powell is as always terrific. Oddly he did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film but did get one the same year for MY MAN GODFREY. Luise Rainer won the best actress Oscar for her performance as Anna Held. Myrna Loy plays Billie Burke. The great Fanny Brice appears as herself and just about steals the show until they stupidly and abruptly cut away from her as she starts singing My Man. She doesn't show up again.Ray Bolger gets a whole number to himself. And Dennis Morgan fronts the mammoth A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody number although it's the voice of Allan Jones which ranks among the great production numbers of the era. The camera slowly pans up a seemingly endless spiral staircase filled with pretty girls as draperies are raised to expose more and more staircase. Then we finally reach the top with Virginia Bruce posed there. It's a giddy and spectacular sequence.The ballet sequence featuring Harriet Hoctor is rather a bore. I'd rather have seen more of Fanny Brice. Brice is hilarious in the dressingroom with blonde Esther Muir. Powell and Rainer are really excellent in this film. Notable costars include Frank Morgan Joseph Cawthorn Herman Bing Marcelle Corday Nat Pendleton Grace Hayle Ernest Cossart William Demarest and Reginald Owen.And while Brice appears as herself the Will Rogers and Eddie Cantor appearances are fakes. Virginia Bruce plays a character based on Lillian Lorraine and Rosina Lawrence plays Marilyn Miller here named Sally Manners.An excellent film in the old style and worth the 3 hours it takes to watch it. Ziegfeld was a great showman and he deserved this fabulous tribute. He died in 1932 having given the world a number of major stars and great shows.".

Yet it is Luise Rainer who delivers by far the most memorable performance  she makes her character temperamental but endearing unpredictable but completely sympathetic.  The best parts of the movie come when she is a big part of the action and when her character slips into the background in the second half the movie loses something. The rest of the large cast does get some good moments and it's fun to see a couple of performers playing themselves although some of them don't get nearly enough to do.

Since this was made in the Golden Age of Hollywood the intention is to portray Mr. Ziegfeld in the best possible light. If it were made today the opposite would be true and all his faults would be emphasized probably to the point of slander. I'll leave it to you to decide which is the better approach. Anyway the movie covers Ziegfeld's rise as a Barnumesque showman to becoming one of Broadway's most successful producers with his Ziegfeld Follies show. Along the way he attracts many women and marries two of them Luise Rainer Myrna Loy.It's a spectacle made in the grand Old Hollywood fashion heavy on melodrama and lavish musical numbers. Powell is fine in the lead. I have no idea how closely he gets Ziegfeld here as he seems very much like William Powell's usual screen persona to me. He would reprise his role as Ziegfeld a decade later in 1946's Ziegfeld Follies also from MGM. Luise Rainer is terrific in her Oscarwinning role as Ziegfeld's first wife Anna. Myrna Loy is a little miscast as Billie Burke but it's hard to argue against any opportunity to see Powell and Loy on screen together. The rest of the cast includes solid supporting players Frank Morgan Virginia Bruce Ray Bolger Reginald Owen and Nat Pendleton. A. A. Trimble does a spoton impersonation of Will Rogers.It is a bit overlong. The first half could have done with some trimming. Still a fine cast keeps things interesting and those musical numbers are dynamite. Dennis Morgan's A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody number is one of the highlights. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards with three wins including Best Picture and Best Actress for Rainer. Its award wins are the subject of debate for some today who argue it is one of the leastdeserving Best Picture winners. That's kind of laughable when you think about it as the Best Picture Oscar rarely goes to the most deserving film. That was true then and is even more true today in my opinion. It's definitely something you'll want to try out if you are a fan of classic Hollywood and all its glitz and glamour. They don't make 'em like this anymore.".

The rest of the cast includes solid supporting players Frank Morgan Virginia Bruce Ray Bolger Reginald Owen and Nat Pendleton. A. A. Trimble does a spoton impersonation of Will Rogers.It is a bit overlong. The first half could have done with some trimming. Still a fine cast keeps things interesting and those musical numbers are dynamite. Dennis Morgan's A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody number is one of the highlights. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards with three wins including Best Picture and Best Actress for Rainer. Its award wins are the subject of debate for some today who argue it is one of the leastdeserving Best Picture winners. That's kind of laughable when you think about it as the Best Picture Oscar rarely goes to the most deserving film. That was true then and is even more true today in my opinion. It's definitely something you'll want to try out if you are a fan of classic Hollywood and all its glitz and glamour. They don't make 'em like this anymore.";

To me though while it's not flawless and not the best film of the year it was still incredibly wellmade and entertaining stuff and from personal view it is nowhere near one of the worst Best Picture winners.The Great Ziegfeld agreed is overlong with a draggy and at times uneventful first half and half an hour could easily have been trimmed. And more could have done with the relationship between Ziegfeld and Billie Burke which appeared late in the film and didn't feel developed enough almost like an afterthought.However The Great Ziegfeld is very lavishly mounted with photography that's both beautiful and clever sumptuous costume design and some of the most handsomely gorgeous sets of any 30s musical. Other pleasures are the marvellous and very wellstagedwithout being too overblown songs with A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody being an absolute showstopper a script peppered with humour and heart and the mostly poignant story. Standout scenes were Fanny Brice's charming My Man Ray Bolger's witty dancing to My Follies Girl Luise Rainer's heartbreaking telephonejustifiably famous and especially A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody with its clever photography and perhaps one of the best uses of a staircase in a film. The direction is adept and the performances are great with William Powell suave personified and especially Luise Rainer who is the epitome of charm and grace capable of a good range of emotions as seen in the telephone scene. Fanny Brice Frank Morgan Ray Bolger are all memorable while Myrna Loy is underused she's hardly wasted either.Overall a wellmade entertaining and very good film and well worth the look. 810 Bethany Cox".

In the early years of the twentieth century Florenz Ziegfeld was a theatrical showman who had Busby Berkely's worship of feminine beauty and Cecil B. DeMille's sense of scale. He was creating Hollywoodstyle extravagance back when Hollywood was just a patch of scrubland.Fastforward to 1936 a couple of years after Ziegfeld's death and cinema still bears his mark. Musicals which were still often based around stage performances were often showcases for a variety of dancing and singing talents usually building to a spectacular finale. The Great Ziegfeld is more than just a biopic it is the culmination of this strand in cinema the first epic musical. Here we see the 30's musical's shimmering sets and fullon dance routines on a scale never before seen on the screen. Robert Z. Leonard directs with his usual sweeping camera moves often slowly pulling back to reveal the size of the production. But he also lets his camera get deeply involved in the more dramatic scenes.Apart from the various songanddance people involved the casting here is very much a Hollywood affair. William Powell was then the goto man for such smart and witty types. He and Myrna Loy were wellknown as a screen couple from The Thin Man pictures amongst others. They both give adequate portrayals but in truth these two need a smaller more intimate production to shine in their own right. The performance that best fits the size of The Great Ziegfeld is that of Luise Rainer. Melodramatic full of presence she seems always on the verge of breaking down into some farcical display of ham acting but never quite does so. It's not a realistic performance by any stretch but it is beautiful in its theatricality.Ziegfeld's influence would live on in musical cinema for many years after his death. The Great Ziegfeld was just the first in a series of pictures tipping their hat to the producer. Meanwhile many of the stars made famous by Ziegfeld  Billie Burke Eddie Cantor Will Rogers Ray Bolger  were finding fruitful careers on the silver screen. It was after all the way of the future. You see it wasn't just the depression that finished Ziegfeld. Even if he had lived cinema would have provided him with too much competition to continue with his follies especially with the advent of sound. But this is beside the point. If The Great Ziegfeld shows anything it is that the spirit of showmanship that he championed could live on if not in one medium then in another.".

Florenz Ziegfeld William Powell was struggling in the early1890s as his circus stage shows were becoming stale and downright dull. Fastforward a few years and Ziegfeld is slowly beginning to create the Broadway we think about today. Loud and vibrant shows come about and with them come much success loads of money and many beautiful women including two wives Oscarwinner Luise Rainer and a young Myrna Loy. Ziegfeld also discovers many who would become stars. Ray Bolger Harriet Hoctor and Fanny Brice all play themselves and the ways they were originally discovered are given some airtime. The producer though does age terribly and seems outofplace when not working on shows. The stock market crash of 1929 would be the fatal blow in the life of an intensely interesting man. The Great Ziegfeld is a Hollywood product all the way. Director Robert Z. Leonard Oscarnominated almost destroys the movie with overkill. The production numbers are interminable with some going well over 10 or 12 minutes. The shows which are large colorful and happy underplay a life that was somewhat sad in many ways. Ziegfeld was not good with money many times having to borrow from people like Jack Billings played by the memorable Frank Morgan and was simply terrible when dealing with women. Ziegfeld did create the image of the American girl but in reality he knew little of the opposite sex and treated women as little more than playthings or property than actual human beings. The Great Ziegfeld is a film that has a scale that rivals later cinematic triumphs like Gone With the Wind but this is not necessarily a good thing as the interest wavers on several occasions here. Overall a good film and worth a look. Pay more attention to the story than the production numbers though. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I almost gave up on this threehour film around the 45minute mark because of Luise Ranier's shrill and annoying character plus there hadn't been much in the way of music which is what I wanted in this film in the first lace.However after the first hour the story picks up considerably with the music numbers and some nicelooking and interesting women. I liked Myrna Loy playing Billie Burke. In fact I like Loy a lot more than Burke in everything! This was my first look at Fanny Price who reminded me of a comic Barbra Streisand with her looks and Brooklyn accent.William Powell playing Flo Ziegfeld was of course the undisputed star of the film. He was terrific too starttofinish. Powell had great screen presence and was a good choice for this role. Frank Morgan played his normal role with that stupid laugh of his but he was good as Ziegfeld's generous friend. Another famous name of the day Myrna Loy gets good billing in here but not much of a role.Some of the sets on the Ziegfeld Follies are amazing Busby Berkelytype extravaganzas that certainly mark the 1920s and '30s. The line They don't make 'em like that anymore certainly rings true. It's also true they look corny today but they're still fascinating to watch. If I was older and had lived through some of this time period I would really feel nostalgic watching this film sad for an era long gone.".

	onyx:emotionText "I almost gave up on this threehour film around the 45minute mark because of Luise Ranier's shrill and annoying character plus there hadn't been much in the way of music which is what I wanted in this film in the first lace.However after the first hour the story picks up considerably with the music numbers and some nicelooking and interesting women. I liked Myrna Loy playing Billie Burke. In fact I like Loy a lot more than Burke in everything! This was my first look at Fanny Price who reminded me of a comic Barbra Streisand with her looks and Brooklyn accent.William Powell playing Flo Ziegfeld was of course the undisputed star of the film. He was terrific too starttofinish. Powell had great screen presence and was a good choice for this role. Frank Morgan played his normal role with that stupid laugh of his but he was good as Ziegfeld's generous friend.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this 3hour movie on the big screen in the late 70s and was happy to see it on a large screen. It won three impressive Oscars in 1936 Best Picture Best Actress Luise Rainer and Best Dance Direction. It was also nominated for three more Oscars Best Director Robert Z Leonard Best Writing Original Story Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing. Luise Rainer won her first of two consecutive Oscars here and was the first performer ever to do this her second Oscar was for The Good Earth 1937.Here MGM paired William Powell with Myrna Loy in part of the 13 movies they made together in the 30s and 40s Manhattan Melodrama 1934 The Thin Man 1934 Evelyn Prenice 1934 The Great Ziegfeld 1936 Libeled Lady 1936 After the Thin Man 1936 Double Wedding 1937 Another Thin Man 1939 I Love You Again 1940 Love Crazy 1941 Shadow of the Thin Man 1941 The Thin Man Goes Home 1945 and Song of the Thin Man 1947. Although The Great Ziegfeld is only a fairly routine biopic of Flo Ziegfeld from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 until his death in 1932 the movie is spectacular for his sets decoration and starring cast including appearances by some of his own stars Fanny Brice Harriet Hoctor and Ray Bolger. One wonders why Eddie Cantor played by Buddy Doyle did not appear as himself in this movie. Will Rodgers played by A.A. Trimble had died in that small plane crash in 1935 before this movie was made. To our great fortune this movie was made fairly soon after Ziegfeld's death when there were people who could still remember the Ziegfeld Follies with their lavish stairs songs and above all his beautiful girls!! This movie is in black and white but one can get an idea of what it might have been like in color from watching Funny Girl 1968.The movie opens with Flo Ziegfeld William Powell and his friendrival Jack Billings Frank Morgan competing with each for attention to their respective attractions at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Ziegie's big attraction is Sandow the Strongman Nat Pendleton while Billings was a belly dancer Little Egypt. Later while in Europe Ziegfeld bests Billings out of signing the French singer Anna Held Luise Rainer to a contract and then marries her. Later after starting the Follies and having trouble with one of its stars Audrey Dane Virginia Bruce Anna oversees the troublesome Audry kissing Flo while drunk and mistakes her drunken kiss for a real kiss. Anna then files for divorce. Flo's second wife is Billie Burke played by Myrna Loy to whom he is married for the rest of his life. Zeigfeld goes on to produce and promote several shows and reviews on Broadway often with other people's money. Near the end of the movie while overhearing four men in a barbershop saying that Zeigfeld is all washed up he promises to make four Broadway successes within a year and have them all playing at the same time. After making good on his bet he hires private investigators to find the four original men and gives them all box ticket seats to all of his four plays. The four musical successes all played on Broadway at the same timeThe Three Musketeers Showboat Rio Rita and Whopee!".

	schema:reviewBody "The great Ziegfeld is a wonderful golden age film. It's 3 hours long but that only bothers me if the film is not absolutely great which this one is. This film was made in 1935 and it's based on the life of Florenz Zeigfeld. We see the story of his life from his beginnings at the 1893 Chicago fair to his falling days after the 1929 market crash. The Zeidfeld name got started with the Zeigfeld follies which started in 1907 and ran annually until 1931. Zeigfeld also helped start the birth of the great musicals which began on stage at the very start of the 20th century and eventually led to the great musical films of the 30s and 40s. Ziegfeld's musical stage numbers were wonderful.His beginnings at the 1893 fair while constantly battling with his rival Jack Billings how's business Ziggy? he discovered Sandow the strong man I like how women would faint after feeling Sandow's muscles. His career took off from there. He then met Anna Held who began performing for him. Zeidfeld and Anna had a lovehate relationship the love part led to their marriage. The marriage turned stormy when Zeidfeld was always around his beautiful showgirls. Those showgirls were beautiful and their dance routines were wonderful with the spectacular sets the girls's dazzling costumes and the beautiful old time music. The shows also included the great Fanny Brice Helga in Everybody sing and ol' rubber legged Ray Bolger scarecrow in Wizard of oz and blacksmith in Harvey girls always showing his unique rubber legged dancing. My very favorite part of the film was Dennis Morgan singing A pretty girl is like a melody while I see this enormous mountain spiral staircase with many beautiful girls in different gorgeous attires. This whole scene almost felt like looking into heaven. The beautiful spiral stairway the beautiful angellike girls the dark stary background sky the slow ascending movement up the stairway with the beautiful heavenly girls on them the beautiful heavenly music and the most glamorous angel girl on top. This scene was ethereal. Then add the fact that most of those people there are most likely dead now in 2016 which makes watching it seem even more like entering heaven since those girls on the stairs really are angels in heaven now and no longer on this earth today. I'd like to believe that that stairway or something like it really is heaven right above us right now. My second favorite song and number was the beautiful song you're really looking beautiful tonight with some gorgeous beautiful girls in some wonderful dresses. There's just something about girls and music from the 20s 30s and 40s. Something wonderful.During the latter parts of Ziegfeld's life he married Billy Burke Myrna Loy. I'm not sure why Burke didn't play herself here like Bulger and Brice. This film came out one year before both Burke and Brice starred together in Everybody sing. Anyway Loy was terrific with her emotions and her famous telephone scene with Anna Held. Anna's reactions were absolutely tearjerking. Amazing. The very latter parts of Ziegfeld's life are sad. He loses almost everything in the stock market crash. He became washed up old and there's a very poignant scene in a barber shop where Zeigfeld overhears the other men in there verbally bashing him not knowing he's in there. In the last scene Ziegfeld is sitting in his chair wishing dreaming wondering where it had all gone. We see pictures of beautiful Zeigfeld girls above his head. We're not sure if he's wishing the future or picturing his past dreaming of what once was and sadly would most likely never be again.".

So sure its not a comedy in the typical sense of the word nor is it a typical action movie or even a typical drama  this movie fits into a mixed category. There's a bit of humor the two gay thugs and Holy Hunter's character there's a bit of drama in regards to the relationships and there's a bit of action. But everything is pretty subdued. Nonetheless I thought the actors did a great job and it was different which I can appreciate. I normally am not a huge fan of Holy Hunter but I have to admit that I really enjoyed her in this movie her character was very interesting and she delivered it very well. And yes maybe there are a few aspects that are not believable as the previous person who commented said but what movies are completely real? Movies are not meant to be an exact replica of what life is if they were then we might as well sit at the bus stop and watch life go by.

It's full of dark humor and light humanistic moments that are sure to make you laugh. You feel for Robin's character and you want him to succeed...even though his task is gruesome. The end of the movie even makes you feel for Harrelson's character whom is loathsome when you first meet him. I have to say however my favorite is Holly Hunter in this one. Not usually a big fan because of her weird accent but she is laugh out loud funny. It seems as though she's simply pretending to have an illness so that she can do and say whatever she feels like. It's a great movie that hasn't received enough attention.".

But it's literally one of those productions where you go... phht gone. Not even straight to DVD just gone. Robin WilliamsSome movies just don't stand a chance. Orson Welles and Sergio Leone both suffered the frustrations of seeing beloved productions sabotaged in front of their eyes. Well in Welles' case The Magnificent Ambersons was chopped by fifty minutes while he was out of the country but I imagine he ultimately would have felt the same as Leone whose Once Upon a Time in America was butchered by Warner Bros.' editor and mangled into a twohour mess. But occasionally something even worse happens  the film just totally disappears. Jerry Lewis was passionate about The Day the Clown Cried until he saw the final cut  which was presumably bad enough that it caused him to vow never to let anyone see it. He is in possession of the only negative in existence  which is tucked away in a vault inside his home. He wouldn't even let his daughter watch it. For all the people involved in the production of the film it must have felt like a rug had been pulled from under their feet. Work under grueling conditions and persevere for countless hours on a crowded movie set  only to realize your efforts will never be seen by anyone? The Big White is such a film  after generating lessthanenthusiastic reviews at a handful of North American and European screenings its worldwide distributor Capitol Films pulled the plug and decided not to release it into theaters at the risk of losing money on advertising. The film died a silent death and disappeared for two years before finally surfacing on DVD in Canada and Asian markets thanks to AllianceAtlantis films. It has subsequently gained a small cult following and sales overseas have been better than expected.Comparisons to Fargo and there have been many are valid. Screenwriter Collin Friesen mimics the Coen Brothers' penchant for wickedly dark humor and even places his film in a snowy setting in the Yukon the film was shot on location as well as in Winnipeg. Even the plot is similar a downonhisluck businessman played by Robin Williams cannot afford to help his troubled wife Holly Hunter who seems to suffer from some type of stressinduced tourette's syndrome and decides to cash in on the long absence of his brother Woody Harrelson by passing him off as legally dead and gaining a 1000000 life insurance payment. Unfortunately Canadian law demands that a person be missing for more than ten years to be declared legally dead. So when Williams finds a dead body in a dumpster outside his office the temporary storage place for two bumbling hit men who never suspect anyone will find the body he passes it off as his brother and collects a check.But a claims inspector Giovanni Ribisi is suspicious of the sudden appearance of this longlost brother and as he begins to investigate realizes what is really going on. Meanwhile Williams' wife is kidnapped by the two hit men who want back their dead body and brother Woody Harrelson returns after reading about his death in a paper  demanding a portion of the paycheck.The finale is violent and unexpected but the buildup is at times deliberately pretentious and decidedly lowbudget  and if you've seen any independent film of the last ten years or so you'll understand what this means. Long artsy shots of nothingness excessively quirky characters brutal humor vicious sarcasm.But it's a fun movie. It's no Fargo but director Mark Mylod keeps it moving along at a steady pace. Williams phones in another twisted performance but it's Giovanni and his girlfriend in the movie played by Alison Lohman who really stand out  along with Hunter as Williams' oddball wife. Although her profane outbursts become annoying after a while for the most part Hunter manages to balance the humor and pathos correctly.For fans of dark humor or independent features this is one worth checking out. It will appeal to some viewers very much and others will probably loathe it. I found it to be agreeably distracting and thought its saving graces were standout performances by its cast. Apart from this however you'd be better off watching Fargo again.".

One day whilst putting trash in a dumpster Paul finds a corpse that has been left there by two amateur criminals. He then has the idea of taking the corpse away and using it to pass off as his brother. What unfolds is a complicated plot involving the insurance claims worker desperate to prove that the corpse is not the brother the two criminals attempt to recover the corpse by kidnapping Paul's mentally ill wife Holly Hunter and the return of Paul's lost brother Woody Harrelson.This film is hilarious and in my opinion is the funniest film of 2005. The complicated plot allows it to have plenty of comedic moments and well delivered lines by all actors especially Robin Williams.The plot is very reminiscent to that of Fargo and A Simple Plan. All three films have a storyline involving Money Death and Snow. Fargo and A Simple Plan have are more serious tone than this film does and allow the cold atmosphere they are set in to make the story more colder than it already is. The comedy in Fargo is much more subtle than this film and does not go as far. The problem this film has is that the quantity of comedy in this film almost squeezes the coldness out of the plot.This film is definitely worth watching for the high comedy value it has but if you are a fan of Fargo and A Simple Plan looking for a similar dark cold thriller prepare to be disappointed.".

Not a bad movie to be put alongside at all! It certainly was influenced by Fargo but diverges from there. This film is less about greed and more about deep love searching for it and nurturing existing love. Holly Hunter is a beautifully nuanced character and made me crack up several times. Robin Williams is in top form comic and deeply tragic. A great vehicle for emerging actress Alison Lohman. Giovanni Ribisi is brilliant. Even the smallest characters in The Big White are detailed.

I chose not to do that this time. After seeing and enjoying the film so much I looked at a couple of reviews and one person tore it up because it seemed to be too derivative of the Coen Brothers' work.Ridiculous and Cynical nonsense.All films made now are derived from other movies or TV shows or books. The story and the acting pulled me in and I enjoyed myself very much. I can see what the reviewer meant about the film having a Coen brothers feel but so what.Bravo to all involved.".

Indeed reminded me of Coen's Fargo there are a few resemblances. It is Alaska and involves a kidnap Another thing that reminds me of Coens is the great great music most of the songs played by the Eels and James.

	schema:headline " The Big Funny White";
	schema:reviewBody "The obvious other movie that comes to mind when watching 'The Big White' is the Coen Brothers's 'Fargo' you know the kidnappingransom of the spouse the money Winnipeg etc. However it's the comedy that makes the difference. In 'Fargo' the humour is more subtle and disguised as drama while in 'The Big White' the dialogues and situations are more obviously funny and that's what gives it its own charm. Another difference is that 'Fargo' is a black comedy while this one is more of a dark comedy that's not exactly black. Mark Mylod directs a splendid ensemble cast and tells the story at an initially slow but eventually steady pace. The actors are great. Robin Williams as the downonhisluck travel agent trying to make some quick bucks is wonderful. Holly Hunter is hilarious as the wife suffering from fake Tourettes syndrome more likely a form of Munchausen's syndrome. She brilliantly balances humour and pathos. Both she and Williams share a good chemistry as do Giovanni Ribisi and Allison Lohman. Ribisi naturally fits the part while Lohman has a small role but makes the best of what she has and shines. Tim Blake Nelson and Earl Brown are quite funny too and Woody Harrelson though initially loud manages to give a more controlled performance in the latter reel. It's a dark comedy so the humour is obviously dark but this is a fun film and I really liked it. The songs are very nice too especially 'I Want To Protect You' by Mark Everett. The cinematography is marvelous in the beginning but slowly settles for OK as the story moves towards the end. It's a pity that the film didn't even get a proper theatrical release and remains underrated and unseen by many. I'm glad I caught it and it's definitely worth watching for those who like dark comedy. What's not to like? There's violence romance suspense humour and it's a clever story.".

There are some excellent performances from Robin Williams Holly Hunter and Woody Harrelson. I found it a bit slow at the beginning but it was very easy to get in to after a few minutes. An unusual storyline definitely not one I've seen done a thousand times! I wouldn't call this a comedy personally although there are some rather funny parts of the film it is more of a romantic drama. The storyline basically follows a guy Robin Williams whose business is failing and financially he is struggling. His brother has been missing for 5 years so Williams tries to cash in the life insurance policy but is told that without a body there is a 7 year scale before a missing person can be declared dead and legally they can do nothing.. Upon finding a body in a dumpster outside his work he thinks his problems may be solved and the story follows his efforts to cash in the life insurance policy. A great story with a sweet ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big White is by far one of the worst black comedies I have seen. Big name actors Robin Williams and Woody Harrelson suck you into seeing the movie only to wish you could get that hour and forty minutes of your life back.The first problem is the pacing is incredibly slow very much like About Schmidt. Humor is spread thin like butter over too much bread making a great movie to watch if you want to read a book at the same time. Combined with the film's pacing is the terrible soundtrack that is about enough to drive one's neurons into insanity. Lullablylike melodies really work to lull you into a near comatose state and unfortunately the particularly sedating tracks occur during the very long and slow gaps between the few interesting parts of the movie.About the only positive aspect I can see in this movie is that the acting is fairly well done especially by Robins Harrleson and Ribisi. Though they play their characters very well the writing and development surrounding these characters is trite making it impossible for the viewer to relate and form a connection. This leads to the problem with the overall plot not making the point it was after. This movie definitely had great potential to leave you with a great lesson in humanity enough to fill you up like a steak dinner combined with a few needed chuckles but instead there is so little development and purpose that instead you get a bunch of crude and trivial humor and a completely lacking feeling of resolution at the end of the movie feels like you ate something off a fast food dollar menu.By all means do not waste your time on this movie. Read a plot outline and find a far better piece of cinema to spend your hard earned dollars on.".

Not that he's a bad actor on the contrary when he's on his game with comedy especially comedy or drama he's amazing. But it seems like his step into the dramatic with ONE HOUR PHOTO started a really dark period for him where there wasn't a speck of levity to be had in anything he did. See THE NIGHT LISTENER THE FINAL CUT etc. for some examples. So I started watching this late after I made up my mind to give it a shot.I've never heard of this before but this farthernorth cousin of FARGO is actually a really funny entertaining piece! Thank goodness too because as a straight drama I don't think the material could get any darker.Robin is playing a financiallytroubled travel agent in Alaska this time around. He's THISclose to losing his business his house and his own sanity. The last one would probably not be so bad because then he'd have something in common with his loopy wife Holly Hunter in one of the best performances she's given since RAISING ARIZONA. A possible windfall finally arrives in the form of a dead body left in the dumpster behind his office. He hits upon a plan to claim that the body is that of his ne'erdowell littleseen brother Woody Harrelson and collect on a million dollar insurance policy that's still active.Well turns out that there are complications. LOTS of them. The two gay hit men who literally 'iced' the dead guy a kneeslapping turn by character vets W. Earl Brown and Tim Blake Nelson suddenly discover that they need the body as proof to present to their boss plus the rep from the insurance company Giovanni Ribisi suddenly becomes positive that this guy is fudging on the claim which he is and he's ready to move heaven and earth to prove it.And just like FARGO things go rapidly from bad to unbelievably worse in a dark but farcical and somehow believable way. I'd rather not say how  that's where the fun REALLY comes in.I've never heard of this director before but he did a fantastic job with a powerhouse cast! Not that anything in Hollyweird makes much sense anyway but why this movie didn't gain a wider release is totally beyond my comprehension.Well I saw enough of it to strongly recommend it and since it will be on repeatedly throughout next month I've already set it to tape on my DVR so I can enjoy it from the very beginning.I certainly hope that Mr. W. is planning on making some more like it...I've really missed the 'funny' Robin.

Read a quick synopsis to initially know what the movie is about but you'll quick get into it. It seems like a lowbudget movie but DEFINITELY IS NOT! I started watching it on a Monday morning and I think it will stay with me for the rest of the week. It's definitely a pickmeupper and makes you actually want to visit Alaska even though a lot of the movie was filmed in Canada.

	schema:reviewBody "Marco Ferreri is one of my all time favourite directors for both his fearlessness in pushing boundaries and his piercing originality. Ferreri's greatest achievement was making relentlessly intellectual films that also managed to entertain. While many other European directors could get caught up in their own genius Marco Ferreri was never pretentious enough to forget about his audience.La Grande Bouffe is one of Ferreri's best and most notorious films. The premise is infamous four friends gather at a country mansion with the intention of literally eating themselves to death. When this becomes tiresome they hire three prostitutes and invite the local school teacher to join them. This is not a film that follows a linear narrative instead it expertly crafts a sense of atmosphere from a series of acutely observed vignettes. There are enough unforgettable images and surreal happenings in this film to make Salvador Dali green with envy. The meat garden Andrea and Michel's flatulent love making and Philippe's relationship with his nanny are just three that come to mind. There is genius at work here this is not an exercise in empty symbolism but a disturbing slice of modern life.The impact of La Grande Bouffe has not wearied with age. The sex scenes are possibly less confronting although Marcello's inventive use of a champagne bottle still raises eyebrows but the film's psychological impact has not been dulled. The characters' ruthless pursuit of death is all the more disturbing given their unadulterated appreciation for life's pleasures. For a film with such disturbing content La Grande Bouffe is also effortlessly entertaining. Ferreri somehow manages to balance the building tension with black humour raunchy sex scenes and even budding romance.This is probably a good time to mention the cast. Ferreri has gathered together a who's who of European cinema. Ferreri regulars like Mastroianni and Tognazzi combine brilliantly with French heavyweights like Piccoli and Noiret. Andrea Ferreol more than matches it with these acting giants. She deserves significant credit for her illuminating performance as the open minded school teacher with the appetite of a blue whale.La Grande Bouffe is intelligent disturbing and unrelenting. Most importantly it is also entirely nonjudgemental. Ferreri would never insult his audience by suggesting to them what they should think. If only more modern directors had taken note.".

The premise is infamous four friends gather at a country mansion with the intention of literally eating themselves to death. When this becomes tiresome they hire three prostitutes and invite the local school teacher to join them. This is not a film that follows a linear narrative instead it expertly crafts a sense of atmosphere from a series of acutely observed vignettes. There are enough unforgettable images and surreal happenings in this film to make Salvador Dali green with envy. The meat garden Andrea and Michel's flatulent love making and Philippe's relationship with his nanny are just three that come to mind. There is genius at work here this is not an exercise in empty symbolism but a disturbing slice of modern life.The impact of La Grande Bouffe has not wearied with age. The sex scenes are possibly less confronting although Marcello's inventive use of a champagne bottle still raises eyebrows but the film's psychological impact has not been dulled. The characters' ruthless pursuit of death is all the more disturbing given their unadulterated appreciation for life's pleasures. For a film with such disturbing content La Grande Bouffe is also effortlessly entertaining. Ferreri somehow manages to balance the building tension with black humour raunchy sex scenes and even budding romance.This is probably a good time to mention the cast. Ferreri has gathered together a who's who of European cinema. Ferreri regulars like Mastroianni and Tognazzi combine brilliantly with French heavyweights like Piccoli and Noiret. Andrea Ferreol more than matches it with these acting giants. She deserves significant credit for her illuminating performance as the open minded school teacher with the appetite of a blue whale.La Grande Bouffe is intelligent disturbing and unrelenting. Most importantly it is also entirely nonjudgemental. Ferreri would never insult his audience by suggesting to them what they should think. If only more modern directors had taken note.";

	schema:headline " Putting the 'f' into arthouse. possible spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "The European arthouse movie since the 50s at least has been generally seen in opposition to Hollywood.  Instead of relying on cartoonish genre broad comedy and loud violent action it supposedly offers analysis detail character critique context civilised intelligence.  Crudely put Hollywood appeals to the senses European films to the mind. LA GRANDE BOUFFE is an almost archetypally European movie  a FrancoItalian coproduction directed by a noted auteur Marco Ferreri and starring arguably the three greatest of all European actors Marcello Mastroianni Michel Piccoli and Phillipe Noiret.  It features allusions to philosophy art history and literature and is confined Bunuellike to the single set of a decaying town mansion.  It is also about four middleaged men stuffing themselves to death blocking toilets until they messily explode and er breaking wind.Ferreri treats his theme of excess  food sex selfpity  with an almost Oriental restraint matching lengthy static long shots so dense with detail and so darkly lit that it's often difficult to make anything out to extreme closeups pitilessly exposing yet also strangely moving a bit like Ozu filming Fellini.  It's hard to know how to recommend this film  and I do very strongly. Four professionals  a cook a pilot a TV producer and a judge  convene at the latter's unused mansion to spend a weekend nonstop eating a prodigiously elaborate feast made from the choicest meats many prospective meals are walking about in the garden.We gradually learn that they have come here to die but Marcello is unable to continue without sex so they hire some prostitutes as well as inviting a local seemingly innocent teacher who is soon revealed to have appetites equal to any of the men.  And so the men eat.  And eat.  And eat.  They sometimes have sex watch antique 'erotic' slides drive cars get sick. But mostly they eat.  They even have competitions to see who can eat the fastest.This ironically does not sound very appetising for the viewer.  There is no narrative drive for instance  any conflict possibly brought by the pure innocent Andrea a symbol of life in an atmosphere of decay to whom Phillipe proposes marriage are quickly dashed by her own taste for depravity.  The men decide to die and we watch them do it.  The film begins with a methodical introduction to all four characters and ends as methodically picking each one off.So what is the film about?  Is it an allegory  a group of fairly representative French bourgeois gathered in a knackered mansion with a sparse dying garden might suggest so.  But an allegory of what?  The decline of French masculinity patriarchy capitalism?  The judge and TV producer especially are examples of the most powerful potentially corrupting forces in Western society the law and the media.  The women all escape and survive although the closing shot of Andrea returning to the home is highly ambiguous.BOUFFE is very Bunuellian from the EXTERMINATING ANGELlike idea of bourgeoisie trapped in a mansion figured in the inability of Marcello to leave in his sportscar doomed to drive up and down the avenue to the profusion of animals observing the men's descent into bestiality as they grunt and hoot and growl and become fatal slaves to their appetites.  Is it a study in decadence  there are many shots framed like grotesque parodies of Renaissance paintings that optimistic project is flatulently shot here. There are allusions made to both Boileau  the father of French neoclassicism  and BrillatSavarin whose Physiognomy of Taste is a famous combination of philosophy and gastronomy which the four men take to nihilistic limits.  Is it a death knell of film as the parody of Don Corleone suggests as four old men watch slides like a corruption of early cinema?I don't know.  But for me the pleasures were many.  The home itself stuffed with so much bricabrac you can barely make out the characters.  The fragmentary motifs returning in the coolly formal style  the replaying of certain scenes and shots the repetition of the inchoate beautiful yearning tango music which is connected to one character but shifts as he becomes a ghost.  The museum of the dead culminating in the extraordinary triangular shot of the sprawled Ugo with Marcello and Michel behind him. The limitless ingenious grotesque variations on sex and food.  The gross comedy.  The genius compositions.  The colours.  The sight of three actors who have starred in some of the 20th century's supreme artistic achievements running from faecal rivers and putting the rump back into rumpo.".

They get together at Philippe's house on the outskirts of Paris and their ritual begins. After some time passed just eating Marcello and Michel decide to invite some prostitutes to cheer up the situation. Philippe invites a female teacher instead. Her presence in the house will be determining for she turns out to be insatiable both for her eating and sexual appetites bringing all of the four friends to death. The prostitutes leave the house soon disgusted by its inhabitants eating behavior and there Andrea the teacher will soon encircle herself of corpses the dead bodies of the four poor friends.Director Marco Ferreri reached perfection in this fantastic opulent representation. Very few things connect with reality here thanks also to the stunning locations decr and photography. Philippe's house is one of the best sets I ever saw. I'm going to take a trip to Paris and try to find it. The four great protagonist taken from an ideal top ten of the best european actors give a great prove of mere roleplaying together with the humongous unreal Andrea Ferreol who fills up the house and the screen. This is art in its purest form. 1010.".

In this film four men Marcello Mastroianni Michel Piccoli Philippe Noiret and Ugo Tognazzi all playing characters who use the actors' real first names come together in a palatial estate to screw prostitutes and eat themselves to death. No real reason is given. The prostitutes don't make it very long. The constant feasting disgusts them and they leave. The only woman who does stay is a Reubenesque teacher named Andrea Andrea Ferreol who is intrigued by both the food and sex unlike the other women the idea of food and sex together turns her on. This movie is a tad too slow. At it's best though it's fascinating and hilariously gross. Food seems quite unappetizing after about a half hour of this. I loved the performances.

Since this is a family site I won't describe the delights of the prostitutes they've also ordered. You'll see those soon enough. When these four sophisticated men ennui leaking from their souls like the fluid draining from those two superb deers speak of kissing the oyster it's not the oysters they have in mind. In fact what they seem to welcome is death by satiation. If food and sex are humankind's two glorious distractions from boredom these four men discover a way to check out with a belch and a groan. It will be glorious endless dinner at the unused Paris manse of one of them. The Whore Menu will be a masterpiece...a saut of fat and lean given by four gourmet epicureans for three young ladies in twelve courses. Crayfish a la Mozart on a bed of rice with sublime Aurore Sauce...softshell lobster served as a first course... The dinner will be memorable...four jaded men three whores and Andrea Andrea Ferreol a schoolteacher. And we're only 44 minutes into this more than twohour movie. One thing for sure There'll have to be breakfast What on earth are we to make of the tired lives mounds of kidneys bordelaise and pointless exits of Marcello the pilot Marcello Mastroianni Michel the television big shot Michel Piccoli Philippe the judge Philippe Noiret and Ugo the chef Ugo Tognazzi? Much can be read into this movie and much has. I suspect that the more some people natter on about its meaning the less meaning it has. What it does have however onenote the movie becomes is the intense flavor of La Grande Black Comedy. The four men become clueless comedians in their own overly nuanced sophisticated pleasures and jaded feelings. If we didn't quickly realize that Marcello Michel Philippe and Ugo weren't just grownup spoiled children stunted in their approach to women as well as food and acted by four superb artists La Grande Bouffe might deflate under its own weight. Even as the whores depart we still have the schoolteacher a woman of unexpected delights and comforts. She brings a certain wholesomeness to sex on a kitchen table. Like an encouraging pairing of wine and cheese she makes sex and food a pleasure...and she pairs well with Philippe for a while. Some fine black comedies may end sadly they don't all need to end with irony. I'll admit that the last line in the movie Is it all right like that Ma'am? Meat in the garden? comes close.".

The men can't just eat themselves to death like they planned to. They need help.And help comes. Andrea Ferreol shares their food and more. She takes them to the edge  the moment where there is still a chance to turn around and continue living.The men die alone. The women survive the prostitutes know when to pull out Andrea walks away at the end. The food is great I got very hungry! the photography quite excellent and the dialog just enough. Very relaxed too. Mostly about food recipes small talk really. That's why it is essential to know and to remember what they are doing.Is it a good film? Absolutely. Is it gross? The camera does not look away. Not from the beautiful food nor from the results at the other end of the digestive tract. It shows desires ecstasy fear and loneliness too. And it does show the big emptiness within the men. Too bad this emptiness cannot be filled by hors d'oeuvres pate fish meat or elaborate pastries.".

The men can't just eat themselves to death like they planned to. They need help.And help comes. Andrea Ferreol shares their food and more. She takes them to the edge  the moment where there is still a chance to turn around and continue living.The men die alone. The women survive the prostitutes know when to pull out Andrea walks away at the end. The food is great I got very hungry! the photography quite excellent and the dialog just enough. Very relaxed too. Mostly about food recipes small talk really. That's why it is essential to know and to remember what they are doing.Is it a good film? Absolutely. Is it gross? The camera does not look away. Not from the beautiful food nor from the results at the other end of the digestive tract. It shows desires ecstasy fear and loneliness too. And it does show the big emptiness within the men. Too bad this emptiness cannot be filled by hors d'oeuvres pate fish meat or elaborate pastries.";

Yes there are nambypamby movies that show all sides and bore everyone with their nonexistent pointofview but that's not what I mean. And of course there are plenty of movies about class that reveal their biases from the start I'm rather fond of Eat the Rich movies myself. But Grand Illusion is about class without dismissing any of its characters. The aristocrats whose world is disappearing are presented as tragic figures stuck in a code of life that is rapidly becoming meaningless. Both aristocrats know their time is past the French one accepts this as probably a good thing the German one doesn't and blames the French one's sentiments on the French Revolution but they both know their way of life is soon to be forgotten. And it would be easy for Renoir when he made the film in the mid30s a French communist with proletarian sympathies to demonize these two. But he doesn't he allows them their humanity which is the most characteristic feature of Renoir movies in any event he is the great humanist of movie history.Nor does he show the collapse of the old way as an unfortunate preface to chaos. The bourgeois characters are good people. The world might be safe in their hands as safe as in any other hands at least except for the propensity among nations for war. All of the middle and lowerclass characters in the movie are presented as people not stereotypes. But Renoir doesn't accomplish this by collapsing all class boundaries into some homogenous universalism. These characters remain trapped within their class and their class is clear to the viewer. The movie is not about the absence of class but about the crushing ironies of the very real existence of class in the lives of the characters. To show all classes without condescension while retaining a particular point of view that while people are good it's best that the aristocratic world is in decline is pretty amazing.In Grand Illusion the nominal hero is workingmiddleclass but the upper class isn't evil and the lower class isn't romanticized or dismissed. And it's all accomplished in such a seamless way that many if not most firsttime viewers might easily think it was a fine movie but something less than great. It sneaks up on you and more than just about any film you can name rewards multiple viewings.".

It's easy to be sentimental about war even while deploring it by focusing on the horror of it or by making heroes out of those who are forced to fight. Renoir deals instead with the far more complex mesh of differences and alliances that separate and divide our characters. And while his main characters all have a clear classnationalreligious identity he makes much more out of them than just sociological categories.But trying to explain why Grand Illusion is such a great movie by charting all the conflicting bonds of nationality class religion etc. doesn't explain why the movie is so powerful. To me it is in those scenes in which language either separates our characters as when Marechal tries and fails to tell the British prisoners about the tunnel or asks why de Boeldieu uses vous or unites them as when von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu speak in English or the English officer in drag sings the Marseillaise or when Marechal finally learns a little German. In these cases Renoir uses languagewithout hitting us over the head to make the pointto illustrate the conflict between his ideal of sympathy between humans and the differences of class nationality and religion.Now I know that this sounds just as dry and academic as other attempts to explain Grand Illusion. Maybe it is the movie really does not need to be explained to be enjoyed. But these are the scenes that for whatever reason have always made the greatest impression on me.".

In these cases Renoir uses languagewithout hitting us over the head to make the pointto illustrate the conflict between his ideal of sympathy between humans and the differences of class nationality and religion.Now I know that this sounds just as dry and academic as other attempts to explain Grand Illusion. Maybe it is the movie really does not need to be explained to be enjoyed. But these are the scenes that for whatever reason have always made the greatest impression on me.";

All of it fits together perfectly to create a timeless and very satisfying experience.The movie takes place during World War I and is often considered an antiwar film but the themes about humanity relationships loyalties and identities are all timeless and go beyond any mere political statement.  The interplay between persons of different nationalities and classes thrown together by the war leads to good drama and makes some profound points about human nature.  The story primarily follows three Frenchmen who are taken prisoner by the Germans showing us how they manage to deal with their confinement and allowing us to watch their disappointments and their attempts to escape.  The other main character is a German prison camp commander with whom they become friendly raising complicated questions of loyalty and duty.The character studies are excellent and all the fine acting and directing get the most of out the possibilities.  The settings are convincing and help the viewer feel what it was like to be in camp with the prisoners sharing their boredom and their longing for freedom.  The plot itself is interesting and has some exciting moments but the main emphasis is on what the characters learn about themselves and about humanity in general.  There are many thoughtful scenes and some nicely defined secondary characters that round out the picture.This is a fine movie deserving of its reputation and one that should appeal highly to anyone who enjoys classic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a wonder to see a film from the 1930's so definite in its view and opinions yet so touching and revelatory.  Jean Renoir's GRAND ILLUSION is a film of great importance one that improves with each viewing.  Having just finished the picture again for the first time in some 7 years I was struck by its freshness.  It is an AntiWar film set during World War I that is something to watch.  It demands intense viewing.This is a French work of art by the great Renoir who would make his most acclaimed film RULES OF THE GAME two years later.  If you ask me GRAND ILLUSION is the superior pic and holds up immeasurably better.  The small doses of humor and original characters in this film foresee the classic shooting party of RULES OF THE GAME.  With this movie Renoir uses prisonersofwar and the ludicrous element of war so prevalent in early 20th Century Europe and merges them into a film not unlike a play an extremely wellwritten play.  The viewer has no illusions as to whether or not a war is happening.  We happen not to see any battles or gunplay rather the human element between men and women who are not so different no matter their ethnicity.Renoir's camera is an incredible tool used throughout.  He probes the characters at the various prison camps with some smooth dolly shots and brilliant use of focus and pullbacks.  It seems like an extension of his hand much like his father's paintings.  One striking scene has some weary soldiers singing the French Las Marseilles after getting third hand knowledge of a French victory over their German captors.  Any scene with Erich von Stroheim is interesting because he is human and not some mindless German dictator so many people would come to know at the time of the film's release.  He is a broken man scarred by war and looking to gain a friend in the enemy.  This is rare.As far as prison camp films go these guys seem to have it easy however the fact that they are officers gives us some explanation.  The storyline effectively moves from escape attempts to human realization of the situation they are in.  Parts of it reminded me of STALAG 17 Billy Wilder's 1953 classic no doubt inspired by GRAND ILLUSION.  This is Wilder's film without the Hollywood touch realist and sometimes drab.  Abel Gance's J'ACCUSE would follow a year later.  If you want to see some antiWWI films with two completely opposite methods of warning beneath the surface see these two flicks back to back.The illusion of reality is shattered by war Renoir is telling us.  If only it could be as simple as those amazing shots of the countryside from inside the German woman's house a breathtaking simple look at a peaceful scene the way it should be.RATING 12".

The film vanished during WWII and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946 but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.The Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist antiwar theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914 during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp specifically for officers. After several escape attempts the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle run by Rauffenstein Erich von Stroheim a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.Unlike other war movies La Grande Illusion shows no actual combat and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. WriterDirector Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war it's just their duty when called on.In most of the film scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments like a harmonica or a flute. Of course given the time period and considering the setting such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries that we take for granted is striking. The film's BW cinematography accentuates the drab environment.The story can be a bit confusing in the first half because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom. The plot is easier to follow in the second half.The film's acting is credible. I especially liked the performance of von Stroheim all decked out in that imposing uniform that monocle and with that stiff bearing.La Grande Illusion is an unusual war film one that had real significance during WWII. For this reason alone it deserves to be seen.".

Once again my relative inexperience with cinema seems to have caught me out this film from Jean Renoir uses a similar formula and predates it by almost fifteen years. Billy Wilder must certainly have seen 'The Grand Illusion 1937'  since it features Erich von Stroheim whom he himself used in 'Five Graves to Cairo 1943' and 'Sunset Blvd. 1950'  and so Renoir's influence is present throughout. It's a WWI film but we see no combat. Whereas most antiwar films illustrate their stance by pounding the alltoofamiliar adage war is hell through images of death and destruction Renoir's approach is considerably more understated. He highlight the futility of war through human interaction both between the captured French prisoners and between the Germans who watch over them.Just what is the grand illusion? Renoir derived his film title from The Great Illusion a 1909 nonfiction book by Norman Angell in which the author argued for the impossibility of a largescale European war for economic reasons. That WWI broke out five years later obviously proved detrimental to Angell's arguments and Renoir deliberately plays on the irony of this knowledge. More significant however is that the book was released in a revised edition in 1933 the general argument modified to assert the utter utility of waging war a theme that supports Renoir's stance this would not be the war that ends all wars. With WWII just around the corner there's an bitter urgency to what the film has to say just three years later the director would be fleeing France. The topicality of the film's message proved especially successful overseas and 'The Grand Illusion' was unusually nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1939.Of course no Jean Renoir film is complete without some classrelated social critique. Most striking in this regard is the relationship between Capt. de Boeldieu Pierre Fresnay and Capt. von Rauffenstein Erich von Stroheim from which scandalously it is implied that one's class forms a more binding camaraderie than that of nationality. Boeldieu and Rauffenstein both multilingual upperclass aristocrats who sense their social dominance is drawing to an end seek solace in each other's company and feel closer to one another than to the lowerclass men of their own armies. However there is hope in Renoir's vision of society. The age of aristocracy is coming to a close and a new social order  in which all men are accepted as comrades  is at the cusp of existence. Boeldieu accepts this inevitability and despite the initial suspicion of his fellow Frenchmen ultimately offers his life to allow two lowerclass companions to escape. He betrays von Rauffenstein in favour of duty to his country even if his death provides only temporary relief from the inescapable futility of war.".

If you know anything about World War I you know that a lot of the class ideals about upper class gentility and the way an aristocrat behaves died in the trenches.

But this was a different time remember when gentlemen still behaved as such and those of your social standing were your equals regardless of nationality.The unlikely friendship that develops between the Frenchman de Boeldieu and the German von Rauffenstein comes out of this class mentality. They are the upper class that is slowly dying out due to the large number of lower and working class men that are entering the army and gaining some amount of money and respectability. It is the true emergence of the middle class and the end of the grand illusion that was the importance of old money.

De Boeldieu does in the end sacrifice himself for his countryman but not simply because it is the patriotic and French thing to do. For a man of the people it is terrible to die in war. For you for me it's a good solution he says to von Rauffenstien. For the upper classes this was truly the way they and their way of life died. The men that emerged like Marechal were the ones who would go on to shape the world we inhabit today.Wonderful performances all around especially from von Stroheim.

And with the benefit of the commentary I don't think there's a lot that I missed.I'm still wrestling with my reaction to the film. There was much in the film that was skillfully done and rewarding. Some moving and thoughtprovoking themes. Some superb camera work. Some fine performances. Some memorable sequences. A lot of good movie making.And yet on the whole I find myself dissatisfied. Because as expertly done as many aspects of the film are there are others where it is simply dismal. Its structure is a fiasco. Its plot a jumbled mess. Events which are played very significantly turn out to have no significance at all and merely peter out. Key events are simply left out of the story leaving us to wonder what happened. The movie breaks up essentially into three sections which have little to do with each other.The problem is the movie lacks a tight coherent plot and is more a sequence of somewhat related events. It's sloppy and all over the map. And it's easy to see why Renoir's inspiration for the film was a collection of war stories recollected to him by an officer he met after the war. And that's exactly how the movie comes off as a hodgepodge of ideas and stories thrown together without enough effort made to sculpt the thing into a cohesive whole. Heck Renoir didn't even know how to end it or what to name it until the very end underscoring the fact that even he wasn't quite sure what he was making. What ended up on the screen is apparently vastly different than the first draft of the screenplay which didn't even have some of the key characters and was supposed to be about the various escape exploits of the protagonist. By the time we're done we get only one actual escape for our hero plus minor participation in a stillborn attempt.So you can wax on all you want about the great care and detail that went into every scene and camera shot about the messages and the themes about the acting the sets whatever you want. And I agree that in looking at the details at looking at the movie in a reductionistic way it's a beautiful work of art. But a movie is about more than its parts. It's also about how those parts fit together to make a whole. And looked at holistically I'm sorry La Grande Illusion is a disappointment. The story rambles and just does not hold together.And I'm still bugged that we have no idea why Our Hero ends up in solitary confinement.".

In some ways the film set the template for the second world war POW films like The Great Escape but this movie dos not have the tense excitement of such an action film that would follow three decades later.

	schema:reviewBody "LA GRANDE ILLUSION is one of the biggest accomplishment of French and world cinema. Antiwar theme is shown in a rather strange way. Senselessness of war is the essence. At a frivolous human and nonviolent way emerged the war illusion. Human relations during the war the loss of any meaning and value. This is a strange story about human relationships in a time of war.Prisoners of war camps. The camps in the war could be called hell on Earth. Here are just illusions. Renoir gives us a work of art that explores the depth and complexity of human relationships. One difficult and undesirable topics is presented with a lot of modesty and charm.In the film's social status is reduced to a minimum. The soldiers are essential and a little crazy. The relationship between prisoners and soldiers is almost friendly. Full of patience and respect. War is man's ultimate folly for it brings him losses that are permanent and victories that are pyrrhic and short lived.Scenography and acting are excellent. Watch Gabin Lieutenant Marchal and Fresnay Captain de Boeldieu is a real pleasure. Erich von Stroheim Captain  Major von Rauffenstein is quite realistic figure and around him is spinning an illusion and absurdity of everyday life. Dita Parlo as Elsa appears briefly but leaves a strong impression. There are so many different and important characters who acting with a lot of freedom and creativity. Renoir reveals every aspect of his characters.This film is full of humanism heroism drama and adventure. All of these features are mixed in a war illusion in which is hard to believe but it's very nice to see and feel.

	onyx:emotionText "LA GRANDE ILLUSION is one of the biggest accomplishment of French and world cinema. Antiwar theme is shown in a rather strange way. Senselessness of war is the essence. At a frivolous human and nonviolent way emerged the war illusion. Human relations during the war the loss of any meaning and value. This is a strange story about human relationships in a time of war.Prisoners of war camps. The camps in the war could be called hell on Earth. Here are just illusions. Renoir gives us a work of art that explores the depth and complexity of human relationships. One difficult and undesirable topics is presented with a lot of modesty and charm.In the film's social status is reduced to a minimum. The soldiers are essential and a little crazy. The relationship between prisoners and soldiers is almost friendly. Full of patience and respect. War is man's ultimate folly for it brings him losses that are permanent and victories that are pyrrhic and short lived.Scenography and acting are excellent. Watch Gabin Lieutenant Marchal and Fresnay Captain de Boeldieu is a real pleasure. Erich von Stroheim Captain  Major von Rauffenstein is quite realistic figure and around him is spinning an illusion and absurdity of everyday life. Dita Parlo as Elsa appears briefly but leaves a strong impression. There are so many different and important characters who acting with a lot of freedom and creativity. Renoir reveals every aspect of his characters.This film is full of humanism heroism drama and adventure. All of these features are mixed in a war illusion in which is hard to believe but it's very nice to see and feel. A little comedy of manners is welcome romance also.Whether it is or not the film tells us that men can act nobly even when they are a part of something that is not itself noble. Mankind must rise from ruin. Unfortunately to this day all is one La Grande Illusion.";

I came to it not knowing what to expect from it  although of course I had some awareness of what others had said of it. Early on I was surprised by the fact that it jumps to the POW prison very quickly and that it doesn't have much in the way of action I was also quite surprised by how much light humor there was in it  although this was perhaps more to do with the characters rather than the film itself. Indeed so surprised was I that I began to quite enjoy the film and be taken by the characters the world of the escape attempts and the odd chivalrous tension between the opposing officers.This turned out to be an error because soon the film starts to bring out the real antiwar message and the focus becomes on the pointlessness and emptiness of war with the supposed rules and standards of behavior being little more than a paper thin construct of no real meaning. While many viewers find this engaging I'm afraid that I did not  and trust me when I say that I wish I could since it is always good to agree with the majority when it comes to classic cinema for fear of being labelled an idiot due to a differing opinion. While I was quite held by the mix of realism humanity drama and pointlessness there are several point where the focus on the latter becomes too tight. I should have seen it coming when we only hear about the many escape attempts rather than see them but it is not long before the emptiness of it all is pushed forward without anything else to provide framing for it to exist within.Don't get wrong there is still much to enjoy with what the film does but it did seem rather obvious the more it went on. I loved the contradictions within the attitudes of the German soldiers at the end but mainly because this was smartly done and not pushed in my face as much as some of the other aspects of the second half. The actors give into it as well even if they are mostly still good. Gabin is a good lead while I thought Stroheim and Fresnay worked well off each other throughout. The direction is good although the tone and pacing seems a little off scenetoscene and also as a whole.This is still an interesting film as it provides a sombre view of war with a sense of the hollowness and meaninglessness of the artificial rules and structures established by man but it is not quite the amazing film that most viewers will come to it expecting. Perhaps a historical appreciation of the film's place in cinema is what I'm missing but for me it just seemed to be rather obvious in what it did and it did this will rapidly dropping any allusions towards being entertaining that the first half of the film suggested. It is an engaging film even with this but it is best approached by blocking out the claims of classic and high praise that everyone seems to have for it  then expectations will be more measured.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain films that due to their strong reputation and historical significance are supposedly beyond criticism. Citizen Kane Seven Samurai 2001 The Godfather and many more are examples of films that despite not being necessarily perfect many say that they are beyond criticism and that if you do criticism them you must discuss what masterpieces they are first. One of those films is Grand Illusion. Considered to be one of the first prison escape movies ever made the film is meant to be one of the best ever made for not only being the granddaddy of prison escape films but for having great characters an engaging story and a strong antiwar message laying underneath its skin. However while it does have many positive attributes Grand Illusion isn't the masterpiece everyone believes it to be due to poor narrative and being very overlong.The plot is that after being shot down during an aerial battle a group of French soldiers are sent to a German prison. Here they decide to escape and use many cunning plans in order to do so. That's really all of the story there is here and while its simple nature makes it seem impossible to screw up the story is poorly told here. This is due to how there isn't much of a story throughout much of the film and many scenes consist of characters talking about things not story related or utterly pointless scenes as well i.e. a scene where the prisoners display a show to the Germans that should have hit the cutting room floor. Because of this the film feels very baggy and overlong as a result. It also doesn't help that the character development is quite inconsistent. While I understand that the film is essentially an ensemble piece there are too many characters for the film to juggle leading to few characters we care about or are interested in and many we couldn't care less about. It also doesn't help that there isn't much threat from the villain characters as they act very friendly towards the heroes and in a later scene when a protagonist dies the villain tends to his need. Sure the scene that this leads to is a wonderful moment something the film sadly has too little of and it does represent director Jean Renoir's pacifist views but it fails to create any tension or conflict within the story and if the audience doesn't care about the events on screen then what's the point of watching?The film isn't a complete disaster though. The film is clearly well made  some of the characters are at least interesting and the cast are excellent with Jean Gabin Marcel Dalio  Erich von Stroheim in particular giving standout performances. It is also at least an entertaining experience for the most part and it is also an interesting watch as it is compelling to see one of the first prison escape films and to see how it influenced later prison escape films as a whole.It is because of this that while Grand Illusion isn't a complete failure it is very flawed and it hasn't aged very well due to its overlong length barrage of pointless material and lacking any tension or suspense for the most part. However there are some great moments here and there and the acting is fantastic overall. So in conclusion what you have is a mediocre film that despite its iconic status is quite problematic. However it is worth checking out to see one of the forerunners of the prison escape genre and is occasionally brilliant here and there. If you must get it get the Criterion version above all others as it goes into great detail about the film it's history cast biographies and Nazi ban. To be honest the edition gives the film a better treatment than it perhaps deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw it again on TCM and now I see things in the film that make me question my high regard and admiration for it. This classic film has a special glow of humanity which makes it unique and instinctively accessible. One can understand why it was such a hit in 1937. At the same time this is not a surrealist film or a satire as the title might suggest but an interpretation of horrific events from the point view of a humanist and in that sense you get the inspirational message which seeks to outweigh other issues but if you stop and think about the whole thing you end up appalled by some of the conclusions you might end up with. If it had successfully advanced the theme that war is hell and that men seek to preserve their humanity under these conditions fine. But that is not the end result the balance between the antiwar message and the idea that WWI was a gentlemen's war and that it brought the best out of men somehow leans on screen towards the latter and lends the film to negative interpretations. Renoir refuses to openly condemn war nor show its ugly face but by implication. And you can't say that wasn't Renoir's style given his inyourface condemnation of the attitudes of French's aristocracy prior to WWII in The Rules of the Game. Renoir emphasizes the men being pals and patriotic eating well joking and dancing which is what Renoir as a humanist understands men wish to do instead of fight but the lack of any substantial sense of horror and suffering makes for an unbalanced film. The suffering is almost all psychological life away from home and wife loneliness but it is hardly felt except in the part of the story with the German woman which is very successfully told. The physical suffering is not exposed at all except for von Stroheimm's ailments which are discussed tangentially and even that suffering is mentioned but not felt. Renoir seems to expect the audience to presuppose the horror and the suffering. Renoir's conclusions in this film are confusing naive and might even be considered downright insulting particularly in the historic period this film was made. The problem might not be in Renoir's point of view or intentions but in what he actually put on the screen. So all in all I'm not sure what Renoir is saying in this film and therefore can not regard it as highly as I once did. I also agree with other reviewers that Renoir's technique is extraordinary but that the script is a mess. All in all if you trust Renoir and stay with the humanistic theme and try to avoid any other interpretation you will still feel this is a great film if not then you will have serious reservations. I for one now have doubts.".

	schema:headline " Humanism that transcends all barriers !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "'La Grande Illusion' is one of those films that reaffirm a film lover's belief that cinema as an art form can be used by filmmakers to bring people together. The screenplay for the film written by Renoir and Charles Spaak is extremely deep and multi layered. Although the film is set during the WW1 era the timing of the making and release of the film is very important. This was released when the Nazi party in Germany was becoming more and more powerful and another global war was imminent. I can't help but think that this film was Renoir's attempt to make people stray away from the extremism that they were getting influenced by. Although it didn't achieve its intended objective one can't help but admire the artist's intentions.If one has to summarise 'La Grande Illusion' in one phrase I think the phrase to be used is 'the power of humanism'. Renoir loves every single character in the film. Not just the French soldiers even the German soldiers get treated with respect. The Germans are not stereotypical caricatures as is found in some other films of this era. The German officers treat their French prisoners with kindness. This shows Renoir understood that there were ordinary innocent German people who were caught in the middle of the wars being instigated by the politicians in power. Apart from underlining the humanism and the similarity between the soldiers on all sides the film also works on other themes. The film explores the changing times. We see the men who have been detached from the outside world due to the war feel surprised when they hear that women are keeping their hair short. One of them equates this appearance with the appearance of a boy. This is clearly Renoir commenting upon the progress women were making at the time in trying to gain equality. We also get the angle of the changing nature of the class distinctions. Rauffenstein and Boeldieu belonged to the higher classes. They understand and respect each other even though they belong to Germany and France respectively. We see them reminisce about the old times and talk about how they feel out of place in a fast changing world where the class distinctions are getting distorted as they embark on an era where people belonging to lower classes as well as Jews will be equal to them. We also get a subtle introspection on the concept of masculinity in this changing society. Renoir through his visuals shows how all the characters are at times literally and at times thematically trapped by the war. We get his signature shots of frames within frame to metaphorically imply that the characters are trapped. Every character be it French or German is trapped mentally and physically by the war. Even a high officer like Rauffenstein feels trapped in his claustrophobic chamber. They are all detached from the outside world. They want freedom but are apprehensive about whether they will be ready for what awaits them on the outside once they get their 'freedom'. This internal apprehension of not being ready to live on the outside reminded me of 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Like Powell  Pressburger did with 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' Renoir is bidding farewell to an era where even wars were fought with a gentlemanly attitude. Although he does touch upon the class distinctions and some other aspects that plagued that earlier era but he is primarily concerned with the humanism of that characters. So we see the kindness between soldiers belonging to different nations. This can lead to a a criticism that the film is a bit overly romanticised and is a bit of a wish fulfillment exercise as it doesn't depict the brutalities of war. But I think a brutally real account of WW1 was never Renoir's vision. In the midst of the rise of the Nazi Party and the huge possibility of another war he wanted to make a film that makes the viewers renounce extremism and in the process instill the spirit of a unified Europe no matter how unrealistic it may seem. This is why I think 'La Grande Illusion' will work brilliantly as a double feature with Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory'. While the first shows soldiers from different nations treating each other with kindness the latter shows French officers being monstrously merciless to their own French colleagues.Renoir's visual style is beyond impressive. He uses very little editing in most scenes instead he constantly keeps moving the camera to reveal other characters in the room or to reveal new parts of the interior which were earlier not visible in the frame. He also uses deep focus effectively to make the visual language of the film very characterinclusive in the sense that all the characters find importance in a scene. This inclusive nature of his style executed by tracking shots is epitomised by the famous scene involving the singing of 'La Marseillaise' a scene where he practically uses no cuts.Performance wise I'll give special mention to Jean Gabin Erich von Stroheim and Pierre Fresnay. 'La Grande Illusion' is a film that I can watch over and over again and get something new out of it on each viewing. It is rich in humanism thematic depth and Renoir's brilliant directorial skills. The title of the film itself is layered and open to many interpretations. What was the grand illusion? Is it the illusion that one can achieve freedom from the suffering by escaping from prison camps or is it the illusion that the world that awaits these soldiers after the war ends will be the same as the one that they left behind? Or is war itself the grand illusion that creates barriers between human beings who are all the same but get divided based on geographical borders? Maybe it is one of them maybe it is all of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Renoir uses the element of directing to expose the predominant theme of this film friendships are what sustain human life. Rather than choosing to focus on the suffering and angst of war Renoir hones in on the humane aspects of brotherly love and kindness to display this message. This is revealed from the very beginning. When French pilots are captured behind enemy lines by the Germans they are taken to prison amongst other nationalities where all are treated with respect. It seems more like a gentlemen's war in this regard. Renoir establishes this veneration by showing the veteran prisoners warning the newcomers of material confiscation. They do this by playfully singing a song about hiding your valuables. Renoir further directs the viewer's attention to the theme of friendship by showing that although the prisoners come from different backgrounds i.e. occupations interests nationalities they still can gather together in a welcoming environment to eat a homecooked meal. They also help one another support the cause of escape by digging a tunnel under the barracks. Even under the direction of choosing the title of the film Renoir ironically suggests that the grand illusion of war is war itself. War is what creates a violent faade over what matters mosthuman relationships.Again this theme presents itself when the main character Marechal a Frenchmen attempts to give information to an incoming caught Englishmen regarding an escaping tunnel in one of the barracks. Even though there is a language barrier and neither one of them understand each other the attempt was made and further contributes to the spirit of unification and friendship. Through Renoir's sense of direction he deliberately eliminates any prejudice between race and military status and in turn establishes a wonderful connection between all of the characters.The most powerful moment in the film that completely seals the theme is when Renoir romantically brings Marechal and a German widow together in a Romeo  Juliet type manner. Despite their countries fighting in a war with each other they see beyond the hatred and find love. It is this love that clinches the highest form of friendship.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the dawn of his career Louis de Funs was a funnylooking guy pushed into the background but allowed to utter a few lines for a few bucks more lines more bucks more experience more expansive acting and so on and so forth he climbed every single step that lead him to stardom and he did it the hard way. Halfway in this inspirational career he was a character actor specializing in bossy little middleaged men generally sporting a bushy mustache and a ferret like expression making him look meaner his dark hair little nasal voice and mimics didn't leave much for sympathy but made him the perfect foil for actors like Gabin Bourvil or Fernandel But as a naturally humble man De Funs always took his job very seriously and pride from having been the busiest man in French cinema that he wasn't a real star allowed him to play in many fields in the same time his son recollects memories where his father could make two small parts in plays and then ending the night in a cabaret act. This ubiquity enriched the range of his acting talent and time did the rest by the beginning of the 60's he got rid of the mustache he became bald an grayhaired progressively he was turning into that man in his fifties whose small stature yet angry persona would make him the perfect embodiment of the petty boss strong with the weak and reversely.De Funs became the incarnation of the Comedia Dell'Arte character Pantalon who is an equivalent of the Molire's 'Harpagon' he would play two decades later the cheap old man cherishing his wealth at the expenses of his duty as a father. In the rich and considerable gallery of characters he'd play in the 60's and 70's at the peak of his career he would always be either an authoritarian figure a rich man and a father sometimes the three at the same time. The experience he built up during his secondrate roles provided him an extraordinary creativity and ability to inject energy and slapstick in these roles he was the true heir of Chaplin Donald Duck and Keaton yet he created something new that defined French popular cinema.The real start would take place in 1964 with two of his most iconic roles in St Tropez Gendarme and Fantomas followed by The Sucker where he'd get second billing after Bourvil in 1965 after that Louis de Funs was would never desert the box office top 10. But Pouic Pouic or SqueakSqueak in English was the film announcing that trend it showcased De Funes' acting capabilities. He had already made an impression by taking the role of the father in Oscar in 1959 but in PouicPouic he proved that he had the shoulders solid enough to carry a movie. He knew the play for having played the butler role in the early 50's and it can be seen as a poor man's Oscar but whenever he's on the screen the film is just constantly funny and energetic. Funs wasn't 50 yet and was still young enough to pull these energy tantrums he knows the secret. Of course it's routine from our perspective but PouicPouic was the film that revealed it.Now the plot doesn't really need any further explanation. It's one of these screwball comedies driven by false identities and misunderstanding the daughter of Leonard Molestier a stockbroker is tired of being courted by a snobbish millionaire Guy Trejean she persuades the car delivery guy Philippe Nicaud to pretend to be her husband. Meanwhile Leonard is in Paris' Wall Street and his eccentric wife Jaqueline Maillian sell some of his shares to buy an oil concession in South America. For some reason he doesn't believe it can be true and to prevent bankruptcy he tries to sell it to the millionaire who courts his daughter. Things escalate as he learns she's married so he uses his soninlaw as a son to make his aspiring soninlaw to sign the papers meanwhile the real son comes and we know that whenever Leonard gets his partner to sign something will interrupt it. This is pure situation comedy humor although the gags don't work with the same efficiency and the final twist is more than predictable it mostly depends on the reactions of the actors and what the film gets right maybe a bit more than Oscar which I didn't enjoy as I wanted is the casting of Christian Marin as the tall and goofy looking butler who behind his English phlegm doesn't hesitate to make a few snappy comments some of them reflecting what we might think of all these corny gags. Mireille Darc as the sensual daughter gets more and more intriguing and exquisite as the play advances and while I loved Jacqueline Maillian I couldn't help but think that the film escaped from perfection because it wasn't the time of Claude Gensac late. And I forgot PouicPouic a chicken who seemed to have no other purpose than inspiring the funny title of the movie but doesn't really add much to the plot.The film is short enough to be enjoyed and the ending had the perfect revenge of Karma although it seemed to have been shot a bit hazily. Anyway the film had the merit to show that Louis de Funs was the real thing on the field of comedy that any actor could pale in comparison although Darc Maillan and Marin were great supporting players doing exactly what De Funs did for two decades being the scenestealer before stealing it once and for a".

Things escalate as he learns she's married so he uses his soninlaw as a son to make his aspiring soninlaw to sign the papers meanwhile the real son comes and we know that whenever Leonard gets his partner to sign something will interrupt it. This is pure situation comedy humor although the gags don't work with the same efficiency and the final twist is more than predictable it mostly depends on the reactions of the actors and what the film gets right maybe a bit more than Oscar which I didn't enjoy as I wanted is the casting of Christian Marin as the tall and goofy looking butler who behind his English phlegm doesn't hesitate to make a few snappy comments some of them reflecting what we might think of all these corny gags. Mireille Darc as the sensual daughter gets more and more intriguing and exquisite as the play advances and while I loved Jacqueline Maillian I couldn't help but think that the film escaped from perfection because it wasn't the time of Claude Gensac late. And I forgot PouicPouic a chicken who seemed to have no other purpose than inspiring the funny title of the movie but doesn't really add much to the plot.The film is short enough to be enjoyed and the ending had the perfect revenge of Karma although it seemed to have been shot a bit hazily. Anyway the film had the merit to show that Louis de Funs was the real thing on the field of comedy that any actor could pale in comparison although Darc Maillan and Marin were great supporting players doing exactly what De Funs did for two decades being the scenestealer before stealing it once and for a";

Tang Shan Da Xiong or The Big Boss known in the U.S. as Fists of Fury was the final result and the movie that started Lee's career and his way to becoming a legend of celluloid.The Big Boss is about a young Chinese man named Cheng Chaoan Bruce Lee who travels to Thailand looking for a job. Living with his distant cousins he finds a job in the ice factory where his cousins work and soon he finds a family in them developing a close friendship with Hsiu Chien James Tien and a big affection for Chow Mei Maria Yi. Although he is a skilled fighter Cheng sworn an Oath of nonviolence to his mother promising that he would not be a get in fights. However things get complicated when two of his cousins disappear and is discovered that the ice factory has a dark secret. Cheng will have to break his Oath in order to unveil the mystery behind the disappearance of his new family.Directed by Wei Lo who would also discover Jackie Chan The Big Boss was a breath of fresh air to martial arts films as it showed a flawed hero in a modern setting. The story by Wei Lo and Bruce Lee is very well developed and filled with suspense and action and in a bold move for an action film the main character remains almost inactive for the first half as Cheng must avoid violence due to his oath. The film not only launched Lee's career to stratosphere it influenced his own filmmaking's style and the way future martial arts movies were done.Wei Lo's usually restrained style was also influenced by his young actor's abilities The Big Boss can be seen as his transition to a more explosive way of filmmaking that would be completed in his next Lee's film Fist of Fury and the subsequent Jackie Chan's films. The natural and raw look of the film added to the high dose of graphic violence it is probably the goriest film in Lee's career give the movie a harsh gritty realism that adds to its charm.As many have already said and will continue saying without a doubt Lee was a very charming actor whose presence filled the screen and owned it completely. That statement is proved here as we see him not as a killing machine but as a common man who just wants to live peacefully giving us many scenes of Cheng enjoying his new found family and struggling with his own vices. Lee's performance is very natural although one could say that he was basically playing himself. The rest of the cast ranges from average to OK with James Tien Quin Lee and Malalene being the best among them. However it's fair to notice that the poor dubbing typical of movies of the era makes a bit difficult to judge them fairly.The Big Boss is considered among the weakest of Lee's films and not without a reason. Those accustomed to constant action scenes will feel it is slow due to the film's pacing and the way the story is built. The acting as written above is not very good and only Lee and Tien's performances are of constantly quality. And finally Wei Lo's inclusion of some silly comedic effects feels terribly out of pace in an otherwise dark and gritty action film.To summarize Tang Shan Da Xiong or The Big Boss is a terrific film on its own right and together with Fist of Fury The Chinese Connection and Enter the Dragon a basic film to understand Lee's career and the development of martial arts films during the 70s. It may not be a classic as the films mentioned but this was just the beginning of the legendary Bruce Lee. 710".

Unlike most martial arts movies of the time the film was set in the present day and attempted things like characterisation and even realism. These touches sometimes seem crude and even laughable now for instance check out the scene when the other workers of the factory are waiting for Lee to return with it's exaggurated 'passing the time' actionsbut when the film came out it was a major step forward.Even more daringly the film has less fighting with the fights being structured around the plot rather than the other way round and bravest of all the star of the film does not go into action into half way through. Instead it cleverly builds suspense by having Lee as a guy who has sworn not to fight and when he eventually cuts loose the result is exhilarating. However it's obvious that none of Lee's opponents are a match for him and only the sequence when he battles a group of heavies in and around an ice factory really stands out. The clumsiness of much of the action Lee was only allowed to choreograph the ice factory sceneis almost redeemed by the huge amount of gore and brutality.Despite it's shoddy aspects the film does have an odd powerespecially towards the end. Lee's character is a very flawed hero who for a while badly strays from goodness and there is a sense that killing all the bad guys will not bring him redemption. In all three of Lee's Hong Kong films violence never really solves things it just makes things worse. Maybe that is why Lee's dated sometimes awkward films are still watched again and again while many other films of the same time and genre have faded into obscurity. Well that and Lee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tang Shan Da XiongThe Big Boss1971 is of all the Bruce Lee movies the most censored and cut because of some scenes of graphic violence.  The violence in its uncut form seems to be on the level of the Street Fighter flicks with Sonny Cheiba.  Bruce Lee doesn't show off his fighting skills until mid way through the film.  What a great fighting performance Bruce Lee gives the viewer when he beats up the big boss's factory workers. Interestingly the film has a couple of erotic scenes that are unusual for a Kung Fu movie.  Both these scenes were either trimmed or cut from the picture.  Bruce Lee's films would get less bloody by the time he did Enter the Dragon1973.  Mr. Vampire actor Ching Ying Lam has a small part as the cousin of Cheng Chao An.  Film that brought Bruce Lee international stardom even though the film was not very good.  For a Kung Fu flick Bruce Lee is unable to show his full ability as a martial artist due to the filmmakers concern about his appearence in film.  Bruce Lee would not fully utilized his excellent skills until the fight sequence at the Japanese martial arts school in Jing Wu Men1972The Chinese Connection.The Big Boss1971 is noted for the infamous scene cut from the film of Bruce Lee spitting a man's head in half with a saw.  A scene that has been lost scene since probably the film's debut in Hong Kong theatres.  Just as infamous as the lost Pirhana scene of Cannibal Holocaust or the lost eye sucking scene from Full Contact.  This sequence is definitely a scene that may have influenced similar sequences in The Streetfighter1974.  This one scene makes The Big Boss1971 a must find in its fully uncut and uncensored form.  Bruce Lee does well for what little material he had to work with. One gory sequence that was trimmed for the film's US release was the scene where Cheng sticks his fingers deep into the main villain's torso.  It would be great if someone would find elements from The Big Boss1971 in order to put together the longest print possible.  The Hong Kong version is superior to the badly cut and badly dubbed American version.  Its the version that I recommand the most for Bruce Lee admirers and fans.".

Interestingly the film has a couple of erotic scenes that are unusual for a Kung Fu movie.  Both these scenes were either trimmed or cut from the picture.  Bruce Lee's films would get less bloody by the time he did Enter the Dragon1973.  Mr. Vampire actor Ching Ying Lam has a small part as the cousin of Cheng Chao An.  Film that brought Bruce Lee international stardom even though the film was not very good.  For a Kung Fu flick Bruce Lee is unable to show his full ability as a martial artist due to the filmmakers concern about his appearence in film.  Bruce Lee would not fully utilized his excellent skills until the fight sequence at the Japanese martial arts school in Jing Wu Men1972The Chinese Connection.The Big Boss1971 is noted for the infamous scene cut from the film of Bruce Lee spitting a man's head in half with a saw.  A scene that has been lost scene since probably the film's debut in Hong Kong theatres.  Just as infamous as the lost Pirhana scene of Cannibal Holocaust or the lost eye sucking scene from Full Contact.  This sequence is definitely a scene that may have influenced similar sequences in The Streetfighter1974.  This one scene makes The Big Boss1971 a must find in its fully uncut and uncensored form.  Bruce Lee does well for what little material he had to work with. One gory sequence that was trimmed for the film's US release was the scene where Cheng sticks his fingers deep into the main villain's torso.  It would be great if someone would find elements from The Big Boss1971 in order to put together the longest print possible.  The Hong Kong version is superior to the badly cut and badly dubbed American version.  Its the version that I recommand the most for Bruce Lee admirers and fans.";

It involves a company that smuggles heroin in blocks of ice and does away with employees who find out. An action movie with a plot. It's almost unheard of. The action is pretty good too. I'm always afraid when starting out a bruce lee movie that because it is so dated the action will seem fake. Up until Lee starts fighting it ussually does. But once the man gets into it the intensity is unquestionable. This movie was not quite as cool as Enter The Dragon but it was very good. Much better than I would have ever thought.

As Chein Bruce Lee choreographed his own fight scenes is a city boy who moves with his relatives to work at an ice Factory . He does this with a family oath  as he was forced to make a promise to his mother after his father was killed in a fight . The promise was the following  never to get involved in any fight and to make sure he would not fall to the same fate and that he'd live to raise his own family. However when members of his family begin disappearing after meeting the management of the factor  the resulting mystery and pressures forces him to break that vow . As he confronts it head on with his mastery of martial arts while investigating the strange disappearances his cousins . Meantime  he falls in love for beautiful women Maria Yi and the usual Nora Miao as a Drinkstand owner and Chein makes love prostitutes Thai brothel featured in the film was actually a genuine and functioning brothel and they were actual whores who were paid more by Golden Harvest than they would normally receive in a day by their clients . As Chein seeks vengeance for the death of his relatives and friends  dispatching numerous thugs and hundreds of Karate experts at violent combats and  he  finally  takes on the villainy of the Big Boss.A vengeance story about a young man in an ice factory that seeks revenge when his cousins mysteriously begin to disappear . Nice Bruce Lee as an undercover fighter who works with his cousins and sworn to an oath of nonviolence . Although  the original star was also James Tien who plays Hsiu Chien while Bruce Lee was to be a costar. However when directors changed the stars switched giving Lee top billing. This violent ChopSocky displays actionpacked  thrills  fastpaced a lot of zooms  and wild fighting images . In fact  this is the only Lee film to be censored in its original country due to graphic violence . This is the only Bruce Lee film excluding his childhood films and Green Hornet reedit films missing his use of the nunchucks . It packs violent combats sequences filled with bounds and leaps  including Karate  Judo Tae Kwon do  Hapkido  Wushu and being the only Lee trademark present in this film is his triple kick attack . Exciting and rousing struggles carried out by Bruce Lee  he wasn't doubled and did his own stunts . And impressive final fighting  the key fight sequence between Lee and the Big Boss . The international title of this film was The Big Boss. In the United States the English dubbed version was originally to be released under the title The Chinese Connection a play on the title of the highly popular film French Connection 1971. For some reason the title was changed to Fists of Fury. As a result to avoid confusion with Bruce Lee's following film known elsewhere in the world as Fist of Fury 1972  the latter film's title for its U.S. release became first The Iron Hand and then The Chinese Connection. The motion picture was professionally directed by Lo Wei and well produced by Raymond ChowGolden Harvest . Although  the original director was Ng Gar Seung however he was replaced by Wei Lo a few weeks into production . It achieved big hit smash at box office  in fact  circa 1971  this was the highest grossing film of all time in Hong Kong beating out American productions Sound of the music 1965 and Tora! Tora! Tora! 1970. Lo Wei also directed the successful Laugh Track Chinese Connection because of the movie's racial content and personal disagreements Bruce Lee quit working with Lo Wei after this movie . And made various Jackie Chan recitals as New fist of fury and Spiritual Kung Fu. This is a topnotch KungFu movie with the unforgettable Bruce Lee . Bruce Lee played the biggest international hit smashes  such as Fist of Fury that was previously realized to his American box office Enter the dragon. This one was made later but released before Lee's Return of dragon with Chuck Norris as contender  and Lee had formerly starred way of the dragon or Enter the dragon is his last complete movie character but his next film  Game of death was absurdly edited after his death . This KungFu actioner was well realized by Lo Wei  an expert on ChopSocky movies and he directed various Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan vehicles . This The Big Boss also titled Big Brother of Tongshan or Fists of Fury or Fists of Glory is indispensable and essential seeing for Lee fans and Karate enthusiastic.".

The biggest indication of this occurs late in the film when a bad guy is knocked through a wall. However the final quarter hour switches the tone dramatically with some grim developments that will help further spur Bruce to vengeance. There is plenty of entertaining action to go around and this is when the film is at its most amusing with lots of grunting and impact sounds on the soundtrack. You'll notice too that if you watch the 101 minute long uncut version things get pretty violent and gory albeit with a lot of that bright red movie blood that looks more like paint. The widescreen photography is good and the music by FuLing Wang is downright funky and a hoot.There are some very gorgeous women in the cast Maria Yi Marilyn Bautista and Nora Miao the latter a recurring costar for Bruce during this time. Bautista even bares her breasts for the occasion. Among the supporting cast are James Tien who was originally set to star as inquisitive cousin Hsiu Chien and the wonderfully grandiose YingChieh Han as the ultimate villain of the piece.This definitely has its value as an introduction to the charms and physical prowess of Lee as an action star and may whet ones' appetite for more of his classics.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Boss stars the legendary Bruce Lee as Cheng Chaoan a migrant worker who visits his cousins in Thailand and begins work in an ice factory. Cheng has taken an oath of nonviolence and struggles to control himself and hold back as his cousins in Thailand begin to disappear...The Big Boss is certainly a classic martial arts film. It kick started Bruce Lee's film career and made him a star in the East. One can see why. The fighting in this film is excellent with Lee and fellow martial artists showcasing their talent even with the films low budget look. The story itself is passable as Cheng navigates an increasingly dangerous situation that he is trying his best to avoid. Supporting characters in the film are likable and the thugs and villains suitably dastardly.A few small complaints would be the relatively weak if passable story. It almost feels like the Big Boss is a sequel as Cheng arrives with a backstory half told. Some characters acting skills are not on par with the fist fighting as well. The props and weapons also look laughably unrealistic.Those aside this is a good martial arts film staring the legendary Bruce Lee. It's by no means the best of his filmography but is enjoyable non the less. The Bog Boss is worth your time if you enjoy martial arts or Bruce Lee's other films.".

Compare James Tien's weak attempt at fighting off villains to the time when Bruce finally starts to fight and you can see why he made such a massive impact on the world of film.Bruce wanted realism and where he can he shows his skill and power. It is only Lo Wei's attempts to revert to silly comic book action that spoils it somewhat.It may seem to some an exaggeration but this film marked the beginning of something that changed the way all action films were made afterwards. Today all action films contain some Martial Arts whereas previously that wasn't the case.OK James Bond films had a go at showing some pretty unrealistic Karate Judo and Ju Jitsui but Bruce changed the way Martial arts would be shown from then on. Without Bruce there would have been no Jackie Chan or Jet Li or Jason Statham etc.The film itself does have some good points. The story is a good one and only spoilt by some really bad editing. I am sure there were some amazing scenes cut from this film and this makes the story jerky and unclear at times.So if you haven't already done so watch this classic bear with it and see the explosion that was Bruce Lee.".

Events then escalate and a large brawl breaks out. Chen finds his green medallion shattered and Chen fights like mad. The violence then escalates throughout the rest of the film leaving Chen little choice on his mission of justice. The Big Boss is a cheap production even for HK films of its era. However Bruce carries the film easily with his eclectic intense presence flawless physique and super human fighting skills. Of Bruce's films The Big Boss is also the bloodiest. Audiences never saw anything like Bruce Lee before and the film was a huge hit. Bruce became an instant cultural icon on par with The Beatles in Hong Kong.

When they inevitably cause trouble for Cheng's group he has to decide on whether to obey a promise he made not to fight or help to defend those closest to him. Now while this film isn't nearly as good as a couple of other Bruce Lee movies it did have a big influence on starting the martial arts genre that we enjoy today. I believe that it is because of this reason that many people rate it so highly. However upon closer inspection I think that most people would see that there are obvious faults to this film. The film quality isn't good the dubbing is bad and there are parts that seem to drag on way too long. But there is plenty of action and a few pretty ladies to lend some nice scenery. I especially liked Miss Wuman Marilyn Bautista. Even so this is a very basic martial arts film and I rate it as average.".

It is obvious that something is wrong at the factory that it was a front for drug shipping. Chaoan has to renounce his oath of nonviolence to get revenge and stop the Big Boss YinChieh Han.The Big Boss is Bruce Lee's first feature film and it's pretty good. After setbacks in Hollywood Bruce Lee moved to Hong Kong and tried to break into Hollywood 'through the setdoor'. The film made him a international star and he is the pacesetter for materialarts films.The plot is simple but it stronger then it was in Fist of Fury. The drug plot line was becoming more popular in the 70s and even the producers tried to cash in on the success of the French Connection and calling the film the Chinese Connection for Western audiences. Sadly for them the American distributors got the names mixed up and call the Big Boss Fury of Fist. This film is darker then other Bruce Lee films with a lot of violence and death and the affects of the underworld. I enjoyed that. There are excellent materialarts fights and action scenes and Bruce Lee play a conflicted character who turns from a peaceful man to a man of violence.This is an essential film for Bruce Lee fans.".

She is apparently troubled and has erotic fantasies with her husband always playing the bad guy  tormenting her. The director is very cunning in sprinkling some scenes from Severine's childhood which actually give a lot of clue regarding her troubled life. One such scene depicts her being abused by an elderly man probably her father. This in my opinion is very revealing and makes our understanding of Severine's other actionsimaginations even better. She always considered herself impure and was ashamed of letting her husband know that. This can be seen in one such sprinkler scenes where the girl Severine refuses to accept the holy offerings from the Father in the Church. And this scene is very aptly placed while Severine is found going up the stairs of the brothel to take up the job as a prostitute.Having been abused by an elderly man in her childhood Severine justifiably doesn't enjoy an young man's company in the bed her husband. And she has erotic fantasies about going to bed with elderly clients at the brothel....again taking a job at the brothel is a fantasy and NOT real. This is very evident from the very funny illogical incidents that take place in the brothel.Into her fantasies walks a young man and she had to please him on the bed at the brothel. While she lay on the bed the young man notices a mark on her and queries her about it. When Severine says its just a birth mark remember...this is analogous to the impurity she is carrying with her from her childhood the young man initially rejects her she thinks her husband would similarly reject her for her impurity but finally gives in and enjoys her. Only then she realises that the young man also bears a scar on his back which he says is from a knife stab. She realises everyone has a scar to be reconciled with in life. This gives her a great sense of relief and her attitude towards her husband slowly changes. In her fantasies however Severine sees a conflict between the young client and her husband and that the young man kills her husband in a fit of rage only to be killed in turn by the policeman. She ends the life of the young client in her fantasies. She confides in a family friend who is actually shown as one more client at the brothel and she is relieved that the husband knows the truth. This leads to a better understanding of her husband and a new relationship blossoms. Now the husband whom Severine thought was nothing but a crippled man blind and unyieldingshe realises that she had in fact only imagined all that and puts an end to her fantasies symbolised by the empty coach driven in the last scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "Belle de Jour is generally considered to be director Luis Bunuel's masterpiece a surprisingly revealing and seemingly personal venture into the world of eroticism and its deviances. It's a truly surrealistic exercise in ambiguity fantasy and reality. The line that separates them is blurred so much that the famously mysterious ending has had critics arguing for decades over its meaning.The fantasy sequences are usually signalled by the sound of carriage bells but by the end of the film the viewer is no longer able to differentiate between what is another one of Severine's fantasies and what is reality. Even Bunuel admitted to not knowing himself. He said that by the end the real and imaginary fuse for me they form the same thing. The gorgeous Catherine Deneuve resplendent in her icy prime portrays Severine Sevigny the middleclass wife of Pierre a doctor. She is frigid virginal yet seemingly happy enough in her bourgeoisie life and its trappings. However upon hearing about a local clandestine brothel from a friend she pays a visit to the madame and becomes a prostitute going by the name of Belle de Jour as she can only work in the afternoons. She apparently fully realizes and enjoys her sexuality despite her guilty conscience exclaiming that she can't help it. She certainly doesn't need the money. She's bored with her life and her marriage needing a firm hand to lead her a need which the madame Anais who is obviously attracted to her almost immediately recognizes. Her sweet and conventional husband is unaware treating her much like a child and the audience cannot help but believe that even if he knew of her true nature he would not understand or empathize. She keeps her two worlds neatly separate until a patron of hers whom she herself enjoys becomes obsessed with her and all is threatened.That Alfred Hithcock in particular admired this film comes as no surprise to me Deneuve would have been the perfect Hitchcock heroine an icy blonde who becomes a whore in the bedroom as Hitchock was fond of saying he preferred in his leading ladies. But this remark is not meant to simplify the story its telling or Deneuve's remarkable performance which is what truly draws the viewer into the film.Belle de Jour was Bunuel's first foray into the use of color and he employed it to great effect. From the fall colors displayed in the landscape scenes to the subtle shades in Deneuve's clothing the contrasts are set. While the world around her explodes in glorious hues Deneuve's character is defined by her couture if staid wardrobe of tan black and white.Belle de Jour was unreleased for many years due to copyright problems but finally rereleased in 1995 through the efforts of director Martin Scorcese and released on DVD in 2003. I've watched it twice in the past week and am still at a loss to describe it very well suffice to say that I am in awe. It's an amazingly erotic film without any explicitness and one that I expect hasn't lost any of its effect over the years. As the subject matter is handled very tactfully and without any actual sex scenes a great deal is left to the viewer's imagination  which only serves the heighten the mysteries inherent at every turn in the film. The viewer is however drawn into the sense of feeling to be a voyeur into Severine's secret life the careful choreography of scenes and camera angles contribute to the uncomfortable sense of intrusion by us the viewers.There are many substories and small mysteries in the film for instance one of the most widely debated upon by critics is the mystery of what is in the Asian client's little box? that he presents first to one prostitute who quickly refuses then to Severine who tentatively agrees. All the audience know is that it's something with a insectlike noise and when the client leaves Severine is sprawled facedown upon the bed the sheets thrown about and obviously pleased with whatever took place in the interim.Belle de Jour was awarded the Golden Lion at the 1967 Venice Film Festival as well as the award for Best Foreign Film in 1968 from the New York Film Critics Circle.Interesting side notes Bunuel himself had a shoe fetish which helps explain the numerous shots of Deneuve's beautifully clad feet throughout the film and the fact that every time she goes shopping she buys shoes. He also appears in the film in a cameo as a cafe patron and in another scene his hands are shown loading a gun.".

Director Bunuel whose masterpiece this is so blurs the line between memory reality and fantasy that by the film's conclusion one cannot be sure if some most or everything about the film has been Deneuve's fantasy.Although it includes a number of impressive performances particularly by Genevive Page her girls and their clients BELLE is essentially Deneuve's film from start to finish and she gives an astonishing performance that cannot be easily described. Like the film itself it is a balancing act between fantasy and a plausible reality that may actually be nothing of the kind. Bunuel presents both her and the film as a whole in an almost clinical manner and is less interested in gaining our sympathy for the character than in presenting her as an object for intellectual observation.Ultimately BELLE DU JOUR seems to be about a lot of things some of them obvious and some of them extremely subtle. And yet given the way in which it undercuts its realities by blurring them with fantasy it is also entirely possible that the film is not actually about anything except itself.

Pierre is a handsome young surgeon. They sleep in separate beds. An older friend Henri keeps hitting on her but she tells him to keep his compliments for himself. He is attracted by her blonde perfection her virtue and her icy disdain.Taking fantasy a stage further Sverine gets a daytime job at a high class brothel. At first she is prudish and wants to pick her clients. Then she is shown 'a firm hand'  which the masochistic side of her nature relishes.Rereleased almost forty years after its original cinema exhibition Belle de Jour still has the power to shock. Not through explicit nudity it is a highly erotic work without being titillating but by the shocking images and the superb performances that contrast the aloofness of the bourgeoisie to the practicality of sex of elegance to depravity. Scenes of Sverine having mud thrown at her stick in the mind no less than the tentativeness with which she approaches the brothel for the first time dressed in black and ready to take flight at any moment. Couture by Yves Saint Laurent and lush photography drown us in luxurious chic. The stylish settings arouse our aesthetic senses and the languorous pacing and emotional complexity keep us trying to figure it all out long before we realise just how difficult that is going to be. Analysing it in Freudian or purely sexual terms is less than satisfying. The characters are convincing  the posh conservative elite the matteroffact but certainly not coarse madame the pervs who visit the brothel and the psychologically conflicted Sverine through them all. It is hardly a plea for sexual liberation  the men even one that Sverine takes a fancy to are pretty lowlife. Their strange fantasy requirements mete out the most fascinating tableau of perversions but even more fascinating is what we don't see such as what is in the box brought by the Chinaman. We are forced to identify with Sverine  she is the most normal character  and yet the most convincing way to approach the film is one suggested by Buuel himself as a parable attacking the decadence of the bourgeoisie. On a more elevated level it is a forceful artistic statement that viewers addicted to linear storytelling may find hard to accept. It seems to anticipate Eyes Wide Shut in its treatment of hidden sexuality but cinematically it is more linked to the surreal Mulholland Drive. Buuel's friend from University and at one point collaborator Salvador Dali could be similarly perplexing when it came to alternate realities. He said People love mystery and that is why they love my paintings. The mind is drawn to interpret a piece of art in a specific concrete way but the artist may wish to express a concept that transcends specific examples. In Belle de Jour Buuel claims that there are not two endings just one ambiguous ending. When you have finished watching the film it is not hard to decide which scenes are reality and which are fantasy but when you run it through your mind again it is equally possible to make alterations. Do we want to know what is in the box or do we love the mystery?The name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on 'lady of the night' since Sverine only worked in the day everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter Sverine's feverish imagination and you might see something else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sverine is perfect she's Catherine Deneuve. She consciously inhabits her subconscious and the comings and goings are tinted with pristine erotic decadence. Her perfection includes outrage without rage panic without fear. Having or not having is the question she never asks. Her husband Pierre the exquisite Jean Sorel is like one of her garments.

Sverine's dreams are vividly sexual the opening scene marks the tone of the movie and the character as she dreams with being raped spanked and humiliated while her angered husband watches. Throughout the rest of the movie Sverine will be trying to make these fantasies come true in a brothel she starts working at or is she? This is what's fun in Buuel's movie it's impossible to tell fiction from fact.Sverine is the heart and soul of 'Belle de Jour' her journey through her own sexuality is riveting she starts with as a repressed woman who's having marital problems probably due to sex. As a way to get out of her dull life she starts working at a brothel during daytime hence her nickname 'beautiful by day.' Some of the episodes at the brothel are funny her first attempt at playing a dominatrix is an embarrassing experience for the poor Sverine who's not accustomed to the relationship between dominatordominated her experience with a creepy Asian client is highly enigmatic mainly because of the famous and mysterious box the client brings whatever it is it seems to bring Sverine a lot of pleasure. Her she participates in a roleplaying situation with a rich enigmatic man who asks her to perform a dead woman in a bizarre ritualfuneral scene the level of insinuations this scene creates in one's mind is outstanding! Meanwhile amidst all the pleasure Sverine is haunted with a sense of guilt and shame as she keeps imagining herself being punished by her husband and his best friend. She ponders leaving the brothel until a new client arrives and she's immediately attracted to him.Pierre Clemnti was an outstanding revelation although I had unknowingly seen him once before in Bertolucci's 'The Comformist' as the homosexual driver Lino I certainly noticed him in this movie he's a fascinating combination of style and substance with his amazing performance playing the sophisticated leatherwearing canewielding goldtoothed young criminal Marcel meeting Sverine when celebrating a successful bank heist. His obsession for her grows to fantastic proportions culminating in the unexpected tragedy of the third act. The end of the movie is perhaps the weirdest part of the narrative the one where all interpretations become valid it's also a great sendup on happy endings and a fine conclusion to a thriller if this movie were a thriller Buuel is just genius! Belle de Jour is a funny tragic and ultimately unique movie. I had the opportunity to watch it at a theatre room last year and obviously I felt the pleasure of seeing this bizarre masterpiece as all movies should be seen on the big screen.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great surrealist dramas and a staple of cerebral erotica. Luis Bunuel a director who has been considered the frontrunner of Surrealism in cinema has created a movie that unfolds like a Moebius strip  beginning at the end ending at the beginning with no conclusion to its question. Who is Severine? The question is asked in several key moments throughout the story but never answered in a satisfactory manner. All that can be done is to sit back and watch the story of how Severine gives in to her own desires and inner dreams and gets lost along the way....Erotica is one of the least understood of literary genres because of the exploitative nature associated with it. Very few people today can write erotica in a way that doesn't in one way or another fall into the traps of having to show more than imply and therefore render its effect a moot point. Writers Anais Nin and Pauline Reage were keen in making their worlds places where despite some explicit passages sensuality was felt through a looking glass filter rather than slapped across the face. When seen under a surrealist vein erotica becomes less sexual more cerebral and completely revelatory.Severine like Sabina in Anais Nin's poetic novella of erotica A Spy in the House of Love is dissatisfied with her life. Like Sabina's husband Alan Pierre is completely unaware of who he's married to and is all business and travel. Both women meanwhile dream of escape of male dominance asserting their own freedom and will jeopardize their security. Both characters will undergo complete changes in their personality under the guise of roleplay never allowing themselves to become attached to other men even when they may want to possess them completely as Marcel does when Severine becomes inaccessible to him.Cinematically BELLE DE JOUR is perfect even when this term sounds clich. Severine's story is a full circle she's seen in black disguise walking into Madame Anais' townhome she emerges near the end wearing the same outfit a cold socialite. It's an interesting coincidence that Anais is the ringleader who controls Severine's dreamy incursions into sex and this story bears a strong relation to Anais Nin's erotic writings themselves incursions into surrealistic sensual dreams. Madame Anais seduces her in the beginning with a kiss Severine severs ties with Anais through a kiss. Also Severine is framed in an isolated way at the fringes of the action in two scenes involving a male client at Anais' townhome  both times this only makes her more visible naked vulnerable. In both she is taken by force though the second encounter initiates those events that break the third wall and literally walk into her Architectural Digest home.BELLE DE JOUR is extremely undeniably erotic. The opening sequence per se looks rather mundane  Severine is subjected to a scene of debasement while her husband Pierre looks on  but as the story progresses it will take on a different connotation and from here on unfold. Because there is no transition from this sequence to the next where Severine and Pierre are in their placid empty bedroom it sort of leaves the viewer hanging and wondering just what has taken place or if anything has happened at all. Of course Severine's own psyche takes center stage more assertively as she herself gets a stronger footing in her new situation so these shifts become clearer as the movie goes deeper into her story.Sounds also play an important part of Severine's story the jingling of bells signal the awakening of an erotic episode. Footmen enter the stage and bookend the story cowbells become the appearance of bulls bearing names referring to expiation Severine is sodomized by a bulllike Asian man bearing a box that hums softly and whatever is inside has to be clearly repugnant when another escort refuses to go to bed with the client. Bunuel of course wants show the hypocrisy behind the complacency of the upper class and what better way to do so than via guilt. Severine for example can't stand Henri her girlfriend's boyfriend but through his suggestion she enters this strange world of hidden sexuality. We see her on two occasions as a little girl in two moments of humiliation through her own guilt. She desires Henri while she also hates him  a guilty pleasure. Henri discovers her secret and exposes her for what she is  a common slut. If anything even when he seems the villain of the piece Henri can be related to Everyman longing for the ideal woman. Once he finds that she's really not that mysterious after all he dumps her because she's lost her abstraction.It's this event  ripping Severine off from her pedestal  that finally severs her secure world even when she's apparently abandoned her profession. Again much like Sabina in Spy... Severine is doomed now to assume a different role while still longing for her more carnal life and with the faint ringing of those ghostly bells coming not long after Pierre reacts weeping to this revelation and possibly even dies his twisted hand is an indication it makes me wonder if their appearance is only the beginning of her punishment and another way the story becomes a complete cycle of erotic evolution that will take the viewer back to the Bois du Bologne and that coach ride.".

This works though because unlike a film like Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie where surrealism was like another character amidst the other character's dreams and nightmares this one only keeps in surrealism for the sake of the lead character's inner demons poking up through the everyday malaise. This lead Severine is played in one of Catherine Deneuve's key career performances that finds that twosidedness she feels while married to her husband Pierre. She loves him but there's something that she's not getting out of the marriage that's leaving her empty aimless and her fantasies however in the realm of dark fantasy go to show she needs to do something during the day. She then finds out about a highclass brothel with only a couple of workers already employed. At first reluctant she gives in to her temptations serving the odder types of Paris looking for a good time with one of them Marcel Pierre Clementi falling head over heels for her. What seemed most intriguing about the film was how Bunuel dealt with the themes the two crucial ones being morality and sexuality. His imagery is direct maybe too direct but it gets its points across with a realism that is alluring and far  away almost like a satire of such a life. She can't stop what she's started and she doesn't really know how to end it unless she gets caught. Then with the sexuality it's never overemphasized i.e. no nudity outside of a quick couple of shots of nudity and no one is shown having sex on screen. What comes out is the emotional tally of Severine the other girls and the supporting characters that come in and out of the brothel. It may seem dated at moments and the observatory notes go to making the film seem a tad longer than it is. But nevertheless Belle de Jour is a worthwhile memorable effort of the 1960's cinema. And at many times it's quite funny. More than that a laugh riot.".

	schema:reviewBody "To Author SanTropezCouch who did not understand Luis Buuel's Belle De JourI have just read your review on Belle De Jour. I do not wish to bash it I just want you to become aware of a few things since you obviously share an enthusiasm in film. Hopefully you will be able to understand Luis Buuel a little better. First of all you wrote It's not a masterwork but this film is a masterwork. Why else would Martin Scorsese present it? You talked about being puzzled by the films weaving in and out of dream sequences and that perhaps David Lynch would be able to do a more masterful job. You have to understand that Buuel does this intentionally. He is a man who tries not to have a lot of logic in the story line of his movies. Check out Phantom of Liberty However there is a lot of symbolism that you missed in the film. It takes reading and maturity to find out what Buuel is all about. The film is unclear weather the ending is a reality or fantasy. Even Buuel himself said he did not know. If you wanted to make this film make sense it would kill what is great about it. Most people do not understand Buuel that will and criticize him for doing something spectacular outside of the logical Hollywood system which people are use to. You also wrote The film isn't very engaging visually. I have to disagree again. Look at the way Buuel shots only Catherine Deneueve's feet in one of the earlier scenes before she enters the brothel. This is genius. Without showing concern on her face or through dialogue for that matter he shows us what she is feeling through the actions of her walking. He does this again later in the film. Also you have to look Catherine Deneueve's apartment in this film a very bourgeoisie like style which Buuel likes to criticize. You can see how empty Catherine Deneueve's marriage to Marcel is. You really need to read up on Buuel before you can criticize him like this. I'm not meaning to be rude either. I had no idea what was going on when I first watched this film. You should watch his first film ever made Un chien andalou. He made the movie have no logical sense at all. Cheers".

	schema:reviewBody "In Paris the bored and frigid upperclass housewife Sverine Serizy Catherine Deneuve is married with the handsome doctor Pierre Serizy Jean Sorel and she fantasizes kink sex with strangers every now and then. Pierre's friend Henri Husson Michel Piccoli and his wife Renee Macha Mril are frequently meeting Pierre and Sverine and after having lunch together Renee tells to Sverine that their acquaintance Henriette is working in a whorehouse and Husson gives the address of a highclass brothel in Paris. Sverine visits Madam Anais Genevive Page in her brothel and is hired to work from 200 PM to 500 PM with the nickname Belle de Jour. The young client Marcel Pierre Clmenti has a crush on Sverine and becomes her prime client. However when Husson discovers that Sverine is working in the whorehouse she decides to quit the job. But Marcel does not intend to loose her. Today I have watched Belle de Jour maybe for the fifth or sixth time now on DVD and I still am not sure about what are Sverine's erotic daydreams and reality. My point of view is that the whole brothel thing is a fantasy of this repressed woman in her empty afternoons. Her erotic dream entwined with her boring reality ends with her husband paralyzed Marcel dead and Husson telling the truth to Pierre. Now that her fantasy is complete she begins another dream with the stagecoach in the park in the last scene. This is another fascinating film of the great Luis Buuel one of my favorite directors ever and the beauty of Catherine Deneuve is mesmerizing. Last time I had seen this film was on 22 October 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Bela da Tarde The Gorgeous of the Afternoon".

	schema:headline " Intentionally ambiguous Buuel drama proves to have a lot more style than substance";
	schema:reviewBody "After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour' I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Buuel was trying to say. And if you asked Buuel what the meaning of the film was he probably would have told you 'it is what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour' Buuel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative.Buuel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments an idyllic carriageride seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Buuel's protagonist Sverine Catherine Deneuve is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband Pierre. But in a blink of an eye Buuel has the last laugh or should I say the first laugh? when we see that the assault on Sverine is a figment of her imagination. In reality she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967.But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation Buuel is committed to shocking us again. Sverine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as Sverine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations.In reality nothing is normal for Sverineshe must endure Husson the boyfriend of the couple's friend Rene who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a highclass whorehouse. This is how Sverine finds out about Madame Anas' establishment which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at as a highclass call girl.While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child Buuel is more interested in contrasting Sverine's life as an unhappy chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Buuel takes great pleasure in emphasizing Sverine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger' who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex. Sverine also expresses disgust to Madame Anas. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on but can't help staring through a peephole confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies.Buuel will turn things on a head once again when he introduces us to bad boy criminal Marcel a lout with metal teeth who Sverine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with Sverine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive.Buuel comes full circle playing with his audience. If Sverine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all had she not decided to work at the brothel Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that Sverine refers to Pierre's accident as he sits in his wheelchair. An accident seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an accident not the shooting which caused him to become paralyzed? If so the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of Sverine's imagination.The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and Sverine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Buuel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now Sverine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on Sverine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair suggesting death.For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others including myself seek narratives with a more clearcut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless in the end this is a film with a lot more style than substance.".

I saw it as a commentary on modern bourgeois life.  Here we have an elegantly attractive woman who needs to be loved yet cannot show love herself.  She cannot break the bonds that define her life and surrender herself to emotion so she seeks pleasure through anonymous sex.  Perhaps it's Buuel commentating on the estrangement of modern life particularly our sexual mores.The ending has puzzled many including myself.  There's a scene at the beginning of the film where Deneuve fantasizes about going on a carriage ride with her husband and being whipped and raped by his servants.  Perhaps the final scene of the carriage returning empty is Buuel's way of saying her fantasies have ended.  But was the experience at the brothel a dream too or is she satisfied now that her husband is paralyzed the result of a jealous customer's rage?  Is she cured of her detachment or have circumstances simply resolved her emotional dilemma?Catherine Deneuve is one of the world's great beauties and she is deliciously so in this film but she also gives a terrific performance here. She hides her emotions and leaves several interpretations to her character which is what Buuel obviously wanted from her.  An excellent film from one of the greatest directors of cinema ever.".

I do not speak French but I found the acting average and the characters we dull and predictable. The dream sequences are dumb onedimensional symbolism Freud would have laughed at. What is everyones fascination with Catherine Deneuve in this film? She has a deer in headlights look about everything she encounters and she offers nothing new to the character she is trying to portray. I do not speak french but the bad acting translated itself straight through the language barrier. The scenes were often not funny enough to laugh and not dramatic enough to be moved or interested. The surreal aspect isn't even engaging enough for this to be pondered. Perhaps I don't undertstand the surreal aspect but I'm really not sure what people see in this film. The interesting premise and themes are present and this is what kept it from being a complete bore.".

I do not speak French but I found the acting average and the characters we dull and predictable. The dream sequences are dumb onedimensional symbolism Freud would have laughed at. What is everyones fascination with Catherine Deneuve in this film? She has a deer in headlights look about everything she encounters and she offers nothing new to the character she is trying to portray. I do not speak french but the bad acting translated itself straight through the language barrier. The scenes were often not funny enough to laugh and not dramatic enough to be moved or interested. The surreal aspect isn't even engaging enough for this to be pondered. Perhaps I don't undertstand the surreal aspect but I'm really not sure what people see in this film. The interesting premise and themes are present and this is what kept it from being a complete bore.";

	schema:reviewBody "Belle de Jour caught a lot of attention 40 years ago because Luis Buel 19001983 directed it and at the time he was considered innovative. The passage of time however has not been kind to this movie. It now appears to be nothing more than a conventional sex melodrama the kind French intellectuals were railing against in the French theatre as early as 1890. True there are some unconventional turns particularly the pedestrian dream sequences Buel inserted to amplify the fantasies bedeviling the wouldbe whore Severine played by Catherine Deneuve. But the sequences are unimaginatively shot and sometimes the editing is clumsy a good example is the well known mud slinging scene as Severine imagines her husband and his friend splattering her with a kind of black goo. It's utterly unconvincing.The strength of the movie if it has one is Catherine Deneuve. She was at age 24 approaching the pinnacle of her beauty in the film. The director was wise to choose an actress with her stunning looks but he unfortunately could not convince her to degrade herself on camera. The degradation process is crucial for what is happening to the character of Severine. She remains prim and proper as all manner of fetishists have their way with her one can only speculate what an actress like Fanny Ardant or Isabelle Adjani could have done with this material. Both actresses were much too young in when the film was shot in 1967 to be considered for the part Ardant was 18 and Adjani was a child but subsequent performances by both actresses have revealed abilities that make the prospect intriguing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was something about the 1960s that brought out a playfulness in filmmakers which allowed them to not have to condescend to audiences and wrap up every little aspect of the film in a neat little bow. When the films' techniques and narrative strengths worked as in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup or Ingmar Bergman's Persona the result was a great film. When neither worked the result was a pretentious mess like Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or Luis Buuel's Belle De Jour his 1967 foray into color film based upon the same titled novel of Joseph Kessler released in 1928.The film has been described as an 'erotic masterpiece' but forty years later one is left with a film that has so little sex in it that it could pass as a PG film if released today as well as lacking all eros. Mild sex scenes are not by definition eros and it's difficult to believe that anyone watching this film could have been shocked much less aroused by a single scene in it. Yes young Catherine Deneuve as bored bourgeois hausfrau Sverine Serizy is her typical gorgeous self but having seen her in several of her later roles plus her featured role in Roman Polanski's Repulsion I seriously must question whether she could really act. In Polanski's film she plays a neurotic sexually stifled woman who sleepwalks through her descent to murderess after what was likely a childhood of sexual abuse. Similarly her character of Sverine was sexually abused seen through flashbacks and after which she refuses communion but unlike the Repulsion heroinevillain is not repulsed by raw sex but attracted to the filthy sadomasochistic aspects of it. Had Bergman made this film it would have been far subtler and better. That Alfred Hitchcock by contrast loved this film says a lot for his own films were equally dependent upon hamhanded views of sexuality and most are equally outdated as well for that very reason. Apologists for the film claim that it allows viewers to bring their own thoughts and experiences into the film. Well most films do so that's not a great argument. Belle De Jour fails for the opposite reason it lacks a core emotionally philosophically and technically masquing it all with claims of Surrealism that label used to cover and alibi for all manner of bad art.In short this film does not even walk the walk and Buuel is not in a league with such filmmakers as Werner Herzog nor Antonioni as far as symbolism goes. Belle De Jour may have titillated audiences four decades ago but today it simply plays out as a wan and silly as well as poorly wrought exploration of a dull woman's sexual life and how that keeps her deluded and miserable. One need not pay to see such when a trip to the local supermarket can give you dozens of more interesting female subjects to choose from.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have very little experience in life and have your head buried in the New York Times maybe Luis Bunuel's masterpiece will titillate your senses but if you spend a day in the real world you might find this movie is just a little silly. Fun to watch truthfully but art it ain't.Catherine Deneuve age 24 plays a 24 year old wife whose husband is not only very good looking but he's got a wonderful personality and he loves his wife faithfully. Besides this he's truly rich  a multimillionaire  who provides her with everything she wants EXCEPT.... Except having everything can be so boring Note True sympathy here. Being rich but without challenge goals or purpose is an empty life. So Catherine will try to fulfill herself in a fantasy brothel which supposedly operates in an upscale Paris neighborhood. Nothing that happens there rings true but I think it's especially false as a woman's fantasy. Women do not dream if the Ultimate Orgasm with a seriously overweight slob with a personality to match. But in the film's trademark scene there's Catherine in the afterglow of a workout with this 300 pounder orgasm fulfilled at last. Gosh!From there she gets one of these inmoviesonly perverts that wants to play the houseservant brandishing a plume featherduster and being bawledout by his mistress. Double gosh! Where are all these rich guys that play these games? Mostly in the minds of really bad fiction writers. Does Bunuel even know that most girls in a brothel do not like dealing with freaks at any price?One other big failure as if the stupid writing isn't enough. Catherine Deneuve was described in 1967 as perhaps the most beautiful woman in history. Too bad she does a seminude scene where we find that despite her stunning face her body is not beautiful at all.In 1967 the French were producing many very fine and artistic movies. Belle de Jour was not one of them. 210.".

Jack can save his preteen son Andrew literally in his arms but his wife and two daughters are among the slaughter victims. Western governments seem unwilling to go after the fiends even hiding the identity of a highprofile victim. Although now a single father Jack uses all his contacts and snooping skill to seek the truth himself. A Londonbased Serbian free newspaper editor sets him on the trail of four Balkanic killers but is murdered. Jack decides to exact revenge himself tippedoff by Sretcontact Duguay.

The film raises lightly but thoughtfully questions of how civilized people ought to react to outrageous attacks upon them and muses over the rights and wrongs of vigilantism. Jeremy Irons reminds us again that he is one of the best screen actors in the world the pain and distress which he etches in his role as the bereaved father is very moving. Forest Whitaker makes the most of an underwritten part and when he and Irons come face to face in the climactic scenes they are a magnificent duo of powerful screen presences.  This film will presumably disappear in the aftermath of September 11th events.  Which is a pity since in its modest way it actually has something to say.

An actor of much skill and emotional range he can admittedly be faulted for the occasional bizarre choice of rolls for example the pedophile in the Lolita remake and the mad bomber in Die Hard 3 performances that surely have him waking up nights in a cold sweat. In The Fourth Angel he takes on a semiaction role which is not his usual casting and yes he pulls it off because his character is basically a brainy journalist who stumbles into the world of shootemup terrorists. If he is to survive he must figure out how the clip goes into the AK47 and how to work the safety and learn it even as the killers are coming down the hall for him.There's no secret about the plot. His wife and daughter are slaughtered by terrorists and he discovers that governments are not going to lend a hand. The way he expresses both his grief and his outrage represent his art at its peak. This film is nicely written and paced and reminded me of Defense of the Realm. The Fourth Angel has an important role for a young male actor who does very nicely and features a brief but pleasing appearance by Charlotte Rampling who has made the transition from femme fatale to middle aged woman with great grace. She will look better to some now than she did then.".

Being a journalist he uses his skills to find out where the hijackers will be and he takes it upon himself to even the score. This is an extremely intelligent and absorbing film about a difficult subject handled with skill and grace by everyone involved. Irons is superb as always incapable of making a false move he embues Jack Elgin with a stunning mixture of rage frailty horror and resolve. Forest Whitaker another brilliant actor incapable of a false move is also used to fine advantage as the FBI agent assigned to the case and finding himself  SPOILER ALERT  understanding and sympathizing with Elgin  END OF SPOILER  and the appearance of the fiercely intelligent Charlotte Rampling certainly doesn't hurt. The film is very hard to find  I bought my DVD online through JumboVideo in Canada. There's a very cool Featurette on this DVD where everyone involved talks about the making of the film in great detail very satisfying.".

It would have been a great movie if it was more of a satire like Hot Shots! and Black Dynamite. Instead they decided to make something serious and the outcome is ridiculous. The acting is very good but their dialogue is quite crappy and without any real sense. Irons and Whitaker do their best to deliver with emotion the words written by obviously a 12yearold and you just laugh all the way. Their idea of putting the protagonist in dilemmas where he seeks justice but it can't be delivered because of failed politics is quite good but again the people who were behind this messed up everything else.To the good stuff  Fun fact The Serbian terrorists have neither Serbian names nor do they speak Serbian. There never even was a case of reported terrorism from Serbians. The writer and producer just thought that since they never cared to learn anything about Serbians then their audience wouldn't have either and they would accept the Serbian terrorism story.  Fun fact Limassol in Cyprus doesn't have an airport  Fun fact Cyprus is not a desert and neither does it have people wearing jelabias the white sheets that most Muslims wear  Fun fact Terrorism in Cyprus is inexistent.Being from Cyprus it was actually quite funny to watch how the British thought Cyprus was considering they are a significant percentage of the tourists visiting the island. Great!Short version If you want to watch a bmovie for the laughs then this is not bad actually. If you want to watch a real movie don't bother.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Elgin Irons is a hardworking magazine editor. He loves his wife son and daughter and he decides to combine work with a family vacation when they all fly to India. Unfortunately terrorists hijack the plane and kill a lot of people along the way  including two members of the Elgin family. Suddenly the genteel Elgin becomes irritated and aggressive and has revenge on his mind. After typically trying all the traditional channels to get justice he realizes the only true justice will come by his own hand. Along his road to revenge he meets CIA agent Davidson Priestley FBI agent Bernard Whitaker and reconnects with old contacts such as a woman named Kate Rampling. Will our unorthodox hero iron out the bad guys once and for all...or will he find out he has too many IRONS in the fire? Find out today...Before Taken 2008 Before Harry Brown 2009 before The Gunman 2015 and before the trend of what Hollywood snidely dubbed GeriAction we had The Fourth Angel. If a bunch of highclass British people made a Death Wish sequel in their own milieu and instead of Charles Bronson got Jeremy Irons The Fourth Angel would be the likely result. There's something awesome about Jeremy Irons one minute wearing white pants and a polo sweater or off pheasant hunting and the next minute he's wearing the timehonored Revenge Jacket speeding down the street on a motorcycle smoking a cigarette and blowing away the bad guys with an arsenal of guns and grenades.Director John Irvin who has had a long and distinguished career but would be known to us and fans of the site as the director of the classic Arnie vehicle Raw Deal 1986  no one gives Schwarzenegger a Raw Deal just in case you forgot  and Dot.Kill 2005 does more than a solid job he is in control of the proceedings and directs with style excitement and fluidity. The Fourth Angel rarely gets boring and you really care about Jack and his son. You truly want Jack to blow the baddies to kingdom come but with style aplomb and some classic British restraint.The movie delivers the goods on a lot of levels and is a satisfying watch. Irons is backed up well by his costars Rampling has a small role but always adds something to whatever she's in Forest Whitaker we all know has charisma and commitment and Jason Priestley is too old to be a teenager but too young to be a CIA agent. He's caught in the middle agewise but we're glad he's here. We guessed the filmmakers thought Luke Perry would be too much of a Himbo to take on the role. So naturally they got Priestley instead.The Fourth Angel is certainly what you would call a classy revenge film which shows that our favorite subgenre has many flavors and varieties. Just when you think you've seen 'em all along comes Jeremy Irons to show terrorists the true meaning of Class Warfare! We give a hearty recommendation to this fine film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jack Elgin Irons is a hardworking magazine editor. He loves his wife son and daughter and he decides to combine work with a family vacation when they all fly to India. Unfortunately terrorists hijack the plane and kill a lot of people along the way  including two members of the Elgin family. Suddenly the genteel Elgin becomes irritated and aggressive and has revenge on his mind. After typically trying all the traditional channels to get justice he realizes the only true justice will come by his own hand. Along his road to revenge he meets CIA agent Davidson Priestley FBI agent Bernard Whitaker and reconnects with old contacts such as a woman named Kate Rampling. Will our unorthodox hero iron out the bad guys once and for all...or will he find out he has too many IRONS in the fire? Find out today...Before Taken 2008 Before Harry Brown 2009 before The Gunman 2015 and before the trend of what Hollywood snidely dubbed GeriAction we had The Fourth Angel. If a bunch of highclass British people made a Death Wish sequel in their own milieu and instead of Charles Bronson got Jeremy Irons The Fourth Angel would be the likely result. There's something awesome about Jeremy Irons one minute wearing white pants and a polo sweater or off pheasant hunting and the next minute he's wearing the timehonored Revenge Jacket speeding down the street on a motorcycle smoking a cigarette and blowing away the bad guys with an arsenal of guns and grenades.Director John Irvin who has had a long and distinguished career but would be known to us and fans of the site as the director of the classic Arnie vehicle Raw Deal 1986  no one gives Schwarzenegger a Raw Deal just in case you forgot  and Dot.Kill 2005 does more than a solid job he is in control of the proceedings and directs with style excitement and fluidity.

I was surprised to see that this was made in 2003 actually because an earlier release date would have made the quality somewhat more forgivable.Irons plays an ordinary man here who remakes himself into a warrior after the death of his family in a terrorist attack. His methods of tracking down extremist factions and turning their own weapons against them become so impressive it attracts the attention of an FBI agent Forest Whitaker who has his own agenda regarding shutting down terrorists.I will say that the terrorist plot line and death of his family was interesting just not done well. His ensuing vigilanteism reminded me of 'Taken' although the two movies should not be compared as 'Taken' is actually a good movie. 03.13".

Jack knew what he had done and that was do some revenge killings and he thought the agent was just looking to make him relax and confess or something of that sort but Agent Jules Bernard kept saying to him he could be trusted to help Jack. Some suspense came from that scene for sure. Lastly the final action scene where Davidson played by Jason Priestley thinks he is going to finish off Jack and the other guy in the car only to end up being blown up and engulfed in fire like Jack's wife and daughter were was some good justice. It could have been shot a little better but whatever.A movie that is not in the category of a made for TV movie but it was pretty bland. I think the movie could rate lower and I may change my score one day but not sure.".

Only the performances of Irons and Forest Whitaker whose character was not that great on paper held my interrest. I never really got who the villains were. Some sort of Serbian terrorists with connections to the CIA and that's a big problem in a revenge flick. You're supposed to rut for the hero all the way and that's not easy if you don't really know what he is up against. The few action scenes were nothing special either. They were not really bad but it was fairly standard shootouts. The plot really tried to be smart and intriguing but it just ended up predictable and half assed. This was just a very hollow movie.".

Well it wasn't true this time because after the opening sequence I was pretty sure I was going to hate I Am Number Four. Thankfully I was in for a pleasant surprise.It all starts with bad CGImonsters and some guys in Star Trek makeup chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them  and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.The story involves a couple of characters and mysteries but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He's supported by his mentorprotector solid as always Timothy Olyphant. Glee's Dianna Agron plays Number Four's love interest. She comes across very natural so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomitinducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.Of course I Am Number Four is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the makeup of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to barely fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.However I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece considering the movie's premise. For what it is I Am Number Four is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twentysomethings. Add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake that it's not based on a comic book a TV series a computer game or toys and it's enough to lift I Am Number Four heads and shoulders above its genre competitors.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a perfect world the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success based off a semipopular novel for teens a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso the producing talent of Michael Bay two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron and an enigmatic yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? Opening with the death of Number Three we jump into the life of John Pettyfer an alien being protected on Earth from a group called the Mogadorians. As it turns out the Mogadorians wiped out the population of John's planet years before except for nine children with extraordinary powers. For some reason they have to be killed in order and with three down John is next in line for extermination. As he goes on the run with his protector Henri Timothy Olyphant they settle into the small town of Paradise Ohio. Soon after John starts gaining and learning more about his powers. But with a new love Agron and his lust to just be normal thrown into the mix John may be in more trouble than he can imagine.I have never read the source material for I Am Number Four but I would hazard a guess that it did a half decent job of explaining what is going on and did not just strive to set future sequels in motion. The film on the other hand suffers because the sequel seems to be the only thing in mind outside of special effects. We are thrown right into John's life and we only get little nuggets of reason for what is going on at any given time. We never get full explanations and are never even offered the ability to piece it together by ourselves. The film seems merely content giving us hints offering little enigmatic moments to get us thinking. But instead of doing anything with these scenes it merely continues trucking along to its eventual ending which promises a continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what is happening. But if the filmmakers do not care about informing the audience now why will we care later? But this would not be such a slap in the face if we had not already seen so many films in the past halfdecade doing the exact same thing attempting to replicate the success of the Harry Potter Twilight and The Lord of the Rings franchises. The Golden Compass Cirque du Freak The Vampire's Assistant The Spiderwick Chronicles and Percy Jackson  The Olympians The Lightning Thief which this film oddly resembles are all examples of studios making films out of young adult books specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequels and lengthy franchise possibilities. They all failed in varying degrees because they all suffer from the same thing I Am Number Four suffers from  not enough plot too much dependence on a sequel. Had all of these films even attempted to be able to stand on their own perhaps they would have gotten the sequel they seemed to think they deserved. I know Four is part of a proposed book franchise as opposed to an already established book franchise but it merely skipped the waiting in the middle for the eventual film.Should these plot and sequel problems not already be enough Four suffers from copying Twilight a little too close even including the notable musical cues from current altrockers. Sure there are no vampires but the romance between John and Agron's Sarah feels a little too forced for comfort. Right in the middle of being hunted down to be systematically wiped out we are supposed to believe that someone who has spent their life running would simply fall in love out of the blue and not feel any consequences? We are supposed to believe he does not know better? Sure he's a teenager and we all did stupid things when we were that young but why does the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two starcrossed lovers? I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of scifi is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst. It is awkward silly and practically plagiarizes Twilight.I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop. The film criminally underuses Olyphant the only actor who actually acts in the entire film and makes him into an almost useless background character. We only get glimpses of Teresa Palmer's character throughout the film the trailer already gives away any mystery of who she might be and when she finally shows up to do something she merely speaks in overtly sexual allusions. Pettyfer and Agron both seem to suffer from not knowing what emphasis to put on their character and when and relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe is stuck in the clichridden role as the knowitall geek of a best friend.When it attempts to work I Am Number Four is quite interesting. I would have loved more story and a whole lot less romance. Even what does work including the decent special effects seems to suffer as a result of all the melodramatic romance.410.This review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the NY Times bestselling novel by Pittacus Lore an alias for the memoirfabricating James Frey and Jobie Hughes I Am Four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing  albeit fairly unoriginal  concept.The planet Lorien COUGH krypton COUGH was destroyed and nine of its alien children were sent to earth. Why earth? Who knows. Perhaps earth's atmosphere is the most similar to Lorien's? A race of 7foot tall humanoids called the Mogadorians are hunting down the children one at a time. Why? Beats me. Because we wouldn't have a story otherwise I suppose. All we're really told is they're a race who chooses to decimate rather than colonize. So be it.Anyway due to some sort of spell the Mogadorians are forced to kill the nine remaining Lorien kids in the proper order. Who established the order and how? No idea. Wouldn't you be pretty ticked off if you were Number One and became aware that you were chosen to be killed first? Perhaps the numbering system is completely random. Otherwise that's a pretty jacked up system. Hmm little Billy seems to be a little slow upstairs and that lisp sure ain't doin' him any favors. Let's make him Number One. Regardless numbers one to three are now dead so the story focuses on Number Four.Number Four's desperate attempts to fit in lead to yet another blown cover and he and his guardian Henri must once again relocate  this time to the small town of Paradise OH. Following the film's somewhat promising start the story takes an illadvised detour and bogs down in a teenage romance marsh. It's at this point that Number Four AKA John Smith falls in love defends a nerd against bullies and begins to discover his unique abilities known as legacies.This blatant drawing from the well of the Twilight series' formula might giddy up the hearts of teenage girls but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film's trailer promised.That arrival comes in the film's third act in the form of a deus ex machina known as Number Six Teresa Palmer who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rumpage against the backdrop of CGI and specialeffects. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences but the drive there should've been smoother and more evenlypaced.Dialogue is weak character development is practically nonexistent and the underdeveloped backstory creates too many questions that lead to frustration rather than intrigue. Granted this is an origin story that's specifically designed to kickstart a franchise but a little more selfcontainment would have been appreciated.One of the film's biggest transgressions is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. We're told that he's a Lorien warrior and as such you'd expect him to join in the buttkickery. Unfortunately he's only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped done offscreen to mask its implausibility by a couple of outofshape alien conspiracy theorists. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warriorguardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom.The film presents a seed or two of hope that the franchise can improve with each installment but will its identity crisis allow it to do so? Attempting to be all things to all teenagers could backfire if it fails to create loyalty amongst any one demographic.Teenage audiences and those who don't consume themselves with the story's many flaws will be more forgiving than I. Perhaps your expectations will be exceeded but there's a good chance you'll be either underwhelmed or disappointed. Wouldn't you rather risk a dollar at Redbox than 10 a pop at the theater? Don't say I didn't properly inform you.".

I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable. Seeing it behindthescenes I couldn't imagine what it would look like. To be honest I was pleasantly surprised.The acting was believable and consistent unlike previous reviews who claim the actors lost steam halfway thru the film. Timothy Olyphant is perhaps the best character in the film Pettyfer following right after. The best part about this film the love story within the plot WAS NOT painfulannoying to watch such as Twilight.This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters as the action scenes truly make the experience.

I half expected one of his friends to shout Radical! but then I remembered that this was not made in the mid 1980s. From there it pretty much degenerates into a checklist of crappy movie clichs Brooding teen trying to fit in even though his power causes him to be different? Check. Generic bullies not realizing who they're messing with and getting their comeuppance? Check. Bad guys using girl to get to main character? Yup. Love for the girl giving the hero new strength to continue even though all looks hopeless? Double check.If you're looking for a movie you can turn off your brain and enjoy then I recommend renting one of the Xmen movies.

	schema:headline " Pretty decent film for a pulp novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror a scifi or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an ActionSciFiThriller though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart name Paradise horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names the scene is generally dark and dreary and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually a lot of films with the scifi moniker tend to actually be horror movies and the only reason that they are scifi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that scifi is not actually a genre in itself but rather a thematic setting since most scifi films will fall into action horror thriller romance and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself though it is probably better classified as epic.This film is about a teenager obviously so that it will appeal to a younger audience who turns out to be from another planet. His planet was destroyed by a race known as the Mogadorians however he and a few others managed to escape from their planet and are hiding on Earth. The catch is that the Mogadorians have found their hiding place and have traveled to Earth to locate them. They have already killed three of them and now they are after him.What we also learn of the hero whose name is John Smith as he is trying to hide is that he is of a special breed from his planet and as he grows older he develops extraordinary powers. We don't know if the powers are standardised or unique to each individual though when we meet number six we suspect that it is the later. The other interesting aspect of this film is the nature of modern technology. While John Smith is attempting to hide and remain hidden with the internet he is finding this very difficult. Further he has the urges of your average teenager to go to school and to socialise. However it is difficult to remain hidden in an American Highschool as if you are a jock then you will be noticed and if you shun the jock culture then you attract attention to yourself.I guess another aspect of this film is about fitting in. In a way John wants to have a normal life even if it involves not fitting in. We notice that he is the all American handsome hero though he rejects that culture and befriends the school geek and it turns out there is some connection between the school geek and his people and the girl that has been turned into an outcast and we also learn why she becomes an outcast. However while at the beginning this film is about the new kid fitting in it becomes clear that he goes from being the outcast chased by the police as he is strange and different to being the saviour. It should be remembered even though it is not explicitly stated that once the Mogadorians whose appearance are quite monstrous in itself have finished with their prey they will turn onto the people of Earth and without these protectors they will not have a chance. Once again it shows that desire of the developed world to have a saviour that can stand up to the threats the we face on a daily basis. Unfortunately unless one includes Jesus Christ in the fold and Christ is not a superman in that sense of the word  he came and died so that we might be reconciled to the father not to step up and defeat every evil force that comes our way especially since evil in itself is quite subjective.".

	schema:headline " I am Number Four is an absolute bore. An excruciatingly awful film.";
	schema:reviewBody "My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn't go with high expectations. I didn't expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action good special effects and reasonable acting but it didn't even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I'm not a teenager which this film is aiming for but even then it's so badly made even they shouldn't like this.Before I critique this film. A brief synopsis from what I can gather. Teenager John Smith Alex Pettyfer from Storm Breakers who is an alien from another planet Lorien is a fugitive on the run from his enemies the Mogadarians who have been sent to destroy him after killing three other kids before him with the same abilities. Changing his identity moving from town to town with his guardian Henri Timothy Olyphant John is always the new kid with no ties to his past. In the small Ohio town he now calls home John encounters unexpected lifechanging eventshis first love Sarah Dianna Agron powerful new abilities and a connection to the others like number six Teresa Palmer who shares his destiny. The first problem of this film is the screenplay which is a horrific mess. The synopsis I had to cobble together from a family friend who is a fan of the books but wasn't of the film. It is very loosely explained during the movie at different points with huge plot holes. If these Mogadarians want to destroy earth why don't they straight away? Why kill these teenagers who are a part of the legacy? How were the legacies and Mogadarians created? Why do the Mogadarians want to destroy earth? I think I heard something about resources but what? Maybe this is explained in the book or subsequent ones I don't know but for someone who hasn't read them things should have been explained and more clearly it's no excuse. Also when John saves Sarah from her exboyfriend and his friends pestering her at the fair she sees him using his powers his hands light up to deal with the guys but she dosen't say anything??? What the heck? Then later she suddenly finds out? This sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writers either that or during that scene Sarah went temporarily blind. I could go on with several other plot holes but you get the point. The structure of the film is terribly put together with certain scenes just feeling so random without them being linked together. Maybe the fact the film just suddenly decides to introduce new information in a convenient way like those weird creatures who guard the legacies including a dog that turns into the creature and the others for the Mogodarian's or whatever. And while we're on the subject of the Mogodarian's as villains they are ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slightest. All the characters are bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about John's past or his parents. With that you just don't care about them as they are little more than cardboard cutouts. Particularly when Henri dies in one scene with sad music. We're meant to care but the characters are so shallow and boring we just don't care and the whole pathetic scene just comes across as sickeningly insincere. Of course the characters being boring also comes down to terrible performances. Alex Pettyfer is just unbearably plain and looks and acts bored. He hasn't got the slightest trace of acting ability just like in Stormbreakers. None of the cast fare any better. They are all unconvincing and give some of the worst performances I've seen in films even Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer's Apprentice could not save this. She looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. I couldn't judge her acting as such though her voice when I heard it sounded like she was trying to be sexy with a sore throat. The trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy NOT funny script that she should speak like that needs a slap.I am Number Four tries to come across as a romantic scifi action but it has little action for teen boys only about ten minutes and even when there was the camera jerked up and down with a shocking lack of continuity I felt dizzy and couldn't make out what was going on so as a result there is no excitement you feel in watching the action. Michael Bay who was the producer of this and still hasn't learnt from Transformers 2 and little romance for teen girls. With little romance or action the film just pointlessly meanders itself sluggishly from scene to scene. In terms of the romance there is no chemistry between John and Sarah and even the special effects are very poor and look too obvious. The film is way too predictable with stereotypes across the board which you will notice straight away making it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film. I paid 6.20 to see this abomination I wish I hadn't. This is the first turkey of the year I've awarded for a film suppose it was only a matter of time. This is just complete rubbish and I would not advise anyone to see this travesty. There will be sequels unfortunately but I certainly won't be signing up to see it. I would rather throw up thanks then put myself through seeing another one of these. Trust me I am Number Four is that crap. I would seriously advise you to skip it. It is one of the worst films I have ever encountered.".

I remember reading the book and not being very impressed however I can't say I can pinpoint exactly what's been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I've seen both ends of the spectrum.Caruso tries a lot to hide the book's flaws and he really does try hard. But somehow he only makes them more obvious. I'll admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects but really when the story wasn't stealing from other scifi Animorphs Johnny Mnemonic Superman there's even an insulting John Carpenter's The Thing nod too it was overloading the audience's brain with Clichs that can be found in almost any teen movie... ever. And some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through.The action scenes I nearly left the cinema they were so bad. It's like Caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about shine flashlights in the camera lens and move it violently when some gets punched. Shaky Camera and quick cutting must die I'm tired of it.The soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top. At times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a 50 gallon drum. At others it's like they're attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast. The film's opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting it doesn't help that it lasts a minute long and the cue's buildup is hilarious.I know the movie is based on a book but with even that said there is a tonne of clichs. Hot chick who loves photography? Check. New kid is instantly buds with the nerd? Check. Douchebag jock who loves the hot chick? Check. Kid finds out he has powers he can't control? Check. evil villain are following kid and guardian? Check. Kid's guardian dies and he must do the mission without him? Check.There's also an annoying homoerotic undercurrent between Sam and John. Also don't get me started on the ThirtySue pileup that is Number 6.For every clich there's a gigantic plot hole. Why isn't the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys? How is John unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later? Why do the Mogadorian!!!! speak with Jamaican accents? How is the dog able to become all superdog all of a sudden? Why are Lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities? And how do Lorien copulate? Yeah let's not go there because the last thing this film needs is a Lorien sex scene.".

But IANF was such a disappointment in the way that there's nothing believable about the movie AT ALL.So the Mogadorians want to kill the 9 surviving Lorien kids with superpowers called Legacies. Why? It's not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the 'Mogs' don't colonize but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway right? It didn't help that right when Number Four's number is up pun intended he decides he wants to be 'normal' and 'go to school'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure what's a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward's whining 247 right? And what's with Number Four's propensity to constantly ignore sound lifesaving advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it's more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies anyway right? All in all I'd say the movie's a flop. The characters are either annoying unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she's just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story's just...meh.".

It's not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the 'Mogs' don't colonize but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway right? It didn't help that right when Number Four's number is up pun intended he decides he wants to be 'normal' and 'go to school'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure what's a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward's whining 247 right? And what's with Number Four's propensity to constantly ignore sound lifesaving advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it's more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies anyway right? All in all I'd say the movie's a flop. The characters are either annoying unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she's just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story's just...meh.";

	schema:headline " Boring besides the last 20 minutes...";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course I Am Number Four is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to barely fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. Among the good points the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic bald covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth carry some pretty cool weapons and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.The main problem is the movie is totally clichd. I mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama.new kid..shady past weird and wants to stay to himself but there's always some cute chick who he risks everything for. There's always bullies who hate that he's got the attention of the cute chick so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90 of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the discovering of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman. I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop.This Twilight series' formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film's trailer promised. I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of scifi in the form of a machina known as Number Six Teresa Palmer who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of CGI and specialeffects is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst.Acting wise Alex Pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique. Dianna Agron is pretty and acts fine. Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer's Apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. Kevin Durand as the Mogadorian Commander is good in his evil act. But one of the film's biggest disappointed is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. The film criminally underuses Olyphant the only actor who actually acts in the entire film and makes him into an almost useless background character. We're told that he's a Lorien warrior and as such you'd expect him to join in the butt kickery. Unfortunately he's only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warriorguardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. And then there's the relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe stuck in the clich ridden role as the knowitall geek of a best friend though he's fine in whatever he has.All this said though this movie isn't the best action film of the year its still worth a watch for the CGI and the last act of the movie. This is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more. So let's just hope they do it right in the sequels. I rate it 5.5 out out 10.".

The story I thought they did a decent job with but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book it would have been a better film. They could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book. I mean in the book Henri and John can open the chest he hides together. They open it in the book and Henri lays John down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet Lorien and with that Henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens visually.

These special aliens also have a guardian who was a warrior on their alien planet whose sole duty is to protect them. Oh and these special aliens have abilities that range from moving object with their minds superhuman strength invisibility etc. Got all that.

The film follows if you can guess the Number Four alien played by Alex Pettyfer and his guardian played by Timothy Olyphant.We are told that the first three aliens have already been killed and that Four is on the run with his guardian to Paradise Ohio. There he predictably gets tired of being told to hide in their house so he starts to attend the high school where he befriends the local nerd falls in love with the star quarterback's exgirlfriend and of course fights with the star quarterback and the other jocks meanwhile he starts to gain his abilities and strengths. All the while this is happening the bad aliens are closing in on them as well as a mysterious blonde girl. This all occurs over about an hour and fifteen minutes which really is a shame because the last 30 minutes when the bad aliens and Four fight is extremely fun and entertaining. It's one of the better action scenes I've seen in a while the big problem being it takes way too long for it to reach the screen.There are many problems with the story but mainly they just leave way too many questions unanswered and this is mainly because the whole film is set up for a franchise with multiple films. This is also what happens when you adapt a novel into a film there's always going to be aspects left out but you have to choose what's essential to the story and not and the writers chose the wrong things. The cast really isn't anything to talk about they just look good on screen but are essentially television actors but it's not totally their fault they're working with that caliber of a script.Some of the good things about the film come mainly from D.J. Caruso. He knows what he's doing when it comes to teenage action movies. This isn't as good as Disturbia whose success is mainly due to Shia LaBeouf but he does what he can with the script and the action scenes are where he shines and pulls you out of the coma you've fallen in to. It was also kind of cool to see an actionscience fiction film based around the high school scenario even though they missed the mark where others have succeeded like The Faculty. Lastly the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic bald covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth carry some pretty cool weapons and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.Overall its not worth the 8 or more you'll have to spend to see it. If you want to sneak in for the last 30 minutes I would highly recommend that or just wait until BluRayDVD. If you've seen the show Smallville and Jumper it's essentially those 2 put together with a sprinkle of the Twilight movies. Caruso does his best with some very cool and entertaining action scenes but the script is just too bare and full of holes for him to save it. The same goes with the cast even if they were all very talented actors I'm still not sure it would be a worthwhile movie. With all that being said I would probably go see the sequels because of the last action scene and just to see if some of my questions are answered or just save some money and read the books...".

It should be a good movie about aliens hunting down other aliens on earthly settings. Well its not a good movie AT ALL. Oh boy is this one baaad.... this made me really angry... First of all the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression the I am messed uplook the I am angrylook and don't forget the awww I am totally like a cute puppy are you girls feeling hawt already?look and that's about it. Not just the actor but the character is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor a teen from another planet who is superduper strong and one of the last of his kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he have a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the same race which destroyed his home is out to kill him does he listen to his mentor's advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining that he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of outerspace assassins are out to kill you and they already killed almost every single one of your race don't you have more pressing matters than go to school and try to be the kool jetsky flipping kid?.... For example like... I don't know...Planning to escape the situation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on that's not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the UFO go to high school and jetsky because he is so hawt......So he shall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirlservice. Go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this but this is PATHETIC. Oh and if you want to make another crappy nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy its okay fine by me BUT don't LIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an action packed scifi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen to god awful dialoge about oddgirls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with oddgirls parents having little family dinners with UFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these hollyjolly pink teenage love stories please don't try to force them down on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens good and bad alike were or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue I heard in years or how stupid it is that after UFO boys little lightshow on the beach or in the classroom nobody really cared. In reality after a show like that on a beach at night during a party well it would draw much more attention and it would be in the news for days... But why talk about these things this movie flat out lied about its intentions and it is sad and pathetic.".

	schema:reviewBody "The team of Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson made two of the strongest movies of the 1970s 'Five Easy Pieces' and 'The King Of Marvin Gardens'. It would be unrealistic to hope that 'Blood And Wine' would be as memorable as those two and of course it isn't. But it is an excellent piece of modern film noir one of the most underrated Hollywood movies of recent years and the best thing Rafelson has made since the early 1980s. Nicholson is perfectly cast as a dissatisfied and greedy wine merchant who hatches a plot to steal a client's valuable necklace.

	onyx:emotionText "The team of Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson made two of the strongest movies of the 1970s 'Five Easy Pieces' and 'The King Of Marvin Gardens'. It would be unrealistic to hope that 'Blood And Wine' would be as memorable as those two and of course it isn't. But it is an excellent piece of modern film noir one of the most underrated Hollywood movies of recent years and the best thing Rafelson has made since the early 1980s. Nicholson is perfectly cast as a dissatisfied and greedy wine merchant who hatches a plot to steal a client's valuable necklace. He is assisted by a slimy British crook a superb turn from Michael Caine in his best acting role in years and his sexy young girlfriend Jennifer Lopez who is surprisingly good. Things get very complicated very quickly when their plan goes belly up and Nicholson's estranged wife Judy Davis and his stepson Steven Dorff get into the picture.

Lopez and Dorff display their greed gradually and their characters develop during the film to be as unpleasant as Nicholson. All the main performances are strong and the monstrous sides of their nature are easily believable. Any redemptions are tarnished with lingering greed greed turns to suspicion turns to deception turns to murder. Human nature is an ugly thing and this element of it is played out at every level here.As a crime thriller it doesn't work as well as it could have  it is often treated as a plot driver rather than the plot itself.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why I haven't seen Blood and Wine from start to finish up until today but it has always been intriguing as that one Jack Nicholson movie I would see in bits and pieces on TV with JLo in an early supporting role as the notquite femme fatale and Michael Caine as a guy with a very bad cough. Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson director and Nicholson did back in the 70s even if they already reached their peak on their first film Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most either as actor or writer he cowrote Head especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB which of course is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character Alex is a criminal but not a very good one as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife Judy Davis has a son from a previous marriage Stephen Dorff who has it in for Alex bigtime. Meanwhile that jewel necklace is almost up in the air and all his craggy partner Vic Michael Caine can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional.So in these ingredients Rafelson and his writers have a classic cookedup noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties probably too sexy too what with Lopez's 'assets'. Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast and assembled is the best cast for the job where desperation greed proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is well Nicholson cold to the bone but also a great liar violent passionate but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze almost in the tradition of Bogart he actually does just as good if not better here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake. Dorff meanwhile could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against type which doesn't really exist for him and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the noir mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either.Released as they say under the radar back in 96 Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his Agame on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead the wills of men tested headtohead but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.".

Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife Judy Davis and his stepson Steven Dorff and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend Jennifer Lopez. In New York he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine.At the last moment Nicholson has an argument with his wife she clobbers him with a poker frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase although neither she nor Dorff knows it.They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments fights a car chase until Davis and Caine wind up dead Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law.It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during and immediately after the car chase.So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a meanspirited movie. Every character seems greedy spiteful and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson  you. The illconsidered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like like Caine and Nicholson in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands. But realistically as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope.I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's Key Largo was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally the MacGuffin  that milliondollar necklace  bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan.Well I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.".

It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.";

The element of suspense is well maintained but what really works for 'Blood and Wine' is the unusual cast. Jack Nicholson is not very different from his other films but it suits Alex Gates. Michael Caine is a knockout as the murderer with a bad cold. He's quite the scenestealer. Judy Davis is first rate. Stephen Dorff plays holds his own. Jennifer Lopez is stunning. What is most striking is her natural beauty combined with a natural performance. She more than holds her own and brings a certain humanness and courage to an otherwise fragile Gabriella. Overall Rafelson's is an intriguing little thriller with a fantastic cast.".

In all fairness I think Jennifer Lopez is a good actress but it just doesn't show in this movie in which she plays a character with a thick Cuban accent who is supposed to be the love interest of the movie of the two main characters. Stephen Dorff feels out of place since he's only ever real good and convincing as an actor when he plays a villain which is mostly due to his looks.

First of all the love triangle turns out to be unsatisfying because nothing really comes of the triangle so why bother. The crime itself is given no more than a few minutes and produces little drama. The promised double and triplecross and changeable loyalties that ensue after the theft in fighting over the booty play out like an episode of Nash Bridges. Now that I think about it this whole movie reminds me of an episode of some similar TV crime drama and could be played out easily in an hour or less with better writing and be much more entertaining.".

The good guys seem appealing only by virtue of committing the least disgusting wrongdoings. The characters' motivation is not to become better but not to become worse than they already are and redemption is nowhere in sight. One depressing bleak piece of a movie with little  if any  value. Nicholson presents a disappointing lack of class Lopez puts off by her strong Cuban accent and only Michael Caine seems to tower above the rest of the cast in a role which is nevertheless a bad waste of his talents. In short avoid if you can. And for a really good caper flick  go see The Thomas Crown Affair any of the two versions although I recommend the newer one. 410".

Danny Jet Li is a physically powerful but emotionally stunted man never given any sort of proper education Danny has learned little in his lifetime but how to fight and his minder Bart Bob Hoskins treats him more like a guard dog than anything else using him in illegal noholdsbarred brawls that earn Bart plenty of money but only reinforce Danny's violent alienation. When Bart is injured in an auto accident Danny is left to fend for himself and stumbles upon Sam Morgan Freeman an elderly piano tuner who has lost his sight. Sam is the first person to treat Danny with kindness and the music he plays soothes the troubled soul of the fighter. However Danny's fighting skills soon come in handy when Sam runs afoul of a pack of smalltime crooks who believe he knows too much about their operations.";

His ability to push the buttons on the most violent screen business while gradually developing a tale of warm sentiment is well served by director Louis Leterrier and a perfect cast of actors. UNLEASHED is one of the few examples of how martial arts and bona fide drama can be mutually supportive in creating a film that is at once thrillingly athletic and gently tender.Bart Bob Hoskins is a brutish loan shark thug who makes his 'collections' accompanied by his 'dog' Danny Jet Li a silent man Bart has raised form childhood to be a caged killer a human with a dog collar that when removed unleashes a ferocious beast who kills on command of his master Bart. Bart keeps him in a cage feeds him and uses him solely for his criminal doings. Danny unleashed is simply a Pavlovian animal and when the collar is replaced he becomes docile with the sad eyes of a puppy.During a 'collection' gone bad Danny escapes and finds shelter in an antique shop basement where he meets blind piano tuner Sam Morgan Freeman a gentle man who gradually introduces Danny to music trains him as his assistant and introduces him to his 'family'  his step daughter Victoria Kerry Condon. With the two of these welcoming tender people Danny discovers how beautiful life can be. The story from this point is how Danny chooses between his Pavlovian response life as a killer and the simple life of Sam and Victoria. The journey is not without stressors and it is a difficult transition that keeps the viewer on seat's edge.The wonder of this film lies in the extraordinary performances not usually associated with martial arts films. Jet Li does some of his finest athletic fighting on film but thankfully at the same time creates a character who is multidimensional and memorable  a very fine acting job by Li. Bob Hoskins is brilliant as the despicably cruel Bart Morgan Freeman adds a luster to his fine portrayal of blind Sam and Kerry Condon makes Victoria zany and lovable at the same time. The action is superbly captured by cinematographer Pierre Morel with the aura of darkness in Danny's caged life serving as a perfect foil to the martial arts sequences.In short this is a fine little film about characters worth knowing and provides audiences with both action and drama of a very high level of achievement.

So far Jet Li has not acted he has merely been that kung fu guy another Bruce Lee.But here we see him act not for just five minutes when there is a break in the fighting but for the entire film. At times there is over half an hour between any kind of fighting and it is very much appreciated. We really see a different side of Jet Li this is not 'you killed my master I have come to avenge him'. But a new modern martial arts film where we have a plot we can believe in.Bob Hoskins takes a nice dramatic turn here 'that man sure can talk' as Danny's 'owner' and it's a gangster role that suits him well. His angry growl is both fearsome and less put on but unleashed.But don't get me wrong here this is still a martial arts film. You'll find yourself cringing and laughing from fright at the fight scenes. Jet Li is not a sleek showy performer here but real fighter intense and scary in his brutality. But equally brutal is the realisation of human freedom and human nature in some ways were all somebody's dog.Danny the Dog is clearly Jet Li's best work and hopefully marks a new direction for him one I am very much looking forward to seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has happened finally. Jet Li has made a foreign movie that would be a non Chinese movie that is actually good. For the most part Jet Li's career in American and European movies have been brainless action movies. In these movies Jet has not had to act and would appear to the untrained eye as not being able to act. This of course is not true especially if you have seen any of his Chinese movies  Once Upon a Time in China series and Fong Sai Yuk series as an example. This movie actually lets him flex his acting muscle.The story revolves around a Glasgow loan shark Bart played despicably well by Bob Hoskins who enforces his territory with the use of a man on a leash a.k.a. Danny Jet Li. When the leash is taken off and the command given Danny springs into a violent rage. With the collar on Danny is quite docile and childlike. As the story progresses we discover that Danny has been trained to behave like this since he was a child. He eats from a can and sleeps in a cage. When Bart rubs a payee the wrong way the payee feels the need to rub Bart out namely with a dump truck and some automatic rifles. Danny gets away and stumbles onto a blind piano tuner Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter Kerry Condon who take him in and show him a different lifestyle.The conflict in this movie arises from the contact between Danny's two divergent lifestyles especially since Bart doesn't die in the hit. First and foremost if one comes to see this movie with a preconceived notion of Jet Li especially from his nonChinese movies you will be disappointed. This is not an action movie. This is a drama. This is not to say there isn't action in the movie but it is not the main attraction.There is action in this movie but it doesn't dominate the drama. It is used effectively to convey the chaos and inhumanity that Danny goes through. The action is quite good and OngBakish. One can't help but go ouch when a kick or punch or sledgehammer connects.Jet Li is the main attraction of this movie. In studying for this role Jet Li trained with an acting coach and seemed to do quite a lot of method acting. On set he would sit alone and eat his food and would isolate himself from people. He also studied the behavior of dogs. Morgan Freeman plays the wiselyfatherfigure. Kerry Condon does a good job of playing the cute innocent  potential love interest. Bob Hoskins does a great job of doing a cockney ruthless thug. Jet's performance along with that of his supporting cast make this the best of the Jet Li's foreign nonChinese movies. I highly recommend it.Celluloid Rehab".

With such great actors like Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins and Jet li's acting has much improved as well. This movie combines some of my favorite genres from Kungfu to drama to action and perhaps even gore this movie is rather violent. I think it was done so as to convey the kind of violence that Danny inherited due to his evil master's exampleways. I think the story is perfectly believable and it just keeps getting better there isn't a dull moment from the jaw dropping fight scenes some of jet li's best I think since Fist of Legend and Once upon a time in china. To the growing relationships between danny and sam to character and plot development. With a superb soundtrack done by a great electronic band Massive Attack. And beautiful cinematography. I have nothing more to say except it's the best movie I've seen all year I suggest you go see it and enjoy it as much as I did!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of If I'm always skeptical of Jet Li's Englishspeaking films it's for good reason. They're usually crap. Too often he's either been put in the hands of incompetent directors who couldn't properly film or edit his impressive martial arts abilities andor he's teamed alongside a cast that includes one rapper too many. It also didn't help that these movies were poorly written and acted failing to work as either a showcase for Li's moves or his charisma. So it's all the more satisfying that Unleashed goes through its entire running time without succumbing to any single one of these flaws. Jet Li stars as Danny a fully grown man with the mind of a child who is a literal slavepet to Bart Bob Hoskins a Glasgow mob boss who keeps Danny in a cage and uses him as a form of persusasion to those who owe him money. Like a dog Danny wears a collar shy and seemingly dumb whenever it's clasped around his neck but a ferocious killer once he's unleashed.After a mishap with another criminal Bart and Danny are left for dead leaving an injured Danny to crawl to a warehouse where he's taken under the wing of kindly blind piano tuner Sam Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter Victoria Kerry Condon. Starting over with a clean slate Danny comes to enjoy his new life and loving family no longer is violence or cruelty something he must face everyday. But fate hands him an unlucky turn when he's forced to confront Bart finding no choice but to give in to his violent side one last time.The film's premise that of a violent man finding a better life is nothing new but rarely have I seen the simple but effective premise delivered so well and with such genuine heart. To my immense surprise it's Jet Li's performance that anchors the film showing us a side of corrupted innocence and childlike enthusiasm that is sweet moving and occasionally even quite humorous. The transformation and natural maturity Danny undergoes is engaging and it's to no small measure of Li's performance that we hope Danny can entirely shed his former life even when we know it'll inevitably catch up with him.Li is surrounded by a fantastic cast with great actors Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins pulling their own weight. Freeman delivers as always playing the kindly authority figure with firm but gentle resolve. Hoskins is overthetop but suitably so as Bart whom we're quite sure is complete scum yet one can't dismiss the fact that he holds Danny in a certain esteem and that he may actually be the only person in the world Bart cares for however twisted a manner he chooses to show it. Relative newcomer Kerry Condon is cute and appealing although she could just as easily have won me over with that great smile of hers.As a kickass action film Unleashed is superb. The ratio of action to story might be a bit less than hardcore martial arts fans desire but there's no question every facet of the plot bolsters the fight scenes giving every battle a palpable and underlying current of emotion that adds to the thrills of the spectacle. And spectacular action this is every fight scenemost especially the brutal opening sequence and the thrilling almost emotionally exhausting climaxis brilliantly filmed and edited wisely emphasizing Li's natural abilities in favor of quickcuts and wirework. There are a few instances of Matrixstyle slow motion but the spare usage works to the film's advantage. There's even a terrific fight scene inside a tiny bathroom that far outdoes a similar scene in The Matrix.An absolute winner on almost every conceivable level the exception being that the title should be changed back to Danny the Dog but I'm not going to hold that against the movie Unleashed delivers some of the best action scenes I've seen to go handinhand with memorable characters I adored and a story that riveted me from start to finish. I should also not slight director Louis Leterrier who puts it all together with the right mix of strong style and natural storytelling. Why can't all action films be this good?".

	schema:reviewBody "But I mean that in a very good Way. Well first off all of you going into this Movie expecting a Martial arts festival I have to disappoint you. This Movie focuses More on the dramatic Storyline then rather on spectacular Fights. Nonetheless very impressive Fights are in the Movie it is the Storyline between Danny Li Bart Hoskins Sam Freeman and Victoria Condon that keeps you in the Movie. This Movie is mainly a DramaMartial Arts Movie and no CrimeActionThriller like IMDb shows you. Honestly I haven't seen much Hosking's movies in the past but believe me the main Reasons that keep you into the Movie are very fine Performances from Jet Li and Bob Hoskins. Both of em are wonderful. Another plus to this Movie are the Sound effects. They are realistic as Hell. In most of the Fight Movies you hear some weird sounds coming when they hit one another well this one were so brutally real that I thought wow they are killing each other out there. The Fights are few but very spectacular and somewhat brutal. The first two Fights are excellent because they are shot very realistic and with a fast paced camera the last Fights are more graphical and slowly filmed. But as I watched the first two Fights I was impressed how everybody involved in the Fight Sequences did such a wonderful Job on letting them look brutal and realistic. Every time Li hits somebody I sat there feeling the brutalized Hits which let's you get the feeling that you're in the Fights Not Literally but it lets you feel the Hits. Louis Leterrier did a very good Job filming this Movie. The Fight Scenes are not too quick so that you can see everything and the Dramatic Scenes are shot with the right Amount of Heart to keep the Spectator engaged in the Movie. But be Aware after the first two Fights is a great Hole which is filled with 4050 Mins of Storyline which didn't bother me but I can imagine that People will go into this Movie expecting something like Romeo must die Twin Warriors or Fist of Legend they will be heavily disappointed because this Movie focuses more on it's engaging Storyline. So please enter the Theater with this in Mind and you will LOVE this Movie. One Thing actually bothers me that is the American way of promoting the Movie. As always they will promote the Movie as one of Li's new Martial Arts Festival with nonstop ass kicking from Li but Please always keep in Mind Li is more acting than fighting in this Movie!! It is a Drama with Martial Arts Elements in it. Don't be fooled by American Distributors!!!!!!!!".

Although Danny was brought up as a dog he is human and through the intervention of music and the care and love of a blind piano tuner Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter Kerry Condon Danny discovers another side of life.Unleashed is not an action movie. There certainly are some spectacular fight scenes but the emphasis is put on the relationship between Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter and Jet Li and on the development of Danny's humanity. Danny yearns for more than just killing he discovers music and is saved by it. Music also plays a key role in his selfdiscovery as it awakens longlost memories of his childhood.For the first time the audience are treated to Jet Li's true acting capabilities. Jet Li seems genuine and earnestperhaps this is because the actor openly acknowledges that this film is close to his heart as a Buddhist Jet Li is against violence and this film portrays the fight between humanity and violence.This drama is a surprising break from usual martial arts movies. The fact that the number of action scenes is limited is counterbalanced by Yuen Wo Ping's masterful choreography do not expect a fightfest. Do however expect an unpretentious touching story featuring good actors with a few spectacular action scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unleashed formerly titled Danny the Dog the new action flick that was written by Luc Besson La Femme Nikita The Professional and directed by Louis Leterrier aims to be the starmaking vehicle its star Jet Li has been looking for and in many ways it could be right on target.I left the theater after seeing Unleashed with a cloud of good feeling looming over me. I've been eagerly waiting to see this movie for quite some time as lately I have watched a number of Li's past films Asian and American and have come to realize that since being in the United States his film career has been quite uneven but things may be set straight with this new action film.Ever since making his American debut as the main villain in Lethal Weapon 4 1998 and then receiving his first Englishspeaking leading role alongside late singeractress Aaliyah in Romeo Must Die 2000 Li has quickly become the screen's most electric and sensational martial arts star. In a few closed quarters some even dub him as being the new Bruce Lee but that's a wholly different matter. His American projects have been wildly unfocused and undisciplined being that his best effort in the United States so far is 2001's Kiss of the Dragon which is where Li first teamed with Besson and their partnership was on that film's screenplay.As I sat in the darkened theater I closely observed other people's reactions to the events unfolding on screen which were for the most part quite positive. Not only does this film serve the purpose of rocketing Li into American stardom but it's also a showcase for his acting talents. He CAN act you know. And it was this element that I focused on in the film aside from the brutal fight sequences.In Unleashed Li plays Danny the human pitbull for Bart Bob Hoskins a particularly cold and ruthless debt collector operating in a rundown section of Glasgow. Danny does not have what we would call a normal human life being that when he's not with Bart collecting debts he spends his days living in a cage underneath Bart's office reading children's books eating cold canned spaghetti and wondering why he even exists.Danny is also Bart's 1 enforcer his only restraint being a metal collar that he wears around his neck as a symbol of the mental prison he's confined to. If a client wishes to pay Bart the collar stays on if the client doesn't wish to pay the collar comes off and Danny is unleashed attacking any and all with the primal ferocity of any caged animal which many times leaves a room and its occupants in shambles and eagerly willing to pay up to Bart.When Bart is attacked by a group of unnamed thugs and presumed killed in the fray Danny is left to fend for himself. Lacking normal survival skills he eventually finds room and board with a kind and blind pianotuner named Sam Morgan Freeman and his musicallytalented and young stepdaughter Victoria Kerry Condon.Danny is at first afraid of his new surroundings but given enough time and patience he eventually warms up to his family. He finds solace in piano music and Victoria shows him the side of his personality that was uncorrupted by Bart's greed. But soon enough Bart comes around looking for his pet but by then Danny has grown quite attached to his new family which he's not leaving without a fight.Hollywood loves formula that's a fact. But Hollywood has not seen an action movie quite like Unleashed in a long time especially an action movie with such a masterful blend of good performances action drama and lighthearted humor. Three brutal fights occur within the first 20 minutes but then we move into lighter territory for a good chunk of the film which is where Danny begins to open up and understand that there's more to life than just fighting. But we must remember that first and foremost this is an action movie.Jet Li puts on a performance that exercises a level of restraint and passiveness that's been noticeably lacking in his past American roles. He's first presented as a mute possibly handicapped mentally and unable to function outside a life of violence. But there is a human soul trapped underneath that seemingly calm facade rugged face and raggedy clothing.The supporting roles are excellent with Morgan Freeman doing what he does best as the blind man Sam and Kerry Condon is excellent as well with both performers able to provide a welcome counter to the film's brutal and bleak premise. Bob Hoskins is perfectly vile and sadistic as the brutal hoodlum Bart who thinks that he may have this dog under wraps but by film's end is proved dead wrong in his arrogant assumptions about Danny.Lastly the fights in this movie are spectacular if incredibly brutal and realistic. There's wirework here and there courtesy of Yuen Woo Ping but like Li's past films such as Fist of Legend 1994 it's not that easily noticeable and some may be disappointed that the RZAMassive Attackproduced soundtrack doesn't blast away in the background of most of the film's action scenes.Unleashed is the best film of Jet Li's that I've seen yet  of any past movie he's done. This will surely get him the credit he solely deserves since he has been in America and I hope that he gets it.1010".

I like them all from Seven Samurai to your comedic Jackie Chan movie. When I left this movie I was even more excited. Not only were the fight scenes unbelievably intense and well coordinated but the acting was quite good. Of course Morgan Freeman was great as in every movie. But the nod has to go to Jet Li for his performance as Danny the Dog. I knew he could fight but this movie elevated him to an actor in my book and not just a martial artist. His transformation from an animal to human was acted with a certain finesse that you expect from a good movie. The characters were well written and well acted all around. The bad guys were creepy Jet Li was believable and they had Morgan Freeman to lead the movie in to excellence. My vote see it and watch it more than once to see all the aspects of the movie.".

I like them all from Seven Samurai to your comedic Jackie Chan movie. When I left this movie I was even more excited. Not only were the fight scenes unbelievably intense and well coordinated but the acting was quite good. Of course Morgan Freeman was great as in every movie. But the nod has to go to Jet Li for his performance as Danny the Dog. I knew he could fight but this movie elevated him to an actor in my book and not just a martial artist. His transformation from an animal to human was acted with a certain finesse that you expect from a good movie. The characters were well written and well acted all around. The bad guys were creepy Jet Li was believable and they had Morgan Freeman to lead the movie in to excellence. My vote see it and watch it more than once to see all the aspects of the movie.";

Danny the Dog is a dramatic story with an excellent construction of a character from a brutal animal to a kind human being. Jet Li has certainly his best performance in the role of Danny who will certainly shake the emotions of the viewer and make him or her think about how many people including children are badly treated around the world and what society can expect from them. The optimistic conclusion gives us hope that some day this situation may be fixed with love dignity and care. Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic as usual and the unknown Kerry Condon is lovely playing the sweet Victoria.

	schema:reviewBody "I won't say the first two minutes of the movie are worth the price of admission but it is pretty close. This is the second movie to be released this year with amazing martial arts sequences that make people squirm in their seats from the shear brutality the other being Ong Bak. This isn't the super pretty martial arts that proves that Jet Li deserved winning China's national championship over and over. No this is the brutal hard hitting anything goes sort of fighting. Also unlike most action movies that have come out recently you can actually see the action. Yes there are dozens of cuts per fight scene but you actually see a full sequence of moves and get to see most of the actors in most shots.The opening scene features Danny Jet Li being unleashed on a room full of thugs. He proceeds to use fists elbows knees even his head to inflict broken arms legs and at least a few ribs. The truly remarkable thing is how fast and visceral the action is. Also unlike his past couple of movies Unleashed does not rely strongly on wire work. Yes there are scenes with wire work but they are relatively subtle and the exception not the rule.Between the opening few fight scenes and the finale fight scene Danny temporarily gets away from his Uncle Bart Ben Hoskins and winds up with Sam Morgan Freeman and his stepdaughter Kerry Condon. The early scenes with Sam are Danny are very good with Sam providing an open kindness and Danny the cautious childlike hope. While it isn't as over the top sappy as I had feared going into the movie the music saves his life aspect is a bit corny. Especially how quickly both in screen time and in elapsed time the recovery is made. But that is one thing about action movies and martial arts movies in particular they are supposed to have that bit of slightly corny plot between action sequences. And this is much better than most which is inevitable with the superb cast.All told I gave this movie a 910. As far as movies all time go it might not rate that highly but in terms of actionmartial arts movies this is one of the best I have seen in a long time and has some of the best action between the action sequences.".

Film producer and screenwriter Luc Besson have struck platinum once again.This film is about a man named Danny who is raised from a childhood by a ruthless kingpin to become an unstoppable killing machine. Ending up in a coma after a car accident in a set up he met a blinded piano tuner who befriends Danny and start a new life. After a change of heart and picking up the pieces of the murdering of her mother Danny set out to fight back and vows revenge on the crime lord once and for all.I've seen many action pictures that Jet Li made but this film is a different approach as he blends action with the human drama. I thought this was Li's best performance in the history of motion pictures. Even Oscar winner Morgan Freeman did an excellent job and the way he acts and teaches Danny Li about the important things about life. And finally Who Framed Roger Rabbit? actor and Oscar nominee Bob Hoskins did a hell of a job portraying the bad guy and man he's one evil son of a gun.Whether you buy the Rrated or the unrated Director's Cut version of the film you're gonna have a great time watching Unleashed and enjoy it over and over again. So for my final grade... I give it an A for this picture!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to call this film A thinking man's action film.There's a common theme you might find when you see the reviews for this film. Those who liked it liked it for the visualsthe drama and most of all the intense acting of the lead actors. Those who disliked it disliked it for the slower pace less emphasis on action and violence and the attempt to raise itself above the basic street level mentality of an action film. Well it's not a typical action film. There is most definitely a plot and thought involved with this film.I'll touch on some of the aspects of the film I thought had the most artistic merit. The visual presentation of the film from lighting to art direction were quite good. It has a bleached out almost sepia toned look to the whole experience making the setting of Glasgow look and feel gritty. The music ranges the gamut from Industrial to the Classical compositions of Mozart and they all contribute greatly to the feel and tone of the story. Mozart's music in fact has a very important part to play in the course of the twists and turns of the film.I knew I could expect good things from Luc Besson as he has a record of artistic vision that expands many different genres from Leon  La Femme Nikita to The Big Blue and The Messenger. Louis Leterrier who directed the oftoverlooked The Transporter was also allowed to shine most wonderfully with his directorial style for this film. No clichd inspirational montages. No wobbly and jerky cameracuts. Each scene each angle is beautiful in either the most violently terrible way or the most poignant and sentimental way.While many of JetLi's recent American endeavors have been commercially successful it's been a rocky road for him to get American studio produced roles that treat him as more than a mindless martial arts cashcow. He really does portray the haunted and broken spirit of a man beaten into a dog and he is able to overcome any questions about his age as he draws the audience in with a very innocent and childlike wistfulness at the world of humanity denied to him. I am glad this film allowed him the chance to try something with a little more meat on the bones rather than say The One. Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman are fine actors whose judgement in signing onto this film was wise and I think may pay off in some additional recognition from those actionfilm goers who might not normally get to witness the breadth of their acting skills.Of course the visual spectacle of martial arts is wonderful to behold as there is thankfully a pull away from exaggerated wirework and we get to see JetLi shine with Yuen Wooping's beautiful martialarts choreography. JetLi has an almost animalistic ferocity in his fight scenes and it's really visible to the audience that this is not a man we see fighting but a beast caged within a man.Overall I suggest that those who are tired of much of the repetitive clichs and WWF style 90 minute miniaction films from Hollywood give this particular film a try. It's more than satisfying on all fronts as a movie with story acting visuals and some philosophical questions about the human condition.".

He bar far is the next Bruce lee for the new millennium. with his insane momentum and demand for attention on the screen he is the man to watch right now. far surpassing the slap stick antics of Jackie Chan and taking his own acting career to a whole new level unleashed finally answers the question... can jet Li act? the answer is yes! not having very man lines in the film actually proved to be a strong point for Li. he played a very young and innocent confused man who was severely mistreated by a horribly acted bob hoskins. hoskins was a huge down for the film. his long annoying dialogue bothered me every time he opened his mouth you new some stupid speech was about to spill out. but the action was also jaw dropping. this is probably the most fierce and hardhitting action fights i have seen. the first five minutes alone will redefine American kungfu. the filming and entire layout of the film is very different even the opening credits are weird. but rogue pictures is building a reputation for making different movies. it was another perfect luc besson film. a lot of transporter like action scenes and a very unusual appearance of Morgan freeman in the film make this absolutely worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "Serengeti darf nicht sterben or Serengeti Shall Not Die literal translation or just Serengeti is a West German Germanlanguage documentary from 1959 so this one will have its 60th anniversary soon and the title already gives away that this is for the most part a nature documentary. You could say that the Americans had forgiven Germany at that point already to the extent that they at least were ready to give it an Oscar. And Bernhard Grzimek was the lucky one to accept it. But he was also pretty unlucky as his son Michael that you hear about and see frequently during this film died during shooting which is not referenced in the film. He was only 24 when he lost his life in a plane crash. Tragic stuff. Anyway I think this film here not only because of the color is a trail blazer for nature documentaries in the decades afterward. But there is more to this one here like we see the native citizens and their way of life the Massai and also see the Grzimeks during their work in the wild how they are filming but also how they are helping in securing the survival of certain animals. These parts were the ones that were not too interesting to me especially the Massai but it's not bad or anything just not as memorable as the other stuff you get to watch in here. I need to add that people may actually be unimpressed watching this one and they will say that most other documentaries are not worse not less informative and not less captivating than this one here and they may be right. But that is just becaue these other documentaries are from way later. We have to keep in mind filming conditions technology civilization etc. when judging this movie. Not taking this into account I probably would have given it only  but these other documentaries I just mentioned could never have been made or at least not been made reaching a level of quality like the Grzimeks do here. That's why it is probably the best documentary from its year and also a definite contender for best film of 1959. Disney and maybe Painlev made films of similar quality during that era or earlier but that's really it. By the way one final note There is a German 3 hour film from not too long ago I think with actors about Grzimek and his life career and family starring Ulrich Tukur and I thought it was pretty convincing and insightful and feel free to check that one out as well. Same is true about these 80 minutes here. This one does not need to be any longer to really make a difference. I highly recommend checking it out and it really should not be so difficult to get your hand on a copy as it so much deserves to be watched and is farf more underseen than it should be. Go change that. Watch it.".

I highly recommend checking it out and it really should not be so difficult to get your hand on a copy as it so much deserves to be watched and is farf more underseen than it should be. Go change that. Watch it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The filming of The Quiet Man was the culmination of a dream by John Ford to make an Irish picture in Ireland. He bought the rights to the story over a decade before and peddled it to every studio in Hollywood and was turned down.He went to Republic Pictures partly because John Wayne was just winding down his contract with them and he wouldn't have to pay him extra and partly because Herbert J. Yates's small studio was the last stop. Ford got the permission for The Quiet Man on the condition he do a sure fire moneymaking John Wayne cavalry picture first. So Ford Wayne and Maureen O'Hara did Rio Grande first before setting out for Ireland.In her recent memoirs O'Hara said that this was her role of a lifetime she knew it would be before one frame of film was shot. She'd been playing in a load of ridiculous Hollywood drivel films as a redheaded Bedouin princess and she did them essentially for the money. This one was to be a labor of love.Love yes but a labor nonetheless. John Ford was a talented but strange man to work for. He could be a bully and a tyrant on any set he was on. She was grateful to him for the career making roles she got with him but recognized his faults. She relates in her memoirs that Ford used his influence to knock her out of an Oscar Nomination for Mary Kate Danaher in 1952 over some trivial offense Ford thought O'Hara committed and took umbrage.It was a family affair for Wayne of sorts as well. His kids came to Ireland with him and you can see them at the horse racing scene as extras. Young Patrick Wayne spoke his first movie lines. He also had with him his second wife Esperanza Baur who was not his kid's mom. She was a tempestuous sort and they would soon part in a very ugly divorce.Sean Thornton who was born in Innisfree but went to America as a toddler has come back to his native Ireland after making a name for himself as a prizefighter and killing a man in the ring. He and Maureen O'Hara have an instant attraction for each other. However Wayne does run afoul of her bully of a brother Squire Will Danaher played by Ford regular Victor McLaglen.Wayne and O'Hara marry but McLaglen won't turn over the bride's dowry. And Wayne won't contest him for it.So with a little help from The Taming of the Shrew and a bit of Falstaff thrown in things are put right in Innisfree. More I won't say. As in all of John Ford's films and this is one of the best he got some grand performances from some of the most minute characters in the film. Some of his regulars like Ward Bond Mildred Natwick Ken Curtis Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields with the rest of the roles played by Dublin's acclaimed Abbey Theatre players. One of my favorites is Jack McGowran who played Feeney Squire Danaher's little toady factotum. The music was arranged by Victor Young who did a grand job of using traditional Irish melodies in the score. One song The Isle of Innisfree was recorded by Bing Crosby for Decca and sold a few platters for him the year The Quiet Man came out. The Quiet Man is an annual classic for St. Patrick's Day the same way It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. At least in America it is. I've wondered if it is as well received in Ireland as it is here. I think John Ford the former Sean O'Fearna was hoping it would turn out that way.Mr. Ford you got your wish.".

	schema:headline " Sean Thornton Meet Mary Kate Danaher";
	schema:reviewBody "The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman raised in America going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget.  In The Quiet Man' director John Ford returns to his own roots going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton John Wayne a man troubled by an incident that changed his life and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on.  And toward that end Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother to Innisfree intending to buy the cottage in which he was born White O'Morn where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself.  There's a problem however the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane Mildred Natwick and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher Victor McLaglen who not only fancies the widow herself but wants to buy her land.  Squire Danaher as he's known is not the only one Sean must deal with though as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth.  And her name is Mary Kate Maureen O'Hara who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no it makes no difference to Sean who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.  Sean soon learns that in Ireland however such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn Barry Fitzgerald a kind of matchmakerchaperonemarriage broker who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn which he is determined to have at any cost.John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures going back to the days of silent films and his favorite star with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John FordJohn Wayne collaborations it's the Western that instantly comes to mind  Stagecoach' She Wore A Yellow Ribbon' Fort Apache' Rio Grande' or The Searchers' to name a few.  Yet The Quiet Man' is perhaps their most memorable effort and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford who received an Oscar for Best Director for it presents the story on a very personal level and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so truetolife.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful uplifting film impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.Too often John Wayne's work gets a bad rap no matter what role he takes on you're liable to hear John Wayne is always John Wayne the only difference is the character's name.'  And as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton it's not only a false statement it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's True Grit' was way overdue especially when you consider his performances in such films as The Searchers' Red River' and of course this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not but he is good at what he does much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he and his films can always always be counted on to provide good solid entertainment.  Together he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius. There's real chemistry between them which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 Rio Grande' and 1971 Big Jake' and there is always that spark of magic between them but never better than in this film.A gifted actor Maureen O'Hara is also without question one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty who Mary Kate is down deep it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast O'Hara like Ford returned to her roots to make this film she was born in Milltown Ireland near Dublin and apparently it agreed with her because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher in fact is arguably one of her if not the'  most memorable roles of her career.The supporting cast topped by Fitzgerald who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen also includes Ward Bond Father Lonergan Francis Ford Dan Tobin Arthur Shields Reverend Playfair and Jack MacGowran Feeney.  A delightful and endearing motion picture The Quiet Man' is of all of John Ford's achievements one of his best.  And Sean Mary Kate Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

And her name is Mary Kate Maureen O'Hara who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister.  But Danaher or no it makes no difference to Sean who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.  Sean soon learns that in Ireland however such things are pursued quite differently than in America.  To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn Barry Fitzgerald a kind of matchmakerchaperonemarriage broker who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher without which the marriage cannot and will not take place.  So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures.  In the meantime he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn which he is determined to have at any cost.John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures going back to the days of silent films and his favorite star with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films was John Wayne.  And when you think of the John FordJohn Wayne collaborations it's the Western that instantly comes to mind  Stagecoach' She Wore A Yellow Ribbon' Fort Apache' Rio Grande' or The Searchers' to name a few.  Yet The Quiet Man' is perhaps their most memorable effort and remains a favorite among fans to this day.  Ford who received an Oscar for Best Director for it presents the story on a very personal level and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity.  That plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so truetolife.  Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life.  It's quite simply a wonderful uplifting film impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast.Too often John Wayne's work gets a bad rap no matter what role he takes on you're liable to hear John Wayne is always John Wayne the only difference is the character's name.'  And as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton it's not only a false statement it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many in his craft as well as in his personal life.  The Oscar he finally received for 1969's True Grit' was way overdue especially when you consider his performances in such films as The Searchers' Red River' and of course this one.  Is he the best actor of all time?  Of course not but he is good at what he does much better than he is usually given credit for.  And he and his films can always always be counted on to provide good solid entertainment.  Together he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius. There's real chemistry between them which enables them to play so well off of one another.  They made five films together between 1950 Rio Grande' and 1971 Big Jake' and there is always that spark of magic between them but never better than in this film.A gifted actor Maureen O'Hara is also without question one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen.  It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree.  It's entirely believable.  And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty who Mary Kate is down deep it's even more understandable.  Perfectly cast O'Hara like Ford returned to her roots to make this film she was born in Milltown Ireland near Dublin and apparently it agreed with her because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired.  Mary Kate Danaher in fact is arguably one of her if not the'  most memorable roles of her career.The supporting cast topped by Fitzgerald who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen also includes Ward Bond Father Lonergan Francis Ford Dan Tobin Arthur Shields Reverend Playfair and Jack MacGowran Feeney.  A delightful and endearing motion picture The Quiet Man' is of all of John Ford's achievements one of his best.  And Sean Mary Kate Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:headline " A Woman's Film Aye But I Like It Too";
	schema:reviewBody "Maureen O'Hara in Technicolor is surely any Irishman's dream and The Quiet Man would be timeless for that alone. But O'Hara's performance is all the more indelible for the great good humor she bestows on her character Mary Kate Danaher. Let's face it with any other actress this could have been a disaster.Sean Thornton John Wayne comes back to County Mayo his birthplace to find a peace he lost tragically back home in America. He immediately discovers some old friends and a new one too Mary Kate who while herding sheep stares back at him in what James Joyce might have called a significant manner.Director John Ford elects to shoot O'Hara from an odd angle and with an unusual overhead shadow crossing O'Hara's face that in anyone else's hands would have totally blown the shot but here creates something well Homerific. It's one of many amazing shots in a film that seems more painted than photographed and is perhaps the most strikingly lovely film ever made.The shot of O'Hara looking back at Wayne also clues you onto something else that this is going to be her story as much as it is Thornton's. In fact it's really more about her than it is about him a film about romance and a woman's liberation at the hands of her lover. We call them chick flicks today. But since John Wayne is the nominal star and no one ever confused Ford with Douglas Sirk The Quiet Man isn't popularly regarded this way.It's fun to read all the comments about poor Mary Kate and how this film glamorizes the mistreatment of women. They have one thing right it's a film about spousal domination but it's the wife ruling the husband. Think about it She makes her lover do just about everything he does in the film even risk bodily injury at the hands of her brutish brother she doesn't know about his past and thinks she married a coward. People complain that he drags her across a dungcovered field while a helpful woman hands him a stick to beat the lovely lady with. But of course it's Mary Kate who's in total control of the situation. She wants Thornton to fight for her in every sense of the word and won't make it easy. She wants him to adapt to her culture rather than adapt to his. She's not one to be honked at as she puts it. It's not surprising she trips and falls at one point while Thornton pulls her across a field probably one of those puppet strings of hers got in the way.But there are worse things in life than being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara like not being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara. She's not only beautiful and purehearted but such a hilarious joy to be around. O'Hara plays up the comedy of her scenes very well she could have opted for a more regal distance from the slapstick but plays it as rowdy as the rest instead. The scene when she spits in her hand before shaking with matchmaker Michaleen Flynn Barry Fitzgerald who gives the nextbest performance after O'Hara tells you who she is better than any of her many sexy moments on screen. It also gets back to the point of why she's so essential in this film. She is Ireland the spirit of Erin and you want her to win not because she's so pretty but because you know she's good and right for Sean too.About the only things wrong with the film are the action sequences the horse race and the fistfight between Sean and Mary Kate's brother. It's not because the scenes aren't terrific but because they are so abbreviated especially the fistfight which feels likes its building to something even funnier and more rousing than what's come before when it just sort of stops. Ford apparently had to do some cutting to get his film in at the required length and with his focus as much on Mary Kate as possible probably preferred to trim the scenes that had the least to do with her. But since the focus on O'Hara is what makes the film anyway this is a small matter. Wayne fans wanting more action will just have to content themselves with almost every other film the Duke ever made.Seeing this film for the first time reminded me a lot of Local Hero the 1982 comedy. Not only is The Quiet Man also a fishoutofwater story about an American in the British Isles Scotland in Local Hero both films maintain a very delicate balancing act between whimsy and pathos with The Quiet Man siding on the former direction and Local Hero the latter. Definitely worth checking out the one if you saw and liked the other. But Quiet Man was there first.".

The interaction between Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is magical and hard to beat.Other classic performances are turned in by Victor McLaglen Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald.";

Of course Ford's vision is by today's standards a bit outdated. The Ireland of the time in the movie probably doesn't exist any more but only in the minds of those who knew the Emerald Isle back then.The story is a bit passe but we make excuses for seeing it once more whenever it plays on cable as we take the journey to an ideal place that thanks to John Ford will live forever.The best thing in the film is Maureen O'Hara. This actress beauty was legendary. Having met her on a few occasions I can only say that she is as beautiful in person as she is in films. Miss O'Hara graced this movie by only being there. The camera loved her she's perfect as Mary Kate Daneher the spinster as the locals call her.The other big assets of the film are the Irish actors that Ford entrusted key roles. Barry Fitzgerald the impish Michaeleen Flynn was delightful. Victor McLaglen is excellent as Squire Will Danaher. John Wayne as Sean Thornton is a bit stiff but maybe Ford's direction called for this actor to play himself in rural Ireland who knows?This is a film to be treasured.".

The Vicar's wife remarks on its beauty and in a deadpan manner suggests only an American would have thought of Emerald Green. Only an American or a foreigner is the implication would think that the picturebook Ireland they are seeing in this film is a realistic portrayal of a lived experience of the country. An Irish person would have painted the door red she says. It weathers better that way.The film takes ideas of Irishness and exaggerates them to brilliant and comic effect. The drinking Mickaleen the patriarchal rule the idyllic countryside. But beneath the Oirish exterior is a sharp intelligence and a subversion of what the film at first glance seems to suggest.Beneath the idyllic countryside are elemental forces that are waiting to be disturbed as we see in the two scenes where Sean and Marykate kiss. Storm clouds fill the sky and the wind whips about them. The countryside which previously seemed so welcoming is now tempestuous and threatening. Theirs are passions which do not fit in the comic book world which we have previously seen. Yet they exist.The portrayal of women and particularly Sean's treatment of MaryKate when he drags her through the field is not so oppressive as it might seem. Remember that it is her who insists on receiving her dowry who equates her possessions to her worth. It is she who forces Sean to act the way he does and fight Will Danaher. She indoctrinates him into her society by threatening to leave him. She withholds the marital bed. Sean eventually becomes the man she wants him to be.In short this is a portrayal of Irish or more importantly rural life that is very much from the point of view of the outsider. Of the city folk. Yet it always acknowledges that and has great fun playing with its stereotypes. Its funny its romantic it appeals to the part of us that yearns to live a simple life away from the complex world much as we know that life does not exist. Enjoy it!".

Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life.A Quiet Man is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Depois do Vendaval After the Windstorm".

Thornton's helped by an alcoholic old man Barry Fitzgerard who plays the character of the Roman Catholic Michaleen Oge Flynn  the Protestant vicar Cyril 'Snuffy' Playfair Arthur Shields  and the parish priest War Bond  among others .This hightspirited tale is one of Ford's finest movies and his first love story with a marvelous freshair feeling . It's a special adaptation of 'Taming the shrewd' by William Shakespeare set on the west Ireland  dealing with an enjoyable romance  adding strong knuckles as well as punches for spectacular fight between Wayne Ford's favourite leading man against brawling Victor McLagen . Ford returns to Irishness in an evocative and idealized portrait  paintstakingly constructed  about life at a hamlet named Innesfree . Maurice Walsh wrote the story in the 'Saturday Evening Post 1933'  then Ford asked the majors the filmmaking but they refused and the Republic Pictures took the production in low budget . Although made in 1951  it was Republic's first production to be shot outside the United States . The story won the International prize of Venice 1952 and Oscar for the best movie and photography to Winton C Hoch and Archie Stout with glamorous and colorful landscapes . This was the fourth Academy Award for John Ford  though somewhat less deserved Oscar  previously was prized for 'The informer 35' 'Grapes of wrath 1940' 'How green was my valley 41'.The picture has family characters  as John Wayne's sons appear in a sequence surrounding to Mauren O'Hara  the Irish Mauren O'Hara played along with her brother Charles Fitzsimmons as Forbes  Irishmen Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields were brothers in real life  they were both Protestants born in Dubln  Ireland  Shields was the family name and they also appeared together in director John Ford's Long Voyage Home 1940 .

But I will say that I believe that this isn't the misogynist dream that some feminists believe this film to be. The worst thing that Sean Thornton does to Mary Kate is drag her back to her brother to demand the dowry. Remember this comes AFTER she strands him in town and he is forced to walk home. But Thornton is a gentleman that refuses to beat a woman. When he comes back home from his long walk Mary Kate offers him a stick expecting Sean to beat her as punishment for leaving him in town. Instead he throws it in the fire. Later when he is dragging Mary Kate along on the famous good stretch of the legs march Sean meets a villager who gives him a stick to beat the wife with. Even though he is hopping mad Sean throws away the stick. People who watch the entire movie know that Sean loves Mary Kate because of not in spite of her fiery spirit and wants to be her partner not her master.

My claim to fame well it's my dear departed fathers claim is he was in the fight sceneby the corner of the pub which was actually a shop. But first my dear Mother use to tell us I'm the youngest of 6 boys and a sister that when the film crew came to West of Ireland my mother who was lovely young woman had her picture taken with one of her sisters arm in arm with John Wayne she would go on about this and I vaguely remember seeing the small enprint as they were called in them days I think my sister has the photo but what a photo. The main reason for my letter is my Dad Frank would tell us kids about the film etc shot in Cong and say oh yes I was in that filim. But with today's technology we have the DVD and sure enough you can stopstart the film and hold the still picture and yes he's in a couple of shots just peering round the back of someone while Wayne and the wonderful Victor McLaglen were knocking bits out of each other. We lived in GALWAY and my dad use to deliver goods  I think to all over West of Ireland and he was there on the day of this shoot. Years later my wife and I and my Brother John at various occasions visited Cong and walked the ruined Abby and bridge etc but our old Dad well when we first saw the DVD era film and stopped the action and saw my Dad it was such a shock because I am the image of him he was maybe late 20s then and it was just like looking at myself. All in all a great film great locations and a good story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot has already been covered many times and so has most of the cast.One comment sticks in my craw...that The Quiet Man isn't really Irish and that the members of the cast slip in and out of their accents in a careless manner.  Whoa just a moment there folks.First of all this film was directed by John Ford who was born in Ireland. Maureen O'Hara and her two brothers who play secondary roles in The Quiet Man were ALSO born in Ireland.  So were Barry Fitzgerald and his brother Arthur Shields who plays the Episcopal priest against the Catholic priest of Ward Bond who is also Irish.  Who would have the nerve to say that Victor McLaughlen's accent wasn't authentic?  He was born in Ireland and won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Gipo Nolan in The Informera film about the early days of The Troubles that just happened to be directed by John Ford.The extras were chosen from The famed Abbey Players of Dublin and locals from the village of Cohn sp where the film was shot.  The old man with the beard is the brother of the director John Ford himself a STAR in the silent days of film in Ireland.That leaves poor Mildred Natwick with her accent at sixes and sevens.  She was impeccable as The Widow Trahern the woman Big Red Danaher hopes to marry some day when he gets up the nerve to ask her properly.To modern eyes The Quiet Man IS sexist and brutal.  No modern woman outside Ireland would stand for such treatment.  The sad truth is though that a women in Ireland are STILL considered to be the property of the man she marries and of the Catholic Church.  Both expect her to produce many children and have her husband's supper on the table when he gets home. If you don't believe me just watch Daniel Day Lewis filmsMy Left Foot or In The Name of the Father.People who are offended by the social order outlined in The Quiet Man will ALSO be offended by MOST of the films of the 30's 40's and 50's from every corner of the world.For the rest of us The Quiet Man is a feast for the eyes and a tonic for the soul.  It is FUN to watch John Wayne stride across a field dragging his recalcitrant wife along.The windy kiss is gorgeous and the kiss Wayne gives O'Hara AFTER he kicks down the door in great Rhett Butler form is amazing.  When John Wayne kissed a woman she stayed kissed for hours.  When he picks up O'Hara and tosses her on the bed AFTER THAT kiss HER reaction is marvelous!  No woman should miss The Quiet Man for those scenes.And when was the last time you saw anything about Ireland where the Catholic Priest and the Episcopal or Anglican Priests were FRIENDS who could attend parties together and where no one was shooting at each other because of the church they attended?  For that alone The Quiet Man is a marvelous film.  I love it more every time I watch it.".

They are lazy and drunk and barely ever appear in the film. It is their four servants who do all the work and all the rescuing. And they faithfully tell the stories to Alexandre Dumas the pub landlord who likes to write things down. The rest sticks to the main premise of the novel a French queen in distress an English Baron dating her etc. but always with a wink in the eye. This is a slapstick movie a parody and a funny one although not really a clever one. The finale is big fun involving lots of people sneaking up on each other and kicking each other in the butt so you can see that this is not clever or subtle humour at all. Think of the average Bud Spencer  Terence Hill movie and you're quite close to this. I'm not sure whether it has as much appeal to adults as it has for kids...".

I am glad to say that I was completely wrong and that this one more than lives up to its companion.  The action is just as fast and the characters as endearing because as we learn only Porthos could find a new way to disarm himself  and then make it work when it counted!  But comedy aside such as our heroes eating breakfast in the middle of a battle the serious turns that had to be taken in order to stay true to Dumas' novel were very well done also.  Oliver Reed imparts his loathing for Milady DeWinter not only with his words but also with the expression in his gorgeous eyes and when he holds her at gunpoint in order to get the Cardinal's warrant several seconds go by in which you as a viewer actually believe that he will kill her right there in cold blood. In fact Reed is in my opinion truly the star of this picture as his character of Athos attempts to mentor young D'Artangan and prevent him from being hurt.  Michael York is as usual wideeyed and very courageous and Finlay and Chamberlain continue to be terrific fops but it is Reed that carries them through.  Kudos also have to go to Faye Dunaway as Milady  she is truly evil and charming at the same time and you can see how her character manages to be so good at what she does. I encourage everyone to see this movie  especially as a companion to The Three Musketeer  and support those in favor of having an editedtogether three hour version. It is truly a classic.  And side note to my fellow students  if you don't have time to read the book The Three Musketeers rent these two movies and you'll get the gist of what you need to know.".

The two are actually the same film shot simultaneously in fact the cast thought they were making one long movie to the extent that they were paid for one movie  they later sued as well they should have.  In fact one who hasn't seen Lester's Three Musketeers might not understand this movie.  Videos and DVDs should be released only in a doublebox.Most Musketeer movies are travesties loosely based on Dumas.  The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnell is a case in point.  It uses little more than the names of characters and it's woefully inadequate.The scriptwriter in Lester's Musketeers movies was George MacDonald Fraser author of the Flashman series.  And Fraser unlike writers of all other Musketeer movies seems to have read the book.  Some of the wildest things in both movies for instance Buckingham's shrine to Anne of Austria are actually from Dumas.  The script rambunctious and silly as sometimes is is startlingly close to the book.Rumor has it that Lester envisioned Musketeers as a project for the Beatles.  If this is true he's fortunate he lost them.  The cast is uniformly wonderful.  Oliver Reed Richard Chamberlain and Frank Finlay are perfect in their roles Finlay is particularly marvelous as he not a large man is able to portray the huge blustering Porthos.  Michael York is a fun D'artagnan.  Faye Dunaway and Christopher Lee are suitably evil.  Rachel Welch the Pamela Anderson of the late '60s shows a flair for light comedy that was not often utilized most of her other movies highlight her . . . ahem . . . other talents.  Charlton Heston is the anchor at the center of the film as the scheming Richelieu.  He doesn't have much screen time but his presence dominates the movies as well it should.  Lester also has small parts filled with amazing talents including Spike Milligan and Roy Kinnear. Keep your eye on a genuine Frenchman JeanPierre Cassel as the king and much later in Lester's Return of the Musketeers as Cyrano  he's a delight in every scene.Lester's locations are fabulous.  His France looks livedin.  One gets the sense of a long medieval period that has decayed by the time of D'artagnan in the early 1600s and of a struggling monarchy dominated by the Cardinal trying to rebuild it.  Even Cardinal Richelieu who wasn't really evil comes off as threedimensional compare Heston's subtle performance to Tim Curry's bizarre antihistorical onedimensional inquisitor and fool in the 1993 version.Being The Three Four Musketeers there are many swordfights Lester somehow is not a great action director but he somehow manages to make each duel unique and funny.  In The Four Musketeers he's given us a duel on the ice between York and Lee that's very funny.  And the climactic duel in a church is sublime.In 1989 Lester released Return of the Musketeers with the same cast. Fraser's brief script for that movie about 100 minutes gives us the gist of Twenty Years After and is quite amusing and a good coda for the series it's a shame Lester didn't get a chance to do The Man in the Iron Mask with a G. M. Fraser script and the same cast.  The version with Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich will do though it's darker and less loyal to Dumas.On the whole The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers are the best Musketeer movies ever made.  They star men and women who were at the top of their profession at the time.  The scripts are superb and there's not a wasted moment.  Do not accept lesser substitutes.".

Not quite as fun as the first movie but true to the classic story writen by Dumas back in 1850.additional comments are duplicate comments made about the Three MusketeersThis set of films 3 and 4 Musketeers were filmed at the same time and released 8 months apart ranks right up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robin Hood with Erol Flynn as one of the best in its genre actionadventure. As an historian I enjoyed the small touches of historical accuracy in the film. As far as I can tell everything is just about bangon the costumes the settings the weapons the street life and the musketeers themselves and yes I know the story is not true. The two films are quite faithful to the classic book by Alexander Dumas given some small and reasonable changes.The swordplay in the film is the greatest! The initial duel against the Cardinal's men in the Convent is a masterpiece of choreographed combat. The battle that takes place early in the second film is hysterically funny as our heroes try to eat lunch in the middle of a war.The actors and actresses are all wonderful especially Michael York Oliver Reed Faye Dunaway and Charlton Heston. One small weakness in the film is that it does not have the time or interest in describing how Milady de Winter seduces her jailor. I suggest reading the book to get a full understanding of that sequence of events.Be warned prolonged exposure to this film is likely to result in a desire for fencing lessons and historical reenactments.Bottom line A great film.".

The most obvious addition is a voiceover introduction by Porthos Frank Finley who reminisces about the events on screen. The choice of Finley is a wise one as he was the most accessible of the characters in the first film and his blissfully ignorant attitude keeps his opening and closing monologues a 'tongueincheek' joy.Politics and intrigue are the order of the day as Cardinal Richelieu Charlton Heston still sleekly villainous continues his machinations to eliminate French Protestants and his major opponent England's Prime Minister the Duke of Buckingham Simon Ward. A key player in 'the game' is Milady de Winter Faye Dunaway in one of her best roles who agrees to eliminate Buckingham if Richelieu will pardon 'in advance' her plans to murder D'Artagnan and his ladylove Constance Raquel Welch. The note he signs would become a key element of the story.Hoping to protect Constance D'Artagnan sends her to an Abbey then impetuously begins an affair with de Winter not realizing the woman's ultimate goal. Only the discovery of a 'FleurdeLis' tattoo on her arm branding her a 'harlot' saves the boy as it unbalances the woman long enough for him to temporarily subdue her and escape. The news of de Winter's brand exposes Athos' aristocratic past and reason for his alcoholism.Just as Van Heflin's interpretation of Athos during this key scene in the 1948 THREE MUSKETEERS was the film highlight the flashback to a younger cleanshaven and dashing Oliver Reed and his betrayal by Faye Dunaway who would be branded for her crime is a high point in the 1974 production. Milady is a calculating insensitive monster and as the depth of her potential for evil becomes known the darkness that is introduced nearly overcomes the film. With a cunning almost feral she ruthlessly arranges the death of Buckingham then takes care of Constance personally. Finally captured by the four Musketeers her doom while justified is a jarring counterpoint to the earlier adventures of the happygolucky quartet.Yet the four comrades survive and with the possession of Richelieu's note to Milady are not punished for their actions but granted extraordinary rewards by King Louis. Richelieu himself is impressed by D'Artagnan's amazing talent and luck and arranges a promotion for the young Gascon.As the four friends leave the Palace facing far different futures Porthos reflects on the camaraderie of the friends and through flashbacks we are reminded of the glorious adventure we've shared with them.THE THREE and FOUR MUSKETEERS are a crowning achievement in Richard Lester's remarkable career capturing a 'feel' that no other Dumas' adaptation has ever come close to. While the sequel may lack the unrestrained 'joy' of the first film when seen together the overall impact of the saga is unforgettable.They don't come any better than this!".

That would make a movie in itself! brings all the elements of the first film together for a shattering finale. The films play MUCH better back to back so that the interest and emotion carry through from the beginning to the end. Still this is quite effective and a more thorough fleshing out of the second tier of the story than what has ever been shown before even though many elements and even characters have been eliminated. Rising to the forefront this time around is the fiendish dangerous glamorous Dunaway as Milady de Winter. Fans of Mommie Dearest will see the groundwork she laid here when she mistreats her servant girl Kitty. Dressed up to the hilt in satin feathers beads and ruffles she is a towering presence as striking to watch as she is deadly. She displays some truly menacing expressions along with some high comedy. It will be a long time before a viewer will forget Dunaway's scream as she is branded a harlot in flashback. Reed gets to show more range in this half as well and he's excellent. They make for an unusual and intriguing pairing. Some of the stars of the first film get shorter shrift here Chaplin Ward Welch but all are still around and have their moments. Then underused actors from part one Lee Dunaway get their turn here. Welch is actually funnier in this half than in the first with her mishaps after she is held captive. Certain images linger in the memory...Dunaway's encounter with some Indians in England her use of a rosary in the convent Welch's safekeeping of the key to her shackles Lee's final sword duel flashbacks of Reed and Dunaway as a couple and the sequence with the executioner. These are just a few of the many vivid scenes in the film which also include sword fights on the ice and in a burning barn. Though certainly a companion piece to The Three Musketeers this is a magnificent piece of film on its own and was inexplicably ignored at most awards ceremonies.".

There's less of the goofy slapstick here with more focus on a better storyline and more indepth character work. Michael York has gone from a dumb rookie to a slightlylessdumb newcomer to the Musketeers and is all the better for it.The entire cast return for a story that somehow feels fresher and more dangerous with the stakes raised considerably. Plus we don't have to go through all of that longwinded character introduction so we can just get on with the political machinations of the story. The main stars do well in actionoriented roles but it's supporting players like Christopher Lee and Faye Dunaway who really shine as the villains of the piece. The ending in particular is a ruthless surprise but it's not quite over as the cast would reunite for one final time in 1989's RETURN OF THE MUSKETEERS.".

Michael York has gone from a dumb rookie to a slightlylessdumb newcomer to the Musketeers and is all the better for it.The entire cast return for a story that somehow feels fresher and more dangerous with the stakes raised considerably. Plus we don't have to go through all of that longwinded character introduction so we can just get on with the political machinations of the story. The main stars do well in actionoriented roles but it's supporting players like Christopher Lee and Faye Dunaway who really shine as the villains of the piece. The ending in particular is a ruthless surprise but it's not quite over as the cast would reunite for one final time in 1989's RETURN OF THE MUSKETEERS.";

Milady's seduction of Fenton and the ensuing assassination are chilling.  And the whole set piece of the Four at the siege is great comedy well played by all.  The only serious departure from the book is D'Artagnan's duel with Rochefort at the end but it IS a thrilling swordfight so I don't mind.  I had the good fortune to see this film and Three Musketeers on a double bill back in 1976 how many of us are old enough to remember double bills at the movies? when I was 16.  Now I've got to buy the videos and watch them together again.  All for one and one for all!  I wonder where is the nearest fencing instructor?".

A lack of cutaways a new music director whose style is distinctly different from the original score and some uncorrected shots leaves The Four Musketeers falling a notch or two below its older brother.But even so the film is still entertaining. For all of its flaws and checkered history the cinematic qualities that were achieved in this film's predecessor are still found here for the most part. Dramatically the actors are left without a route to create something knew for the characters and the plot plods somewhat from eventfirst to eventfinal. But the actors are able to sell it otherwise.The action scenes are fine but again the epic scenes are truncated leaving the audience only a taste of what might have been. And that's probably how best to describe the impromptu sequel to The Three Muketeers. The action scenes are what they are good in some areas adequate in others.Anchor Bay's DVD for some reason doesn't include the French opening credits but the extras and color corrected and digitally mastered DVD for both musketeer films is a welcome addition to anyone's library.In short the second film is not quite as good as the first film but is still very entertaining and in this way still a very magnificent piece of cinema. Enjoy!p.s. the Anchor Bay edition DVD corrects the washed out copy I saw in the theatre 30 years ago. Thanks Anchor Bay.".

	schema:reviewBody "This continuation of the Musketeers saga from The Three Musketeers73 brings back essentially all the characters tho they never really left as this was filmed at the same time and piles up the intrigue. Plots combine with counter plots as the puppeteer Cardinal Heston sends his two emissaries of evil Milady  Rochefort Lee good casting if ever there was against the heroes who defend the queen's honor. The Milady character Dunaway becomes the central focus of the story she proves to be so dangerous that dashing D'Artagnan York barely escapes her deadly designs on a couple of occasions despite his abilities. The most startling revelation for those unfamiliar with the story involves a backstory for the morose Athos Oliver Reed. Reed lends a pathos to the character of Athos heh.Though this continues Director Lester's penchant for comical timing and nearslapstick action the story itself has a more plotdriven narrative and by necessity more dramatic even tragic elements. This chapter after all concludes the tale in many ways and for some characters it definitely ends on a somber note. There is a poignancy and flair to the proceedings missing from even the first chapter but as entertainment value it's just a smidgen below the introductory previous film. You miss the sheer excitement and thrill of meeting all the characters on the other hand this is in many ways a bonus gift to all the fans of the first film who need not imagine how their favorite characters would continue as in other favorite films which had no sequels. Since this was filmed at the same time the film has none of the apparent weaknesses of the usual sequels.Many years later in '89 most of the cast and the director returned for another sequel Return of the Musketeers. Some of the magic wasn't there but it was interesting to see them all again older and perhaps wiser. That film is not yet available on DVD but was around on VHS and Laserdisc.".

It is a film full of catchy lengthy dialog which is dominated by the very funny character Kai. The film deals with the issue of being cool and how you present yourself towards others. Kai is very observant of this fact constantly judging other peoples actions and commenting on these. Whilst doing this he comes up with new wild theories which are highly entertaining ranging from Baywatch actresses breast implants to golden goal theories.His partner in crime is fed up with his lax attitude to life and the aimless life he leads. He himself though is also never happy with what he is doing always complaining that he's wasting his valuable time doing nothing but never realises that this is his own fault. His attempt of studding law seems pretty vague and halfhearted and remains a grey area throughout the film whether he is ever going to complete it.Spun into these issues of the main characters the film shows their new innovative and highly lucrative business plan of distributing cannabis products through their own pizza delivery service 'Pizzaria Lammbock'. This business of there's goes extremely well allowing them to lead a relaxed and carefree life. In their new found 'paradise' they become careless and too trusting ultimately letting in an undercover cop in their little secret. Turning their environment and that of their friends into a hostile terrain. The two weed mongers don't find out what kind of mess their in until its all too late and the undercover cop comes out of the closet!!! What follows then after is a desperate fight to come clean of their deeds which are now not only drug possession with intent to distribute but also a lot of other things have heaped up on their shoulders. Yet the serious situation the two main characters are in and how they manage to deal with it by no means lowers the entertainment level varying from extreme laughter to suspense and surprise. Whether their encounter with the police leaves them behind bars or just makes them turn over a new leaf or indeed leave them unchanged remains the little incentive to learn German and then find out for yourselves!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that Lammbock is one of the best movies ever about dope. If you don't like dope you will likely think that the dialogues are boring and the film is lame  if you have ever liked cannabis you will laugh loudly about the funny dialogues and the great humor. No I am not saying that you would have to be stoned to see this movie this movie is just one of the very few realistic drugmovies. Well the story isn't realistic but the atmosphere is. I think that is it what makes this movie so great it has managed to catch the atmosphere like it would be in a real smokeinn. In most cannabisrelated movies i.e. saving grace cheechchong  halfbaked  the effects of this drug are pretty unrealistic the users are described as stupid brainamputated mumbojumbobubbling monkeys and many of those have this drugs are badmorality. Not so in Lammbock. The users are normal people some are crashed most aren't and they behave pretty much like real  pot smoking people well not WHAT they do but HOW they do it. The acting is just great! Lammbock is free of morality and thats good  I want to watch comedy to be entertained not to be educated. Well there are some scenes I didn't like either i.e. how they treated the forestworker but that's not the humor of the whole movie and it doesn't spoil the film! This movie gave me back my faith in German comedy!".

If you don't like dope you will likely think that the dialogues are boring and the film is lame  if you have ever liked cannabis you will laugh loudly about the funny dialogues and the great humor. No I am not saying that you would have to be stoned to see this movie this movie is just one of the very few realistic drugmovies. Well the story isn't realistic but the atmosphere is. I think that is it what makes this movie so great it has managed to catch the atmosphere like it would be in a real smokeinn. In most cannabisrelated movies i.e. saving grace cheechchong  halfbaked  the effects of this drug are pretty unrealistic the users are described as stupid brainamputated mumbojumbobubbling monkeys and many of those have this drugs are badmorality. Not so in Lammbock. The users are normal people some are crashed most aren't and they behave pretty much like real  pot smoking people well not WHAT they do but HOW they do it. The acting is just great! Lammbock is free of morality and thats good  I want to watch comedy to be entertained not to be educated. Well there are some scenes I didn't like either i.e. how they treated the forestworker but that's not the humor of the whole movie and it doesn't spoil the film! This movie gave me back my faith in German comedy!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is by far one of the best Independentish ones I have seen in a long time. Very fresh original look at a genre where you would think that they've just about done it all.So there are these two potheads who grow their own weed ...and lots of it  all in all a field of well over 250 square feet well hidden somewhere in the woods. They operate a rundown backalley pizza delivery service which really just serves as a cover for selling their weed to customers. You order a Gourmet pizza and they will put some weed on it wrapped in aluminum foil and carefully hidden under a big sausage slice. Business goes well until they're in for some bad luck... one of their newlyacquainted friends turns out to be an undercover cop and one day while they're at the field they get caught by a forester. From there on it's all just hilarious mayhem.What makes this movie so refreshing are the dialogues for one thing and the storytelling in itself. As can be seen in an interview on the DVD with one of the main actors the idea with the dialogues in the film was to a great extent to improvise rather than clinging to some script wordbyword. Moritz Bleibtreu Kai and Lukas Gregorowicz Stefan are REALLY good at this in their two lead roles they are hilarious together and make it look more like reallife buddy talk. And especially Kai talks a lot of nonsense while under the influence The storytelling with its numerous subplots is very well done. Just a bunch of things that most twentysomethings can relate to in one way or another. Stefan is almost out of law school and is worried that all the dope will keep him from studying hard enough for his finals. And then his exgirlfriend walks back into his life and he really wonders if he should leave his current girlfriend for her. Kai on the other hand has trouble dealing with Stefan's little sister who is coming on to him... and so on.Rent or buy the movie watch it watch it over and over and you will probably never get tired of it!!!I don't know if this movie will ever be available on the AngloSaxon market but if not you'll definitely be missing out.12 out of ".

	schema:headline " Great stonercomedy even though it has some uneven moments";
	schema:reviewBody "Stefan Gregorowicz and Kai Bleibtreu are best buddies who run a rundown little Pizzeria named Lammbock. However rather than Italian delicacies the customers tend to order their homegrown Marihuana which is hidden under a leaf of salami. While Kai is your typical Stoner content to smoke until the end of his life Stefan comes from a more rigid upperclass background and tends to worry about his examinations to become a lawyer and getting caught smoking by his stern father Wepper. Other than that the duo is concerned only with their marijuanaplantation in the woods getting stoned playing videogames getting stoned talking trash partying with their friendsslashcustomers and well getting more stoned. Trouble arrives when. Trouble arrives when their plants are infected with parasites and they seek aid from smoothtalking Achim Weigend who just happens to be a young ambitious undergroundcop.Let me say first of all I'm not the biggest fans of many of the actors in Lammbock. Especially Bleibtreu who for a while was hyped as moviestar and Wotan Wilke Mhring later hyped as protagonists in crime and actionfilms have a rather limited actingrange examples that almost anybody can learn how to function a piano but many will never become mastermusicians. However for their roles in Lammbock they fit like fists in gloves.The movie often has a very witty dialog and incredibly funny scenes that makes it sorta a German mix between Dazed and Confused and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. To mention a few highlights would be Mhrings performance as stoner suffering from Tourette's syndrome making ever second word from his mouth an unintentional obscenity a scene where Gregorowicz is forced to swallow some highly potent hashish and then attend a formal dinner with his father's colleagues or a policeman himself a pothead who lectures future undergroundcops.There are some uneven even unnecessary subplots and plot lines especially those involving Stefans little sister Laura Zielcke her Aidstest a potential liaison with Kai and of course the infamous unintentional incestscene which go nowhere and add nothing to the movie but time. But those moments are few and far between and take nothing from the overall quality. What separates Lammbock from many similarthemed films  say for example the Jay  Silent Bob or Cheech and Chong flicks  is that Lammbock is rarely over the top or some overblown parody and shows the protagonist as people easily can relate to be they friends of this kind of horticulture or not. It's not like in the mentioned Cheech  Chong films where you simply know that the duo will escape while smoking the largest joint since Bob Marleys last birthday party but rather it keeps the viewer rooting for our heroes even fevering along with them especially in the last quarter of the movie.Word of warning though some of the dialogs will make little sense if you're not familiar with the German background in which the topics take place and if you've never been out with your buddies smoking the hooch well you might not get the point in the first place.Other than that I'd call it one of the best if not the best stonercomedies produced in Germany where possession generally carries a hefty fine possibly jail social discrimination etc etc.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Lammbock is a German 90minute movie from almost 15 years ago. The writer and director is Christian Zbert and he is still busy making film in 2015. I have seen some of his other works and must say that I preferred these over Lammbock especially the recent Hin und Weg. But back to this one here. You could probably call it a stoner comedy. It attempts to be more relevant and better in terms of quality than the likes of Axel Stein comedy that was famous back then but it does not succeed. Lead actor Gregorowicz worked with Zbert on several projects and that is probably also why he got cast here. Marie Zielcke who play the biggest female part has not really managed to prove she has good range but is not much more than a beautiful face. Even if she is not as bad as Neldel she is fairly irrelevant today just like Gregorowicz.Bleibtreu however is still among Germany's biggest movie stars. Apart from him you may recognize Wepper Monot and Mhring in here if you have an interest in German cinema. Unfortunately all these talented actors cannot really make the script work. The marijuanapolice struggles are neither funny nor dramatic enough to make this one worth the watch. Same goes for all the relationship issues. The characters in here were as unlikable as uninteresting pretty much all of them. Maybe some people perceive this film as hip or trendy but it really does not offer a lot neither in terms of writing nor in terms of acting. Thumbs down one of Bleibtreu's weakest films. Good thing it does not run longer than 1.5 hours.".

Mainly is a comedy but some of the content is very deep and like the small man in your headdiscussion which starts about the two guys discussing if anyone would suck only soccerstars Mehmet Scholls dick or anyones dick true in a psychological sense. There were two things I did not like the scene where Stefan mistakenly humps his sleeping sister and discovers it only in the morning is just disgusting. Not only that it has nothing to contribute to the story it is just vile and no content worth for joke I think this was their intention. also I did not like the end of the movie so much when Stefan by free will fails his final exam and also leaves the country. It was like a plea for egotistic behavior leaving all behind after his father  who helped him out in a very difficult situation  and Kai helped him so much.".

Not only that it has nothing to contribute to the story it is just vile and no content worth for joke I think this was their intention. also I did not like the end of the movie so much when Stefan by free will fails his final exam and also leaves the country. It was like a plea for egotistic behavior leaving all behind after his father  who helped him out in a very difficult situation  and Kai helped him so much.";

	schema:headline " Was this intended to be funny?";
	schema:reviewBody "Yeah what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turningpoint in life something like Sonnenallee or American Pie which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get?Attention spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before. But as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better german actors I believe that this effect really was intended. I think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be  especially when they are stoned. But really I don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends' talk. Boring dialogues make up most of this film.But okay that's one thing. I can cope with that I have seen nice films with abominable dialogues just think of Schwarzenegger's life's work. But the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything. Just one example SPOILER!! Why do you think does someone take a garden hose to his hempplants deep in the forest? To water them? Of course not usually you don't find waterpipes deep in forests do you? The only reason this waterhose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I truly hated this scene because it's really violent. Usually I don't mind violence in films  slapstickcomedies are full of it. But in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that. But if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstickscenes also seem real. In this particular scene in Lammbock I really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead  the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle. And the protagonists just walk away. It would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funny.Talking about being consistently  that's what I missed most about this film. The whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind. Things just happen without a apparent reason   yeah I know that's life but that's not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance. I found myself asking Where's the point? all the time. Characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend Kai in fact she tells you but I could not buy it not at all. I think she just was there to give Kai an opportunity to act this childish AIDStest sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better. The protagonist's girlfriend you meet once then she leaves Germany what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in America and splits up with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends. He actually didn't you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law being daddy's son daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film and living in beautiful Wuerzburg. Even the dinner with daddy's layerfriend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the family's friends except for the trip the guy is on later but I think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any. I have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams. I couldn't understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausible.All this made it a notsogood film but not one I wouldn't watch again on television. It really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu's play although he repeated his wellknown stereotypes again this time. Not good not abominable that's what I thought after the film was half over.But then came this incest scene and this I really found repulsive. Incest simply isn't funny. I don't even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way. This scene spoiled the whole film for me I couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more  I can't feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isn't funny. So it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave Germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we don't know. it is even totally unnecessary. I almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is fulfilled just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film. It isn't really funny it isn't really a drama it isn't at all a road movie a la Tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyable.Skip this film. Watch Final Fantasy that's also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The romantic comedy 'Sliding Doors' is a great look at how quickly a person's life can change in a matter of moments. By taking one path instead of another forming a tantalizing 'what if?' In fact this movie gives the impression that some things are meant to be known while some things are not.London publicists Helen is effortlessly sliding between parallel storylines that show what happens if she does or does not catch a morning train back to her apartment. Love. Romantic entanglements. Deception. Trust. Friendship. Comedy. All come into focus back and forth overlap then surprisingly converge in one of the great romantic comedy films in years.Sliding doors is one of the best films that Gwyneth Paltrow has done. It has it all humour anger sadness love compassion and a lot of lying. This movie is most special for the way the two storylines overlap making this a very original movie. Paltrow's performance is grand as the 'hurt Helen' or the very 'nave Helen' depending on which parts of the film you are watching. Some of her lines are priceless. Paltrow has had a very celebrated career in acting and of late singing and deserves all the accolades she gets. It was also refreshing to watch her in the murder thriller 'The perfect murder' along with screen legend Michael Douglas.Yet there are some other great performances in this film. John Hannah was exceptional as the sensitive and understanding 'James' who is helping the 'hurt Helen' back to being her 'old self'. Then you have the cheating boy 'Jerry' played by John Lynch who was using the 'nave Helen' to live out a very adulterous and selfish lifestyle. It was very funny to see the way he handled the situation with Helen actually. Then to top it all off we get a great performance from Jeanne Tripplehorn who was Jerry's girlfriend on the side who gives Jerry a very difficult time in both parts of the story.This film also has an impressive soundtrack. With acts like Blair the Brand New Heavies Dodgy Jamiroquai and the Space Monkeys. Yet there are two very famous parts to this soundtrack. One is Elton John who is given a bad mention in the movie when Jerry is caught in a most precarious of positions while playing the Elton John song 'Honky Cat'. However the best song on the whole soundtrack comes from the band Aqua with the tune 'Turn Back Time' which suited the film perfectly. The film clip to this song is also very good.Sliding doors is one of those feel good movies which can also make you feel sad as well. It shows how difficult life can be in a relationship and how important relationships can be as well. It also proves that relationships are extremely hard work and you need to find someone who you trust and love and that you get the same feelings back in return. If you want to see the good and bad sides of love take a look at this romantic classic.CMRS gives 'Sliding Doors' 4.5 Very Good Brilliant Film".

Most films would take just one or other of these plots and churn out a typical romcom but Sliding Doors turns them into one excellent film. The acting is great even if Paltrow's accent is at times a little too British and forced and the plot twists every few seconds. It could have become very confusing but the direction is good enough that you can easily follow the two stories at once.There are two things that stop this film being a 10. The first is that the two Helens sometimes seem a little too different from each other to be the same person. Even if they have gone through to different experiences they don't act the same at all. The second is that the message of the film seems that we don't control our own futureafter all it isnt Helen who decides if she makes it to the train it all depends on if a little girl is pulled out of the way by her mother in time. Still this is a very entertaining film and definately worth watching. 810.".

Without giving anything away I did not see the ending coming at all the first time through but it was entirely satisfying without being cloyingly Hollywood. Don't expect a cultural masterpiece.

Without giving too much away the film deals with two separate scenarios that evolve from Paltow's a catching or b missing a subway train. The director manages skillfully to lay the two stories down alongside one another without confusing either one. Although the two Paltrows are distinguished by different hair styles even that isn't really necessary. She becomes happy in one story desperately unhappy in the other. She succeeds eventually in one story fails in the other. She is the same character but entirely different. As she proved in Shakespeare in Love this girl can act.

Sliding Doors is a delightful romance with a wonderful screenplay. There are excellent lines and the chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah is marvelous. John Lynch is a good actor but is completely miscast in the role of a man disputed by two gorgeous women. I have just watched this movie for the third time and I still love it.

When we are dealing with the characters colliding through the fourth dimension a whole different set of circumstances are put in motion. The reason we can never travel back in time while forward is possible is that time would then become mutable and what we are may no longer be and then we wouldn't travel back in time. Two roads diverge in a woods paraphrasing Robert Frost but what if we could take each of those roads and see what happens. This movie is quite magical and does the best it can to get Gwyneth Paltrow through her parallel universes and see the things that one would see. I think the problem is that unless we get into quantum physics it's hard for the average person to really reconcile these sorts of events. I thought the acting was very good and believe things as they unfurled. I would recommend this film if you like to think about the possibilities it envisions.

I think the problem is that unless we get into quantum physics it's hard for the average person to really reconcile these sorts of events. I thought the acting was very good and believe things as they unfurled. I would recommend this film if you like to think about the possibilities it envisions. Try it on yourself sometime and extrapolate your own existence from some fork in the road and imagine what may have been.";

	schema:headline " Interesting idea but only half the film it could be.";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember when 'Sliding Doors' first came out back in 1998. It was one of the movies that I desperately wanted to see but for some unknown reason never got round to watching. It must've been on terrestrial TV at least three times before I was finally able to catch it. I'd heard good things knew the premise pretty well and had even seen a few brief clips of the movie in between. In my mind I'd formed some pretty high expectations over the years  and the only thing you can inevitably get for that is disappointment. It was almost like looking at a dottodot puzzle and being intrigued by the position of the dots but then discovering once I had joined them together that they make up one pretty darn mundane picture.This movie's biggest problem comes in just assuming that its 'alternate reality' storytelling device intriguing though it may be will do everything else for it. And true it does help to 'shake up' what would otherwise be a brace of very dull and clichd panoramas  we keep watching out of pure curiosity simply to see how things end up. And once I'd discovered that personally I ceased to care. One of the reasons why 'Sliding Doors' isn't a movie I would ever particularly want to own is because its novelty value has already gone down the drain by the second viewing. Not a great deal really happens dramawise and there isn't much comedy to help it along either.I still prefer this nonlinear film to the more recent '21 Grams' perhaps because by comparison this is refreshingly unpretentious as an experimental movie. It's perfectly contented with its simplicity which to some extent is quite pleasant but unfortunately equally as happy to be shallow and that it never attempts to dig especially deep proves a real downer in the end. It never claims to be a film about life with anything particularly meaningful to say  it's a film about a life or at least two possible versions of it just not a very interesting one at that. I'm pretty certain that both scenarios presented here have already been used several times over as soap opera subplots  and they really are much too thin to be described as anything other than two subplots played against each other in the hope that they will make a substantial story in union. In truth each scenario is just a quarter  and together all they make is a half.Gwyenth Paltrow earns points for trying but no amount of effort can redeem the fact that Helen is as 2D as both her stories. She never emerges as a particularly strong or welldefined character and I was never inclined to root for her in either case to see Patlrow in a leagues more engaging role check 'Shakespeare in Love'. The only thing I'm really left with to recommend is John Hannah. His cheery mannerisms and the charismatic feel he gives to James do help make him the sweet breath of fresh air he is clearly meant to be and if they had to go with this whole Mr Perfect routine I'm glad they enlisted him  he adds a warm lustre to what otherwise would be an empty and superficial film.Meanwhile John Lynch is simultaneously one of the movie's biggest assets and biggest errors. Under different circumstances I would be praising exactly the same performance right up there with Hannah's. Unfortunately that heartfelt and amiable portrayal is kinda wasted in context with everything else and only serves as a glaring reminder of what the movie could've been  a straightforward but insightful character study with a 'twists and turns of life' backdrop. Essentially Gerry is portrayed as a dishonest cheating but ultimately goodnatured and wellintentioned character  we the viewers are treated to glimpses of his side of the story which frankly is a lot more interesting than Helen's and actually begin to feel for him. It is his moral dilemma in both scenarios not Helen's knowledgelack of knowledge that coupled with his flawed personality form the real interest of this movie  there are times when I even wondered if the whole Helen thing was just meant to be a smokescreen to the real story about Gerry I mean look at the lyrics of the soundtrack's key number 'Turn Back Time' by Aqua  surely they pertain better to Gerry than to Helen.Unfortunately BOTH lifelines end with Gerry being rather quickly and cruelly cast aside. It's only then that it kinda dawns on you  it may have an unconventional format but this is still very much a traditional fairytale outlook and it was probably never the creative team's intention that we would feel pity for Gerry. It settles for viewing him as the villainous antagonist if you ask me Lydia is the only personage who could possibly fit that bill and is happy to treat him as one no matter how much sympathetic life Lynch has since injected into the character. It leaves you feeling kinda cold and unsatisfied so much so that it effectively nullifies those last few feelgood moments. True James is a lovely bloke the sort that every heterosexual girl on the planet wishes she could end up with  but it was Gerry who struck me as being the most human and NOT because he's unfaithful  but because of how he deals with the realisation that he was unfaithful. Lynch appears to have picked up on this. The writers clearly didn't and they got their priorities way wrong.And the moral of this movie  erm missing your initial mode of transport isn't necessarily as bad as at first it might seem?Go figure. Like I said it's about a life not life.".

The title represents choice or fate. Gwyneth Paltrow is positioned in two parallel stories. In story A she catches a subway train and arrives home to catch her boyfriend cheating. In story B she misses the train and arrives home only to suspect foul play. Great setup faulted with sitcom situations but director Peter Howitt has fun with interesting locations. Paltrow is fantastic playing someone at the mercy of either deceit or luck but either way weighs her options after losing her job. John Hannah as her friend is standard and unsympathetic. John Lynch plays her exboyfriend who is a jerk whether caught cheating or plainly being deceptive. Jeanne Tripplehorn plays his mistress who predictably makes things worse becoming nothing more than a parody fatal attraction gimmick. Zara Turner has a useless role as the female whom Paltrow moves in with and that is about the extent of her role. It addresses fate and the choices we make which is fine in itself but perhaps one choice viewers can make is to avoid this contraption. As for Paltrow hopefully she can apply her talent to films where the doors don't slide on the screenwriters. Score 5   10".

Sliding Doors delved into uncharted territory for 1998 and beyond not since then has a movie tackled such an interesting concept. Kudos to the writerdirector Peter Howitt for creating such a refreshing and unique take on the romantic comedy.You have to ask yourself...what would've happen ifor what could've become ofwith a concept like this.Helen Paltrow leaves her aimless writer boyfriend in the A.M. and heads to her P.R. job only to get shacked. When she tries to enter the subway back home one of two significant things happen that a little girl prevents She gets on and finds both a new male James Hannah and her old beau in bed with Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn who plays the mistress LydiaORshe misses the train and after a nasty spell carries on with her life with her mischievous and user boyfriend.Brilliantly the movie takes us in two overlapping directions with two Helens both of whom thanks to the wonderful acting of Paltrow you root for.Here's one aspect I actually didn't like but didn't hinder my overall view of the film the Helen that knows of the affair cuts her hair short and blonde  a la another 1990s icon Jane Mancini Josie Bissett of Melrose Place so that it's dumbed down enough for the audience to determine between that Helen and the original brown and longhaired Helen's story. It's as if they didn't have enough confidence in the audience that they would know where one story's going and the other's headed. I got it already. One Helen's melancholy though pushing forward with the new James and the other's working multiple jobs due to losing her P.R. employment.Nevertheless and again you'll watch each storyline unfold with overlapping scenes that were filmed exquisitely with ease tension suspense romance and harboring a fantastic and absolute 1990s soundtrack. Wow I used to love Aqua! Back to the story You'll follow Helen 1 and 2 on their parallel quests to meet up with fate. Will Helen 2 learn of her deadbeat boyfriend's infidelity? Will Helen 1 learn James is her soul mate? Will any of this make sense and what will we gain from it? I loved this movie. I loved the originality of it. I loved the acting  both Hannah and Paltrow were excellent. I loved the cinematography and the overlapping scenes.The movie's not 100 perfect  it starts to run out of steam with its own ideas but the director was well enough aware to know when to cut his losses and finish off the movie. But I challenge anyone to come up with another 5 movies that are as original as this or another favorite of mine Memento. But a movie can't survive on a premise or gimmick alone the movie must have the right writing and talent in front of the screen to pull it off. And this enormously romantic comedy hits all the angles.".

I must admit I found it impossible to keep my attention on this movie after it became clear that this movie was actually really going to Disneyfy our main characters. No one suffers anything really. No one thinks much about anything ever. Everyone sort of bubbles along bouncing from hard surfaced reality to gut wrenching twist. Where's the real people in these alternative lives ? Everyone seems as light as a flea and as deep as a snowflake. Serious situations produce only halting dim witted faces. No hard questions. No insights. In a phrase it's Clueless London 90210. These people have the personal and interpersonal insightsskills of a room full of 13 yr old former crack babies. No one seems the slightest bit aware of their actions or the consequences of their choices. Blah barf phooey. These people deserve each other and the paper thin cardboard flavored lives they unwittingly create. Pass me the remote and a No Dose. Yawwn.".

What a ghastly take on the possibilities fate hands us. Sigh. Moan. Groan. I must admit I found it impossible to keep my attention on this movie after it became clear that this movie was actually really going to Disneyfy our main characters. No one suffers anything really. No one thinks much about anything ever. Everyone sort of bubbles along bouncing from hard surfaced reality to gut wrenching twist. Where's the real people in these alternative lives ? Everyone seems as light as a flea and as deep as a snowflake. Serious situations produce only halting dim witted faces. No hard questions. No insights. In a phrase it's Clueless London 90210. These people have the personal and interpersonal insightsskills of a room full of 13 yr old former crack babies. No one seems the slightest bit aware of their actions or the consequences of their choices. Blah barf phooey. These people deserve each other and the paper thin cardboard flavored lives they unwittingly create. Pass me the remote and a No Dose. Yawwn.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Sliding Doors' tells two stories of the same characters. It uses the concept of time by showing what a significant difference a few seconds can make in ones life. In a nutshell it's about Helen a young publicist' who's just been sacked. The story divides into two as an upset Helen rushes to catch the metro on her way home. The first story starts with Helen missing the metro and the second story starts with her catching the metro. Both stories overlap at times but in spite of following a novel concept the screenplay disappoints to an extent. Some of the 'turn of events' look very forced. For example the scene where Helen gets mugged in residential area during broad daylight and James's wife suddenly appearing are unbelievable. The soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ears. Gwyneth Paltrow does a commendable job actingwise. However her diction is poor. The accent would have sounded more convincing if she had the right intonation and speed. John Hannah and John Lynch lend adequate support even though there characters are a little clichd. Jeanne Tripplehorn is brilliant as the bad American girl. 'Sliding Doors' would have made for a better film if the loose ends were pulled a little tighter but it qualifies for a decent one time watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems difficult for me anyway to imagine Gwyneth Paltrow as anything other than the wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. She seems as famous for giving her children strange names as she is for her acting career which seems to have stalled in recent years. But go back to 1998 and she seemed to be everywhere normally playing an English character. This arguably is her finest hour as this is a romantic movie with a rare intelligence and a daring approach to telling its story.Paltrow plays Helen a twentysomething PR executive living with her writerboyfriend Gerry John Lynch in London. One day she goes into work to find out that she's been fired. Distressed she goes to catch a Tube train back home and it's at this point that the film takes an unusual twist. First we see Helen board the train and then a second Helen misses it. The film then continues telling Helen's story from both angles which run simultaneously showing how much can change after such a simple difference.Sliding Doors is to be commended for daring to do something different basically providing two films for the price of one. Unfortunately neither film is a runaway success. It's only when they intersect and cross each other's paths that you appreciate the film for what it is. Paltrow works hard in the dual lead roles but the only real difference between the two Helens are their haircuts. Keeping pace with both stories at the same time is tricky at first but all the more rewarding when you get your head around it. Her costars Lynch and John Hannah are less impressive. Lynch is suitably slimy as Helen's boyfriend while Hannah comes across exactly like a Scottish Hugh Grant stammering in all the right places and getting suitably tonguetied at the right moments. The other problem I have with Sliding Doors is that it isn't a sidesplitting romantic comedy. It has its moments though I can't think any at the moment. It's more of a serious study into relationships than a hilarious duallayered comedy  it's not exactly There's Something About Mary still my favourite romcom.There aren't many films like Sliding Doors out there. Romcoms aren't known for being intelligent and different but this film deserves attention for trying to break free from the usual conventions. Unfortunately it's not a great film  it feels far longer than its 100 minute duration and it isn't as entertaining as it should be. I also felt it had a strong antimen feel to it as the few male characters in the film are either spineless worms lying cheaters or leering lager louts. Even the bitchy ex Jeanne Tripplehorn despite being a thoroughly nasty piece of work gets a smoother ride than the men. It's definitely a chickflick like most of my Better Half's DVD collection but I would still just about recommend Sliding Doors purely because it's a refreshing change from the norm. I just think that it could have been so much better  there is so much potential here writerdirector Peter Howitt doesn't quite know what to do with it. Persevere and maybe watch it twice in case you don't get it the first time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sliding Doors is written and directed by Peter Howitt. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah and features John Lynch Jeanne Tripplehorn and Virginia McKenna. The music was composed by David Hirschfelder and Remi Adefarasin photographs it on location in Londion. The film follows Helen Quilley Paltrow who has just been fired from her public relations job. The plot then splits into two parallel universes based on if she either did or did not get onto the London tube train to get home.Peter Howitt is more known to the British for his portrayal of Joey in the hugely popular sitcom Bread. Here for his first full length directing assignment he tackles the romantic comedy genre and gives it an intelligent and witty kick up the backside. Howitt apparently had the idea for the film when he was almost run over by a car the whole what if? situation worked around his mind and ended up being Sliding Doors. The premise is tricky but executed with skill two dovetailing stories featuring the same people. To expand on each story would to my mind be unfair on any prospective newcomers to the film it's just safe to say that infidelity features prominently and that as funny as it is at times it's also an often sombre and cautionary piece as well.The cast are a mixed bunch. Hannah and Paltrow are superb he is funny charming and utterly beguiling yet a world away from the normal pretty boy types so favoured by film makers. She is on both fronts engaging infuriating and commanding the utmost attention from the viewers. You will find yourself shouting at her sometimes yet at others you may find your heart sinking such is the conflicted emotional depth that Paltrow gives Helen. And this is done not by bursting into tears or any sort of the world is against me histrionics it's played very straight because her Helen is no lame dame. Credit too must go to Howitt who chooses not to go down the safe route of playing the tears to get tears romcom card. Sadly the two other main players are a big let down Lynch just never convinces as boyfriend Gerry while Tripplehorn as the ex stirring up a hornets nest is whiny and Persona Non Grata. The big winner here tho is Howitt's writing his directing is raw and often too in your face but the script breaks away from formula and constantly nudges the audience into asking pertinent what if? questions. There's nothing complex about it just slices of destiny and fate that can alter within seconds. For better or worse.No smugness here and this is better than the average romcoms that seem to be put out by cash hungry studios on a monthly basis. Is it just a romcom with a gimmick? Yes it is but what a gimmick! And come the end as the two stories bang together you hopefully should feel all the better for it. Hope springs eternal my friends. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "As I'd written in previous reviews for other Jancso' films I had missed out on an opportunity to watch this one on latenight Italian TV given that the first edition of the Italian DVD itself is outofprint and also in view of the fact that I've recently acquired a number of the director's works on disc I opted to add it to my DVD collection now rather than wait for another broadcast of the film which for all I know might never happen!.Typically for Jancso' very little was available to me on the printed page except for a succinct entry on Marco Giusti's Starcult guide wherein he describes the film as being frightfully enjoyableridiculous exasperatingsincereit was totally rejected at the time. In any case having now made a fair idea of what the Hungarian director's style is all about albeit this being his first of four films made in Italy  plus the fact that I've watched a few of the Political Revolution films made in the wake of the famous May 1968 events of which THE PACIFIST is an example  I knew more or less what to expect from it. Thankfully the film is short enough at 83 minutes and sparked by occasional humor not to become overly oppressive  since needless to say it's rather hardtack as entertainment obviously didactic in nature to begin with but also considering Jancso''s customary i.e. curiously aloof approach to things! For marquee value it features two popular names and faces of the era  Monica Vitti and Pierre Clementi the latter's characteristic mix of arrogance and earthiness is ideal for this environment in fact he had already appeared in Bernardo Bertolucci's similar but even more opaque PARTNER 1968but Vitti seems illatease with the demands of the leading role. She plays a TV reporter who becomes involved with revolutionarybum Clementi at first he seems to be stalking her  and being afraid reports him to the police however when he's caught and brought before her for identification she claims it was somebody else! After this she invites him to live with her but before long his companions turn up admonishing him for having balked from doing his duty among them is Daniel Olbrychski who curiously enough goes uncredited here for the record the Polish actor appeared in two other Jancso' films  AGNUS DEI 1970 which I haven't watched and ROME WANTS ANOTHER CAESAR 1974. Clementi was supposed to kill a man as a sure sign of his devotion to the 'cause'  and for failing to deliver on his promise his former friends offer him a way out by playing at Russian roulette! Vitti leaves intent on setting the law after them but on arriving at Police Headquarters the Commissioner takes her for a neurotic! by then Clementi has been executed regardless  and noticing that Olbrychski has followed her there Vitti shoots him thus causing a commotion.I have to say though that one of the reasons Vitti's performance feels artificial is due to the fact that her distinctively plaintive voice is inexplicably dubbed on the Alan Young R2 DVD edition I watched! I know that the custom in Italian cinema at the time was to shoot without sound and then recreate the dialogue track later in the studiobut ironically Vitti can still be heard on the trailer!! Considering that the print was reportedly culled from the original negative I wonder whether the 'redubbing' was done prior to the film's original release  rather than newly rerecorded specifically for the digital format as had been the case with say the Italian DVD I rented not too long ago of Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON 1970.For what it's worth THE PACIFIST is notable for a few inventivelydeployed sets Vitti's home is enveloped by windows as if it were a glass showroom ditto for a derelict church turned into an impromptu display for the newest fashion in cars and a score by Giorgio Gaslini which even includes a couple of pop songs  one of these translating to Stop Raining incidentally was adopted on its home ground as a subtitle to the film itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the Battle of Valle Giulia in the historic year of 1968 the film director Pasolini famously declared that he had more sympathy with the police than the protesting students as the police were the children of the poor and the students the children of the middle and upper classes. There is an implied reference to this at the start of La Pacifista a plea from a generation of radical students who wanted to not be dismissed just because of the privileges of their upbringing.There are radical groups from the right and the left in the movie. In between them is La Pacifista Barbara played by the glorious Monica Vitti who just wants to be an earth mother in love with everyone. A right wing group of youths plan malfeasance against her. They come off as a fairly tribal group fascinated with ritual degenerating into a death cult.I haven't been able to find much written about the movie it seems that it has been ignored or found confusing or indeed confused and the overall impression is generally negative. It's definitely challenging and ambitious and it feels like you have to go some to suspend disbelief. The movie presents a partially choreographed version of reality a technique that goes full blown a couple of years later with Janco's Red Psalm this is very visually appealing although it's very hard to pin down why it's being done except that it definitely reinforces the tribal nature of some of what is going on.The most ambitious technique is to voice the thoughts of some of the characters via narration. It is a lot easier to make actions believable than it is to make thoughts believable. Sometimes I was not exactly clear which character's thoughts were being narrated due to the tableau focus of some of the camera work. One of the right wing revolutionaries for example seems to have some concerns about his girlfriend being Jewish or ex girlfriend and how that conflicts with his ideology but which one? Much of the movie focuses on Monica Vitti who portrays a journalist covering the demonstrations. We hear a lot of her character's thoughts. It's difficult to sometimes tell what is going on there because it often sounds like two characters and this could be two sides of herself or it could be that she is having a dialogue with her imagination of her mother or another relative or friend.The revolutionary events of the movie seem very alien to her and in fact the movie seems to become quite feminist because she as a woman is generally ignored or seen as hysterical.In the end I think the main message of the film is that you can't ignore fascists you have to fight against them pacifism is not an option. This seems rather tagged on by the final few scenes of the film and a rather factional message in this particular case given how useless and imploding the fascist group seems. Generally it's a very messy film and I can see why it has been dismissed. It is however a good looking and ambitious movie so I give it points for that.".

Yes it's antic but the spiritual aspect totally caught me by surprise. The mystery of the bird represents the unfathomable forces which interlace peoples' paths and create love. Bird of the Air is witty and sweet and deftly directed. The two leads are presently unknown but it's easy to predict that will change. And while the bird is awesome the dog had me at first sight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Character actress turned filmmaker Margaret Whitton demonstrates real directorial savvy with A BIRD OF THE AIR an appealing dramedy adapted by Roger Towne The Natural from Joe Coomer's 1992 novel THE LOOP. Indie production may be lowprofile amongst the highconcept Hollywood product out there but is a highly recommended movie.Originally optioned by Oprah and later acquired by Matthew McConaughey as a vehicle for himself and postSAHARA but preOscar Penelope Cruz Whitton's eventual version benefits from casting unknown leads.Jackson Hurst toplines as Lyman a handsome introvert with zero social skills whose job is cleaning up the interstate in rural New Mexico by night aiding stranded or injured motorists. A beautiful flighty young librarian Fiona winningly personified by Rachel Nichols sets her romantic sights on Lyman and a decidedly unconventional bond develops between the mismatched pair.A couple of nonhuman characters balance and amplify the drama as a parrot mysteriously flies into Lyman's trailer home one day an aged lost soul like our orphan hero. Fiona's basset hound is the other leading player at first downright hostile to Lyman but later helping to break down his protective shell.Much of the narrative revolves around Lyman's quest to track down the previous owners of the parrot while Fiona researches Lyman's own shady background. Director Whitton has cleverly distorted the voices of those owners to provide a voice for the humorously loquacious bird whose pronouncements hint at the film's underlying themes.Brief but telling character turns are provided by the succession of owners all sympathetically acted by a diverse group of talents including Buck Henry Judith Ivey and Phyllis Sommerville. Film buffs will also note a welcome albeit fleeting return to the screen by Anjanette Comer as Buck's wife. Also forceful in support is Linda Emond as a diner waitress who mothers Lyman and narrates the picture.Flavorful but not showy lensing by Oscarwinner Philippe Rousselot is a plus and the film remains offbeat without succumbing to the cutesy clichs that tempt so many indie efforts of late. Hurst is disarming as the central hunk acting in a style reminiscent of early Harrison Ford before he started taking himself a bit too seriously and Nichols in quite a turnabout after costarring opposite CONAN THE BARBARIAN is a radiant heroine.".

Keep in mind it was not her dog she did not actually witness the shooting and the dog was suffering. A normal functioning human would be able to shake the bummed out feeling off after such an experience. I'm convinced this writer is not a human and has never met one. The dialogue is forced and awkward. The scene where he meets the old man who owned his parrot as a child is cringe worthy. Is the old man supposed to be mentally handicapped or is it bad writingacting? The climax comes when our titular Highway Hero is forced to prove his love of dogs by sacrificing himself for his love's pet and gets hit by a car... that's just... it just is I don't even know. She then kidnaps him from the hospital while he's drugged and hauls him along on her journey to her family's house roll credits.

	schema:headline " A great good feel funny movie!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicolas Cage plays the great straight guy while his 2 brothers played by Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey supply the comedy value in this hugely entertaining and funny movie. Things don't go to plan when the Firpo brothers try to rob the peaceful town of Paradise and get stuck there on Christmas Eve only to find that they have robbed the nicest town on earth. I think Cage is great in this film like in 'Peggy Sue Got Married' 'Family Man' and 'It Could Happen to You' he plays a lovable character that is full of emotion which you just can't imagine anyone else playing. There's also a great moment in the film where he looses his temper and he almost transforms into Castor Troy from FaceOff. If you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and not just the action stuff you should see this movie and it's even better at Christmas time.".

Trapped in Paradise is about the healing powers of a small town at Christmas. If you've ever live in a small town or even visited one you could relate to this movie. To me this is more of a feel good comedy than anything. It might not hit a lot of top ten lists because its not flashy and it doesn't have a huge trailer but its a good movie to sit down and laugh to and make you feel good about the human race once again. Nicholas Cage John Lovitt and Dana Carvey's characters are believable even if they are not dynamic. I highly recommend this movie for anyone from the young to the young at heart.".

Nicholas Cage is great and I've seen Dana Carvey and John Lovitz perform on SNL before.  I must say they make excellent cons and are very funny.  However unlikely it was for the townspeople to save them at the end doesn't really matter.  It just shows good nature.  And I also tend to like some comedies a bit better if the somewhat unjust don't change at the end just teach us something.  IE at the end Dana Carvey takes the guy's hat and puts it on his brother's head.  It just makes it that much more funny to say it's good from beginning to end.  Think about There's Something About Mary. At the end Ted is the only one that really learns anything while Woogie just tries to get an autograph from Brett Favre.  This movie is something worth checking out if you can just leave all common sense behind.  Don't just go for the critically acclaimed.

Yet they were both great movies. I also don't get those who say that Thirteen Days was inaccurate. My God the only thing that the filmmakers didn't have was access to the thoughts of those involved. What more do you want? The thing to remember about films like Trapped and ConAir is that they are fictitious and the whole point of making movies is to suspend belief and tell a story. It doesn't have to be funny. It doesn't have to sad or make a point or have a morale. It just has to be. This is what separates the boys from the men and thus separates filmmakers from those with axes to grind and wannabes. You make a film because it means something to you personally not for commercial value.

Never treat her without menacing but do not show the menace open so that you can deny it after. 2. Isolate her from society best make her a child as soon as possible so that she does not get bored. 3. Never praise her for what she is doing unless in the presence of foreigners. 4. Praise her in front of her parents with whom you should establish a good friendship. If she is complaining later about her marriage the guilt will be given to her.As the subtitle of the movie says the longest ever used in a movie The movie is about those people who are capable to see the unjustness of social rules but don't help changing them and by doing so confirm them. Effi Briest is therefore a typical Fassbinder movie which he liked to call melodramas and thus also a predecessor of his later womenmovies about Maria Braun Lola Lili Marleen and Veronika Voss.That this film is an outstanding masterpiece has nowadays been recognized by all leading film experts around the world. Although Fassbinder let himself sometimes inspire by works of literature Fontane's Effi Briest is one of his only three explicit literature adaptations besides Berlin Alexanderplatz and Querelle. One could perhaps go as far and say While in Effi Briest society is criticized at the hand of one single individual fate in Berlin Alexanderplatz a society as a whole is put in the pillory and in Querelle a possible alternative world after all the disgust is shown. Fassbinder made this long way in societal criticism in only eight years during which he approached the society of the time in which he lived by systematically coming closer to reach the 50ies of the 20th century Lola. His movies can be seen as chronicles of different means of suppression by using calculi which turn out to be independent of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fontane Effi Briest is a West German movie from the year 1974 and the writer and director is Rainer Werner Fassbinder although the writer of the original work is of course Theodor Fontane as the title already tells us. It is not one of Fassbinder's earliest works but he still decided to pick the blackandwhite route again maybe to show how old this story already is. At 140 minutes it is easily among Fassbinder's longest films. And that's really a negative dealbreaker here. To me this film dragged a whole lot on many many occasions. I hardly cared for Effi or any of the supporting characters at all as a consequence. And I also really hated the dialogues sometimes. Of course they were adapted with the exact quotes from Fontane's novel I guess but I did not like it at all. I usually like Fassbinder when he gives us his view on society or just on how people act within the boundaries of society. There are a handful films from him I really love and some I do not care about particularly but this one here is really a major disappointment. It is probably my least favorite work from him and it's also not helping that he several actors that appear frequently in his films such as Schygulla Lommel Hermann and Bhm. I may be a bit biased as I did not like the recent version starring Julia Jentsch either but I really only recommend this to huge fans of the Fontane work. Everybody else even Fassbinder fans will probably be majorly bored because it's so different compared to everything else he has done apart from the very slowlymoving plot. I can only shake my head at other reviewers who call this one of the best films ever made and give it 10 out of 10 stars. Highly not recommended.".

Its a nice looking film gorgeous in black and white often like a painting of 18th Century characters standing on beaches or in drawing rooms. It doesn't remind me of Sirk specifically aside from the few shots in mirrors and the overly composed shots. There's no histrionics and hardly any music melo in melodrama means music. The scenes on the beach where the narrator talks for minutes while we watch the characters from a midshot are either meant to be funny or they don't work at all I can't decide.

Now I've seen about a dozen Fassbinder films and I often have really enjoyed them but watching this one was a chore.First the film's style seems less innovative or interesting than just dull and dare I say it cheap. The black  white film looked more like a way to save money than anything else and the film played like a long series of vignettes all strung together with awkward dissolves. This made it all seem very episodiclike the audience is getting snippets instead of seeing a story.Second the story wasn't particularly interesting. The film played like a Bergman film WITHOUT the complexities. And sadly the film was slow and the characters uninvolving.Overall I found watching this film a chore. There are many wonderful German films out there but I assume the average person would also find this film dry and unapproachable as you need a lot of patience to stick with this film.".

Now I've seen about a dozen Fassbinder films and I often have really enjoyed them but watching this one was a chore.First the film's style seems less innovative or interesting than just dull and dare I say it cheap. The black  white film looked more like a way to save money than anything else and the film played like a long series of vignettes all strung together with awkward dissolves. This made it all seem very episodiclike the audience is getting snippets instead of seeing a story.Second the story wasn't particularly interesting. The film played like a Bergman film WITHOUT the complexities. And sadly the film was slow and the characters uninvolving.Overall I found watching this film a chore. There are many wonderful German films out there but I assume the average person would also find this film dry and unapproachable as you need a lot of patience to stick with this film.";

HOWEVER I have to say that I found the story with which I am unfamiliar incredibly bland. How many 19th and early 20th Century novels have this exact same plot? It's the simplistic fallen wife scenario without a spark of invention it seems to me. In that way I could not stand this film and was trying hard not to pass out. However Fassbinder's miraculous filmmaking cinematography miseenscene direction music even the acting kept me at least interested. I give it a 610.".

I have desperately tried to understand what all the fuss is about when most of his movies seem like movie Experiments gone badly wrong. Effi Briest is at least an accomplished movie with a unique style although at 2 hours 15 minutes it's pretty slow and overly long.Fassbinder being an eccentric artiste couldn't just use the title of the novel but came up with a monstrous title which the IMDb spellchecker doesn't allow me to quote here that doesn't make much sense in German but seems to give the movie a Marxist twist it alludes to many know their possibilities and requirements but chose to support the ruling system. The title is usually mercifully shortened to just Fontane Effi Briest.At the time the sound recording of films was still a considerable technical problem so that the entire film was dubbed the voices and partially also the background noises were rerecorded in a studio and added to the film in postproduction. The dubbing was done very meticulously so that the voices are in perfect synchronicity with the lip movements. The voices are in several cases not of the actual actors for example Eva Mathes was dubbed by another actress and voiced yet another actress. This gives the film a touch of artificiality and a sense of heightened reality which goes well with the slow pace of the story.So for a Fassbinder it's a surprisingly watchable movie. At the same time there is no narration no tension nothing is building up to anything. It's love it and sit through it or switch off the video.Interestingly Fassbinder also has no intention of putting a new angle on the jaded story of the romantic girl falling victim to an uncaring world. I would love to see Effi as a competent woman trying to make her own rules or even as a femme fatale for a change.".

Fassbinder saddles the film with narration that is only interrupted by tedious drawn out conversations and extraneous intertitles. Various characters narrate the film at different times but more often than not the narrator is actually omniscient and entirely divorced from the story this device is just part of a bigger problem a slavish devotion to the source material that isn't kind to the book or the film. One particularly important moment is conveyed via a stagy histrionic monologue when it could easily have come out naturally in conversation. Overall Effi Briest is one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen as the marriage between the amazing visuals and the awkward script is no more successful than the doomed relationship between the naive titular character and her pedantically moralistic husband.".

	schema:reviewBody "My grandmother was a parent during the '50's and liked everything neat and clean and in its place. Heaven forbid if things get too out of hand too real. I have waited my entire life for Hollywood to tell Secretariat's story and after watching Disney's Secretariat my heart remains unsatisfied. It was a good feel good movie but good is the keyword. I felt like Grandma edited this movie. Again it is a good movie with some interjections of great cinematography yet Secretariat was a GREAT horse and deserved a GREAT movie. This was an Oscar winning story with an Oscar winning cast but the script was emotionally impotent. There were no risks and risk is what horse racing is all about. The movie is so safe and there wasn't anything safe about the facts that surround this horse and his rise to be the greatest race horse that ever lived.Still today when I watch Secretariat run on YouTube I cry!!! I'm not sure why but the tears flow from the depths of my being. Rationally I try to tell myself that he is just a horse but something overcomes me every time no matter how many times I watch him run. That overwhelming surge of emotion is what this story deserved. If you've ever been in the presence of a great horse you will know what I am talking about. They are strong and confident. You can feel their aura. There is a low rolling thunder of excitement when you are near them. Talk to the people who were there. Read the first hand accounts of their emotional state when they saw this horse run. He was mesmerizing captivating unexplainably breathtaking. The audience deserved to feel the thunder roll through them in every scene.I expected so much more from director Randall Wallace. The power and emotion of Braveheart We Were Soldiers Pearl Harbor The Man in the Iron Mask is what Secretariat deserves. Where was that? I'm not sure what research he did for this movie and how much his hands were tied by the real life characters or the studio but the main character became the background and what was in the forefront was a sugar coated conflict of a woman with a driving passion and the place society and her family was trying to lock her into however even her passion didn't spill out onto the audience as it should have. I felt like the accomplishments of Penny Chenery and Secretariat have been shrunk down and placed into a nice neat little box fit for a good little housewife and her sweet little horse. I felt as if I was the one being squelched because I wanted so badly for everyone to share the emotion I feel at the sheer audaciousness when this horse ran. To accomplish what they accomplished he and his owner had to be completely audacious to rise above the negativity and overwhelming odds surrounding them.Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses however her role left me doubting the character. For example when a woman talks to her horse she does more than look into his eye for a few seconds and say Well OK then. When a woman truly needs to know something from her horse she breathes him in they breathe each other in as their souls entwine and one knows the other. You will see it on his face and you will see it on her face without human words being spoken. This is a rare and special event but it happens and it could have carried this movie. If you have seen Diane Lane in Unfaithful you will realize this is an actress that could translate this kind of communication and emotion to the screen.The audience should have been allowed to feel the emotional range that surrounds all involved in preparing a horse for the greatest races any thoroughbred will ever run. Just watch horse racing on television and you will see real raw emotion that these people explode with at the end of the race. So much was on the line for everyone involved and yet throughout the movie everyone handled the stress with subdued emotion never getting too far off the scale. Just when you thought someone was going to show some real feelings they apologized for it. Real life is just as ugly as it is beautiful. Without the dark of night the brightest stars would never beam their intense beauty upon us. Every masterpiece must have its extreme contrasts to fulfill the emotional needs of its audience.I'm not blaming anyone. I am sure everyone involved did their best. I am simply sharing with the reader my disappointment in what I thought would be a thrilling tribute to a horse so deserving.Ron Turcotte said the film captured the story pretty well. I ask you is pretty well good enough for the greatest race horse who ever ran on the track? Secretariat's heart was two and a half times the size of a normal horse's heart I feel the portrayal of his story should have been two and a half times the size of any regular movie. He gave us everything he had when he ran the Belmont thirtyone lengths ahead of Sham who was an amazing record breaking horse in his own right. Don't we owe it to him to give him everything we've got to see that generations to come understand the events that transpired to make him who he is? Have we as a culture become so jaded that there can be no magic in the truth? Can the epic only be found in fiction? I don't believe it. I believe that purity of a moment of perfection forever locked in time is where magic can be found and that magic is why it brings inspiration and tears to the eyes of the soul who seeks it.Suzette Howard".

The movie is so safe and there wasn't anything safe about the facts that surround this horse and his rise to be the greatest race horse that ever lived.Still today when I watch Secretariat run on YouTube I cry!!! I'm not sure why but the tears flow from the depths of my being. Rationally I try to tell myself that he is just a horse but something overcomes me every time no matter how many times I watch him run. That overwhelming surge of emotion is what this story deserved. If you've ever been in the presence of a great horse you will know what I am talking about. They are strong and confident. You can feel their aura. There is a low rolling thunder of excitement when you are near them. Talk to the people who were there. Read the first hand accounts of their emotional state when they saw this horse run. He was mesmerizing captivating unexplainably breathtaking. The audience deserved to feel the thunder roll through them in every scene.I expected so much more from director Randall Wallace. The power and emotion of Braveheart We Were Soldiers Pearl Harbor The Man in the Iron Mask is what Secretariat deserves. Where was that? I'm not sure what research he did for this movie and how much his hands were tied by the real life characters or the studio but the main character became the background and what was in the forefront was a sugar coated conflict of a woman with a driving passion and the place society and her family was trying to lock her into however even her passion didn't spill out onto the audience as it should have. I felt like the accomplishments of Penny Chenery and Secretariat have been shrunk down and placed into a nice neat little box fit for a good little housewife and her sweet little horse. I felt as if I was the one being squelched because I wanted so badly for everyone to share the emotion I feel at the sheer audaciousness when this horse ran. To accomplish what they accomplished he and his owner had to be completely audacious to rise above the negativity and overwhelming odds surrounding them.Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses however her role left me doubting the character. For example when a woman talks to her horse she does more than look into his eye for a few seconds and say Well OK then. When a woman truly needs to know something from her horse she breathes him in they breathe each other in as their souls entwine and one knows the other. You will see it on his face and you will see it on her face without human words being spoken. This is a rare and special event but it happens and it could have carried this movie. If you have seen Diane Lane in Unfaithful you will realize this is an actress that could translate this kind of communication and emotion to the screen.The audience should have been allowed to feel the emotional range that surrounds all involved in preparing a horse for the greatest races any thoroughbred will ever run. Just watch horse racing on television and you will see real raw emotion that these people explode with at the end of the race. So much was on the line for everyone involved and yet throughout the movie everyone handled the stress with subdued emotion never getting too far off the scale. Just when you thought someone was going to show some real feelings they apologized for it. Real life is just as ugly as it is beautiful. Without the dark of night the brightest stars would never beam their intense beauty upon us. Every masterpiece must have its extreme contrasts to fulfill the emotional needs of its audience.I'm not blaming anyone. I am sure everyone involved did their best. I am simply sharing with the reader my disappointment in what I thought would be a thrilling tribute to a horse so deserving.Ron Turcotte said the film captured the story pretty well. I ask you is pretty well good enough for the greatest race horse who ever ran on the track? Secretariat's heart was two and a half times the size of a normal horse's heart I feel the portrayal of his story should have been two and a half times the size of any regular movie. He gave us everything he had when he ran the Belmont thirtyone lengths ahead of Sham who was an amazing record breaking horse in his own right. Don't we owe it to him to give him everything we've got to see that generations to come understand the events that transpired to make him who he is? Have we as a culture become so jaded that there can be no magic in the truth? Can the epic only be found in fiction? I don't believe it. I believe that purity of a moment of perfection forever locked in time is where magic can be found and that magic is why it brings inspiration and tears to the eyes of the soul who seeks it.Suzette Howard";

With Disney funding the cash flow and an A list cast assembled Secretariat the movie is every inch the professional production you would expect. However thematically it's surprising that the horse is very much secondary to the story of his owner Penny Chenery Lane.Chenery's story as written on the film version page is a worthy one to tell for sure. After suffering family bereavements she stood firm after winning the horse on a coin toss to guide the horse to the greatest of American horse racing triumphs. This in a male dominated sport dominated by chauvinists. Further more Chenery had to hold her own family together whilst running the Chenery ranch. Inspirational woman for sure and Lane is naturally steely in the role but there just isn't great human interest drama crafted by director Wallace to warrant the film being primarily about the good lady.Naturally when the horse racing takes centre stage it's gripping and exciting the race segments very well filmed but we already knew that Secretariat was an awesome horse how he got to be that way isn't known to us. Malkovich plays trainer Lucien Laurin with moody flamboyance but we see next to nothing of his training of the horse! It's one of the many oversights that stop the film competing with Seabiscuit. It may seem unfair to compare the two but the makers of Seabiscuit got the blend right whilst cleaving close to the facts to tell their story. There's also the controversy factor the fudging of the facts to suit the makers ends where some characterisations have been pointedly argued to be incorrect and a deviation from truths to the point we don't have the real story of what made Secretariat so great. Whilst it spins a rags to riches story when in reality it wasn't Riva Ridge anyone? Where's the Preakness clocking controversy? These facts would have boosted the film no end but I guess this is the price we pay for having Disney funding the film supposedly about the magnificent beast in the title. Come the home straight the music does swirl and the cheers go loud and undeniably the uplift factor takes a hand but there's too much wrong all told to make this a great picture. I have to say it go watch Seabiscuit instead. 6.510".

In 1973 Big Red dominated racing like no other.What makes this even more amazing is that Secretariat is actually the second most interesting story ... his owner Penny Chenery Tweedy played here by Diane Lane was his match in competitive spirit. This Disney movie actually spends as much time on Ms. Tweedy as it does the fabulous horse.Disney does what Disney does best. This is an all out feelgood rahrah movie in the vein of Seabiscuit The Rookie Rudy and even Hoosiers. Don't expect indepth analysis of the racing world or horse training or even horse farm operations. This movie is made to deliver a warm fuzzy via the perseverance of a strongwilled lady and an incredibly majestic animal.Expect some overthetop touches such as John Malkovich's portrayal of trainer Lucen Laurin horsewhispering by Ms. Lane and plenty of heartstring tugging as is customary from the fine folks at Disney. Expect historical facts to be treated a bit lax in some scenes no mention of 1972 Derby winner Riva Ridge also from the Chenery stables. Expect none of that to matter as this is a crowdpleaser not a documentary.In addition to Mr. Malkovich and Ms. Lane there is some fine support work from Fred Thompson James Cromwell and Nelsan Ellis so great as Lafayette in True Blood. Directed by Randall Wallace whose most recent directorial effort was 2002's We Were Soldiers this is entertainment for all ages and an easy introduction to the champion that was Secretariat.".

	schema:headline " Good movie but Secretariat was a GREAT horse and he deserves nothing less than that.";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this movie not expecting anything brilliant but a fun movie that portrayed a great horse which is exactly what it wasespecially since it's a Disney movie. I had no problem that the story was mainly about Penny Chenery and what she did my problem was that they took the most memorable and moving race of all time The Belmont and turned it into a rushed scene. I felt as though they did not spend enough time on Secretariat's magic that happened that day at Belmont. The fact that the race wasn't recorded at Belmont isn't the problem because there are so many other problems with this scene. The music was just silly  no emotion whatsoever when I watch the actual footage of this race there is SO much emotion!. They could have made this scene far better than it was. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the Match Race and the last race scene from the movie Sea Biscuit  now those were scenes and music put together that gave me goosebumps and tears to my eyes. Secretariat just gets a quick race scene with some silly music as he comes down the last turn. Not too emotional if you ask me. Diane Lane did a wonderful job as Penny Chenery and you are always rooting for her throughout the entire movie. I can't say the same for her family. Her husband was an ignorant jerk as was her brother. And why did her peace loving hippie daughter get the extra screen time that Secretariat deserved!? That really irked me. Before this movie came out so many people were assuming that Sham Secretariats biggest rival was not going to be mentioned at all. Well that certainly was not the case as they did a good job at letting the audience know just who Sham was which really impressed me. I own race horses and I watch actual footage on youtube of the great ones especially Secretariat and I get chills and get a tear to my eye just watching him run mainly the Derby and the Belmont and I thought for sure there would be at least one time in the movie where I would get emotional but no not one scene had that effect on me. If you know a lot about horse racing andor truly see how much of a wonderful horse Secretariat was you will not think this movie is up to par. I also think the movie Sea Biscuit involved more emotion towards the horse from the audience more so than Secretariat does. If you are aware of how great of a horse he was you will love him but if you're going into this movie not knowing much about Secretariat the director fails to bring you emotionally involved with him. I will most likely buy this movie when it comes out because overall I did enjoy it but I just wish it could have been better.Simply put like my title says Secretariat the horse himself was nothing short of great and this movie is decent at best and I'm sorry but the best race horse of all time does not deserve good or decent ... he deserves GREAT.".

If you want to take your children to a well made movie with horses this is a good film. If you want to learn about the greatest racehorse of the 20th century go to you tube and watch old clips of the actual horse itself. If you're looking for a good movie about a horse buy or rent Seabiscuit. That movie tells much more of the story about the horse.".

Only twice in my life have I ever walked out of a theater in the middle of a showing and one of those times I left because I was annoyed at the girl I was seeing at the time. The only film I couldn't bear to see through to the end was an old Betsy Russell B movie I saw in junior high the name of which I hope I never recall.Had I been in a theater rather than watching a BluRay of 'Secretariat' this probably would have been my third walkout. It is a truly horrible film.Actually I bought the disc because the film should have had a free pass straight into my short list of all time favorites. Things the film had going for it1. The subject matter. Secretariat was arguably the greatest racehorse of all time. 2. Casting John Malkovich and James Cromwell are among my favorite actors and Dianne Lane has almost attained Katie Hepburn status in my personal opinion I used to say that if I could fill out a table for five with four media celebrities they'd be Dianne Lane George Carlin Tim Burton and Charles Laughton. Might have been bad chemistry but certainly worth the chance. 3. Storyline. Meadow Stables awash with red ink in a game for only the deepest of deep pocket players gets a new management team of Chenery Lauren and Turcotte after the illness of her father. This trio goes on to save the farm while accomplishing a feat never before done in racing the winning of backtoback Kentucky Derbys with the same owner trainerand jockey combo. Riva Ridge won in '72 and Secretariat in '73. 4. Timing The movie going public was already predisposed to like the film because of the groundbreaking accomplished by the 2003 'Seabiscuit' and a number of less known but often quite good efforts with 'Phar Lap' in 1983 'Ruffian' in '07 and possibly even Coppola's 'Black Stallion' back in 1979.Disney proved however that you really can make a sow's ear out of a silk purse. They've produced a formulaic flat and all too often insipid retelling of what should have been a terrific story. 'Seabiscuit' often pulled at my heartstrings 'Secretariat' attacked my gag reflex. Things I truly hated1. The list of anachronisms and errors which are legion is fairly well compiled on IMDb so I won't be redundant but some of them are so deliberate and to anyone interested in horse racing so offensive they certainly belie the movie's tagline 'The Impossible True Story'. Better it should have been 'The Impossible To Believe This Nonsense Is Anywhere Close To The True Story'. Secretariat didn't save Meadow Stables Riva Ridge did. 2. Kudos for the most spectacularly inappropriate use of 'Oh Happy Day' in the stretch run. That one really got to me. There was nothing religious or divine about the unusual physical anomaly which allowed a creature to be born with a pump heart 2  times the mass typical for his species thus oxygenating his blood far more quickly. 3. I have the utmost respect for Penny Chenery but she should have clued Randall Wallace in on the fact that a camera panning the grandstands on that day in that racetrack would be hard pressed to find a bareheaded woman much less a Derby Entry owner sans hat!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not about going back. This is about life being ahead of you and you run at it. Because you never know how far you can run unless you run.Secretariat is one of those rare sports movies that manages to hook your attention and maintain the suspense despite knowing how it will turn out at the end. It's impossible not to fall in love with this horse and his story. Disney was the right choice for the production of this film considering their success with other family friendly sport films like Remember the Titans. Secretariat was voted as one of the best athletes of the century number one on the list if we don't count human performances and several of his records still stand to this very day nearly 40 years later. His story had to be told in film as Secretariat is considered to be the best racehorse of all time. The story involving his owner Penny Chenery and how she saved her ailing father's stable risking everything including her marriage and betting it on the horse just adds to the overall dramatic effect of the plot. Secretariat reminded me a lot of another good racehorse film Seabiscuit. I wouldn't say this is a better movie it's different but I can say that Secretariat was a better racehorse that won the most important races including the Triple Crown in 1973 a feat that hadn't been accomplished in 25 years. Randall Wallace writer of Braveheart and director of We Were Soldiers did a good job with the direction of this film despite being better known as a screenplay writer. The screenplay for Secretariat was written by Mike Rick which was adapted from William Nack's book about the large chestnut colt nicknamed Big Red.Diane Lane is Penny Chenery a mother of four and housewife who's life changes after her mother's death and a visit to their stable based in Virginia. Penny's father used to be the brains of the entire operation in Meadow Stables but with the death of his wife and his illness things are going downhill at the stable. Penny decides to change things around in order to save the stable and begins by firing their trainer who seems to be making some unfavorable deals with other owners by trying to sell their horses at a much lower value. Penny with the help of the family's trustworthy secretary Miss Ham played humorously by Margo Martindale begins managing the place. The first smart move she makes is breeding one of her horses Somethingroyal with a famous Thoroughbred racehorse named Bold Ruler. The result was the birth of the large chestnut colt nicknamed Big Red but better known in the horseracing world as Secretariat. Penny hires Lucien Laurin John Malkovich as the trainer and Ron Turcotte Otto Thorwarth as the jockey and along with the groom Eddie Sweet Nelsan Ellis together they form a great team and foster the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. Of course the movie can't be successful if it doesn't have some drama in it and so some problems surface back home with Penny's husband Jack Tweedy Dylan Walsh because running a stable back in Virginia has affected Penny with her housewife duties. Somehow Penny has to manage saving the stable in a macho dominated society and maintain her family together while risking everything on one horse Secretariat.Secretariat succeeds as a film because the story is just so powerful and uplifting. The movie deals with overcoming difficult odds and following one's dream. Penny had a good life as a housewife but all this had led her far away from her early goal of following her father's footsteps and managing the Meadow Stables. Once the opportunity presents itself to her she quickly takes on the difficult task and decides to follow her long life dream. Secretariat teaches us that it's never too late to follow one's dreams and overcome difficult situations. Disney has always been good at reminding us how important it is to fight for our dreams. Life is a race and if we don't wake up in time our dreams and goals might just end in that only dreams and we will never achieve anything if we don't take risks in order to live out our dreams. Penny took the risk and bet it all on Secretariat who didn't fail her. The story of this colt is just amazing and inspiring. The final scene where he is racing at the Belmont Stakes is just mesmerizing and left me full of goose bumps. Secretariat was such an amazing horse and his story is done justice in this family friendly film. It is a strong memorable movie that teaches us some important lessons while at the same time never ceases to entertain it's audience. The performances in this movie are also great. Diane Lane as Penny and John Malkovich as Lucien give memorable and fun performances. Secretariat is a movie for the entire family to enjoy.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I have little interest in movies and haven't been to a movie theater in years but I did go to see Secretariat because that was such a big event for my horseloving 13 year old self back in the 70's. I loved the cinematography of the movie  how it put you right into the race with one of the most phenomenal horses of the century. I particularly loved the closeups while those passages from the Book of Job were being recited He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength He goeth out to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear and is not dismayed Neither turneth he back from the sword The quiver rattleth against him The flashing spear and the javelin He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rageIt really captured the beauty and power of the racehorseto me the movie was worth going for those scenes alone.The movie did contain inaccuracies and omissions for example I found it humorous that Pancho Martin the trainer was featured as if he were Sham's owner trading barbs directly with Penny  where were Sham's owners? And that the movie made it appear that Sham won the Wood Memorial when Angle Light was the victor and that the coin toss over Secretariat was presented in a highly simplified manner. However I do understand that Disney had to simplify the story line so as not to confuse the average viewer especially after spending 20 minutes trying to explain to my husband the complexities of the way Secretariat was actually acquired in the famous coin toss. To me it wasn't at all surprising that Disney developed the movie in the way they did. When I first noticed a movie was coming out about Secretariat my immediate thought was  What is there to say? I wondered what there could be in the story with which a typical American movie goer could identify. This was no story of an underdog who came out of nowhere if such an amazing horse was going to come in to being it happened exactly in the way anyone would expecta colt with the bloodlines of some of the best Thoroughbreds in the entire world bred by wealthy people in Kentucky and Virginia. Secretariat was two year old Horse of the Year and part of a racing stable that had the previous years Kentucky Derby and Preakness winnerRiva Ridge. No surprises in this story. It was clever to develop the story angle focusing on his owner Penny Chenery and her struggles against adversity as she brought Secretariat to the races.I was initially no fan of Secretariat's while he was racingI was rooting for Sham all through the triple crown races and at the time often felt like the only one who wanted Sham to win. I worked at a riding stable in Virginia at the time and it seemed everyone was a huge fan of Secretariat  there was so much hype and excitement over him. All you heard in the media was about the big red machine and how invincible he was. So for me it was a breath of fresh air to hear about this horse from California named Sham who could be a worthy opponent for Secretariat. Secretariat seemed too beautiful and perfect and I resented the fact that everyone was calling him by Man O' War's old nickname Big Red.I admired Sham's tremendous spirit. Perhaps I was also partial because Sham is the name of the Godolphin Arabian in Marguerite Henry's books after all I was 13. There's been much made in reviews of the movie over how Frank Pancho Martin came across as the bad guy because of all his boasting about Sham. It is true that he did boast about Sham but for those of us who were fans of the horse and were weary of hearing all the time about Big Red it was absolutely delightful I for one loved it. The truth is the real underdog in the SecretariatSham competition was Sham. I'm not at all surprised that Pancho's boasting was spun out of proportion in the movie to make him appear villainous because the moviemakers had to jump through hoops to make the real underdogs appear like the villains. Let's face it  Sham's owners and trainers may not have had quite the wealth and connections of Secretariat's team  it's possible you could find a much more riveting rags to riches story in Pancho's background than in Penny Chenery's she was an heiress after all. Amidst the onslaught of publicity over the superhorse Secretariat to me Pancho stood like a David against Goliath passionately defending his own amazing horse. In addition Sham was racing on the West Coast when the very best racehorses supposedly raced on the East coast. Sham was not blessed with Secretariat's charisma or beauty  but he was a kind extremely game horse. Though I will admit even given all that Sham was not a perfect underdog because he too just like Secretariat was bred at Clairborne Farms in Kentucky. Though I was and will always be a fan of Sham when I saw Secretariat blow the rest of the field away in the Belmont Stakes winning by 31 lengths I was overcome with a sense of awe at having witnessed a once in a lifetime demonstration of searing power speed and beauty. And I fell under Secretariat's spell and became a fan of his as well.I'm glad Disney made this movie  they did a nice job. It's one that the whole family can enjoy.".

To me it wasn't at all surprising that Disney developed the movie in the way they did. When I first noticed a movie was coming out about Secretariat my immediate thought was  What is there to say? I wondered what there could be in the story with which a typical American movie goer could identify. This was no story of an underdog who came out of nowhere if such an amazing horse was going to come in to being it happened exactly in the way anyone would expecta colt with the bloodlines of some of the best Thoroughbreds in the entire world bred by wealthy people in Kentucky and Virginia. Secretariat was two year old Horse of the Year and part of a racing stable that had the previous years Kentucky Derby and Preakness winnerRiva Ridge. No surprises in this story. It was clever to develop the story angle focusing on his owner Penny Chenery and her struggles against adversity as she brought Secretariat to the races.I was initially no fan of Secretariat's while he was racingI was rooting for Sham all through the triple crown races and at the time often felt like the only one who wanted Sham to win. I worked at a riding stable in Virginia at the time and it seemed everyone was a huge fan of Secretariat  there was so much hype and excitement over him. All you heard in the media was about the big red machine and how invincible he was. So for me it was a breath of fresh air to hear about this horse from California named Sham who could be a worthy opponent for Secretariat. Secretariat seemed too beautiful and perfect and I resented the fact that everyone was calling him by Man O' War's old nickname Big Red.I admired Sham's tremendous spirit. Perhaps I was also partial because Sham is the name of the Godolphin Arabian in Marguerite Henry's books after all I was 13. There's been much made in reviews of the movie over how Frank Pancho Martin came across as the bad guy because of all his boasting about Sham. It is true that he did boast about Sham but for those of us who were fans of the horse and were weary of hearing all the time about Big Red it was absolutely delightful I for one loved it. The truth is the real underdog in the SecretariatSham competition was Sham. I'm not at all surprised that Pancho's boasting was spun out of proportion in the movie to make him appear villainous because the moviemakers had to jump through hoops to make the real underdogs appear like the villains. Let's face it  Sham's owners and trainers may not have had quite the wealth and connections of Secretariat's team  it's possible you could find a much more riveting rags to riches story in Pancho's background than in Penny Chenery's she was an heiress after all. Amidst the onslaught of publicity over the superhorse Secretariat to me Pancho stood like a David against Goliath passionately defending his own amazing horse. In addition Sham was racing on the West Coast when the very best racehorses supposedly raced on the East coast. Sham was not blessed with Secretariat's charisma or beauty  but he was a kind extremely game horse. Though I will admit even given all that Sham was not a perfect underdog because he too just like Secretariat was bred at Clairborne Farms in Kentucky. Though I was and will always be a fan of Sham when I saw Secretariat blow the rest of the field away in the Belmont Stakes winning by 31 lengths I was overcome with a sense of awe at having witnessed a once in a lifetime demonstration of searing power speed and beauty. And I fell under Secretariat's spell and became a fan of his as well.I'm glad Disney made this movie  they did a nice job. It's one that the whole family can enjoy.";

I was really only interested in the story of the horse which by the end of the movie I found more interesting to read about on wikipedia.

The actors all have a great body of work but adding this movie didn't do much to uplift their career but probably only their bank account. Not that I blame them but the direction just didn't get the best out of these otherwise fine actors. It's not worth the time just skip this movie and go enjoy Sea Biscuit all over again.

	schema:headline " Horse Movies and other enjoyable clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "Horse racing and horses in general has never really interested me. Really when a horse and Disney come together we can be sure we're in for a feel good slightly clichd film with lots of life lessons along the way. Now this may sound cynical which I suppose it is but you can't say that I'm wrong. There's nothing intrinsically wrong about the use of clichs and riddling a film with life lessons but it can be sticky. There have also been a lot and I mean a lot! of horse racing movies involving the unbelievable odds against the horse and the unshaken perseverance of the owner. Now for some reason these horse movies usually turn out as enjoyable fun if not new experiences. Can Secretariat bring anything new whatsoever to the dusty yet still wellvarnished table of horse racing movies? No. Does Secretariat fall into unfortunate horse racing clichs such as slow motion intrusive music anthropomorphic animals and dumb wise sayings for the main character? Yes. It does all of these things. However like its tired old predecessors Secretariat succeeds for the most part in being a shallow yet enjoyable and cute movie.We all know the story. After Penny Tweedy's father dies she takes over his farm and raises a horse named Big Red who goes on to become the greatest racing horse that ever lived so we don't need to get into that. Diane Lane plays the aforementioned Mrs. Tweedy and her performance is acceptable if not a little contrived. John Malkovich plays Lucien Laurin the horse's trainer. Laurin wears bright and tactless colors along with unfashionable hats. His whole demeanor celebrates the eccentric. Malkovich was probably the only actor who could have done this role with such zaniness and subtlety. The first shots of Malkovich feature him attempting to hit golf balls on the driving range. His swing teeters on the edge of hopelessness and we can tell immediately that he has no business in retirement. This man should be out training horses. Penny comes to him offering a job and Laurin has no business saying No but of course he does. After much deliberation on his part he finally agrees to take the job and the so the story begins. Malkovich is as wonderful as ever and the film wouldn't be nearly as entertaining without him. John Malkovich is a treasured performer.Now this is a perfectly harmless film that is meant for escapism purposes only. The film never gets to deep and doesn't explore in depth the dynamics of horse racing or the psyche of our main character Mrs. Tweedy and what motivates her. The film strives to be nothing but a fell good movie and it accomplishes just that. While we're watching it we fell good for the most part. This movie makes no boasts about being deep or intellectual or thought provoking. Secretariat lives to entertain its audience and for the most part it does. I was entertained. People in the theater around me seemed entertained. Truth be told it is not a great movie nor can we expect it to be. Sometimes pure feel good movies do become great movies but for the most part they ignite the shallowest of human emotions such as love hate and sorrow. All of these thrive in Secretariat as they should. It tells a sweet and gentle typically Disney story that just keeps us lightly amused and entertained throughout its two hours and three minutes. I think this generic formula works pretty well. So is the movie good? Yes. Is it original? Big fat NO! My main problems with the movie are more technical. I hated the musical score. I just wish that for once Hollywood would cut out the dramatic intrusive invasive music at climax points and stop telling us how to feel! We shouldn't have to be told how to feel by big booming and thunderous musical notes. If a movie can't do this without such a pretentious score then it is not succeeding. The incidental musical score was also a big problem for me in this years Inception a film I liked very much except for this small point. I also can't stand slow motion. Every film since Chariots of Fire has insisted on slowing down the final moments of a race to show the winner run like molasses threw the finish line. This has become a ridiculously overused clich in film making and it must be stopped NOW! The next slow runner I see on screen will cause convulsion to seize my body. I am so sick and tired of slow motion in racing movies. Haven't we had enough? End rant . . . Other flaws in the film include the anthropomorphism of the horse. Look the horse doesn't know what's really going on and horses don't pose and their owner can't peer deep into their souls by looking quietly into their eyes. This is another horse movie clich that unfortunately Secretariat revels in. I assure all of you animists out there that no horse has ever had a reasonable thought and it certainly has no soul. That's just a fact of life. Why Hollywood and Disney in particular insists on making these animals as human as possible baffles me. I have not ever do not now and will not ever understand this folly of animal movies. Maybe it's to get the audience to cry! Anyway despite its many flaws Secretariat wants to entertain us and succeeds most of the time. A few clichs could have been avoided along with some technical errors and perhaps the film takes a little too long to finish but for the most part I liked the movie. I think most people will like the movie unless they're really really curmudgeons. And a note to Randall Wallace you are a talented man who makes good wholesome wellmeaning spiritual movies. Yes I include Braveheart here as well.www.colewebbharter.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rare case of a Hollywood movie being far less exciting that the real events that comprise its storyline.I saw each of Secretariat's triple crown races on TV when they happened. My wife is a former horse owner and she was dieing to see this movie. And we both sat in front of the screen stunned. To be fair there was excellent acting by John Malkovich and good acting by Fred Thompson and the actor who plays jockey Ron Turcotte. But most of the other actors just stood around looking embarrassed and uncertain of what to do with themselves as they recited clichd lines. Most of the scenes involving Penny Chenery's family and professional problems had all the passion and realism of a Mr. Ed episode.What happened? Well the direction and screenplaydialog of Secretariat are awful. Not just a normal sort of awful. I mean historically epicly awful. Some of the scenes in this movie are at the general level of The Swarm  one of the worst movies ever made.First problem Secretariat is not seen very often in this movie. His winning string of races as a twoyear old that made him Horse of the Year are not shown instead we hear a track announcer announcing the name of the winning horse Secretariat! Secretariat! over and over again. Hmmm that must have helped with the movie budget.Instead we see many scenes with Penny's family. Penny has four children an antiwar protester hippie daughter and three children that are not the hippie daughter. The hippie daughter looks and acts like a Brady Bunch daughter or a Hannah Montana character with absolutely no hint of drugs sex or dirty loose clothes. She and her hippie friends spray paint signs for protest rallies the sign we can see says Make MusicNot War ooh that's realistic. I guess Make Love Not War was too edgy for the creative geniuses behind this historical epic.I genuinely like Diane Lane but she is either miscast as the tough owner of Secretariat or she received bad direction. She has no growl in her voice and very little iron in her demeanor. Her character makes a string of snap decisions each of which is portrayed as requiring an incredible leap of faith  and every decision is eventually revealed to have been absolutely correct and absolutely essential. For example she makes one momentous decision by staring into Secretariat's eyes for about 10 seconds. Everyone of these scenes is acted and filmed in a way that comes across as unconvincing and contrived.Whenever the script over a fouryear period needs to have Penny interact with journalists the same two actors playing reporters are always used no matter whether the scene is in Virginia Kentucky NYC or upstate New York. I kept thinking of a grade school play where two kids are assigned the roles of reporters and keep exiting and entering the stage in different scenes.The background music often detracts from the action especially a totally jarring blast of black gospel music at the movies' climax. And AfricanAmericans in the 1970s? They are depicted as characters out of Amos  Andy like Buckwheat in Spanky  the Gang.Many scenes appear to have been shot with only two cameras. In scenes with Penny's husband and brother the actors look like they are nursing a hangover as they deliver their lines and then stand around looking like they want to vomit. And the plot takes significant liberties with the facts. In real life Penny divorced her husband soon after Secretariat wins the triple crown. Too edgy for this script I guess. And the plot centers on a fictionalized situation in which Penny struggles to sell breeding shares in Secretariat to literally 'save the farm but in real life the breeding shares for Secretariat sold like hotcakes and Penny played no role in selling them. Its a shame because the movie fails to do justice to reallife events that were genuinely dramatic and moving  and then relies on fictionalized situations for its storyline.If you enjoy Plan 9 from Outer Space and My Motherthe Car then I recommend this movie to you.".

	schema:headline " Secretariat no Seabiscuit";
	schema:reviewBody "With high hopes I went to see the movie Secretariat. I was completely optimistic after some years before seeing the movie Seabiscuit that this would be a winner. You see I am not a horse person. I do not have pictures hanging all over my house of horses running in the surf do not own a horse do not scream and run off the road whenever seeing one from the car do not have to ride them and do not have to try and feed treats to every equestrian animal that may cross my path. So when Seabiscuit came out it was with some reservations that I even went. I thought 'another dang horse lover movie.in which some chick would cry when her horsy went fast' I must say I was humbled. Seabiscuit completely took me by surprise.As the movie developed as the characters were developed I laughed cried and was surprised shocked and totally entertained though out the movie. At the end I stood and gave a standing ovation. OK OK I liked it really good.OK? Well I thought now here comes a movie about Secretariat.I have actually more than once went to the horse park in Lexington KY. Now the reader might say how could a he man horse hater like you possibly go to the horse park? For anyone that does not know the horse park is kind of like a 'Six Flags over Texas' for horses. Every breed of horse is there you can ride them learn about them and just see them in their natural habitat. Why did I go?? Mostly because of the movie Seabiscuit you see I wanted to learn about the great race horses who they were and what they accomplished. It is there 'Man o War' is buried. His story is amazing and yes there is the story of Seabiscuit and of course Secretariat. 'Man o War' was hands down the greatest race horse ever to be born but the close second was Secretariat. So armed with my knowledge of this history it was with high hopes that I walked into the movies last night. How could you possibly screw up a story of the perhaps second greatest race horse that ever lived? Well you can and they didWhere do I start? There was no character development. It seems each person in the movie just appeared out of no where with any knowledge of their background. They would appear and then disappear then reappear to do a scene in the movie. Then there was the ultimate message that was woven throughout the moviethat is all men are assholes. Every single man introduced in the film apparently hated women thought they were stupid were liars bullies weird wimps back stabbers disloyal senile or just wanted to try and insult our heroin in some way. As I recall the only nice guy died halfway through the film. So it was left in the script for the central female character to deal with all the male assholes around her and help her horsy to be allowed to race in spite of all the fearful men trying to stop her. I have never watched such a he woman man hater movie in all my life. I mean 'Sex in the City 2' was bad but it was kind of like all men were stupid and the women were shallow as a saucer but it did not go after every single male in the script to make them look like jerks. Not so with Secretariat.They even screwed up the horse raceshow can you screw that up?? There is nothing more dramatic than watching a horse race in person. Watching one in a movie can be exciting as well but in this movie it seems all they wanted to show was how dirty the jockey would get when riding. Then there was a bunch of camera shots by apparently someone that had never filmed a horse race. Random shots of horses running around the track and yes be sure and show just how dirty the jockey was. I should also mention the totally weird relationship the woman in the movie had with her husband. She ran the horse farm and he was a lawyer in Colorado. As a man in the movie he was a jerkasshole of course but she spent most of her time telling him he was not going to tell her what to do. They seemed to have a strained relationship at best. Just to give an example every person seems to understand the Kentucky Derby is one of the biggest races each year. If I with my disdain of horses in general had a spouse with a horse running in the Derby it would be heaven hell or high water before I would miss something like that. It is like the super bowl of horse racing. Her husband never even showed up. No show for Belmont and then brought the whole family for the Preakness for some weird reason. I was so irritated by that time I wanted to tear up their tickets and make them sit in the car for the race.So lets see how do I break this downBad script bad story development bad editing poor character development all men jerks all women good oh yes in the midst of this car wreck there was something about a race horse named Secretariat but in the course of the 'accident' I seemed to forget exactly what that was aboutWait for the DVD rent it at Redbox for 1 take it home break it in pieces or burn it to roast marshmallows at least you might get some positive interaction from the movie and not have to be subjected or save someone else from being subjected to two hours of torture.".

So when Seabiscuit came out it was with some reservations that I even went. I thought 'another dang horse lover movie.in which some chick would cry when her horsy went fast' I must say I was humbled. Seabiscuit completely took me by surprise.As the movie developed as the characters were developed I laughed cried and was surprised shocked and totally entertained though out the movie. At the end I stood and gave a standing ovation. OK OK I liked it really good.OK? Well I thought now here comes a movie about Secretariat.I have actually more than once went to the horse park in Lexington KY. Now the reader might say how could a he man horse hater like you possibly go to the horse park? For anyone that does not know the horse park is kind of like a 'Six Flags over Texas' for horses. Every breed of horse is there you can ride them learn about them and just see them in their natural habitat. Why did I go?? Mostly because of the movie Seabiscuit you see I wanted to learn about the great race horses who they were and what they accomplished. It is there 'Man o War' is buried. His story is amazing and yes there is the story of Seabiscuit and of course Secretariat. 'Man o War' was hands down the greatest race horse ever to be born but the close second was Secretariat. So armed with my knowledge of this history it was with high hopes that I walked into the movies last night. How could you possibly screw up a story of the perhaps second greatest race horse that ever lived? Well you can and they didWhere do I start? There was no character development. It seems each person in the movie just appeared out of no where with any knowledge of their background. They would appear and then disappear then reappear to do a scene in the movie. Then there was the ultimate message that was woven throughout the moviethat is all men are assholes. Every single man introduced in the film apparently hated women thought they were stupid were liars bullies weird wimps back stabbers disloyal senile or just wanted to try and insult our heroin in some way. As I recall the only nice guy died halfway through the film. So it was left in the script for the central female character to deal with all the male assholes around her and help her horsy to be allowed to race in spite of all the fearful men trying to stop her. I have never watched such a he woman man hater movie in all my life. I mean 'Sex in the City 2' was bad but it was kind of like all men were stupid and the women were shallow as a saucer but it did not go after every single male in the script to make them look like jerks. Not so with Secretariat.They even screwed up the horse raceshow can you screw that up?? There is nothing more dramatic than watching a horse race in person. Watching one in a movie can be exciting as well but in this movie it seems all they wanted to show was how dirty the jockey would get when riding. Then there was a bunch of camera shots by apparently someone that had never filmed a horse race. Random shots of horses running around the track and yes be sure and show just how dirty the jockey was. I should also mention the totally weird relationship the woman in the movie had with her husband. She ran the horse farm and he was a lawyer in Colorado. As a man in the movie he was a jerkasshole of course but she spent most of her time telling him he was not going to tell her what to do. They seemed to have a strained relationship at best. Just to give an example every person seems to understand the Kentucky Derby is one of the biggest races each year. If I with my disdain of horses in general had a spouse with a horse running in the Derby it would be heaven hell or high water before I would miss something like that. It is like the super bowl of horse racing. Her husband never even showed up. No show for Belmont and then brought the whole family for the Preakness for some weird reason. I was so irritated by that time I wanted to tear up their tickets and make them sit in the car for the race.So lets see how do I break this downBad script bad story development bad editing poor character development all men jerks all women good oh yes in the midst of this car wreck there was something about a race horse named Secretariat but in the course of the 'accident' I seemed to forget exactly what that was aboutWait for the DVD rent it at Redbox for 1 take it home break it in pieces or burn it to roast marshmallows at least you might get some positive interaction from the movie and not have to be subjected or save someone else from being subjected to two hours of torture.";

Thank heavens there were a couple of well done racing scenes.

It was so nonfactual as to be ridiculous. There was no mention of the fact that Penny Chenery and Meadow Stables and Ron Turcotte had the Derby winner Riva Ridgethe year before Secretariat. They wanted you to believe that Penny could get a phone call in Colorado in the middle of summer while poolside and make it to Virginia to be there for the birth of Secretariat in March with her trainer and the groom by her side. They gave Ron Turcotte a southern accent I have met the man and he has a beautiful FrenchCanadian lilt to his voice. There was too much time wasted on the Marcia Brady like character of Penny's daughter and not enough racing scenes. The Preakness was shown on a small home TV for Heaven's sake!And the worst was that they wanted you to believe that Keeneland race course was Belmont Park Aqueduct and Saratoga. The music was terrible I can't believe they played that dumb gospel song during the finale of Secretariat's heartstopping Belmont triumph. And while they did have the best part of the greatest race call ever Secretariat is moving like a tremendous machine it was barely audible in the background. Why oh why could they not just have let the race speak for itself. Please people go watch the actual race on you tube. It will give you goose bumps. OK so maybe as such a big fan I have over analyzed the detailsbut that being said go see the movie anyway. If it brings the excitement of racing and the spirit of Big Red to just one viewer then I guess it will be worth it. For my part I will just watch Seabiscuit a great racing movie over again.".

The Script is full of absurd dialog  it turned good actors in to rotten ones. Everything that Seabiscuit was this film was not. I couldn't believe how many good actors were involved in this film. Diane Lane was completely miscast  you don't believe for a second she actually has any idea about horses even though the character grew up wthem.

The Script is full of absurd dialog  it turned good actors in to rotten ones. Everything that Seabiscuit was this film was not. I couldn't believe how many good actors were involved in this film. Diane Lane was completely miscast  you don't believe for a second she actually has any idea about horses even though the character grew up wthem.

Since that day 37 years ago the mystique of that horse Big Red has only grown in my heart. I still cannot watch Secretariat run that day without tears coming to my eyes. Thank god that U Tube exists and I can watch every race that wondrous stallion ran and see footage of him running in his paddock filled with himself and his power. I don't know about Man of War but I do know about Secretariat and I have a hard time believing there was ever a greater Racehorse than he.When I learned that a film was coming out about Secretariat I could only hope it would do him justice. I am not a great fan of the genre of sport films with 'Raging Bull' being one of the few exceptions. All I felt I could hope for was that they would not demean the memory of the great Secretariat. I have waited until the film showed at my favorite local cinema to view it.I was planning to see it on the day that the equally wondrous filly Zenyatta was attempting to conclude her remarkable racing career by winning the Breeders Cup Classic for the second year in a row a feat almost as remarkable as Secretariat breaking the record for a 1  mile race by 2 25 seconds a record which still stands and which will not be broken at least in my lifetime. I would like to think that Zenyatta is a candidate for another equestrian cinema biography.When Zenyatta made another of her great stretch runs from far behind not unlike Big Red's usual mode of running but this time came up a nose short I found myself again in tears and unable to go see 'Secretariat'. But the next day I decided to see 'Secretariat..' I'm glad I saw it and while it is certainly not perfect and is a Disney product with designs to sell it as a Christian media event the story is actually accurate from what I know to the achievement that Secretariat Penny Chenery Ron Turcotte and Lucien Laurin were able to pull off.Diane Lane and John Malkovich were really fine. I wondered how Secretariat would come across. In the film he's a cipher just as he was in my mind in real life. How was he able to accomplish what he did in the Belmont Stakes? We'll never know.So here's to the film makers for not totally screwing up Secretariat's life as they did with that Seabiscuit film..Long Live King Secretariat Big Red and Long Live Queen Zenyatta!!".

Having read several books on Secretariat I was well familiar with owner trainer jockey and horse but I was curious how Disney was going to portray them on film. They made a pretty but very flawed movie.Generallyspeaking they did all of the major players favors by making them all  Penny Tweedy Lucien Laurin Ron Turcotte and Secretariat  look very good. Laurin and Turcotte by the way sounded and acted totally different in real life. The worst hatchet job was on Pancho Martin the owner of Sham Secretariat's Triple Crown rival. In real life Pancho was nowhere near as arrogant and nasty as portrayed on film.Although Diane Lane is fine as Penny Tweedy I thought John Malkovich as the most interesting. Malkovich has a habit of getting our attention no matter what role he plays on screen. As with most horse stories i.e.Seabiscuit Dreamer etc. these stories are beautifullyfilmed as this Disney effort is no exception.The only thing that bothered me was making the story primarily about Mrs. Tweedy instead of the horse. Calling Mrs. Tweedy a hero for sticking to her guns and keeping faith that Secretariat would turn out to be a champion is wrong too. Excuse me but a mother who stays away from her three kids and husband for long stretches to tend to a horse is not admirable much less a hero. Her family is what she should have been concerned with first not a horse. I'm not surprised Disney turned the story into feminist propaganda.Yet in all being a horse racing and Secretariat fan I enjoyed it.".

The acting cinematography music and story are great and hold up after repeat viewings. The Beach is one of those movies that I watch once a year as its enjoyability never decreases. This is a very solid film that will no doubt only increase in its popularity as time goes by as fans of The Beach are quite hardcore. Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.

When in Bangkok he meets the slightly deranged Daffy who leaves him with stories and a map to a beach on a remote island that can't be seen from the sea.  Taking with him 2 French travellers Richard sets out to reach the island and finds it inhabited by a mix of people living as a small ideallic community.  However internal conflicts rise up with their arrival and a copy of the map that he gave to some friends threaten to expose the paradise community for it's darker roots.While I know that the critics were a little hard on this film when it came out my main reason for not going to see it was a feeling of total apathy towards it.  I wasn't interested in the story have never read the book and didn't feel I had to see it because of either the big name star or the famous British team behind it.  On television for free though is a different matter and I gave it a go.  Firstly the film does look great I know there are tales of environmental damage to the area but it does look like paradise and is very lush.  Director Boyle's direction is visually good too  whether it be drawing style from scenes or contrasting the city with the island or doing imaginative things like computer game style images he does work well.The plot is good on paper but isn't as well brought through.  Richard's journey and initial settling into the island is involving and interesting but the main plot is really in the second half which is also where it becomes a weaker film. The film clearly is building into a teenage Hearts of Darkness type story where the DIY civilisation leads to cruelty and madness  this aim can be seen in an early scene where tourists sit watching Apocalypse Now in a waiting area.  However his descent into madness is less well done and less convincing than Brando's.  It all happens to quickly and although with brutal consequences it really needed to be seen to be more of a gradual distancing from the norm rather than a sudden leap into an abyss.DiCaprio is not an actor that I particularly like or enjoy to watch but he is pretty good here.  The fact that this film did as well as it did in terms of box office is probably mostly down to his star power but he also gives a good performance.  His madness is well portrayed and it's not his fault the film requires him to suddenly switch the way he does.  Swinton is better as Sal her madness' is more subtle and is continual rather than sudden.  The mix of multinational unknowns in the support roles are all good  even if with so many good looking young people it does feel a little like a music video shoot at times.Overall I enjoyed the film even if it never got as involving as I hoped it would.  The story lacks punch and point  a fact that can be seen in a very weak ending which was a real wash out in my opinion  but it is still good enough to watch once.  The whole thing looks great and DiCaprio's star power and charisma helps keep the audience with him it's just that the actual story doesn't quite have the rich feeling or depth that the touristfilm location does.".

He's good at playing the boyish cocky immature type. He's also good at narration which he provides here as he has in a number of other films. In fact I wish there were more of it in here.French actress Virginie Ledoyen is a new face to me and a pretty one. I found her intriguing and not just because of her face Actually all the characters were pretty darn interesting in this film and you get a varied group.The scenery from Thailand is magnificent. By the way the beach that's in this film really exists just as it's seen here. The story is interesting too for the full two hours. My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language particularly with all the fwords.Don't listen to those national critics who blasted this. I think you'll be entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to this one knowing that it could be crap but hey I do not care what others think and once again this way of thinking did not prove me wrong.This flick is basically about a young twenty who goes away on a trip to Thailand by himself because he wants to forget his past. There he meets a loony Robert Carlyle who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers Franoise Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way and Etienne Guillaume Canet to come and join them.After they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.This is the plain storyline of the movie but there is so much more to it it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there but the way it was brought over never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.Yet this film is not flawless it was good entertainment over all yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end but in the middle when Richard Leonardo DiCaprio loses it so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird too long and too incomprehensible in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not. It could have been so much better but I guess it had to be.NO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!7 out of 10P.S. Don't agree????? sue me!!!!!!!!!!! or mail me see above".

	schema:reviewBody "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Warning! Contains spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Beach is a Danny Boyle film. In it's first week of release enough people paid to see The Beach to cover over   of Leonardo DiCaprio's paycheque for his first major role since 1997's Titanic and it would be safe to say that the majority of those paying customers were disappointed. I believe this is a safe guess because I was one of those people. I have yet to read a positive review of the film and the best my friends could come up with was It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be'. Sadly I had to agree.The thing is I wanted so badly to love this film. I had read the book and loved it I had seen Boyle's previous work and loved it Yes I even loved A Life Less Ordinary and I wanted nothing more than to prove to all the naysayers that The Beach would rise above the stench of the usual February release crowd and be remembered as one of the best films of the year. I went to see The Beach for a second time. The film may not appear on any yearend top ten lists to vindicate my faith but on second viewing The Beach became a Danny Boyle film. Those who are familiar with 1994's Trainspotting will understand that this is a compliment of the highest regard. Adapted from Alex Garland's 1997 first novel of the same name The Beach follows Richard DiCaprio an admittedly brash young American backpacker who escapes to Thailand to find something. Richard is a fairly vague guy. In fact all he gives us is his name what else do you need to know?'. Is he looking for himself? For Love? What he does find is Daffy a manic Robert Carlyle. He finds him on the floor of the neighboring hostel room with his wrists slit  the blood covering the walls and bed in such a fashion as to leave no doubt that the act was committed with purpose and joy?. The previous evening Daffy tells Richard about a beach  a real paradise of mythical beauty. The following morning Richard finds a map on his door. What is most immediately jarring to anyone who has read the book is the decision to make Richard an American instead of a Brit. This does change a couple of things for one we miss the joy of Zeph and Sammy  the two American tourists whom Richard unfortunately or fortunately invites to paradise'.With Richard as an American we Canadians are deprived of a wellneeded slap in the face In the film Sammy and Zeph are our stereotypical arrogant American surf dudes. In the book the surf act was just that It's a protest against bigotry' Zeph explained. Europeans think all Americans are stupid so we act stupid to confirm your prejudices. Then we reveal ourselves as  intelligent and by doing so subvert the prejudice more effectively than an immediate barrage of intellect  which only causes confusion and ultimately resentment.' 45 How pleasant it might have been to sit in a Canadian audience and listen as the trap is sprung. Still the most important thing about Richard Zeph and Sammy is intact. They are not the only things that lead to the end of paradise but they are a symbol for all that shows us that paradise is not possible. They are Americans and they are a plague. In fact the film is telling us that we all are but for some it may be easier to keep the blame centered on our favourite target. The Beach is not an antiAmerican film. It is an antiConsumerism film. And we are all targets.  We see this in many telling scenes not the least of which involves Richard preparing to leave the island for food  taking orders from the entire multicultural beach community of what to bring back from civilization to their paradise'. Here's what's brought into paradise' Bleach for an Australian girl who doesn't like her dark hair rubber gloves for the Eastern European cook who is tired of smelling like fish and requests soap something toxic something industrial' to solve the problem and batteries for those on the island including Richard who won't accept a paradise without Nintendo. Paradise' has its problems. Paradise' will not survive because once it is found it is lost.As Richard's time on the beach passes he finds something again. The only thing he ever finds  he finds twice. Daffy begins to appear to Richard in the latter part of the film. Daffy knows why he left the beach and he tells Richard. He doesn't tell us. But we soon understand. Perhaps the most common complaint I've heard about The Beach includes some comment on the studio system and how it destroys the independent genius of someone like Danny Boyle. Maybe it does. It's quite possible that 20th Century Fox wanted Leo they wanted Leo to be an American they wanted Leo's character to sleep with no fewer than two beautiful female characters and they wanted a happy ending'. It's possible that Boyle consented. It's possible that he subverted the whole process. On the recommendation of a friend I went to see The Beach for a second time and what I saw was brave. What I saw was Danny Boyle winking at me from behind the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard sits in an internet caf looking at a photo from paradise'  I saw Boyle's version of Zeph and Sammy. He sprung the trap on us. Upon first viewing the ending is a copout a flippantly stupid wrapup that says it's okay to fall to the absolute depths of selfimposed degridation because we'll always have a few happy memories to cover the fall'. Richard's words tell us that he still believes in paradise' but his eyes tell us something else. This is Boyle's triumph Richard's eyes tell us what they now know that there is no such thing.  God knows we're lonely souls' begin the lyrics to the song that plays over the closing credits and we know that Richard is now the loneliest of them all. Danny Boyle's The Beach follows last year's The Matrix and Fight Club showing us what we don't want to see that there is no use looking for paradise because there is no paradise left   it's left us  we've repelled it. It is too late for Richard to save his beach because he believes it can be saved from Zeph and Sammy he doesn't know that the reason it can't be saved is because he's already there  the poison has already begun to spread. But he learns and we learn as The Beach reminds us of what we all too often are Cancers parasites eatingup the whole ing world'.".

One of those things in my book is a fact. They did wreck an island and for pure entertainment it's not worth it. Still the bad reviews from the critics I disagree with I found this quite a little gem and if you agree with some of my other reviews I recommend you don't hesitate when you see The Beach sitting on the drama shelf of your video store.The wonders of modern technology like computers video games cell phones pagers and the internet were designed to make our lives more enjoyable and facilitate communications. Yet for many the complexity of the digital world is overwhelming leading to a feeling of unrealityof being discconected. The desire to find something real  to connect with something or someone  is what drives Richard Leonardo DiCaprio a young American backpacker who arrives in Thailand with adventure on his mind. Travel he asserts is the search for experience the quest for something different. Richard and two friends Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet he meets in Thailand risk their lives travelling secret that is dubbed the beach resort for those who don't like beach resorts. At their destination Richard and friends are welcomed into a community that lives on the beach.

DiCaprio shows on his face how successful he is when he did the film and he is a showoff. But darn it all DiCaprio is good because we know he has the potential. He went a long length to do this movie even director's favourite Ewan McGregor was passed over for DiCaprio and rightfully so. I just can't picture anyone else playing the role. The acting hotline is also boiling with such talents as Tilda Swinton Virginie Ledoyen and the masterful Robert Carlyle. Danny Boyle's direction is solid and he paces the film nicely and the script is adapted well from Alex Garland's betterthanmovie book. The film certainly has flaws some scenes  particularly the ones with the dope growers  are just plain stupid and the film really loses it's feet towards the end going completely out of control.Still The Beach is a film that is ripe for discussion. It features alluring scenery from the small island of Phuket it has some striking visuals and an absorbing and intense message about finding your own paradise. It's not the best film of 2000 but The Beach remains a worthy attempt.".

When it first came out it was DiCaprio's presence that caused me not to watch it and after watching him grow as an actor over the last 15 years DiCaprio is what got me curious enough to give it a try.DiCaprio plays Richard a tourist who hates the tourist traps he can afford in Thailand. A guy in Richard's hotel named Daffy for appropriate reasons  kills himself but first draws a map to an island that he claims is nirvana. Richard convinces two French tourists to come with him and they actually do find a colony of people living outside of any civilization other than the one they have built for their own survival and pleasure. The leader is Sal Tilda Swinton who tells the three that the drug dealers who control the island allow them to stay there but have said there can be no more people joining them  it hurts their chances at having their thriving cannabis business remain undiscovered. Sal says that they can stay but is bothered by the map burns it and asks if they gave a copy to anyone else. Richard lies and says no  he gave it to a group of stoners he met before they got there. Whether they are on their way there or are too drug addled to make the trip Richard does not know. So he figures the lie will hurt nobody.This is basically an adult Lord of the Flies. The lesson it teaches is that no matter where you go unfortunately your human nature and all that comes with it hitches a ride. That is why Richard could easily see the evils of the city but it took some time for problems to arise at the beach. It's just a matter of more humans in one place than another.And who would figure on a story in which armed drug dealers actually turn out to be the good guys probably because they know the truth about human nature better than their nirvana seeking neighbors. To see what I mean watch and find out.".

	schema:reviewBody "HERE BE SPOILERS The Silver Screen adaptation of the popular dystopian backpacker's novel 'The Beach' is perhaps not the most accurate adaptation of the cult book which has become required reading for a whole generation of travellers. Parts of the original book are hardly mentioned in the film while whole sections are completely skipped such as pseudo soldier Jed whose massive role in the book is written out of the screenplay completely. Just as plot parts are removed others are added in their place. Richard's unrequited love of Francoise is replaced by a rapid relationship ending with an all too strange sex scene on between Sal and Richard. Good natured Sal who only wants to preserve village life becomes a sexual predator approaching the level of Sharon Stone as she entraps Richard in her Black Widow clutches. Etienne takes a minor role upon reaching the beach swiftly giving up Francoise and becoming a hermit in the forest with the injured Swede. Many of the more powerful or more controversial scenes from the book are cut from the movie giving the feel that the director was reined in by his funders. References to Vietnam are abbreviated to a single shot of a fan while Richard's reaccuring dreams about Daffy are replaced by a brief sequence toward the end. Perhaps most shockingly of all the books surprise ending truly dystopian in it's screaming climax is replaced by the rather weaker idea of the inhabitants of the beach sailing away on a homemade raft and joining modern society for Cyber Cafes and coffee. Perhaps if this film can be seen as a separate entity altogether from it's written counterpart then it would be a pretty good film. Certainly the CGI beach looks pretty good the acting is of decent quality and the film is not without it's charms. However if even the director Danny Boyle of 'Trainspotting' legend is disappointed with what he made then perhaps this one is best given a miss and relying on the book to do the talking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Entertaining in parts but as a whole it's pure manure.This movie is generally about the sociopath Richard DiCaprioin his elitist pursuit of pleasure sex and holiday paradise. He goes to great length in pursuing this using lies deceit and violence to get what he wants. He gets to know about a secluded Thai beach and makes friends with a french guy and his girlfriend in order to steal the girlfriend from the guy.. The trio finds their paradise on an island that's part occupied by some armed and crazy Thai marijuana farmers and the other part a crazy hippie collective . The hippies are driven by a collective fear of getting their tropical paradise discovered so they use fascistic methods when silencing members of the society to not reveal the secrets of the whereabouts of their beautiful beachself made tropical paradise community.The hippie commune is still a slave to consumerism society and not the alternative society that it is set out to be. Just like Richard the members of the community goes to great length in defending their right to fun and pleasure taking a blind fold to the ones that get hurt and killed in their pursuit. The goal of the commune is elitist and fascist the means of using violence is motivated by keeping out other tourists and people the commune doesn't want out of this beachresort. Richard makes everything he can to do the same things. He is everything that goes bad with the commune inpersonated.. He's not able to feel any empathy or understanding for anyone the only time he openly questions the fascism of the commune is when his own life is on the line in order to save it. In other cases he walks away and still feels good being in paradise. Well the movies meaning wasn't supposed to be about this. The director somehow thought that we should see any kind of sympathy and actually care about what happens to Richard and forgive him for his actions instead he is the only guy in this movie that is actually disgustingly inhumane. Maybe he thought we should have been blazed by the star quality of Di Caprio. But truthfully He is nothing more than a stupid parody of idiotic travellers who think they can behave anyhow they like in any foreign exotic location. The unintentional satire is exaggerating this making him a total psychopath. He is not just a someone who quietly takes orders the nazilike leader of the commune Sal is his peer. The same person but with power.DiCaprios character is somebody you would want the director to have shot off early in the movie. Even if it was the meaning of the director to show DiCaprio as a total ahole this ahole definitely isn't good company for the two hours. This is not the only bad thing about the movie. It's slow scenes extremely bad computer animations and the horribly outdated britpop soundtrack makes it an equally painful experience to watch.The movies ending is nothing but Richard being nostalgic about his beach adventures in his normallife setting not having learned any lesson or gained any emotional strength. The viewer is also encouraged to join his nostalgia for his blood stained paradise. Why go to such great lengths anyway to get away from the mass tourists? Go to the Philipines or any place that isn't as crowded as Thailand. Stupid movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle's The Beach was an awful viewing experience for me and thinking back on it is just as unpleasant so naturally I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about it.The reason that The Beach is so awful is because it is so pretentious and full of itself. It gives a painfully obvious and blatant expression on a social commentary that feels so forced. The Beach is also extremely boring. I was patiently waiting for the movie to pick up but after an hour of pure nothing I gave up hope and assumed that the rest of the film would be just as uneventful. Sadly I was right. The Beach feels like a 2hour long Expedia commercial. The music is cheap and terribly cheesy and the cinematography is sometimes interesting but mostly just dull.Leonardo DiCaprio did give an entertaining performance even though he did overact quite a bit. Tilda Swinton wasn't bad either but the rest of the cast is just so forgettable and boring that it even weighs down these two characters. Robert Carlyle was one of the few redeemable aspects of The Beach. His character was utterly mad and it seemed that he loved playing this character which made him a blast to watch.The story is painfully slow. We have to endure long stretches of Leo's character expressing his obsession for a girl he barely knows then we are suddenly treated to a horrifically graphic shark attack scene. The tone of The Beach is never established. Most of the movie is extremely depressing and generally uncomfortable to watch but then the movie ends on a gleefully happy note as if nothing bad even happened.The best way I can explain The Beach is that it is a confused hyper mess of a film that tackles a social commentary so blatantly obvious that it comes off grossly pretentious. And any time Danny Boyle tries to have fun it comes off as just awkward. While The Beach does have a passionate cult following I simply cannot find enjoyment in the film myself. It's dull pretentious and just messy. I respect Danny Boyle as a film maker but I really don't know what he was hoping to achieve with this one. I'm just grateful that the whole experience was completely forgettable. Another trip to this mind numbing paradise wouldn't be good for my sanity.".

	schema:headline " Travel Narrows the Mind Wonderfully";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since at least the eighteenth century with its cult of the noble savage tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema in films such as The Blue Lagoon or the various versions of Mutiny on the Bounty in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of Lord of the Flies like the William Golding novel on which they are based offer an ironic twist on this theme a tropical island is used as the setting for an antiUtopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.The Beach has certain similarities to Lord of the Flies. The main character is Richard an American backpacker travelling round Thailand who has heard tales of a cooperative multinational community of idealistic young people living on a beach on an island off the coast. Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends but changes his mind when another backpacker Daffy gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found. Undeterred by the fact that Daffy commits suicide shortly afterwards Richard sets out to go there accompanied by Etienne and Francoise a young French couple whom he has befriended.After a number of adventures the three succeed in reaching the island and discover that the fabled community is no urban myth but a reality. At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket lazing about smoking pot or for some obscure reason translating various English phrases into SerboCroat. As with all films of this type however we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems. Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him. More seriously there are flaws in the basic concept of the community.The main flaw is that travel narrows the mind wonderfully. The community mostly Westerners have dropped out of their own societies and travelled halfway around the world to Thailand but find Thai society no more congenial than those they have left behind. Their solution is to drop out of that too and to set up a beach resort for people who don't like beach resorts where they can live their own hedonistic idea of the hippie life. The community is not however selfsufficient they produce little for themselves apart from fish and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis. The island in fact is owned by a group of Thai farmers themselves involved in a much larger cannabisproducing operation who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.As in many antiUtopian parables the community is dominated by a sinister dictatorfigure. Lord of the Flies had the choirboy Jack Animal Farm had Napoleon and The Beach has Sal an upperclass Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community although it is never clear how she attained this position. Sal is obsessed with protecting the community's privacy and secrecy and in order to achieve this end she is prepared to resort to violence even murderous violence. She is deeply suspicious of Richard who she suspects may have distributed further copies of Daffy's map. One of the film's most chilling incidents comes after Christo one of the group is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment but because this might result in the community's existence being revealed to outsiders Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.There is some good acting in the film especially from Tilda Swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as Sal a woman with steely eyes and a cutglass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. This increases the impact of the scene at the end where Sal finally does lose her cool. The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne. Originally seen as a loser the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard Etienne later emerges as the community's voice of conscience the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.It was however unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard was overruled by the studio as Leonardo di Caprio although he is better here than he was in Titanic tends to overact. The film tends to deteriorate in the second half with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard alienated from his fellowmembers of the group starts to become mentally unstable. The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric. Despite its potentially interesting themes The Beach falls just short of being a very good film. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah backpacking across the world . What an exciting thing it is  but only if you're a rare and remarkable person . Travelling all over the world isn't all it's cracked up to be . You might get a one night stand  you might get stoned but to be honest couldn't you have got that at home ? Did you really need to go the ends of the earth for that ? If you're a rare remarkable person you'll also get altitude sickness  suffer dysentery  catch ringworm and under go a rabies scare . You'll have wasted all your money on plane tickets and inoculations and the only thing you'll have to show for it is a small paragraph in the obituary column of the local newspaper after dying from a rare tropical disease THE BEACH is very similar in many ways . It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland  features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why  characterisation Take one American pretty boy  send him in Thailand  stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish  unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart . Did anyone like the characters in this movie ? Neither did I . I haven't read Garland's novel but I'm led to believe there's a scene where a giant squid is washed up on the beach and the characters eat it only to end up with food poisoning . I would have enjoyed this movie much more if all the characters had died from food poisoning . When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problem Another thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz . Something similar happens in another Boyle movie 28 DAYS LATER but at least in that movie you're aware of the character's motive even if it is fairly unconvincing . Here you do find yourself wondering the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor or even if it was excluded at draft stage . Not only that but you find that the characters remain unchanged by events at the end therefore there is zero character development Danny Boyle has said that he makes quintessential British films and it's difficult to disagree with him . TRAINSPOTTING has a strong feel of time and place while 28 DAYS LATER mirrors the British apocalypse writers of the 1950s . THE BEACH with its exotic foreign location and its American star definitely feels like it's made for an American audience and Boyle tries too hard to pander to their taste . That's why THE BEACH is probably Boyle's weakest film to date".

	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning of 2000 everyone waited impatiently the release of the movie the beach mainly because Leonardo DiCaprio was in the main role. You thought that he was going to carry on with dignity following the huge commercial and artistic success of Titanic. But sadly it's not the case. This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment. As far as I'm concerned I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach. Actually my expectation was justified but it only lasts half an hour. When they discover the beach and they adhere to the community I think the movie could have ended there. The second part which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark only plays the role of fillin and spoils all the movie. Moreover Danny Boyle eyes a bit too much towards the bloody.Otherwise to put it mildly is that the dialogs of the beach are few inspired sometimes silly and too convenient with the situations. Sometimes the movie turns out to be too predictable before the love affair between DiCaprio and Ledoyen you guess that a love story will start between them. And inevitably it will cause Canet's jealousy but this jealousy will spread to Ledoyen she learns that DiCaprio had sex with Sal during their stay in Bangkok. Besides the performance appears quite mixed Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio. Another thing I noticed DiCaprio' voiceoff doesn't succeed in making the movie gripping as it was the case with Edward Norton in Fight Club.Then let's admit it the end of the movie seems too easy and conventional. You guess before the end that the perfect paradise doesn't exist on earth and certainly not in Thailand there are sharks it's not always shiny and Sal the leader of the community reveals herself to be despotic and finally cruel. Let's add that the paradise keepers will do anything to protect their territory even to kill...Nevertheless the movie enjoys a shiny photography that reflects brilliantly the color of the sea and the beach. Landscapes are magnificient and there's a good original soundtrack which includes Moby's porcelain. But these qualities aren't sufficient enough to save the movie. A disappointing and predictable movie and somewhere unfinished. You can blame Boyle for not revealing the reasons of Daffy's suicide.".

THE BEACH lacked all the elements that I look for in a movie and that I think makes a movie important. I was really tempted to sneak out of that stupid movie and go see THE TIGGER STORY!Richard Leonardo DiCaprio a young dopeaddicted traveler who is trying to forget his past meets a psycho named Daffy Robert Carlyle who gives him a map to a beautiful islandbeach paradise before committing suicide. Richard along with two more dopeaddicts Sal Tilda Swinton and Franoise Virginie Ledoyen set out to find this beach. What they find is a community living together without the evils of the world struggling to keep their existence a secret so the rest of the world doesn't spoil it. It turns out Richard is the biggest danger to the secret of the community.Sound like it might have a plot. Think again. This movie is completely plotless. At first you may think it's a love story between Leonardo and Tilda but that stop quickly. Then it seems like it is about Leonardo losing his sanity but that quickly comes to an end as well. Then it seems a may be a fight between the community and another group living on the island but that's not the case either. You will wait from the start to the end of this movie for the plot to start but it will never come.Another element this movie lacks in fact probably the only element that is left for a movie with no plot is character development. Leonardo's character in the beginning refuses to talk at all about his past. Godforbid we might actually get to know his character. You'll feel just the same about him in the beginning as you do in the end with no development at all. The rest of the characters are also boring and don't get much better. The acting is nothing special. Leonardo does a fair job but the horrible script prevents me from calling his performance anything great.Unless you're a dedicated Leonardo fan skip THE BEACH. I found it very long boring pointless and not entertaining.".

After meeting her new neighbor Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find son dead in the French country side specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him.

With barely any explanation he is freed and befriends Elsa's mother before settling down to teach Elsa how life goes in cycles via the hatching of the specimens they caught.  Cynics may balk at the Bluebird of Happiness reference when Serrault learns that a specimen sent to him at the outset is in fact the elusive Isabella i.e. the thing he was looking for was right there under his nose all the time if only he'd known it.

	schema:reviewBody "Julien Michel Serrault is a bitter old man in the midst of an emotional desert. His collection of butterflies constitutes his sole passion. One day he makes his new little neighbor's acquaintance Elsa Claire Bouanich visibly neglected by her mother but looks unfavorably on her intrusion in his life. One day he's going to the Alps to try to find a rare species of butterfly the Isabelle and for his greatest pleasure Elsa invited herself to the trip...If you ever want to spend an evening in front of a DVD and if you search for originality then this Philippe Muyl's flick hasn't your name on it. How many times have we seen the eternal recipe of a friendship story between a grumpy old man and a little girl as fresh as a daisy? Making Julien and Elsa go into the Alps to try to discover the Isabelle is a pretext to bring them together and make them know each other. At first it's hostility. At the end complicity prevails. Between the two poles a scheduled psychological evolution. In short on the surface the Butterfly 2002 smells the reheated. However although Muyl has limited talents as a filmmaker the success of Cooking and Dependences 1993 is to be attributed to the tandem JeanPierre BacriAgns Jaoui there's something warm in his work. The presence of the little Claire Bouanich is partly responsible of it. She's so gorgeous of freshness and spontaneity that it would take a heart of stone to resist her. Definitely no Shirley Temple. She sees in Julien the grandfather she would have liked to have and especially an experienced person to take care of her. Getting in contact with him she learns life with its joys and sorrows and her hillwalking is rich in learning lessons so that it's nearly an initiatory travel for her. Beside her Michel Serrault is excellent as usual.Tenderness for his two main characters preposterous explications but adapted to a child's faculties of understanding to bring touches of humor did you know that shooting stars are locks of hair God loses?. Philippe Muyl mixes these two things and by letting oneself slip into this touching story one just has to be charmed along the way and the work is done. And it works rather well. There's a feelgood factor that dominates our minds throughout the projection and sometimes it's comforting to feel this. Moreover the wild beauty of the Alpin countryside is highlighted to add a decent amount of poetry.But probably to avoid a break of tone the director erased as much as possible dramatic sides of the story particularly the hateful misunderstanding according which Julien is suspected to have kidnapped Elsa when she left of her own free will. During the time the two protagonists are in the mountains this point is taken to the back seat and after Elsa fell into the hole and help rescue her Julien is taken to the police station but we can watch him leaving it rather freely without any trouble. Philippe Muyl glossed over this point. Fortunately that doesn't muck up the bliss of the projection but beware Mr Muyl! You came close to disaster! At the end of the road the most cynical ones will only probably see a simpering flick without any real depth and tailor made to furnish an evening in front of the telly. As for the others if you are sick of watching violent or bloody movies  la Kill Bill 20032004 why not having a break with this certainly stereotyped product but so cute which surfs on the wave of unexpected popular movies like une hirondelle a fait le printemps 2001 through the simple philosophy it brings out earth connection a return to the basic pleasures of life.".

This particular chteau has no military value as such but as it is used by many of the Nazi big chiefs destroying it whilst they relax inside will upset the German plans immensely. But can this rag tag band of murderers rapists and thieves shape up into something resembling a fighting force? Their reward should they survive the mission is amnesty but Reisman for sure has his hands full on both sides of the war.One down to the road block we've just begun.. Two the guards are through..

Twelve Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve.. Thirteen Franko goes up without being seen.. Fourteen Zerohour Jimnez cuts the cable Franko cuts the phone.. Fifteen Franko goes in where the others have been.. Sixteen We all come out like it's Halloween....The Dirty Dozen has become one of those films that is a perennial holiday favourite like The Great Escape Zulu and The Magnificent Seven. Which while it most definitely deserves such big exposure it's a little surprising it's part of the holiday viewing schedules given its cynicism and amoral core just one of the many great  intriguing things about Aldrich's testosterone laced movie. Met with mixed reviews on release with the negative side of the fence bemoaning its nasty violence and preposterous plot The Dirty Dozen none the less performed great at the box office where it was the fifth highest grosser of the year and the number one money maker in terms of profit to budget. Coming as it did during the middle of the Vietnam War it was evident that the paying public quite easily bought into the thematics of The Dirty Dozen. Nearly 45 years since it first lured people into the cinema Aldrich's movie shows no sign of age or better stilland more remarkableits enjoyability has not diminished.What makes it a great film then? First off is the allstar macho cast assembled by Aldrich and his team big hitters like Marvin stepping in when John Wayne balked at the script Borgnine Kennedy Ryan and Bronson were already names to the public but these are also supplemented by soon to be stars like Cassavetes Sutherland and Savalas also stepping into a role vacated by another this time Jack Palance who didn't like the racial aggression of the character  stoic performers like Jaeckel  Robert Webber. While curio value comes with the casting of singer Trini Lopez and Gridiron star Jim Brown. Throw Clint Walker into the pot as well and you have got a considerable amount of beef in the stew! Secondly the film led the way for a slew of movies that featured bad guys as heroes with that Aldrich's film holds up well as being a hugely influential piece. Then thirdly is that not only is it intermittently funny as the violence explodes on the screen but that it's also chocked full of action and adventure. All that and for those so inclined you can find questionable morals under scrutiny and see the war is hell banner firmly flown during the nastiness of the missions culmination.Split into three parts meet the guys see them train  the mission Dirty Dozen has been criticised for its lack of realism but is that really needed in what is essentially a male fantasy piece setting out to entertain? Besides which lets applaud it for acknowledging that brutality and atrocities were committed on both sides of the fence. Rest assured The Dirty Dozen still had enough edginess about it back in the 60s. It's also true enough to say that the characters are in the main stereotypes and that the unravelling story is a touch clichd but these are men that men want to be okay maybe not Savalas' religious maniac rapist! and men that women can cast a flirtatious eye over there's plenty of character here to hang your hats and undergarments on appealing to the inner rebel hidden away in many a viewer. The message's in there are not sledge hammered into the story Aldrich always said he wasn't making a message movie just a film about camaraderie and unlikely heroes and the construction of the action is top notch from one of America's most under appreciated directors. It's nicely shot in 70mm MetroColorMetroScope by Edward Scaife Night of the DemonKhartoum and features a suitably boisterous music score from Frank De Vol Cat BallouThe Flight of the Phoenix.It's a far from flawless picture of that there is no doubt but it's loved by millions and continues to gain an audience yearly who are willing to view it on its own entertaining terms. As a boy I wanted to be Lee Marvin because of this film as a middle aged man now I still want to be Lee Marvin in this film. That's yet another reason why The Dirty Dozen is so great. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Acclaimed director Robert Aldrich also famous to war film buffs for his rulebreaking drama Attack twists the familiar 'unit picture' into a famous story of unexpected heroism in the midst of World War II. Instead of making his heroes cleancut American draftees we're looking at the dirtiest convicts the Armed Forces has got to offer. OSS Major Reisman Lee Marvin Hell in the Pacific is an insubordinate Army officer who's facing a courtmartial when he's given one last chance for a reprieve select twelve Army prisoners from a maximumsecurity detention center train them for a topsecret mission behind the German lines and then lead them into battle. If they succeed in the mission they'll be released. For Reisman it's a tough call but it's his only chance to save his career. The men he was to work with are a mixed batch and director Aldrich packs a lot of character development into a twoandahalfhour movie. The most important of the Dirty Dozen is Franko a smalltime Chicago hoodlum who's facing the gallows for robbery and subsequent murder of a British civilian. It's clear from the start that Franko is a loner who thinks he's big stuff but Reisman manages to prove that he's really all talk. More than once he considers and even attempts escape from the remote training camp that the Dozen are forced to build  but maybe just maybe beneath that rebellious attitude there's a chance for redemption. Then there are some more sympathetic types Wladislaw Charles Bronson Battle of the Bulge was once a frontline infantryman who shot his platoon's medic when the medic got scared under fire and started running  Bronson says He took off with all the medical supplies only way to stop him was to shoot him. Jefferson Jim Brown Ice Station Zebra has been convicted for murder  his defense is he was defending himself from vicious racist MPs who were abusing him. Wladislaw and Jefferson find themselves allied in order to get Franko on their side because they have faith in Reisman and aren't willing to let Franko's rebellion become infectious. Also in fine support is Clint Walker None But the Brave as the big Navajo Posey who punched a man too hard for shoving him. He really didn't mean to kill him he just doesn't like being pushed. Posey comes off as a cuddly teddy bear who'd never intentionally hurt a soul and it's clear from the start that he's one of the good guys. Finally Telly Savalas Kelly's Heroes lends a hand as the psychotic racist religious fanatic Maggot who believes his job is to punish the other 11 men for their wickedness. His motives are never really clear all we really know is that Maggot is somewhat unhinged and potentially dangerous. Even though Reisman and his squad don't get along they're forced to become allied against a common enemy  the American General Staff who want to do nothing short of shut the operation down. Aldrich again breaks the rules making the conventionally good guys into the enemy. The Germans are barely mentioned throughout the first two acts and only become involved for the explosive finale. The heart of this movie is antiestablishment behavior right in the vein of the protest culture of the 60s the good guys are the unshaven criminals and the bad guys are the cleancut welldressed Generals who come across as stupid and vain. As Colonel Everett Dasher Breed Robert Ryan Flying Leathernecks makes an excellent bully a villain that the Dozen eventually unite to take action against. Once the men have been trained and are finally cooperating and acting as a unit it's time to set them loose on the Nazis. And still the story doesn't become stereotypical. The mission is simple the men will parachute into occupied France penetrate a chteau being used as a rest center for highlevel German officers and kill as many of said officers as possible in a short amount of time. This operation involves stabbing defenseless women machinegunning prisoners and finally locking several dozen German officers and their mistresses in an underground bomb shelter pouring gasoline down on them through air vents loading said air vents with hand grenades and then blowing up the whole place. Characters and story aside the film benefits from some superb editing by Michael Luciano. Director Aldrich and cinematographer Edward Scaife work hand in hand to compose every shot. The cramped dank prison cells in the first act are utterly convincing and the layout of the huge magnificent Germanoccupied chteau looks quite appropriately like a cross between a marvelous mansion and an impregnable fortress. The battle scenes are wellchoreographed too. Never does a moment go by where we do not know where one encounter is happening in relation to what the rest of the squad is dealing with in and around the Chteau. Frank de Vol's sweeping score is used sparingly and adds to both the humor and suspense of the picture. One scene in which Donald Sutherland's character inspects a platoon of the 82nd Airborne is set to a live orchestra's performance perfectly. War is a really a dirty business  this isn't a movie about men playing by the rules. It's about breaking every rule in the book to get a job done and if a few innocent bystanders get in the way they're simply collateral damage. On a higher level Aldrich's film reflects culture attitudes of the late 60s. Moviegoers wanted a film which encouraged breaking the rules which showed the higher levels of the American military as deeply flawed and made the dregs of society into the heroes of the piece. It's a cynical representation of the time it was made in but holds up flawlessly 40 years later in a culture which has probably been shaped by the attitudes the film reflects in every frame. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne who apparently was offered the part of Major Reisman probably wisely turned it down. Wayne would never have done in the part of the maverick major in charge of training the way Lee Marvin was so perfect in the role. In fact Marvin's and the performance of others in the cast helped The Dirty Dozen get over two very big improbable situations I have always found in this film.The first one being the way the conflict between Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin is handled. I can certainly see why a spit and polish West Point graduate like Ryan would not like Marvin why Marvin would rub him the wrong way. But I cannot understand why when the Dozen are transferred to his command for parachute training they don't tell him what's going on. I would think he would have a need to know. Then again a whole big part of the film wouldn't have occurred if Ryan had been let in on Marvin's mission.The second thing is that granted these guys might be considered expendable to say the least with several of the dozen scheduled for a firing squad but the army would want to make sure the mission had some chance of succeeding. There's no way absolutely no bloody way that a psychotic like Telly Savalas would have been allowed on the mission. And why Lee Marvin didn't scrub him when psychiatrist Ralph Meeker offered to is beyond me as well.Those glaring holes in the story have always prevented me from giving The Dirty Dozen the top rating that most have given it. But it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the film.The basic idea of the film appeals to me. An unorthodox major taking a group of nonconformists to say the least and making them a crack fighting outfit. Regular army training did not do it for this crew the first time around.Charles Bronson is one of the dozen and this film certainly put him well on the way to top billing. A dozen years later in fact he'd have it over Lee Marvin in Death Hunt.

	onyx:emotionText "John Wayne who apparently was offered the part of Major Reisman probably wisely turned it down. Wayne would never have done in the part of the maverick major in charge of training the way Lee Marvin was so perfect in the role. In fact Marvin's and the performance of others in the cast helped The Dirty Dozen get over two very big improbable situations I have always found in this film.The first one being the way the conflict between Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin is handled. I can certainly see why a spit and polish West Point graduate like Ryan would not like Marvin why Marvin would rub him the wrong way. But I cannot understand why when the Dozen are transferred to his command for parachute training they don't tell him what's going on. I would think he would have a need to know. Then again a whole big part of the film wouldn't have occurred if Ryan had been let in on Marvin's mission.The second thing is that granted these guys might be considered expendable to say the least with several of the dozen scheduled for a firing squad but the army would want to make sure the mission had some chance of succeeding. There's no way absolutely no bloody way that a psychotic like Telly Savalas would have been allowed on the mission. And why Lee Marvin didn't scrub him when psychiatrist Ralph Meeker offered to is beyond me as well.Those glaring holes in the story have always prevented me from giving The Dirty Dozen the top rating that most have given it. But it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the film.The basic idea of the film appeals to me. An unorthodox major taking a group of nonconformists to say the least and making them a crack fighting outfit. Regular army training did not do it for this crew the first time around.Charles Bronson is one of the dozen and this film certainly put him well on the way to top billing. A dozen years later in fact he'd have it over Lee Marvin in Death Hunt. Jim Brown also having just finished his football career began his movie career with a winning performance as another of the dozen. John Cassavetes was singled out for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Also Donald Sutherland got his first real notice as yet another of the dozen.A year later William Holden and Cliff Robertson did The Devil's Brigade which bore a lot of resemblance to The Dirty Dozen.

	schema:reviewBody "A group of conscripted convicts formed by twelve condemned  already destined for death row are drafted to go on a nearsuicide mission and attempt to eliminate a Nazi staff . Dirty Dozen is an entertaining film with Lee Marvin as tough officer along with the ordinary team of renegade soldiers of World War II . Marvin training a group of rebel and misfit soldiers for a dangerous assault on a palacechteau. In the hands of hardboiled director Robert Aldrich and a toughasleather cast headed by Lee Marvin  as a troublesome U.S. Army Major  that's all the plot that's needed to make one riproaring wartime flick. Marvin's mission is twofold and in violent and cynical style  first turn his prisoners into a fighting unit and then turn them loose on a German fortress located in Britain . His crimeminded characters include John Cassavetes as rebel inmate  Clint Walker as a chronic malcontent Telly Savalas as a readytoblow psycho Donald Sutherland as a lamebrained convict and many others . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader. The final part is all action as the culprit commandos wreck havoc and then run for their lives. Despite the fact that few of the heroes survive the bloodbath the message here isn't that war is hell. Rather it seems to be war can be a hell of a good time... if you've got nothing to lose . The relentless assignment is set against strong training risked adventures and hazardous feats . The dangerous mission includes a numerous group formed by a motley and diverse squadron played by allstar cast .This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning about an experienced officer  Major Reisman  he's assigned by Military staff Ernest Borgnine who acted in the original and all the sequels Robert Webber  George Kennedy to train a dropout group of murderers  criminals and rapists who get a chance to redeem themselves . They are a bunch of dispensable characters with no past and no future . Lee Marvin reprieves a bunch of Death Row inmates  forges them into a twofisted fighting unit and leads them on a deadly assignment into Nazi territory  but there is a religious crazy in the team .The prisoners are oddballs  ragtag and undisciplined gang a large cast formed by John Cassavetes Clint Walker  Donald Sutherland Telly Savalas  Jim Brown  Charles Bronson Trini Lopez under command a sergeant Richard Jaeckel. The team is hardly trained by the Major Reisman . In this film Marvin and his motley band  the Dirty Dozen are suppose to destroy a fortress where resides various Nazi officers . Then they are parachuted and arrive in French Bretain and attacking the palace . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines  to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected castle.Lee Marvin as Major Reisman assumes the character of the leader of the Dirty Dozen in this wartime classic movie directed by Robert Aldrich and based on the characters created by T.M. Nathanson  being scripted by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller. This moving film packs frantic thrills perilous adventures  relentless feats  and buckloads of explosive action and violence. The noisy action is uniformly wellmade especially deserving of mention the riproaring final scenes on the fortress  including some spectacular shootouts and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit  cudgeled by Lee Marvin into his rebel group  the film is full of feats  suspense  and thrills . Rough Marvin is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland . Atmospheric and martial musical score by Frank De Vol and appropriate cinematography filmed by Edward Scaife in several locations from Gaddesden Hertfordshire  England and MGM British studios Borehamwood .

However the soldiers' that Reisman has been assigned are all sentenced to death or life in prison for their crimes.  The mission is a suicide mission on a French chateau where German top brass will be the aim being to kill as many as possible.  But before the mission the group must pass a training to be considered for pardoning.Well known by all men everywhere this is less a serious war movie and more an enjoyable ensemble romp through a training camp with the final third being the mission itself.  This is the film's strength  the training sections are very enjoyable and good fun to watch.  The mission is punchy and dramatic and works very well as the conclusion to the film rather than the whole film itself which other mission' films have to do.  The training is slick and enjoyable not only it is occasionally quite funny but it is also consistently amusing and exciting at turns.The film's main selling point increasingly so is the all star cast all of whom do really good work.  Marvin is tough in the lead and he is well supported by Borgnine Kennedy Ryan and Jaeckel playing the other officers. Of the prisoners Cassavetes steals the show with his cocky Franko although he is not short of famous support.  Sutherland although not well known at the time is good comic relief Savalas is a little too heavy for the film but adds menace Bronson is good value Brown is strong and is well known due to a weepy Billy Crystal!  The rest of the dozen give good performances but I'll be honest and say that the famous faces stuck in my mind more.Overall this is not a wonderful film and as a war movie it isn't the best mission' movie you could find simply cause the mission is quite short and straightforward.  However it is a fun movie that never drags despite the slightly longer than normal running time for this type of movie.

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult when you approach an old movie to see it for the first time and you have to try and drop all the baggage associated with it from reviews and analysis over the years. The Dirty Dozen is such a movie. I just watched it for the first time last night on TV clipped though it was for those smaller brained people among us who don't like to see dark bits at the top and bottom of their screens.It's interesting that there are three real character acts to this movie. There's the dark opening and character introduction the fun act where the characters meld together into a team and the closing act where the mission and the war become a stark and deadly reality. That last act is dark too although there a couple of accidental laughs in there for the worst character expression at a death ever and one particularly bad death scene.What does strike you about the opening is how really dark it all is. We're talking about murders who are looking at to be retrained. Indeed one is a rapist with a serious God complex who is bordering on utterly insane. They are about to be hanged for their crimes but have one last chance. Poor Major John Reisman has no say in the matter he has his band and has to make them work.It's well filmed for the first two character acts and the acting is very good. John Cassavetes and Telly Savalas are wonderful in their roles. In fact it's a surprise to see Savalas in such a role and shining so brightly. Donald Sutherland also shows he has some excellent character acting in him. The rest are far from bad but you can see a lot of typecasting for them.The movement from the dark opening to the more jovial training act is interesting to watch as this is exactly how many of the characters are seeing it as a bit of fun. What they aren't expecting is the third character act that of the actual war itself and for some this proves too much.The difficulty I had with the final act is only in the filming. There are premature cuts awkward angles and jumping storytelling. So much is missed by the camera and it doesn't feel like it's there to let your imagination run it seems like someone has cut the film deliberately and quite badly. There are quite a few scene transitions that just don't work at all.However where it doesn't fail is bringing the characters to their ultimate journey that of redemption and a renewed desire to fight for their Major and their fellow men. They become soldiers and indeed heroes.It's a good war film to watch very well structured and reflective of the characters journeys. It's just that final act for me which spoiled my enjoyment and purely in the filming of it.".

There are quite a few scene transitions that just don't work at all.However where it doesn't fail is bringing the characters to their ultimate journey that of redemption and a renewed desire to fight for their Major and their fellow men. They become soldiers and indeed heroes.It's a good war film to watch very well structured and reflective of the characters journeys. It's just that final act for me which spoiled my enjoyment and purely in the filming of it.";

I have a hard time believing that a 10yearold was shocked into crying hysterics by the ending of this movie.Secondly perhaps the film makers WANTED the audience to feel uneasy ambiguous or even a bit disgusted. War IS hell remember? Which is why 11 of the 12 die on the mission.And while the Nazis are not portrayed as evil caricatures anyone who sees them as victims needs a history lesson.

I first saw this film when I was about 8 year old and thought it was the best thing I'd seen on TV.Lee Marvin heads the cast as an unorthadox short on discipline rebellious Major during World War II whose given a suicidal mission by a bunch of Generals headed by the excellent Ernest Borgnine. He must take 12 convicts train them and take them on a mission behind enemy lines to destroy a large chateau and kill a large number of important German officers who'll be partying there that night.The films explosive climax is fantastic as you know inevitably that not everyone will survive the mission and by now you've sort of chosen who your favourite characters are. The build up and the training scenes are also brilliant as you discover the backgrounds behind these violent criminals.It's Marvin's show but John Cassavettes is superb as Victor Franco in fact with a supporting cast featuring Robert Ryan Charles Bronson Telly Savalas Donald Sutherland George Kennedy and Clint Walker you know you're in for a great ride nobody is wasted.There's a lot of humour mixed with quite serious issues...you sometimes forget that this band of jokers are killers with only one chance to survive a mission they are hardly trained for.This classic is on par with The Great Escape and Where Eagles Dare Three inferior TV movies were made in the mid eighties which basically take the same idea from the original but they are obviously no match.It's available on video and DVD and every home should have a copy.

	schema:headline " Actually the Foul Fourteen...";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahead...It's funny  1967 saw the summer of love but it also saw the release of a raw violent war movie in which more than a few of the heroes are psychopaths.  I've kind of wanted to see this movie since I was a kid but it's taken me a good three decades to realize that goal.  It had all my little kid friends abuzz in the '70s  those who'd seen it somehow  and I can see why.  This really is your basic macho war movie.  It's a kind of film that doesn't get made much any more or  at least  not released theatrically.  It's got fewer redeeming qualities than war movies or movies set during wartime  there's a difference made since the mid'70s basically in light of the American experience in Vietnam and the domestic reactions to that experience and it's more a straight shoot'emup that almost glorifies violence.  It has a few subtleties however that set it apart from the truly mindless violence of some films that I could name many of them from the '80s.  The film touches upon class race and other social structures and its diverse cast does a great job of creating and resolving conflict as kind of a microcosm of any multicultural society.  Justice and the idea that officers might sometimes be the last people that you'd want to have running things also belong as major themes though they've been more fully and effectively developed before e.g. What Price Glory All Quiet On The Western Front and since e.g. Apocalypse Now Gallipoli Hamburger Hill.The cast works really well and includes some unlikely candidates such as footballer Jim Brown who did a great job in this his second movie by the way and musician Trini Lopez who even gets to sing a song.  Lee Marvin is excellent as always as the gruff but not humorfree and in his own right subversively insubordinate major who's charged with the team of criminals that become the Dirty Dozen.  I don't know who thought of casting the prototypical Noo Yawker Telly Savalas as a southern religious maniac emphasis on maniac but it does work and he's scarily and creepily good in the role.  Charles Bronson plays it straight in one of his better roles and does a good job.  John Cassavetes delivers the most intense performance if I recall from seeing him in other films I think that he always did as a troublemaker and his is a standout performance.  Donald Sutherland's character isn't fleshed out much but he does get to act the fool in a couple of memorable scenes including one in which he's passed off as a general.  The massive Clint Walker who looks like a 70sera Big Jim action figure come to life is also great as a backwoods giant who's gentle until pushed too far.  Richard Jaeckel also acquits himself well as an MP in what I expected to be a short role though he ended up going on the mission and was one of the three that survived.  George Kennedy and Ernest Borgnine don't have huge roles in this film but each is good in their part.  Of note perhaps is that both Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas were WWII veterans both wounded in combat.This bunch of misfits are eventually whipped into a unit and they're such underdogs that most viewers will probably revel in their victory over Lee Marvin's priggish superior officer played to arrogant perfection by Robert Ryan.  There's a fair bit of humor in this film too at least until the attack is launched.This is a violent movie and I found one particularly interesting moment to be when one of the Dirty Dozen is told to execute some Germans  he obviously doesn't want to do it but the script doesn't belabor the point it merely makes it obvious without him saying a word.  So too do some of the soldiers seem to harbor some qualms about obliterating Germans that they've trapped in a cellar.  The Germans herded below are slaughtered  looks like a war crime to me friends and neighbors.  In this respect the film pulls no punches and although otherwise not a particularly realistic film it shows quite nicely i.e. disturbingly the ugliness and brutality of war. It's also commendable that this film never dehumanizes the Germans.  For that matter if anyone are brutal thugs here it'd have to be the Dirty Dozen.I guess the bottom line for me is that I basically like this film though I'm quite disturbed by some elements within dumping grenades and fuel on trapped German officers and their ladies being the biggie and I'd be a bit worried about someone who was a rabid fan of the movie  at least if he giggled like Telly Savalas' character while watching Germans bite the dust. Maybe on second thought I just like the first half of this film.  By the way Lee Marvin's character has a German name that I'm sure was not unintentional 'rice man' I think...I'd speculate that this was an oblique reference within an oblique reference related to the Southeast Asian conflict that the US was embroiled in during 1967 but I'm not sure to what extreme these kinds of things need to be taken.".

Its very dangerous trying to humourise war in the movies because that  would be offensive to all those that had served  died in real life.  Kelly's Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far pretending that  war is really fun  cool when you've got people like Clint Eastwood in  charge.  But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but  manage to keep into focus the cruelty  horrors of war at the same time   MASH and Catch 22 are the best examples.  With Dirty Dozen we have something of a gobetween the humour amongst  the characters is light  welcoming but never falls into farce or  badtaste and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some  tight scripted scenes of drama  mass murder throwing petrol   grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about  that scene and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas  chambers  concentration camps in Belsen  But unlike MASH  Catch 22 Aldrich resists the temptation to openly  politicise the effects of war after all this film was made in '67 near  the height of the Vietnam warprotests. Instead he takes a straight  line course of action and lets us be moved  entertained by the  convicted GIs doing their duty.  Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays  the antihero far better than Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes. Marvin just  looks the type who'd give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard  time.  But special mention must go to Cassavettes as Viktor Franko the  troublemaker's troublemaker. His character is so refreshing  wild  amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras with the exception  of Savalas. Franko is the Joker of the pack but you soon feel an  attachment for him in spite of his crimes.  Sutherland  Bronson don't really add much. The former plays a  slightly naive man who hasn't really grown up and Bronson just smirks   mumbles a lot.  The only other character worthy of a mention is the truly terrifying  Savalas who is a Christian through  through yet hates all women as  much as the Germans and has a most spine chilling laugh! Difficult to  believe this man later became Kojak!  The film is a tad overlong the first  last 40 minutes hold the  interest but the middle section the War Games scene is far too long  and generally detracts.  All the same DD is a very good movie especially for those who don't  want to be politically moralised too.  ".

Bronson Brown   Walker are the brawn of the group and the film provides all of them the opportunity to display their physical attributes. Sutherland represents the only other major character of the dozen as the unit idiot. Lee Marvin was in his prime and I consider this his best and most definitive role as the leader of the dozen. Borgnine and Ryan also standout as adversarial superiors to Marvin. This was a man's film from beginning to end and although not as colorful or explicit as the excellent book it was based on it was every bit as good a film as was the book and the exciting climax was a big improvement on the non climactic book.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE DIRTY DOZEN is very much a film that stands between the fault line of the old classic Hollywood and of the New Hollywood . Arthur Penn's BONNIE AND CLYDE was released the same year to great commercial and critical success . The Hays code that dictated what could and couldn't be shown in American cinema was being replaced but a certification system and this film reflects this . Notice how a well regarded film critic like Roger Ebert was shocked at the amount of violence on screen . Of course it's very tame by today's standards but Robert Aldrich like Sam Peckinpah always did try to push on screen violence in the 1960sIt's interesting that there's moral ambiguity surrounding the plot . With a film like THE GUNS OF NAVERONE and WHERE EAGLES DARE it'd be jolly decent chaps been given a mission to kill the dastardly hun but here we saw a bunch of criminals doing so . Also interesting how the film differentiates between the  good criminals  and the  bad criminals  even if you haven't seen the film before you'll be hoping which character gets their pardon and which one dies in action Of the cast Lee Marvin  Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan would have been well known where as Donald Sutherland  Charles Bronsan and John Cassevetes weren't famous names . Bronson did go on to be a big name in 1970s cinema and it's difficult to think of a decade apart from the 1970s where a tall  thin slightly goofy looking actor would have been a film star . Cassevetes didn't really become a big name as an actor but did become a highly acclaimed director of independent features . Post 70s indie cinema owes much to him As for the actual plot there's a major plot hole in that the allies know there's a Nazi conference taking place but instead using a squadron of bombers to reduce the chteau to rubble they come up with a scheme that's little chance of success involving the condemned men  but if the allied planners showed more sense there wouldn't have been a story . The plotting does mean the film is rather flabby and overlong but it's a fairly entertaining one if you like war adventures and Lee Marvin and his cohorts are much better actors than Brad Pitt and the ones who appeared a recent film by Tarantino".

Working from a script by veteran screenwriters Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller based on a novel by E.M Nathanson Aldrich wastes no time on extraneous detail or historical context he's clearly interested in keeping this 2andahalf hour epic moving along as it contains a lot of characters tough dialogue and wellstaged action.At the same time little effort is expended in disguising the story's schizoid nature. Its first half is a fairly standard though rousing WWII adventure with a skilled cast expertly portraying the typical band of misfits  in this case American military prisoners  who bond under fierce training and are molded into an efficient fighting force. Then in the second half the results of this training are unblinkingly depicted with the assault on an RR stronghold for the German high command in which the mission is simply to kill as many of the enemy as possible. That this happens to include a large number of civilian noncombatants many of them women seems of scant concern. The slaughter is mainly accomplished with gasoline dumped down ventilator shafts on those trapped in the cellars below then ignited.It makes for exciting spectacle but might also leave something of a bad taste in your mouth.".

I could buy it if one or two of them had been wrongfully accused but eleven of them? Or rather six of them since the other half of the 'dozen' aren't even developed into characters. I could also buy it if they redeem themselves or come to some personal revelation through their mission but the finale of this film was so sadistic that it ruined everything that had been set up. Are we supposed to cheer when these so far unredeemed 'heroes' pour gasoline on a bunch of trapped Nazi officers' WIVES?? Why did the writers put women in this scene at all? Where's the redemption in psychos acting psychotic? This finale just puts them on the same level as the Nazis but unfortunately this film isn't going for any kind of moral message.

I've read some of the other posts and everyone seems to think the knife scene was the funniest. I didn't expect to come to this movie for a laugh but the knife scene almost killed me. Luckily it was just me and my friend in the movie theatre so I could let it all out.If you go to the movies to free your imagination then this is the movie for you. Stay away from people who say it's farfetched and unrealistic. If they want realism they should go to the laundromat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kung Fu Hustle was one of the most visually imaginative and unique movies I have seen in quite some time. Upon first viewing the trailer I thought we would have another Kung Pow Enter The Fist on our hands but boy was I wrong. Unlike Kung Pow the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch. The scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument don't know the name of it in such a way that it kills was incredible.Although there was not much to the story it was not nonexistent either. There was a simple story happening which made sense for what we were watching. Even the jokes with the subtitles came across as funny and from my experience humor does not translate as easily as this movie would have you believe. It borrowed or spoofed a bit from SpiderMan and The Matrix as well which was a bit unexpected for this film initially. At least for me.To be honest I could enjoy this movie without sound or subtitles too. It was that appealing to the eye. It would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention. It could also be great if you feel like a good comedy. I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater it held my interest all the way to the end. 910".

	schema:headline " Stephen Chow is truly a great director...";
	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin Allen and now actor writer producer and director Stephen Chow can join the select few whose remarkable talent as a performer matches his ability behind the lens Kung Fu Hustle proves it. Chow is no stranger to direction. In 1994 Chow codirected Love on Delivery and since then a number of other self starring projects and many of these projects are considered the best of his acting career. However his skills as a comedian  be it his brash physical comedy Shaolin Soccer his manical scenarios Tricky Brains or epic historical parodies A Chinese Oddsey  have never outshined his talents as a director. Kung Fu Hustle not only reminds us of Chow's terrific comedic timing it introduces us to his stunning visual eye and exhilarating action direction. More importantly this addition to Chow's superb filmography finally allows us a means of defining his technique. A master of blending both comedy and visceral action with artistic integrity and traditional melodrama. It has been awhile since a director has been able to take me from quite serious and intense graphic violence to over the top ridiculous spoofing. The contrast of atmosphere and mood throughout the film is incredible and even more incredible is Chow's ability to make it all work. When the scene is funny you appreciate the comedy when it switches gears to action you are blown away by the terrific sequences when it switches to melodrama you are on the edge of your seat awaiting character responses and when they're all fused together you do exactly what Chow is hoping you'll do. You laugh. So I liked the film but what is the film exactly. Like most Stephen Chow films while the concept is simple to describe the execution is far more complex. Kung Fu Hustle tells the story of Sing a wannabe gangster attempting to join the famous Axe Gang who during some of the early scenes seem to spoof Gangs of New York  look for a firework visual quote a legion of black suits responsible for a series of gruesome murders and complete dominance over a 1940s Hong Kong. Sing's reasons for wanting to join the gang are simple bad guys are cooler. His arrogance causes a war to break out between a poor housing complex that secretly holds a number hidden talents and the murderous axe gang. What starts as a relatively small skirmish and I mean relatively explodes into a war of Miike's Dead or Alive proportions. The use of digital effects in this film are extreme. Chow having succumbed to the digital revolutions in Shaolin Soccer manages once again to use his effects wisely. There are a terrific number of effects shots in this film far more then I've ever seen in a Hong Kong production save maybe the terrible Wesley's Mysterious File and while I am disappointed at the lack of practical effects the impressive quality of them more then makes up for it. This film simply does not look like a Hong Kong film. It rivals Hollywood features in every category set costumes cinematography but amazingly enough the CGI is really good! You can notice most of the effects but that doesn't matter because they are used for laughs and effectively so. Some of the effects not only will have you in stitches but also in shock and awe at the sheer incredibility of some of the scenes. One scene that sticks out is a terrific spoof of the Road Runner. Its not hilarious but also a visual feast.The impressive action is thanks largely to the great choreography talent including both Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping each working on the film at spate occasions. Yuen Wo Ping manages to take a scene that appears to be rehash of the Burly Brawl hundreds of suits against one guy and manages to make it not only fresh but a thousand times more exciting and intense. These fight sequences demand the attention of any cinephile who claims themselves a fan of marital art cinema. Wachowski's take not this is how you direct Yuen Wo Ping to this artistic peak. So everything seems great right? This has to be Chow's best right? Actually not everything works and is not at all Chow's best film. It is not his funniest film but that is because it takes the risk of exploring the action genre. It also relies a bit too much on CGI and while its use is effective it can occasionally bring you out of the film. Compared to his other films this film ranks 1 for its visuals and action but in terms of laughs and writing it cannot surpass the classics. That being said Kung Fu Hustle is absolute blast. See it if you can at the Toronto Film Festival import it on DVD and catch in theaters when Sony Classics brings it here in Febuary I believe. It is action comedy at its finest.Three cheers for Chow Sing Chi!".

This movie is even better than we have expected. There were full of laughters almost from the beginning to the end in the theater. Stephen Chow displays his talent as both a director and an actor. It maintains the previous Chow's style and humor as in other movies such as Xi Ju Zhi Wang and Xing Yun Yi Tiao Long while those CGIs were not expected. In Chow's movie what the Chinese people like is that it says no to super heroes. It just tells the stories of ordinary people particularly those people leading insignificant and unsuccessful lives. Several characters in this movie were played by popular KungFu stars in the 1980's  1990's in China. Stephen Chow shows respects to them as the way he respects Bruce Lee. Above all KungFu Hustle is a movie with great hilarity stunning CGI effects fantastic KungFu and the lives of ordinary people. I give it 9 out of 10. Highly recommended!Now this movie is in theaters in Europe and North America. The recent comments have shown a good sign already.Best wishes to Stephen Chow!

Five minutes later a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen and it's been watched a dozen times since.There's always been a certain cheesiness to Hong Kong cinema but on rare occasions a writer or director will directly tap a nerve and somehow weave that directly into the story 'Kung Fu Hustle' is one of those films. This piece isn't simply a 'standard' kung fu movie it's a romance a sweeping portrait of goodversusevil and a moral lesson on the use of power. The comedic bits are so well integrated into the story that it flows smoothly from one tone to another. The fight choreography is stellar and special care was taken to make sure that every character in the piece is human. There're no 'perfect' people or places and it somehow makes the wire fighting that appears in parts seem believable. The acting is excellent and the camera work is all rock steady.Feeling jaded? Burdened? Wonder if it's possible for one person to make a difference? Settle in with a copy of this film and believe...".

Five minutes later a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen and it's been watched a dozen times since.There's always been a certain cheesiness to Hong Kong cinema but on rare occasions a writer or director will directly tap a nerve and somehow weave that directly into the story 'Kung Fu Hustle' is one of those films. This piece isn't simply a 'standard' kung fu movie it's a romance a sweeping portrait of goodversusevil and a moral lesson on the use of power. The comedic bits are so well integrated into the story that it flows smoothly from one tone to another. The fight choreography is stellar and special care was taken to make sure that every character in the piece is human. There're no 'perfect' people or places and it somehow makes the wire fighting that appears in parts seem believable. The acting is excellent and the camera work is all rock steady.Feeling jaded? Burdened? Wonder if it's possible for one person to make a difference? Settle in with a copy of this film and believe...";

Stumbling across a gangcontrolled apartment to extort money from the locals who are actually kung fu masters in disguise. Sing's actions attracts the notorious Axe Gang and set off a relentless chain of events that brings the clans together in an explosive battle.From kung fu showdowns to dance sequences featuring tuxedoed mobsters you've never seen martial arts action this outrageous! With jawdropping fight sequences by Yeun Wo Ping famed action choreographer of Kill Bill Vol.1  2 and The Matrix Kung Fu Hustle will blow you away! Chow's movie is set in 1940s Guangdong Province China. Chow plays Ahxing a street rascal who fools around constantly. He is good at talking glibly but at the core he is feebleminded and stuck in poverty with an unknown future. So it doesn't look good for Axing at the beginning of the movie.It doesn't get any better either a little later as we discover it is Axing's goal is to become a member of the notorious Axe Gang the fiercest cruelest and most widespread gang of the city.One day when Axing goes into a slum Pig Cage Town to do his usual extortion he witnesses a real clash between two gangs the Axe Gang is clearing out a local gang that has not shown allegiance to the Axe. Axing realizes the slum residents  including the plump landlady and her skinny and wimpylooking husband  have each turned into kungfu masters to fight against the large group of gangs.Axing then realizes this is a battle between good and evil and that he is called to choose one side.Stephen Chow continues his unique comedy style twisting the slapstick jokes and reinterpreting them with his composed face. In Kung Fu Hustle Chow intensifies the selftorture sequences and creates more funny points in his suffering. For example when Chow shows his characters practising kungfu while faced by a middleaged woman in the slum he is quickly kicked in the groin. He is also stabbed by three flying daggers which were supposedly aimed at his enemy and is later bitten in the face by two poisonous snakes. Through all these trials he manages to survive for another day.Apart from creativity Kung Fu Hustle has also demonstrated a higher quality comedy than his early 1990s works such as Fight Back to School 1991 and King of Beggars 1992. The cinematography is more sophisticated with an authentic 1930s aura. And like Shaolin Soccer Kung Fu Hustle heavily adopts computer graphics to present special effects such as the snake daggers and flying axes.".

It's not in the same vein as Shaolin Soccer and it is not a belly full of laughs but it certainly emphasised his love of action movies especially Martial Art movies. The film pays homage to all those Hong Kong Martial Arts Serials Bruce Lee and the action genre in general. I would even say that Kung Fu Hustle is a more refined Shoalin Soccer in terms of storyline action sequences and acting.The setting is great with some nice scenes of old Hong Kong and the way people used to live. The fight scenes were pretty good especially at the start with the three masters fighting the Axe Gang. Okay the story was predictable but that didn't take away the enjoyment one bit.Overall it is a highly recommended movie to watch and I can't wait for his next film.".

Yet it is not just a funny comedy about kung fu. It is more than that. Somehow it is similar to Harry Potter in this case is wizard or animations by Hayao Miyazaki in which a world of imagination is created. The characters in the film are so funny and classic. Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different the overall result is hilarious. This is a movie that make Hong Kong people proud. I hope it will be a box office success in other countries too. I think I'll definitely buy the movie DVD for my personal collection.".

But let me tell you that the experience was worth more than my disgustingly overpriced admission. With the popcorn and drink on top of it.Perhaps i'll start with the least important element of the movie. Firstly Kung Fu Hustle has officially replaced all other overblown martial arts films by a long shot. The fighting in this movie is spectacular. Half the fights are so loaded with creativity it makes fighting movies look like something you've seen for the first time. The CG is great. The other half are part parodies of other films and they are hilarious as well as spectacular. In fact I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet. Depending on your library of watched films you'll catch more of them. I got quite a few and they were well done.And here's the most important part about this movie. This is where Kung Fu Hustle succeeds where so many other martial arts movies fail. It has a believable simple touching intertwined and well flowing story. I can't tell you how many times where I've walked out of a martial arts  or even action  movie and been immensely disappointed because the fighting and explosions were great but the rest of it simply fell short. These movies are typically way unbalanced.But Stephen Chow is talented enough to take both elements of the movie to their rightful place. I don't know how he did it but it worked. The acting is incredibly enjoyable. The plot is likable. The fighting will make your jaw drop. And all the fighting actually has something to do with the story. It's absolutely amazing.If you're tired of action movies not making the mark go see this one. Now. 1010.".

So having said that consider this a rave review of Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle.While the film itself was entertaining the prospect of summarizing the scattered plot is not. Set in 1940's Shanghai Kung Fu Hustle basically centers on a tenement ruled over by a mean chainsmoking landlady Qiu Yuen and her whipped husband Wah Yuen. When someone deigns to complain about the fact that they don't have enough water to take a quick shower she pounds them senseless with everyone standing by completely helpless. Flip to another part of town where the notorious Axe Gang a deadly bunch of dancing axe wielding guys are wreaking havoc on a city that can't even be protected by the police. The two areas of town don't concern themselves with one another until a wannabe member of the Axe Gang Sing Stephen Chow and his sidekick Chi Chung Lam poses as a member in the tenement to extort money causing a series of events to occur in the tenement that wind up with most of the Axe Gang either killed or injured and Brother Sum Kwok Kuen Chan the leader of the gang to do everything in his power to wreak revenge on both the tenement and its occupants particularly those who act as its safeguards.As I mentioned earlier there were a lot of parts that I found so funny that I was either finding myself almost lightheaded from laughing so hard or finding myself obnoxious because I would struggle to recoup in order to read the subtitles in time to not miss anything. While there are several movie in jokes even one dedicated to Chow's prior film Shaolin Soccer it was the sight gags that really did it for me. The chase between Landlady and Sing and especially the knife scene with Sing and his sidekick were brilliant slapstick. A lot of the action was extremely over the top and complimented by some pretty decent CGI work.While anyone who has seen Shaolin Soccer knows that Chow does not employ a normal cast of heroes it was still interesting to see that for the most part almost anyone who could have heroic qualities attributed to them did not fit the normal model. As a matter of fact several of the major players in the film were middle aged or even elderly a notion that is both funny and refreshing for anyone who looks for something a little different in their heroes. Surprisingly there was also a very well conceived scene in the middle of the film involving two professional assassins who are trying to kill the main defenders of the tenement that I found to actually be a pretty kickass action sequence. Despite a couple of gags here and there until the end when the Landlady got involved the scene was playing off like something I would say cooool in an awed tone about in a Tarantino film or something. So while the film was overall one of the funniest I've seen in recent memory there were a couple of great moments of highly stylized action.Kung Fu Hustle wasn't a perfect film by any means but the criticisms I have about it are completely nitpicky. For instance the romance between Sing and the mute girl was just kind of thrown in though some of it was necessary for background on his character. And a purely aesthetic complaint I wanted more dancing by the Axe Gang. Chow shouldn't have teased us with the little bit that they danced and then abruptly take it away for the rest of the film. Hey it's a review  I've got to air the good and the bad.But since the good outweighs the bad exponentially I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle to just about anyone because of both its action and comedic elements. For making me laugh to the point of nearaneurysm Kung Fu Hustle gets a solid 810.".

What I will say is that even though I read a couple of good reviews about this movie I wasn't prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me. While the plot was fairly simple and it was definitely an action film there were just so many things that surprised me throughout the movie. There were times in the film where I had to applaud  it was such a feel good movie and I left the theater with the same HUGE smile on my face that was on my face for about 90 of the movie.If you haven't seen this film yet don't read anything else about it  just GO so you can experience it for yourself without anybody's opinions coloring your judgment. GO and see this film. It's pure entertainment.";

But at the ending part he looks the same age with before trying to sell some more powerful kung fu manuals. There may be other explanations but to read this part in a reallife way it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals and Sing is just like normal people who just bought one and thenmade a dream.Most importantly the changing age of adult Sing and the Deaf girl back to young kid at the ending part gave a huge hint that they still at their kid age throughout the movie. The Butt boy Bucktooth Jane tailor landlord etc showed in the end also implies that they are not legendary guys in the movie they are just normal people like u and me. All the stories are a dream done by young Sing. He has evil minds indeed but he wishes to be a good guy he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend and then if possible save the world. This is a dream not only for him it is a dream for all movie fans and also a dream for people in normal life.We go to theatres so we also have dreams. This film is 10 out of 10 because it gives us many implications. One of them is there are many ways to make a dream. Don't know how? Here is one!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have mostly good things to say about Stephen Chow's latest movie.Kung Fu Hustle for the most part is unlike Chow's previous awardwinning actioncomedy Shaolin Soccer although he has obviously continued the martial arts theme and expanded massively his repertoire of sfx.I am a Chow fan beginning from the times when he relied on a deadpan expression toilet humour spoofs of other movies and books and goodending heartwarming smalltownvillage boymakesgood story lines.Some of those elements are noticeably absent in KFH. Ng Man Tat is missing as is the customary female attraction the main female character has little screen time. The cast of SS is back excepting Ng and the goalkeeper of that movie in particular has a roaring time here as the leader of Axe Gang.But of course when it comes to KFH one must talk about the sfx. In themselves they are creativelydone and quite out of the world. As part of the film one might ask has Chow stumbled into the cinematic abyss that has caught so many of Hollywood's directors who dabble in the black arts of sfx? Thankfully the answer is no. True KFH unlike SS is weak on story and characters which has been characteristic of recent Western yawns such as Van Helsing Blade Trinity etc. In this Chow has stepped away from the formula which made SS not just a sfx extravaganza but a successful story. In contrast KFH is a bundle of action sequences thrown together to showcase the sfx.But the wit and cheekiness of Chow remains. It is gratifying that the fun and sarcasm that has been a hallmark of his acting career have translated themselves well into films that he has produced and directed.So in KFH we have Chow spoofing the clichs of Chinese martial arts stories the retired martial arts couple who become petty scrooge and lecher the heroes who save the neighbourhood one of them gay end up getting dispatched soon after and the con beggar who sells a wu ling mi ji to a naive boy.Because of the spoofs the sfx don't become spectacles in themselves but help to drive the madness upward. Highlyskilled sitar players strum out blades and ghouls in battle a pugilist using the Toad's Skill croaks and blows out his lower mouth like one Chow ascends into the skies as he masters the Buddha's Palm with a eagle in the distance the engrossing mass battle with the blackclad Axe Gangsters lifted from the Matrix movies. It is all mad irreverent and at times even affecting.Still I do yearn for the good o' Chow. The sfx are fun and crazy. But surely the funniest bit in the film has got to be the knifethrowing sequence. That is good o' Chow. So I don't mind just bring on the Chow be it old or new in the next year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hi all I started watching Kungfu hustle out of sheer boredom on my flight to Japan. I expected it to be another boring martial arts movie with clichd story lines and bad acting. What I found was an amazingly entertaining crazy novel story with slapstick comedy that had me laughing my ss off loud. Stephen Chow is definitely putting China on the world cinema map with his genre of movies. The action is of course not real and has used computer effects  but I don't believe Chow is trying impress everyone just by having real martial arts a la Ongbak. He is an entertainer like Jackie Chan was in his prime. He even takes a cheeky punt at western movies like the Matrix and Spiderman which is pretty cool. The story of Kungfu hustle itself is set in a sort of 70's China and people like me who love travelling and different cultures get a real feel of being in China. The story throws up a lot of crazy surprises like that of a children's fairy tale and is very funny and refreshing. I watched Kungfu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie. Kungfu hustle gets a well deserved 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not know what to expect of this movie other than what the trailer showed but I was completely blown away by this film! Not only does it pay homage to the Matrix and Spiderman as well as Looney Tune cartoons but the opening with the butterfly paid homage to the Men In Black with the dragonfly flying through the opening credits. From that point on I was totally swept up in the movie and the 95 or so minutes seemed to go by in no time at all! The effects were well within the atmosphere presented by this actioncomedy and I found myself laughing at all the jokes presented as well as feeling for the character of Sing as he blundered his way through trying to be a gangster even though he was way in over his head.Scene after scene flowed with maybe some exceptions here and there but all in all held together and kept my attention. I too could have watched this movie without the subtitles and have enjoyed it just as much. The tonal sounds of Brother Sum the language itself added to the beauty of this film I could close my eyes and listen to it and be swept away. If the language was not so hard to master at such a point this far in my life I would love to be able to learn it just to get the true dialogue they were speaking.From the background story of Sing to the rag tag collection of people living in Pig Sty Alley to the seemingly inept but fear in sheer numbers of the Axe Gang this film has enough characters to satisfy anyone. They each have a place in the movie and I don't think it would be the same without them.The story cinematography the effectsat times obviously CG but they fit within the context of the film the characters and even the music all make this a memorable viewing enough to put this in my collection of films that I could watch over and over without growing tired of it.There is so much I actually enjoyed of this film I would love to dig deeper into the career of Stephen Chow. I had not heard of him before this viewing but I would like to see if his other films were as entertaining.If you like movies that have martial arts enough action and comedy to spare with a story strong enough to hold it all together I would recommend you catch this movie.

In true HK style it has a bit of everything. Not only was it a much much better martial arts film than either the more respected Hero or House of Flying Daggers it was a much better film period. In fact Kung Fu Hustle was one of the best movies of any kind I've seen this year.It's great that Columbia PicturesSony Classics gave this movie a US release with only minor cuts which now that I've seen the uncut HK version should have been left in. But it is obvious that they had no idea how to market it though they spent a lot of money trying. They pushed it only for its comedic elements positioning it in the media as a wacky spoof of Kung Fu movies like Blazing Saddles was for westernswhich it is not!But I don't really blame Columbia for Kung Fu Hustles weak stateside box officeI blame those morons at Miramax! Yeah you heard me you two! I think that this great movie would have found a much bigger audience if Miramax the US distributor of Chow's previous film Shaolin Soccer hadn't so utterly botched that film's US release showing it heavily cut in only a couple of theatres before dumping it unceremoniously onto video. While not all Americans are familiar with the conventions of the HK Kung Fu flicks of the Seventies which admittedly does help when viewing Kung Fu Hustle EVERYONE in the US knows soccer. I think Soccer could have been a US smash along the lines of Crouching Tiger if handled properly.In a perfect world the more easily digestible Shaolin Soccer would have been Chow's huge US hit paving the way in the American public imagination for this far superior follow up. If Chow had become the US star he should have a couple of years ago Americans would have lined up for Hustle even if they had never seen a kung fu movie in their lives. But it was not to be. People didn't know who Chow was and couldn't tell what kind of film was being marketed they went into the theatres expecting to see a dumbass gross out parody and left disappointed.It's just not right that more folks in the US haven't seen this great film. Let's hope for a second life in the USA from good DVD sales.psand by the way I don't think Kung Fu Hustle is really doing parodies of either The Matrix or Reservoir Dogs as is way too often mentioned in reviews. Both of those flicks borrowed HEAVILY from previous Hong Kong movies so I think it much more likely that Chow was referencing the original Hong Kong movies with which he and other Asians would be most familiar not the American imitators.".

Let's hope for a second life in the USA from good DVD sales.psand by the way I don't think Kung Fu Hustle is really doing parodies of either The Matrix or Reservoir Dogs as is way too often mentioned in reviews. Both of those flicks borrowed HEAVILY from previous Hong Kong movies so I think it much more likely that Chow was referencing the original Hong Kong movies with which he and other Asians would be most familiar not the American imitators.";

Afterwards I wanted to tell people how funny it was but every time I tried I would start laughing again simply from thinking about it. Stephen Chow is incredibly funny and talented. Its hard to write why the film is funny without spoiling it but I'll give it my best shot because Kong Fu Hustle deserves to be seen without having any preconceived notions about it.The principal actors are all very funny and have great sense of timing and even though I saw the film subtitled it didn't make it any worse. Especially Stephen Chow is funny and both his posture facial expressions and general timing is high above average. I also like the fact that he has a high degree of selfirony and is not afraid to let the joke be on him which pretty much all the jokes in the film are. Among other actors worth mentioning are Wah Yuen who plays the landlord and Qiu Yuen who plays the landlady. They both seem enthusiastic about the project. The supporting cast is pretty good as well.The acting is not in the high seat however. Obviously the main attraction is the action and all action scenes are brilliant. They are executed in a very stylish and aesthetic manner and are also very very funny. There are scenes that were just beautiful and left me breathless but they never lose the selfirony which is so incredibly well executed and are therefore also incredibly entertaining. Much more than in other Hong Kong action movies like Hero which in my opinion could have done with a dose of selfirony. The computer effects are blatantly obvious but they still seem pretty believable within the confines of the film universe and they are generally very well done. Also I found the burly brawl sequence to be incredible and it had me in stitches. Overall the effects and fight scenes make the film very worthwhile and therefore highly recommendable.Overall Kong Fu Hustle is an incredible achievement in film making and everyone who is not afraid to see the Hong Kong action genre spoofed should definitely watch it.810".

The kidnapping is soon followed by the gruesome murder of another woman Polly and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down one by one. Sinister even by Whitechapel standards the murder grabs the attention of Inspector Fred Abberline a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his psychic abilities.

This is a proper grownups movie that probes some of the darkest regions of the human psyche places mainstream filmmakers like Lucas Spielberg James Cameron and their ilk don't dare to go or couldn't go even if they wanted to.

FROM HELL is a perfect example.  For the record the theory behind the killings is pretty much right out of JACK THE RIPPER THE FINAL SOLUTION by Stephen Knight and it's been pretty well discredited since it first came out twenty years ago even though it makes a hell of an entertaining piece of fiction.I completely discount any criticisms of the movie where people say it didn't happen that way.  Of course it didn't that's why this is a fictional film and not a documentary.  It's very loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel and about all it retains of it is the Duke of Clarence theory and the stylish look of the architecture.  It's enough to make the film beautiful to watch.Yes I know that four of the five victims of Jack the Ripper were women in their late 40's which on the streets of Victorian London would mean that they would resemble crones in their late 60's or early 70's.  Just try to make that fly past a Hollywood studio boss the casting at least had women who looked fairly human rather than like fallen glamour girls.  I've read a couple of comments disparaging the accents.  Actually Cockney accents were the norm in the street because people tried to blend in and often weren't eager to advertise Scottish or Irish origins.  I call special attention to the performance of Jason Flemyng in the role of Netley the coachman arguably the most fascinating and believable character in the whole production.  Most of his best scenes ended up on the cutting room floor unfortunately and yet he still manages to pull the movie together into a cohesive whole just by his presence.  It must have been a heck of a fun role to play!  As well Sir Ian Holm deserves special mention for stepping in when the original choice for his role Sir Nigel Hawthorne tragically became ill and died just before the film went into production.  I have never seen Sir Ian in any role that I didn't find completely believable and that ranges all the way from KING LEAR to his role in ALIEN for heaven's sake.My interest in the whole Jack the Ripper case has been reawakened thanks to this movie and I'm trying to hunt down a copy of Alan Moore's graphic novel which is very difficult to find.  No it's not even close to an approximation of what really happened nobody will ever know the truth Patricia Cornwell's arrogant claims notwithstanding.  It's still worth renting if only for the beautifully ominous score and the fascinating transformation of Prague into Victorian London.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A dark and meticulous tale based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents  Heather Graham and Johnny Depp I'm talking to you and the direction assured the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn't stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes. Why did I enjoy this film I hear you ask? For a start the direction was superb  the streets of London looked grimy while the unfortunates' i.e. prostitutes wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate. This produced a wonderful atmosphere creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking and very gruesome. Johnny Depp's performance as the detective Abberline as always was hugely enjoyable to watch. He played his character in a very subtle way  halfway between comic and serious. He portrays a desperate man constantly resorting to drugs so he can pass through the day. Depp and the filmmakers see him as a version of Sherlock Holmes constantly finding clues that other police officers have overlooked cliched yes but somehow Depp provides a little bit of originality. Abberline even suggests that the killer must be a learned man! How could this be?! While dismissed by all the other characters in the film for a learned man would never commit acts of such debauchery we as an audience know better not to trust a detective like this  their preposterous ideas are usually right. Another actor to praise in this is the wonderful Ian Holm. He plays his character with a wry little smile seemingly enjoying every line he says. His interactions with Depp are great to watch.While the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.For those that care I gave this film 710".

His interactions with Depp are great to watch.While the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.For those that care I gave this film 710";

	schema:headline " Interesting spin on the tale if not particularly memorable";
	schema:reviewBody "From Hell is an interesting spin on the familiar Jack the Ripper tale using the iconic cultural image of the cloaked man with the top hat as the source for a spinoff not of history but of a graphic novel.The lead performance by Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline who really existed in 1888 at the time of the murders and really was an authority on the case is wonderful. Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately Heather Graham  as the prostitute Mary Kelley  is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals for most of From Hell's duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.That said the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane as one of the police officers involved in the case has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch and similarly as convincing as the scenery.This is a very gritty and gory film  more so than I ever expected. It's quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals horror elements and history thrown in for good measure on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique and very different and not particularly because it was great. I didn't expect a whole lot but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could or should have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one's sense of history. Like Disney's Pocahontas. The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing if only for its originality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack the Ripper but surprisingly this was my first film based on the story. From Hell is an outstanding mystery and a dark moody film. This is the type of film that sticks in your mind days after seeing it. You'll have the image of old Whitechaple in your head. You'll have the terrific murder scenes stuck in your head but most of all you'll have the image of Jack the Ripper in your head. From Hell will disturb you. It might scare you and it might even bore you action fans will not enjoy this film. From Hell is certainly not for everyone but it certainly was for me.Johnny Depp is fantastic. He is one of my favorite actors and certainly delivers the goods in From Hell. His performance is perfect and one of his bests yet. Heather Graham also does a fine job in From Hell. I was surprised with her performance. I'll admit when I heard she was going to be in the film I was worried. I mean who doesn't get worried when they find out the same actress who was in Austin Powers 2 is going to be in a Jack the Ripper film. But she did surprise me although I still think she could have done better.The Hughes brothers direct this film with such style. The use of colors in the film is beautiful as is the use of lighting. The camera angles are crazy and the film turns out a beauty. Trevor Jones' score is great As a matter of fact I'm listening to it now and fits the film perfectly. The music is eerie creepy and scary. It's flawless.The murder mystery is also great. It keeps you guessing the whole way through I was not successful in guessing who Jack was and when the killer is revealed it all makes sense. And let me tell you From Hell is violent! Although not as gory as I expected it to be it'll still make you cringe that throat slash!. A lot of the violence takes place off screen which lets your imagination run wild and mine did just thatMy head was filled with tons of gory images.A lot of people call From Hell boring. I can see how they think that but I disagree completely with that. Sure the film is slow moving but how fast can a murder mystery movie be? I didn't get bored with the film at all... I was completely absorbed in the film. Another problem people found with this film was the love story which I have to agree with. Had the love story been more developed the ending would have been much more depressing as we would have felt for the characters more This could be what kept the film from an A rating.As I said before From Hell is great. It is my 3rd favorite film of the year and my second favorite horror film this year. It's a dark compelling film that is NOT FUN! There is no comic relief it's all horror. Had it been a little more scary and had the love story been more developed this film would be an A. I highly recommend fans stay away because you'll hate it.this film to fans of Jack the Ripper and horror fans with patience. ActionFrom Hell 9.510 A".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was good but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it I thought it looked nice but moved too fast was a little dumb. But by the end I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure it's a triumph of style over substance but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.I would compare From Hell most closely to Alex Proyas' 1997 triumph Dark City which like From Hell made almost nothing at the box office. I hope like Dark City that From Hell will win a larger audience on video. It's not as intelligent as Dark City which was brilliant in nearly every way but From Hell equals it in visual virtuosity. Its story while sometimes lapsing into silliness is enormously gripping. It's also one of the few horror films to succeed at inducing a sense of dread in the audience. A Scotland Yard detective played well by Johnny Depp is on the case of Jack the Ripper who is himself on the trail of a group of five prostitutes. On the way Depp discovers that the ritualistic murders are part of a larger conspiracy. The film is full of great twists the biggest one being simply hilarious in its level of audacity. The end is quite unpredictable although the climax is a little too predictable.There are several minor flaws in the film. It does go a bit too fast but its breathless pace ends up paying off well in the end. Many people will be turned off at the level of gore in the film. Seriously avoid it at all costs if you have a weak stomach. But if you could take it in Silence of the Lambs Se7en or Sleepy Hollow you'll be fine. I actually felt that those three particular films flaunted their gore and were tremendously ineffective in their horror. Yes even and perhaps especially Silence of the Lambs. I don't know why but I didn't feel that way about From Hell. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Gloomy down beat Victorian thriller that doesn't quite make the kill";
	schema:reviewBody "From Hell is another JacktheRipper yarn. This time around Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick George Abberline who is investigating the work of a killer carving up the bodies of prostitutes in Whitechapel London.From Hell is a borderline horrorthriller. There is a fantastical element to the story as Depp receives visions of the killings when chasing the dragon or in simpler terms when doped up to his eyeballs. These visions are used to make madintuitive leaps on Abberline's parts to help push along the storyline as the bodies begin to pile up. Unfortunately the killer is quite obvious as the script provides red herrings which are set up in a manner that you know they're going to be false so the viewer is surprised or not when the real killer is revealed. That's a shame as it removes some of the mystery from the movie when you realise you got it right. There's also a rather interesting take on the murderer's reasoning which is not entirely unwelcome but does feel somewhat as if they need to pad out the story and distinguish it from other Ripper yarns.Depp is as usual good. His accent appears a bit muddled however  where is he supposed to be from? But as Hollywood standards go it's better than average. Robbie Coltrane provides the humour such as there is by being Abberline's quipping sidekick making dry observations of the situations he finds himself in. Coltrane has shown his acting skills in the TV series Cracker and he doesn't strain himself here nor does he outshine himself. The rest of the cast are grand but Heather Graham as the whore whom Depp falls for is unconvincing as she looks far too pretty and well mannered to be a lady of the night.The direction is alright. The Hughes' brothers manage to convey a generally downbeat and sombre tone to the proceedings. The vision sequences however come across as slightly comicbooky a reminder of movies of the 60s70s where they went overboard on filters and camera distortions in order to depict insanity. Far more effective is the bleak visions used in the TV show Millennium  here it tends to detract from the seriousness of the moment. Some of the scenes are fairly gory  it features a quite gruesome throat slashing  while other times the violence is seen purely in the reactions of others without having to expose the viewer to it. Both of these work well. All in all the Hughes' acquit themselves because they fail to actually show a bright clear image until the very very end of the movie where the image is accompanied by one of the darkest in the movie. Thus they effectively capture the mood of the city and the times.From Hell suffers from having a lack of tension and a script where characters tend to take on almost caricature tones some of the prostitutes and the Nickel's gang in particular come across as hamfisted. Nevertheless there's a mood to the movie and Depp's performance is convincing enough to keep you watching until the decidedly downbeat end. Recommended for fans of the Victorian thrillerhorror genre and those seeking a halfdecent movie. 6.410".

Sleepy Hollow was a masterful reenvisioning of the classic story of Ichabod Crane featuring a nice blend of mystery  horror. From Hell seemed like a natural extension of this character archetype with a looselybased historical inspiration adding weight to the horrific scenarios that it depicts. With that in mind I decided to check it out.There are many things that are done right in this movie number one being the atmosphere. London is gray rainy  dark and its desperate citizens reflect this foreboding setting well. The women whore themselves out for an extra cent while the men retain control through intimidation  violence. Racial tensions corrupt officials and secret societies complicate the picture and the actors in their elaborate costumes capture the unrest perfectly. As the film is a work of historical fiction it takes liberties in the portrayal of certain eventsfacts but only for the purpose of increasing the dramatic potential of the plot. In fact these little deviations in historical accuracy felt very creative and mostly fit in with the ambiguous nature of one the most infamous unsolved mysteries.The faults while noticeable are not disqualifying. The characters are played well despite being mostly unremarkable to begin with. Depp's Inspector Abberline is likable though his behavior is inconsistent. As an opium addict he seems content to waste away his life in an altered state yet jumps into action without hesitation and utterly dedicates himself to risk life and limb tracking down a vicious serial killer  sifting through the lies that keep him so elusive. This also serves to make his relationship with Heather Graham as the female lead seem slightly artificial. The visionary opiuminduced haze that enables him to keep pace with the killer was an interesting touch but wasn't utilized to its full potential in my opinion. Also the killer's character is not developed enough and so comes across as cartoonishly scary lacking in realism.Ultimately this is a tense thriller that will captivate your attention with a unique interpretation of the Jack the Ripper mythos.".

	schema:headline " Jack the Ripper is the ostensible subject of Albert and Allen Hughes' From Hell but this legendary figure is more a point of departure an obviously sensational hook than the film's focus.";
	schema:reviewBody "30 Second Bottom Line The infamous Jack the Ripper serial killer mystery unfolds in Victorian England as a stylistic who dun it.From Hell is an exciting murder mystery with a number of hints about who dun it to keep things interesting every step of the way. Depp gives his expected outstanding and other worldly performance. Ian Holm Katrin Cartlidge Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson and some of the unnamed prostitutes give the film an edge that takes us back a century in time. Heather Graham is OK and I'm pleased to see her doing something beyond Say it Isn't So and more along the lines of Sidewalks of New York. She is however a little too pretty sophisticated charming and clean for a street ho. Katrin Cartlidge would have been a better Mary. It's a little bit of a stretch to envision the Inspector and the whore Mary falling in love but stranger things have happened.It's always gratifying to see actors writers and directors grow and certainly the Hughes Brothers are doing that. They have not made a lot of films but each one is very good. The two could be a Stanley Kubrick in the making as he only made 13 films during a long respected and controversial career. Since 1993 they've made Menace II Society Dead Presidents and American Pimp. From Hell is more sophisticated while still retaining a dark tone that is not depressing. Peter Deming as cinematographer has outdone himself with From Hell and Mulholland Drive. It's clearly Oscar caliber work.Although From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell with the focus on a real killer in 1888 the film is not trying to be a JFK and convince us how it really happened. That said when you realize who the killer is you are faced with an interesting hypothesis.Jack the Ripper may have been crazy but he was acting out of logic his own to be sure and for a reason other than wanting to kill a few prostitutes. The fog in London finally is lifted on the murder mystery and on the Hughes Brothers being great directors.Message on the movie We can't always have what we want from life. Evil exists.

	onyx:emotionText "30 Second Bottom Line The infamous Jack the Ripper serial killer mystery unfolds in Victorian England as a stylistic who dun it.From Hell is an exciting murder mystery with a number of hints about who dun it to keep things interesting every step of the way. Depp gives his expected outstanding and other worldly performance. Ian Holm Katrin Cartlidge Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson and some of the unnamed prostitutes give the film an edge that takes us back a century in time. Heather Graham is OK and I'm pleased to see her doing something beyond Say it Isn't So and more along the lines of Sidewalks of New York. She is however a little too pretty sophisticated charming and clean for a street ho. Katrin Cartlidge would have been a better Mary. It's a little bit of a stretch to envision the Inspector and the whore Mary falling in love but stranger things have happened.It's always gratifying to see actors writers and directors grow and certainly the Hughes Brothers are doing that. They have not made a lot of films but each one is very good. The two could be a Stanley Kubrick in the making as he only made 13 films during a long respected and controversial career. Since 1993 they've made Menace II Society Dead Presidents and American Pimp. From Hell is more sophisticated while still retaining a dark tone that is not depressing. Peter Deming as cinematographer has outdone himself with From Hell and Mulholland Drive. It's clearly Oscar caliber work.Although From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell with the focus on a real killer in 1888 the film is not trying to be a JFK and convince us how it really happened. That said when you realize who the killer is you are faced with an interesting hypothesis.Jack the Ripper may have been crazy but he was acting out of logic his own to be sure and for a reason other than wanting to kill a few prostitutes. The fog in London finally is lifted on the murder mystery and on the Hughes Brothers being great directors.Message on the movie We can't always have what we want from life. Evil exists. Victorian England was a very unpleasant place and era.So the conclusion is that this movie is a fair movie althouht actually it hadn't got a very clear ending it is fantastic thriller to watch and remember don't miss this one.";

It's so dark that it makes Seven look like The Wizard of Oz. Then again you wouldn't expect a movie based on Jack the Ripper to be light and cheery now would you?London 1888. A young prostitute was murdered in the Whitechapel district. The police enlist the help of Fredrick Abberline Johnny Depp because of the savagery of the murder and because his opium hallucinations help him solve crimes. But more victims fall Abberline begins to realize that these murders are connected.The film has a brilliantly dark atmosphere. You know that odd creepy feeling you get when you read about haunted mental asylums and images of demented doctors performing horrific experiments come to mind? That's what From Hell feels like. It's an unsettling feeling and the Hughes Brothers are skillful in their employment of this unnerving feeling.The acting is solid although the film's best hand is the atmosphere. Johnny Depp who according to his IMDb bio is fascinated by Jack the Ripper plays things straight as far as Depp can go in that direction. Heather Graham is also solid as Mary Kelly the prostitute that Abberline develops feelings for. She speaks with a credible Cockney accent and tones down the perkiness that she's known for to a very low level. Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane provide good support as well.The problem with the film is the story. Whether it was in the scripting stage or in production the story is confusing at times particularly at the end. This is one of those movies where you have to pay attention or else you will get lost which is quite possible considering how strong the atmosphere is.Let me make myself clear this is a very dark and disturbing film. Most of the violence and gore are left to the imagination which will be on overkill due to grisly descriptions of the murders but there is no doubt that this movie deserves as hard of an R rating as can be found. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the bloodphobic.".

Directed by the Hughes Brothers much is made of Inspector Abeline's opium Absynth and strychnine addiction something associated more with Sherlock Holmes than Abeline although historically accurate as the drugs of choice for the Victorian gent in London .Johnny Depp an actor who seems to pick roles which allow him to showcase his versatility is convincing as Abeline the unfortunate detective who became a sacrificial scapegoat offered up to the frustrated and furious Londoners by a powerful Masonic order. His London accent varies through the film and is reminiscent of his Jack Sparrow. Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order. The film is filled with factual aspects such as the pressure put upon Abeline to find a Jew butcher as the murderer the chalk writing being washed off the wall and the intentional misspelling of Juwes. Equally it's full of assumptions however I couldn't help feeling it's the closest any film has come to the truth. No one has ever sufficiently answered how Jack the Ripper was able to get in and out of east London unseen and un stopped and the murders swift and brutal over a short period seemed to end as quickly as they had begun without reason or answer.The plot is simple to follow and unfolds with ease as the film progresses there are no surprises or ridiculous unbelievable twists but there are some problems with the film. You're repeatedly bombarded with surreal drug influenced moments expected to believe in a miss fitting romance subplot asked not to question set and costume design which is accurately Victorian but seems too clean and bright for the age. Perhaps the directors felt Abeline's drug induced visions were important and purposely avoided the classic Victorian smog and squalor we think of to give a bright and fresh feel . Additionally less is made of Jack the Ripper's acts themselves. Given that the film is titled From Hell which is how the genuine Ripper letters were addressed surprisingly the letters and body parts he sent to the newspapers and Scotland Yard is hardly touched upon as the film seems to concern itself more with Abeline and the Masons rather than Jack and his actions. We shouldn't forget how disturbed the mind of Jack the Ripper was and perhaps the fact that somehow these events were indeed covered up even to this day the directors were perhaps right to focus on those who sought to perpetrate the cover up than remake a story told so many times before. That said all these things do leave you feeling that the film is not sure of it's own identity and is somewhat confused schizophrenic even. Enjoyable none the less.710".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has good lighting directing and acting but the plot is horrible.  I watched Menace II Society and Dead Pres and they were both great films.  It seemed like the Hughes bros. were in their element. Unfortunately they stepped into the the wrong arena in this movie.  You can notice flashes of brilliance in their direction but the plot moves along at a snails pace.  Don't watch this movie if you want to see a redeemable representation of Jack the Ripper it isn't about that at all.  It seems to me that they used the Jack the Ripper storyline as a catalyst to show late 19th Century London.  The entire movie is dark dank and downtrodden.By the end of this film I felt ripped off.  Depp and Grahm are good maybe even great at their jobs but their talents are squandered in this film. The directors try and turn the story of a sadistic killer into a love story. The problem with their attempted love story is that Depp and Grahm hardly interact at all before the last few scenes.  Ahhh why do all movies end up like this??   Can't there not be a female protagonist for Depp to fall for. I wish.  Oh well I applaud the Hughes bros. for attempting to make a stylized movie about Jack but they fall short in the plot dialogue and the whole Jack the Ripper story.Bottom line watch this movie if you A like either Depp or Grahm B enjoy watching interesting dirction with little or no plot to attach itself to. or C  enjoy watching old time London where women are treated like dirt. Don't watch this movie if you A enjoy films where the plot and the direction correlate to create meaning.  B  if you have a weak stomach or are a femenist.  or C  If you expect this to be even close to as good as Meance II Society one of my all time favorites or Dead Presidents.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie has good lighting directing and acting but the plot is horrible.  I watched Menace II Society and Dead Pres and they were both great films.  It seemed like the Hughes bros. were in their element. Unfortunately they stepped into the the wrong arena in this movie.  You can notice flashes of brilliance in their direction but the plot moves along at a snails pace.  Don't watch this movie if you want to see a redeemable representation of Jack the Ripper it isn't about that at all.  It seems to me that they used the Jack the Ripper storyline as a catalyst to show late 19th Century London.  The entire movie is dark dank and downtrodden.By the end of this film I felt ripped off.  Depp and Grahm are good maybe even great at their jobs but their talents are squandered in this film. The directors try and turn the story of a sadistic killer into a love story. The problem with their attempted love story is that Depp and Grahm hardly interact at all before the last few scenes.  Ahhh why do all movies end up like this??   Can't there not be a female protagonist for Depp to fall for. I wish.  Oh well I applaud the Hughes bros. for attempting to make a stylized movie about Jack but they fall short in the plot dialogue and the whole Jack the Ripper story.Bottom line watch this movie if you A like either Depp or Grahm B enjoy watching interesting dirction with little or no plot to attach itself to. or C  enjoy watching old time London where women are treated like dirt. Don't watch this movie if you A enjoy films where the plot and the direction correlate to create meaning.  B  if you have a weak stomach or are a femenist.  or C  If you expect this to be even close to as good as Meance II Society one of my all time favorites or Dead Presidents.";

	schema:reviewBody "From Hell is a gruesome portrait of murder in London during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of Jack the Ripper a psychotic individual who murdered 5 prostitutes. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the inspector who tries to hunt him down and delivers one of the best performances of his career. The story is well written by the Hughes Brothers and is a truly enjoyable film for anyone who loves the horror genre. However it is the predictability of this film and the performance of Heather Graham which provides From Hell with a downfall. The spoken dialogue between Depp and a good doctor lets you easily figure out who the murderer is. It does not supply the audience with a surprise or twist. Heather Graham's performance is purely simple and does not illustrate her capable talent. She does not deliver a wellrounded performance as Mary Kelly also a prostitute because she does not show essential emotion i.e. fear in order to fulfill her role. However the film is an exceptional horror picture and should not be overlooked by any fan of movies.".

The theme has been used in many previous Ripper movies in particular the 1988 madeforTV Jack the Ripper with Michael Caine as Inspector Abberline and Murder by Decree with Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes ...This 2001 version is similar but whereas the two aforementioned films are terribly enjoyable the 1988 TV movie particularly so despite being inaccurate in their historical details the new movie is simply terrible. Abberline Johnny Depp is a druggie who uses opium to see details of brutal murders and solves the case. Good job because he doesn't do any real police work at any stage in the movie even by 1888 standards ...Mary Kelly Heather Graham is the whore with a heart of gold who is sober and pretty right through the movie with her makeup perfect even when languishing at the Ten Bells. She never actually plies her trade though do the stage is all set for the fairy tale ending. And so on and so forth.I won't even bother to point out the many many many factual inaccuracies and plain untruths in the film. That would fill too many pages on its own.Most of the acting throughout is hammy and way overthetop. The dialogue is appalling and the directors haven't really read their own script. For example it is clearly stated in the film that the murders were committed in the dark. Well they were.There were few gas lights in Whitechapel in 1888. The place was pitchblack as soon as night fell hence the real Jack could get away with his slayings. Of course in the movie the stage  and it is clearly a sound stage this is not art direction of the highest order  is nicely lit all the way gas lights as far as the eye can see. But heck this is the Hollywood version. Except this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula Hollywood. That was nicely done. This is daytime TV Hollywood as regards plot dialogue character developement cinematography and direction ...Small bonus points in this shammy film Ian Holm splendid as usual as Sir William Gull Robbie Coltrane fine as Sergeant Godley Ian Richardson splendid as always. Otherwise a really bad film. Stay clear. Or rent the 1988 version on video.".

As for me being a Yank and all I neither noticed nor cared too much whether either Depp or Graham turned out a spotless British Cockney Irish or whathaveyou accent because ultimately I don't know enough about those accents to be able to make an informed opinion. So in that respect I was rather neutral on the whole accent business throughout the film.Yes I know what an authentic BCI accent sounds like and I too noticed that these weren't flawless but I never gave it much thought as both of them seemed at least realistic and convincing enough to allow me to enjoy the overall atmospheric look and feel of the movie which was far more important.That being said I can see where you are coming from. It would be the equivalent of watching a movie say featuring Medieval warriors doing battle where everything in the battle scenes  the weapons battle flags helmets spears horses etc. are just spoton accurately depicted but horror! here and there you notice that a few of the foot soldiers are seen to be wearing modernday wrist watches and sunglasses or sporting the latest pair of Nike running shoes on their feet. Distracting to say the least  and potentially ruinous to the whole magic of the movie experience.I get the same reaction I guess when I see American actors who were born north of the MasonDixon line attempting to do a realistic sounding Southern accent. My own mother was born and raised in the Deep South I've personally traveled throughout much of the South and as such I can spot a real Southern accent from a fake one from at least a mile away. Good example of a nonSuthnah' doing an incredible Southern accent Fred Gwynne bornraised in NYNY as Judge Chamberlain Haller in 1992's My Cousin Vinny.But these comments about accents do raise some interesting critical questions. Namely should Gollywood try to make more of an effort in casting the most appropriate and realistic actor or actress in every cast opening? Hmm let's see Inspector Abberline was from Dorset... perhaps the producers of this film could have or should have found an actor born and bred in Dorset to fill the role of Inspector Abberline? Sorry I don't right off hand know any actors originally from Dorset so you'll have to provide me a name if you know of one!. But on the other hand and we all know this stubborn little fact of filmdom... yes that's right they have to sell those tickets they have to fill those seats in the theaters folks. And Johnny Depp  say what you will about him  he does at least have that fill the seats sort of boxoffice magnetism.I have always admired Johnny Depp and I like much of his body of work. And I hurry to say that I was not disappointed with his work in this film. I regret that for many of you he didn't make the grade as a convincing enough Inspector Abberline so much so that it ruined an otherwise absorbing and atmospheric film. I can only point out that given the realities and mysteries of casting it could have been worse. I mean thank God it wasn't Bill Murray playing the Inspector! Danny DeVito anyone?With the possible exception of calling the good folks at Central Casting I don't know what the answer is I don't know what we can do about it... Sorry I don't know their number but I know it ISN'T 1800GETREAL. But let me just close by saying that movies DO require a certain contribution of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. Until the folks at Central Casting can come up with perfect matches for every cast part or until actors and actresses can effortlessly adopt themselves to the subtleties of a regional or foreign dialect well we will just have to deal with it won't we?".

	schema:reviewBody "A hitman a helicopter an unforgettable climactic sequence a thriller a music  It's sad that 90 of movie fans now remember The Professional as a great actionthriller film made by a French director named  Luc Besson and featuring the acting debut of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno as a professional hitman protecting her from the claws of a demented cop played by Gary Oldman. I guess EVERYONE in America associates THIS title with THIS film while in France and probably in Europe when people think of The Professional there's a beautiful melody instantly resonating in their mind a penetrating score that conveys the fatality hanging over the shoulders of one of the greatest antiheroes of French Cinema Joss Beaumont played by JeanPaul Belmondo in his career's most defining role and the notes I'm thinking of while writing these lines are certainly some of the greatest that ever enriched Cinema's musical memories a sound made by the great Ennio Morricone. If you haven't seen the film and if you're unfamiliar with the music I allow you to suspend the reading of this review because it's so pointless compared to the beauty of The Professional's score. And I implore you to go listen to it before getting back to this useless assemblage of words.What is The Professional or who is he? I don't know if this really matters if you don't plan to watch the film. It's so simplistic in its premise that it can be compared to anything made before or after like The Day of the Jackal or even the 1994's Professional after all you have your traditional catandmouse chase between a killer with a sense of honor and the cops and politicians whose ambiguous motives make you inevitably root for their target. Manipulation? No the film is simply above these considerations when you watch it you understand that it doesn't have no purpose else than to captivate you until a rewarding confrontation. It still has an average 80's Bmovie feel some campy acting some visual and sound effects that need to be reconsidered the blood looks like red paint in fact the form is as simplistic as the content. And the treatment toward women is exquisitely misogynistic in the purest tradition of James Bond films where even in the most honorable woman there's something slutty waiting for the magnetic Belmondo to exude itself all the opportunities to expose some nude breasts or curvy legs are good but for some reason it suits the spirit of a film that doesn't embarrass itself with political correctness these were other days where movies obeyed to some formulas that didn't depend on the public's reaction. Indeed the script written by Michel Audiard one of the most popular French writers is a challenge for moral sensitivity since nobody's spared  Africans politicians women cops there's a cloud of badness contaminating the air and spilling over all the characters and in this environment where each works for his or her interest all we can do is to root for the man who follows his instinct his sense of duty his honor.Joss Beaumont is the man who was paid to kill the President of a fictional African country and was literally sold by his government. After two years he's back to France and determined to finish his job even if the President became a friend of France. People are so banally corrupted that the very notion of hero and villain becomes pointless. There's a great line coming from the African head of state who tells Joss that 'it took France two revolutions and five republics to become a very debatable form of democracy and he's supposed to do that in years?' During the disenchanted 70's when France was stricken by an economical crisis the infamous Giscard presidency and when the public was disillusioned with the power of law an icon had to incarnate this moral ambiguity between what is legal and is legitimate. Since his debuts with Melville Belmondo was born to play likable outlaws and needless to say that The Professional was tailormade for him.The movie has reached such an iconic status in France that it might catch offguard some younger or foreign audience because at first sight there's something almost deliberately poor in the way it's handled until the catandmouse aspect gradually turns more into a sort of chess game where Beaumont is so welltrained that he becomes a real mastermind using the greatest tricks he learned he even refers to chess by using the 'playing the whites' strategy the attack. And naturally there's always this feeling of everyone trying to anticipate the moves of the other to which person he'll get and what he'll do next. Beaumont's goal is clear assassinating the President and for cops stopping Beaumont by any means and for that job there's the unflappable face of Robert Hossein as Rosen the man who made it personal so calm so scary that he's the perfect antagonist to the flamboyant and charismatic Beaumont.To conclude whatever could be perceived as flaws is so archetypal of a certain breed of French cinema that it takes a sort of gourmet pleasure to appreciate it especially today when for the sake of realism the macho man has turned into a sexual beast and when characters are all bland and particularly unlikable. Interestingly one of the new generations actors who was inspired by Belmondo is Jean Dujardin and you can see how he inherited his mannerisms this mix of charisma and flamboyance. There are some times where nothing can beat oldschool cinema because it was so damn serious but never took itself seriously.And the last five minutes are so breathtaking that whatever flaws you may have pointed out it totally redeems the film especially thanks to the iconic score of Ennio Morricone. Simply put The Professional is one of the best French films!".

The whole thing is laughable thirty years later because we are used to Bourne Identities coming out of our fannies but this is how they made films before CGI and mega budgets a charming star an excellent ensemble cast wellmotivated action and a relatively tight script. Okay it's cheesy by modern standards but one must remember French politics re. Africa remember Bokassa? The French do and mercenaries. It makes more sense to the French and certainly didn't export well. But you can nonetheless see why Belmondo could get away with a certain wink at the camera Burt smarminess because he always played it with a touch of comedy and he was way more charming than Burt ever was. ALthough you can read this film as played for laughs at the time it's plot was believable and the coldhearted treatment of citizens by government forces is certainly more than believable to Europeans. Watch it and enjoy. How many low budget action films stand up 30 years later? This one does and the subtitling is pretty good.".

Okay it's cheesy by modern standards but one must remember French politics re. Africa remember Bokassa? The French do and mercenaries. It makes more sense to the French and certainly didn't export well. But you can nonetheless see why Belmondo could get away with a certain wink at the camera Burt smarminess because he always played it with a touch of comedy and he was way more charming than Burt ever was. ALthough you can read this film as played for laughs at the time it's plot was believable and the coldhearted treatment of citizens by government forces is certainly more than believable to Europeans. Watch it and enjoy. How many low budget action films stand up 30 years later? This one does and the subtitling is pretty good.";

The star was pushing fifty by this time with his famous looks already starting to fade actually I'd never watched a film of his following the actor's 1960s and 1970s heyday up till now!  but to get an inkling of what THE PROFESSIONAL is like think of a Charles Bronson vehicle from this same era with the protagonist proving virtually unstoppable and outwitting his pursuers at every turnonly this is a relatively more polished product with an eye less on exploitation than political maneuvering.The star is a secret agent sent on a mission to assassinate an African tyrant eventually the political climate changes and his superiors decide to sell him to the new African regime escaping after two years of hard labor he goes back to his homeland  just in time for a state visit from his previous target  letting his agency in on the fact that he intends to accomplish his initial mission regardless! And so starts the manhunt  with Minister Chief of Police Military Adviser who happens to be Belmondo's extutor and ruthless Special Squad official all involved. Several women also end up as pawns in the dangerous chess game  including Belmondo's wife his mistress a codebreaker at the agency and even the African President's choice hooker! As I said the film is actionpacked including a car chase supervised by Remy Julienne and a surprising Westernstyle showdown between Belmondo and Robert Hossein the sadistic leader of the Special Squad yet thoughtful with numerous ingenious plot twists and a delicious finale with the various officials not wanting to lose face after Belmondo's target has been 'terminated' arguing over how they should best tackle the matter  which is then somewhat inevitably followed by a downbeat 'curtain'. Driving the film along is an overpoweringly melancholic main theme which incidentally is one of master composer Ennio Morricone's most popular works curiously enough the theatrical trailer for THE PROFESSIONAL features music from another Morriconescored movie INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION 1970! Anyhow a rich vein of tongueincheek humor helps too though this is never allowed to take the upper hand the best line is when Belmondo abducts a member of the Special Squad with whom he has various runins throughout the film in order to infiltrate the African leader's heavilyguarded quarters a countryside chteau and he tells him Act stupid as usual so as not to draw attention to themselves interestingly coscreenwriter Michel Audiard disliked the finished film and subsequently disowned it! Unfortunately the version I watched via a French Box Set comprising three of the star's 1980s thrillers was dubbed in English  as the original language while available carried no subtitles! I now look forward to these other two films though I can't really anticipate whether they'll be of comparable quality...".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the rare instances when the music composer is the hero. This is Morricone's film. His famous tune chi mai is played throughout in many scenes and it lifts many ordinary parts to another level.On the surface the film is like a tongue in cheek revenge drama. BELMONDO plays a French Rambo who is sent to an African nation to assassinate its leader. But he is hung out to dry by the french intelligence services and is jailed following a public trial. After a dramatic escape from an African slave camp BELMONDO returns to France to take revenge on the people who betrayed him.If you look closely the film is an odd mix of many genres. It is not just an action film. sure there is a spaghetti western style shoot out a pulsating car chase and some seriously violent action. The women are all objects of sex who want to sleep with BELMONDO or get coffee for the superiors. But it is also a satire about the ridiculousness and incompetence of French intelligence agencies and how the leaders of first world countries and third world countries are in bed with each other. At one point a French intelligence agent remarks irritably about a countryside mansion where an African leader and his prostitute are residing  why are we deploying such a large police force to protect this whorehouse?The gritty and violent beginning in Africa seemed at odds with the BELMONDO's adventures in France.It is not a bad film. I'm sure there is a context which i don't really get because i'm no expert on French politics and foreign policy.BELMONDO is awesome. He must have been pretty old when he made this but he was really pumped up. The women are all nice eye candy. There is even a lesbian torturer who tries to move in on BELMONDO's wife only to get a karate chop on her neck.But like i said at the beginning the real hero is Morricone.".

	schema:headline " The perfect action movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "I usually don't reveal my final judgment of the movie straight away in the review's subject line but in the case of Le Professionnel I just felt like I had to tell it like it is This is simply put and without exaggerating the perfect popcornentertainment actionthriller and it catapulted itself straight towards a high position in my list of personal favorite movies of all times! Le Professionnel has a terrific screenplay with wonderfully deranged characters and plentiful of ultimately exciting action sequences. It also features the best JP Belmondo performance of his career by far and stellar support from the entire cast surrounding him. And then of course there's the truly phenomenal musical score of Ennio Morricone The astounding theme song Chi Mai perhaps wasn't originally composed for this particular film it appeared first in the obscure artfilm Maddalena in 1971 but it's forever unified with Le Professionnel and thanks to its immense commercial success the song also became one of the biggest hits in Morricone's inexhaustible repertoire! The basic plot of Le Professionnel is simple but very effective and compelling. Josselin Joss Beaumont is a highly trained French special agent who gets send to an unspecific African country on a secret mission to assassinate the corrupt selfelected President N'Jala. By the time his plane lands however the president has suddenly become a friend of the French nation and Beaumont's unscrupulous government sacrifices him. Beaumont is imprisoned under inhuman circumstances but after two long years he makes a daring escape and returns to France around the same time President N'Jala makes an official state visit. Once home he joyously informs his former superiors that he will fulfill his assignment and thus knowing Beaumont's skills and imaginative operating methods the secret service mobilizes their toughest agents to protect the president and to hunt down Beaumont. Le Professionnel is chock full of imaginative sequences that are simultaneously actionpacked comical and intensely built up towards! For example in order to reach apartment of his wife that is heavily guarded by several policemen Beaumont creates a diversion by hooking up with a group of homeless men and run amok in front of the apartment. Another example is how he always toys around with the media and stages cat andmouse games with the best agents on the force. The ultimate highlight is of course the virulent car chase through the narrow Parisian streets and even underneath the Eifel Tower! This scene becomes even more perplexing when you realize that Belmondo always performs his own stunts. The film also has the most diverse and eccentric supportive characters walking around. How about the vicious  cruel lesbian agent who nearly violates Joss' wife whilst interrogating her? Or the wicked inspector Farges who obsessively tracks down Joss because he repeatedly humiliated him. The most fascinating character next to Joss Beaumont of course is undoubtedly the Commissioner Rosen as depicted here by the severely underrated Robert Hossein. Rosen is a merciless stoic and persistent copper. He's the complete opposite of Beaumont which makes their confrontations uncomfortable and suspenseful for the viewer to look at. Especially their final confrontation is sheer genius and qualifies as the absolute best western scene in a non western movie! A mustsee".

	schema:reviewBody "Demolition Man 1993 is one of the best epic classic science fictionaction film of all time! I love this film to death it is StalloneSnipes futuristic science fiction action film from the 90's. They don't make like this movies anymore. I am a huge Stallone fan and Rambo is my favorite action movie franchise off all time with Cliffhanger and Demolition Man are two all time personal favorite Stallone action films of mine off all time. I know I didn't mention Cobra that was because I did not watch that film as kid I grow up watching Rambo trilogy Cliffhanger and Demolition Man. It is 21's century most dangerous cop VS 21's century most ruthless criminal. Aliens is my all time favorite science fiction action film Demolition Man is my second favorite science fiction action film off all time.I love the action sequences in this film I love the opening scene such a fantastic explosion in the beginning of the film when whole building explodes. Has been one of the biggest practical explosions in the film. All done for real no CGI. All the action sequences in the cryoprison at the end the fight between this two. I love the shootouts in the museum. The car chase in which you have an old car and Stallone goes on a top of a futuristic car on the top. Yes the film has a satire but Total Recall RoboCop and Starship Troopers also have satires in it so why Demolition Man shouldn't have humor or satire in it is beyond me.Sylvester Stallone is a renegade badass L.A. cop John Spartan called the Demolition Man who break rules and does what he does best to catch the bad guys. He will blow things up to get the job done and he does in this movie. Demolition Man defies my childhood and I love this movie to death!Wesley Snipes is Simon Phoenix a ruthless killer and a criminal and my opinion this is Wesley Snipes best movie ever. I love the futuristic world we see the future. I love Sandra Bullock in this movie she is a hot babe and really her best role. Right after Demolition Man Sandra went and make Speed another action film. Sandra Bullock I love she is a great actress I love her in Miss Congeniality films Speed and in many other films. Directed by Marco Brambilla and produced by Joel Silver and yes Marco Brambilla directed really great his best and only movie he ever directed. I wish Stallone would make movies like this today. Why can't the actor goe back to old school action movies again like he did with The Expendables 1 and 2. This is John Rambo Vs Blade. Yes I love Blade all three movies and I am a huge fan of this film. I know The Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgment Day are two of the best futuristic action science fiction films and they are good movies I like them so much. But I love Demolition Man movie way more I love Aliens Robocop Predator I love those movies from the 80's so much. I have this movie on Bluray and I am watching it constantly. It is Rated R and it is all practical done for real great effects great blood and even martial arts are in here. We see Stallone with two guns firing at Simon Phoenix. During the final shootout in the cryolab Spartan is seen dualwielding the Beretta 92FS and a Smith  Wesson 3914 in an epic battle between those two legendary icons I love it. 1010 I miss action movies from the 90's like are Rapid Fire Under Siege Speed Hard Target Hard Boiled Broken Arrow Universal Soldier Death Warrant Double Impact Showdown In Little Tokyo Die Hard With A Vengeance Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger Terminator 2 Judgment Day and even way more 90's action movies. They don't make em like this anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Demolition Man 1993 is one of the best epic classic science fictionaction film of all time! AN ALL TIME CLASSIC has it all explosions practical effects one liners 80s songfests soundtracks. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I love this film to death it is StalloneSnipes futuristic science fiction action flick of the 90's. They don't make like this anymore.Demolition Man is my favorite best Stallone Scifi action movie very awesome alongside with Rambo films. Demolition Man is one of the funniest most actionpacked and most poignant social satires of at least the last 22 years. It's not necessarily the easiest film to appreciate as it makes its points through extremely overthetop mindless action and tongueincheek purposefully cheesy plot and dialogue but it's well worth trying to acclimate oneself to the style if you're not an action or scifi fan as the satire cuts deep. There are other films with somewhat similar aims such as Total Recall 1990 and Starship Troopers 1997 which are perhaps just as good as Demolition Man but they certainly can't top it and they have aims other than the purely satirical. As a social commentary it's extraordinarily ontarget. I mean come on this is the movie where the joke was made that Schwarzenegger would be president and Taco Bell would win the franchise wars and what do you know? Now people want the constitution amended so Arnold can run for president and Taco Bell is winning the franchise wars they merged with Pizza Hut and KFC. One of Stallone's best Scifi action packed films. This film is phenomenal!Send a maniac to catch a maniac!!!!!!!! Sylvester Stallone is a legendary badass cop John Spartan Demolition Man he plays by his own rules and he does what he does best to catch the bad guys. He will blow things up to get the job done and he does in this movie. Demolition Man defies my childhood and I love this movie to death! The cast the script the story itself all of these elements come together to make this one of the best action movies of the 90s. This movie does have a few surprises and it is not above making fun of itself or the action movie genre Denis Leary is a wonderful touch!. It is a perfect addition to an action movie night or collection. The movie has humor a little comedy and pure action that the gunplay is delivered in perfect StalloneSnipes style  you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. Stallone uses hand guns including a Remington shotgun. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments I counted TEN allstar ones during my last viewing and they're evenly spaced through the movie. The martial arts are excellent so are the cryoprision scenes. Terrific special effects and art direction. Marco Brambilla did a great direction debut of directing of one of my all time classic scifi action movies! This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say. The vision of future world here is undeniably original and memorable. What is more admirable is that many of things seen here are happening in REAL world. Demolition Man shows what would happen if the politics will went to far with it.Anyway I love this film I grew up with Demolition Man beside Cliffhanger is my second best favorite action Stallone movie!!! The rating I am giving is a 10 because the film isn't a 6 but it is a perfect 10. It is a film that is an underrated cult classic movie that I will always enjoy and cherish it to death!!! Demolition Man is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Marco Brambilla in his directorial debut. The film stars Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. The film was released in the United States on October 8 1993.Demolition Man is a 1993 sciencefiction action film starring Sylvester Stallone as John Spartan a Los Angeles cop with a reputation for destruction who in the then future year of 1996 is found guilty of a crime he didn't commit and is subsequently sentenced to be frozen in a cryogenic prison along with his nemesis Simon Phoenix Wesley Snipes. Spartan is then revived in the year 2032 and finds himself in the city of San Angeles when Phoenix escapes. Spartan is then asked by the San Angeles police force to use his old school tactics to take down his archenemy. The film's cast also includes Sandra Bullock Benjamin Bratt and Denis Leary. The film is notable for featuring one of the first and only appearances of the Heckler  Koch G11 an experimental rifle at the time that was portrayed as futuristic magnetic pulse rifle. 1010 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

	schema:reviewBody "John Spartan Sylvester Stallone is a reckless Los Angeles policeman known as the demolition man for the destruction he routinely engenders while apprehending big baddies. After a particularly ruthless criminal Simon Phoenix Wesley Snipes sets him up by making it appear that Spartan wantonly caused the deaths of a bus load of hostages Spartan is sentenced to 60 years or so in prison. The film begins in a nottoodistant future relative to its 19921993 production date of 1996. Prisons are quite a bit different and there's a new policy of cryogenically freezing inmates. We cut forward to 2032. Phoenix is up for an obligatory parole hearing when he escapes. The film's 21st Century society is extremely different worsening cultural chaos exacerbated by a huge earthquake precipitated the change and the San Angeles police cannot capture Phoenix or keep him in check. Chief Earle makes a decision to revive Spartan reasoning that an out of control but effective cop mired in the ways of the late 20th Century may be the only one who can capture the out of control criminal but he and the future society may be in for a lot more than they bargained for by reawakening the Demolition Man.Demolition Man is one of the funniest most actionpacked and most poignant social satires of at least the last 30 years. It's not necessarily the easiest film to appreciate as it makes its points through extremely overthetop mindless action and tongueincheek purposefully cheesy plot and dialogue but it's well worth trying to acclimate oneself to the style if you're not an action or scifi fan as the satire cuts deep. There are other films with somewhat similar aims such as Total Recall 1990 and Starship Troopers 1997 which are perhaps just as good as Demolition Man but they certainly can't top it and they have aims other than the purely satirical.The opening scene feels like a typical late 1980searly 1990s action sequence. At least until we realize that there's not going to be a happy ending for the hostages that Spartan is trying to save. Once we arrive at the future a lot of viewers might misjudge the performances of the principal cast besides Stallone and Snipes. Sandra Bullock as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley a reference to Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World and Benjamin Bratt as Alfredo Garcia a reference to Sam Peckinpah's 1974 film Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia at first seem to be turning in bizarrely incompetent performances. It's only later that we realize they are spot on for the film's brave new world which is basically an instantiation of a staunchly moralist cult run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau a reference to famed director Jean Cocteau combined with Cocteau's friend novelist Raymond Radiguet.Technically the film is quite impressive. The production design cinematography effects staging of the action sequences score and soundtrack are excellent. But what sets Demolition Man a cut above the rest are the script and the performancesyes even from Stallone and Snipes although Bullock and especially Denis Leary in a relatively minor part where he gets to do his motormouthed ranting comedy schtick that made him famous both threaten to steal the show.Director Marco Brambilla who has remained oddly inactive since Demolition Man which was his first film and his writing team skewer a lot of cultural norms as relatively arbitrary conventions. Radio and television commercial jingles are considered the pinnacle of musical art in the film's world. Strict morality is enforced through constant computer monitoring of behavior combined with finesa running joke throughout the film is that profanity results in fines. Meat and alcohol have been outlawed. So has physical contact including sex. All restaurants are now Taco Bells in some cuts of the film intended for foreign markets this was changed to Pizza Hut instead. There is an underground outside of the cultic mainstream society but they're literally underground living relatively lawless well at least they eat meat and drink beers in tunnels strewn with utility pipes.As a result serious crime is a thing of the past swept under the rug or into the sewers and labeled with Orwellian newspeak. Phoenix and Spartan's reintroduction of violence and mayhem including murderdeathkill results in a reawakening of cultural freedom analogous to their own thawing out. The antiutopian antiutilitarian political message like that of Orwell's 1984 and later films influenced by the same such as Equilibrium 2002 couldn't be clearer. And the message can be extended to situations that are not political. I didn't use cult above carelessly. The idea is that the society's warts are necessary for individual authenticity. Yes things can run smoother under a dictatorship but who wants to live under a dictatorship even a supposedly benevolent one?".

When Stallone finally catches his man he is found guilty of killing a group of innocent civilians at the same time and they are both given sentences in the new cryoprison. When Simon Pheonix escapes into a new world in the year 2032 the police have no way of dealing with such a vicious archcriminal so they reanimate John Sparton and so it begins.I simply love the way the future is portrayed in this film it is a wonderfully satirical crime free environment where the humans have become ultraplacid geeks under the new regime. Sandra Bullock and Nigel Hawthorne are the two main policepersons that we see and they are brilliantly funny in their performances.Demolition man is as funny as it is action packed and although it's pretty shallow it is still great fun to watch.710".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie features Sly Stallone at his muscle bound destructive best. Around the same time he did the excellent Cliffhanger he also did this nifty action flick. What you get with Demolition man is an entertaining and satirical look at the future of Los Angeles where people walk about in robes and are a peace loving society. Anything remotely bad for you including spicy foods is illegal and the whole new system is run by Raymond Cochtoe played by the late Nigal Hawthorne. The opening action scene is set in the present day and is a rip roaring sequence with Stallone polishing off bad guys with stylish flair before he has a face off with the show stealer Wesley Snipes. Snipes plays the baddest of bad guys Simon Phoenix and does so excellently. The films pacing is good and in particular there are three big action sequences that shine these are the opening and the end as well as a very good action scene set in a museum. The comedy factor is high in this film and the film certainly has tongue fastened firmly in cheek. The two leads are very good and in particular Snipes revels in his nasty role. Sandra Bullock is good as the gratuitous attractive lady you get in practically all action films. All in all this is a great way to spend 90 or so minutes and is certainly how I would like to remember Sly Stallone in his action prime. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a guilty pleasure of mine along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man 1987 and Escape From New York 1981. Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix played by an effusive Wesley SnipesSly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent fish out of water. Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a more than just cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film and that's understandable. As I said it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run 1976 and part Shane 1953 with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongueincheek than not and that farce toois crucial to social commentary. In the end action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.".

As John Spartan a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix played by an effusive Wesley SnipesSly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent fish out of water. Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a more than just cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film and that's understandable. As I said it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run 1976 and part Shane 1953 with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongueincheek than not and that farce toois crucial to social commentary. In the end action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.";

In my opinion it bridges a gap between mindless action movie and satire and the result is pure gold.Im not going to write this like a review Stallone plays John Spartan etc because you KNOW that. Id rather comment on the movie as it was made.This movie halfway pokes fun at a 1984 style future and halfway takes it seriously. And most movies that try to split things down the middle fail on both fronts well as I see it this one pulls it right off and makes it great. The laughs in the movie don't come from haha gags but rather from biting satire and eerily prescient predictions. Tracking chips omniprescent surveillance making cigarettes illegal? Maybe we aren't there yet but its been heading that way for a long time. It takes a lot to make an audience laugh at a ridiculous setup then right after the laugh make them think Wait...That could easily happen!The thing that I appreciate most about this movie is the fact that it doesn't forget its own gags. Most other movies the first time a character was fined for the Verbal morality statute the movie would drop the gag skipping the alarm tone and accusing voice. In this movie every time someone swears in public within voice distance of whatever it is that hears them swear in the background you hear the gag played out. This transforms it from a joke to a Holy crap that would suck type of mindset and it works!And thats what I mean. This movie more than most others that I could name merges satire and a dystopian look with lighthearted gags and mindless action scenes. Thats hard to do and more people should give the writers and director and crew credit for sewing it together and making it play.One of the few action movies that I watch every time I catch it playing on my TV box it works that well and the gags still make you laugh. After all absurdity is a very real way to highlight and satirize elements of society. It sticks with you longer that way.".

The main difference is that those films didn't climax with 45 minutes of smashing mayhem.

	schema:headline " A Stallone comedy that actually works!";
	schema:reviewBody "Sylvester Stallone's various forays into comedy have been pitiful at best. Demolition Man is the single exception. In fact it may be the best film Stallone has ever done. Because its a vehicle perfectly suited to him. Its an actioner but also a very funny satire on Political Correctness gone mad.Beginning in 1996 Los Angeles is a war zone. Stallone is renegade cop John Spartan nicknamed the Demolition Man. Spartan is assigned to rescue hostages from psychotic criminal Simon Phoenix a platinum blond Wesley Snipes. Spartan gets Phoenix but when he accidentally blows up the building with the hostages inside the two enemies share the same fate. They both wind up in cryoprison where they will be frozen programmed and conditioned to become productive members of society and then thawed out at a later date.Shifting to 2032 instead of the dystopian vision of the future we were expecting Los Angeles or San Angeles as its now called has become a peaceful society. The world has become a very happy place. A place of no crime no hate and no sex!! The benevolent dictator if there is such a thing! of San Angeles Dr Cocteau Nigel Hawthorne is none too happy that some citizens are not following his grand master plan. Some people have broken away from society and live underground wanting to live their own lives led by fasttalking leader Edgar Friendly Denis Leary. Raiding the surface world for food and supplies Cocteau wants them dealt with. And he has a radical plan. Thaw out Simon Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly.Of course it doesn't work out that way and Phoenix is far more interested in taking over the defenceless San Angeles which rapidly becomes the war zone it once was. Since the police SAPD are illequipped to handle this they come up with a radical plan of their own. Thaw out John Spartan to deal with Simon Phoenix. Partnered up with SAPD cop Lenina Huxley a delightfully perky Sandra Bullock in the hunt for Phoenix they wind up tearing down the hideously nice San Angeles in the process.Demolition Man is a very funny satirical version of the future. Its observations are not as astute as RoboCop but there are occasions where it is an action film of striking intelligence. The fact that the future is so nice and nonviolent is a neat twist on what we usually expect from stories about our oncoming future. But the novelty is that San Angeles is so nice and nonthreatening that it's almost scary. And just as frightening as any dystopia. From 1984 to Children of Men.There are lots of wonderful throwaway gags too packed away into the background. There are too many to mention but I like the neat little touches the film keeps coming up with. Like when Dr Cocteau holds a meeting instead of addressing people in person at the conference table are these little TV screens that swivel around as Cocteau walks about. And the cars of the future drive themselves. OK that one's not so unexpected. But buildings that clean up after themselves! Bet you didn't see that one coming!Whenever Sylvester Stallone has tried his hand at comedy the result is usually disastrous because he's seemed ill at ease with the material. But with Demolition Man he looks like he's having a whale of a time. His utter contempt for San Angeles is very amusing and I love the running gag of the monitors that fine you if you swear. Something Spartan puts to use when he can't figure out how the toilets work. Watch and you will see! A thinly disguised act of contempt against order.But the one major plus in the film's favour is the wonderful Sandra Bullock. It's hard to believe she was nominated for a Razzie award because she's the best thing about the film. This is just before she found fame in Speed and with Demolition Man she displays comic timing of the best sort. Lenina's a supposed aficionado of 20th Century culture something she proudly tells Spartan every chance she gets. But she only gets things half right. Messing up all the colloquialisms You can take this job and shovel it. He really matched his meet.Stallone and Bullock are a wonderful pair. All the most joyful moments in the film come from their scenes together. There's a really cute scene when Lenina takes Spartan back to her place to have sex. But in 2032 sex has become slightly different. Now there's no touching. Just virtual reality helmets to simulate it. Their wires get seriously crossed and both Lenina and Spartan are baffled at what the other person wants Fluid transfer yuck!.Wesley Snipes is not bad in the part of the villain. He throws himself into it with real larger than life abandon even if a lot of his puns are atrocious. But he handles the action scenes well enough. He could have done without the peroxide hairstyle though.And as for Nigel Hawthorne well he looks a little out of place in the film. He's an actor who looks more at home on the stage or in a period piece and I get the impression he's a bit uncomfortable acting in an action vehicle. Its a performance phoned in on his part which might explain why he gets killed just a little over halfway through.But nevertheless Demolition Man has much to recommend. It moves at a brisk pace its funny and exciting in all the right places and as action films go its quite witty too. Love the snide comment Sly makes towards Arnie who goes on to be President. Only intended as a pun at the time but he's Governor now isn't he? Who knows? It could happen!".

The jokes are thick and fast as Stallone enjoys laughing at himself it's also an interesting vision of the future that writers Peter M.

Giving you a full depth of what a future would really be like down to things as simple as handshakes. Seldom do you see such a complete depiction of a culture change.The action aspect is much like other movies of the genre.

In most future movies mannerisms conversation and most of the technology is not any different from today. Here they have taken every aspect of life and changed it in some form. Giving you a full depth of what a future would really be like down to things as simple as handshakes. Seldom do you see such a complete depiction of a culture change.The action aspect is much like other movies of the genre. But the humor is better than most with our hero showing his troubles with adjusting.";

After both Rocky V and Rambo III proved unsuccessful to both critics and audiences in '90 Stallone struggled to come up with another blockbuster making carp like Judge Dredd and Daylight in the process. 1993 proved to be a semireturn to form thanks to small successes like Renny Harlin's Cliffhanger and Demolition Man an entertaining if completely forgettable action flick. Costarring Wesley Snipes who was becoming a big box office draw thanks to hits like White Boys Can't Jump and from producer Joel Silver the film first starts off in a crimeladen 1997 where dedicated police officer John Spartan Stallone has just captured criminal Simon Phoenix Snipes. Unfortunately Spartan kills thirty hostages in the process causing both of them to be convicted and rehabilitated via cryogenic freezing. Flash forward to the year 2032 where Phoenix has been freed and escapes to wreck havoc on a crime free San Angeles. With no other options the impotent police force including Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt unfreezes Spartan to apprehend the wild Phoenix.There's no doubt Demolition Man is filled with problems the direction by Marco Brambilla who was pretty much never seen or heard from after this is workmanlike and pedestrian along with the numerous action scenes the film's attempt at social commentary fails in the form of overpreachy monologues by the always loudmouth Dennis Leary many subplots are left unresolved including one involving Spartan's daughter which goes absolutely nowhere and some hardcore film fans might cringe with the sight of small piece of comic relief played by none other than Rob Scheinder.That being said the film does make up for its flaws thanks to strong performances by Stallone and Snipe both clearly seem to be enjoying themselves a fun screenplay cowritten by Heathers scribe Daniel Walters is loaded with cute little gags and quirks and there's enough entertainment value to make up for most of the films faults.Overall the film is a harmless piece of fun. This early 90s action flick comes recommended.".

She does well in her role but it is too small to help the movie any. The movie honestly has no plot and pretty bad acting.

In reality he deserved to be dumped considering his madeup religion gets her beatup and hospitalized.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie Religion Inc. was made before any of us knew who Sandra Bullock was. Here she has a relatively minor role but is prominently featured on the DVD cover wearing a nice red dress which doesn't appear anywhere in the movie. Plus they are marketing it as A Fool And His Money. We fell for it! We bought a copy at 5 and it is barely worth 1 for the quality of the DVD but even less for the movie. Seriously there are better DVDs available for 1. You may wonder What is wrong with it? Fair question. First the sound is inferior kind of fuzzy listed as stereo but sounds closer to mono. Second the picture is not even as good as good VHS quality. Third there are chapters and nothing else as basic a DVD as you can find. Still all that would not be terrible had it contained a good movie.The movie is a very cheesy B grade movie at best. The Lord tells the protagonist to start a business so he starts a company called religion Inc to establish a new religion. It works for a while but then trouble strikes. So far such a premise has promise for a different kind of comedy. Unfortunately the writer had no vision and everything falls flat in the second half. The only redeeming quality is that it runs a short 80 minutes.SPOILERS FOLLOW for my recollection. Trying to think of a name for the new religion they pick the opposite of Protestant the Preferant church which preaches it is OK to look out for yourself and accumulate wealth and advancement. It is OK to have extramarital affairs and to take advantage of the less fortunate. A janitor with a PHD in Philosophy becomes the spiritual leader. Even though the new religion which plays on followers' dark desires flourishes the founders have chest pains which can only be relieved when they go straight. Cheesy hokey choose your adjective but we found it a total waste of 80 minutes. Except to see a young Sandra Bullock with acting promise.".

It doesn't go after any of the known religions but rather after mass hysteria preachers as well as greed and egoism.

While the concept is fascinating and could make a great movie the filmmakers here really dropped the ball. This movie is bad. Unfortunately it's not bad enough to fall into the categories of it's so bad it's good or movies that are fun to make fun of. The story goes nowhere and the ending is so quick nonsensical and clichd that it appears that they had no idea how the movie was going to end and panicked when they realized they were running out of time. Add to that that the picture and sound quality on the DVD are terrible about the level I would expect for something taped on a VCR circa 1985 on the lowest quality setting and this movie simply isn't worth getting.".

It is a 4x3 screen image likely trimmed from wider. Sandy is only in a few parts. I still find it to be okay just not for watching too often. Liable to appear to gradually improve if not watched all that often. More approachable than Hangmen. Very okay Bullock. It is also looking at questions of good practice doing that in a fairly simple and open way. Those who like later Sandy because of the 'good guy' element could find that most of these early Sandy have something too but expressed in a way that is easier in some ways but more difficult because of the low budget factor.  Is this about religious or political or business beliefs? It is very post seventies. Sandy manages to keep to her good girl beliefs typical early Sandy but gets badly mauled because of that. There is a happy ending which is fitting and makes for a nicer sort of entertainment. That a less than happy ending might appear to be more reasonable is not the issue as entertainment value has a priority here. This is obviously not a low budget documentary about post seventies beliefs though it does have a lot of the qualities that such a documentary might have.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman reprised his role of Eddie Felson from The Hustler 1961 on all short lists of great movies to star in The Color of Money a worthy sequel in the way Rocky II was to Rocky  not a great movie but very good.Eddie advancing in years has apparently left the hustling circuit for a more respectable job as a liquor wholesalesman. On his route he encounters a brash obnoxious pool shark named Vincent Tom Cruise and his girlfriend Mary Mastrantonio. Vincent has the talent but not the brains or knowledge to be another great hustler so Eddie his desire for the circuit reignited offers to stake Vincent and teach him the ropes in exchange for a substantial piece of the winnings. At first Vincent's ego and obnoxiousness threaten his development but he soon learns all of Eddie's tricks  and a few of his own. By the time of the big tournament at the end of the movie Eddie and Vince have split ways  and find themselves on a collision course.I just realized that The Color of Money is my favorite Tom Cruise movie but not my favorite Paul Newman movie which could well be The Hustler. I reviewed this movie recently after a long discussion with some friends about the difference between a movie star and an actor and the few living legends that are both besides Newman I'd include Jack Nicholson and Robert de Niro. As always Newman even with such a huge public persona disappears into the role of the middleaged grifter heartbroken how far his game has fallen in the days since he left the pool hall circuit. But he also makes the other performers around him shine. Cruise's trademark cockiness shines through in Vincent. Besides Mastrantonio one of my favorite actresses Helen Shaver turns in a nice performance as Eddie's girlfriend and Forest Whitaker first appeared on my radar in his short time on screen.The other star of the movie is the game. While Scorsese didn't make his movie into the character study of The Hustler he uses the pool tables and balls as a medium for many artistic scenes. If you are someone who enjoys looking at beautiful movies you won't be disappointed. And there might even be some real pool players  you never know...The story is good not great. The Color of Money is not cut from the same felt as The Hustler and does not try to be. It is a movie about pool not a character study. I don't think I would be up to repeated viewings as frequent as The Hustler but it's a fine way to spend an evening watching Newman and Cruise shoot pool.".

	schema:headline " Fast Eddie is back!";
	schema:reviewBody "People misunderstood The Color of Money I think. There are a few things to keep in mind 1 This was a Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese was fresh off Taxi Driver Raging Bull and other such successes from less than a decade before. People were expecting a lot.2 It starred Paul Newman returning to his character from The Hustler in a sequel that was twentyfive years in the making. That's longer than the wait for the Phantom Menace prequel.Perhaps for those two very strong reasons alone when The Color of Money opened in 1986 the critics and audiences didn't think much of it. It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree it didn't hold a candle to The Hustler and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture.After 19 years I disagree. I think The Color of Money is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece but an excellent continuation of a character we haven't seen for 25 years.First of all Scorsese's direction isn't his best but it's still very good. And he's definitely got the same elements going on as After Hours from a few years before  his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy '80s vibe are present in every frame. Likewise he's using the quickcuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he's known for. The thing is Scorsese's styles just changed a bit during the 1980s they even carried on into GoodFellas  the nighttime shots carry the same foreboding look as After Hours and Color of Money. I think now looking back since we've seen more of Scorsese's films it's easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film. A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach. Just look at The Aviator for goodness sake! Newman deserved the Oscar more for The Hustler of course but for what it's worth Fast Eddie Felson's evolution is handled with care in the script and it's very entertaining for anyone who's seen the original to note the change in his behavior. It's also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler Vince Tom Cruise filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before.If The Hustler was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man then The Color of Money is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man and the contrast between the young and the old. All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time and we don't believe them. The Color of Money follows this principal  in thirty years we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie wise and matured. And then he'll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he's the king of the world. Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story? I doubt it. It's unnecessary because as far as I'm concerned The Color of Money has already stressed the point. But you never know...Overall this isn't a great movie and I won't pretend it is. But I do think it's one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for. Film buffs should see it especially those who loved The Hustler.".

Now twenty some years later his Fast Eddie Felson is driving around in a big fancy Cadillac selling liquor and stakehorsing younger pool players. One day while romancing his bartender girlfriend his young protg John Tuturro gets whipped by this cocky kid named Vincent. Eddie Felson is immediately drawn to the flaky loudmouthed kid with the name Vince stenciled on his tee shirt. After some arm twisting and manipulating Eddie Vincent and Vincent's streetwise girlfriend Carmen Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are making their way to Atlantic City where a 9 Ball pool tournament awaits. Along they way Eddie tries to teach them how to hustle pool. This will be a problem because of course the cocky youngster won't do as he's told. He has a gift and knows it. It is simply impossible for him to hold back and let someone beat him. Even when it could lead to a bigger payoff down the road. His girlfriend Carmen also seems to see both Vincent and Eddie as a way to make money for herself. She is clearly a woman with motives all her own. Of course this will all lead up to a climatic match in Atlantic City between the old master and the young protg won't it? Well it appears to for a moment until we learn that what we saw wasn't really what it appeared to be.And that's the part of the film that seemed to really irk Roger Ebert in his review. He was expecting a masterpiece of a film for no other reason than Martin Scorcese is the director. But the film isn't a masterpiece. Its simply a very good film with some great performances great music and some gritty and authenticlooking locations. Who is the better pool player is the last thing this film is about. This is a film about people using other people. Be it for money inspiration comfort you name it. Newman plays Felson here as a gruff seasoned man who thinks he knows everything about the game and those who play it. He finds out as the film moves along that is not always the case. Sometimes these younger players have new tricks up their sleeves and if you let your guard down they will hustle even the smartest old timer. There is a classic scene where Eddie after a few too many drinks allows a chubby and apparently dimwitted Forest Whitaker to take him for hundreds of dollars. The film is full of scenes that end in ways you don't quite expect.This is one of those movies where above all else the casting was almost perfect. Newman is as watchable as ever. Mastrantonio steals a few scenes. Cruise is annoying of course but he was supposed to be. Still he looks kind of weak compared to the other actors. Great support from Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs too. Watch closely for an appearance from music icon Iggy Pop. During a montage Cruise hustles him and then steals a shot of booze right out of his hand! The cinematography from Michael Ballhaus is great as always. In fact its too good! Some of the camera shots just look too stylish for such a film. Maybe that was Scorcese's way of trying to liven up a picture with so little violence! Overall The Color of Money is worth your time. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound".

	schema:headline " I Want Your Best Game";
	schema:reviewBody "Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo film When the Legends Die The Color of Money is still a worthy film and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic The Hustler.I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The Drowning Pool.When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic characters in an older generation.One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier film to know what's happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on track.Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have been. A young kid with a 'sledgehammer break' gets Newman's attention and its Tom Cruise. He's got a girlfriend Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio with him and the three sort of adopt each other. It's a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle. Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize just how much he's missed because of the gangland blackball.Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very good working relationship.Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him. Unfortunately in the first he was up against Henry Fonda who had been similarly snubbed for years by the Academy and was dying during the Oscar voting. The second time Ben Kingsley portrayal of the title role in the massive blockbuster Gandhi obscured what I think is Newman's finest performance in The Verdict.Though the Oscar was an Oscar for lifetime of work The Color of Money is a worthy sequel to The Hustler. Martin Scorsese got great performances out of the whole cast. And Paul Newman finally got a matching Oscar to go with the one Joanne Woodward won for The Three Faces of Eve for their mantelpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo film When the Legends Die The Color of Money is still a worthy film and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic The Hustler.I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The Drowning Pool.When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic characters in an older generation.One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier film to know what's happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on track.Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have been. A young kid with a 'sledgehammer break' gets Newman's attention and its Tom Cruise. He's got a girlfriend Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio with him and the three sort of adopt each other. It's a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle. Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize just how much he's missed because of the gangland blackball.Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very good working relationship.Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him.

	schema:reviewBody "The Color of Money ain't about pool. The Color of Money isn't about young Vincent or his girlfriend Carmen. And believe it or not The Color of Money isn't even about money. The Color of Money is about Paul Newman's character Fast Eddie Felson and his salvation to place meaning with significance to his trying lonely life as a pool hustler. Viewers lost in the glam of hustling pool or the action of 9ball are missing out seeing the real beauty of this film of the story told. The story and life of Fast Eddie Felson that is. And credit to Paul Newman to go along with the brilliant character of course. Newman gives his grade A performance one of the best I've ever seen from Newman or from anybody that is. Paul Newman is beautiful. The Color of Money is one truly exceptional character piece. The Color of Money for my money is better than The Hustler. It's an incredible sequel. It's an incredible feature. It's one of my more loved movies mostly for Paul Newman's performance but also very much for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Tom Cruise as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the main costar here and Tom Cruise takes on third role. I love the beautiful Mary Elizabeth. She's so good. She has such true acting abilities which is rarer to find in Hollywood than one might think. Tom Cruise is great as Vincent one of his more well acted roles to go along with Jerry Maguire and Rain Man which is his best. Tom Cruise has some true acting talent too just not like Newman or Mastrantonio only because that they are two of the very best. Cruise has more star quality though. Don't get me wrong. The kid can act. I just love Tom Cruise. The best of the magic of The Color of Money happens between Newman and Mastrantonio as they quietly share a magnetic connection. The magnificent Martin Scorsese is a master of his trade maybe the best in the business and The Color of Money is one other misperceived underappreciated Scorsese classic to go along with Casino and Gangs of New York as well as but to a smaller scale Shutter Island The Aviator Cape Fear Bringing Out the Dead and Mean Streets. The Color of Money is a 9 out of 10 ranking an outstanding mark nothing less. I hope I spelled Mary Elizabeth's last name right every time Mastrantonio. It would be too entirely challenging to revise such a mishap. But I know that I did. Mastrantonio God that's a terrific name.".

The camera glides around as if on air to create joyous results shots that put the pool action right into the conscious of the viewer it's a great effort. The film is further boosted by two wonderful performances from the leading men Newman deserved his Oscar for putting such verve and honesty into the now grizzled Felson there is a scene with Forest Whitaker that is Newman gold without him hardly having to say anything . Then there is Cruise all big hair and a ball of adrenaline a great ebullient show that is great fun to watch. I read somewhere that Newman praised Cruise for capturing the essence of a young Eddie Felson well you can't say fairer than that. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio more than holds her own with the boys and fleshes out a smart and entertaining film that seems to get better with age just like Felson funnily enough.Oh he's back alright 910.".

Key to both films is the astonishing Paul Newman who holds his end of the stick and then some. The rest of the cast is purely in canned and competent support roles or in semistar roles by two young actors with some screen presence but no great subtle skill to match Newman's. I'm speaking not only of Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio who is forced to play the slightly tough slightly sexy generally submissive girlfriend but also of Tom Cruise who is brilliant at being flakey partly because he is in real life from all accounts. You give Scorsese credit here for using the young actor in a role that matches his natural persona in contrast to others including Spielberg who seem to make more of the actor than there is and a certain falseness gets in the way. But this film uses the awkwardness and naive boyish qualities of Cruise as a sudden pool shark really well. What holds it all back? I think basically plot. I mean it's fun to see the big hustle at play and to get stung once or twice when things aren't what they seem. But we sort of know going in that that's the general plan and then it happens. And it takes a long time happening...there are no no complications here beyond pool and hustling. The romances for what they are worth a completely thin and didn't have to be. The settings all these great great poolhalls and small town joints are terrific populated a little too perfectly by locals of all different stripes. The camerawork makes some fairly cinema verite footage make sense in the scenes but not with either edge or lyricism. This all sounds a little like I'm working hard to point out the flaws and I must go back to where I started about Newman and the basic strength of the aging pool player facing a change in his personal scenery. It's a canned affair overall. Well done sure but without the richness of the best of Scorsese's work or the best of Hollywood for that matter including the preceding The Hustler which you might see in a pairing with this one.".

That might owe to the earlier film's black and white photography adding a noirish feel to the smoke filled pool parlors and lounges where the young Eddie Felson used to ply his trade. With The Color of Money I couldn't get quite comfortable with where the picture was going or if we would ever get there. The basic plot is understood the now older Eddie Paul Newman would take upstart newcomer Vincent Lauria Tom Cruise under his wing teach him how to read his opponents stake him in his matches and collect his share of the winnings. I never really got the sense though that Vincent was ever really along for that ride since he almost never took Eddie's advice allowing his ego to constantly get in the way of their shared goal.What I got the biggest kick out of had to do with the musical lyrics set to various confrontations Vincent dealt with on the circuit. Eddie's warning about Moselle was comically echoed by Warren Zevon's line  'You better stay away from him He'll rip your lungs out Jim'  that was great. Later as Grady Seasons runs the table Vincent has to consider  'Are you gonna fall for this'? The other noteworthy moment watching the film today had to do with Paul Newman's character talking to Vincent early in the story and explaining how he would teach him how to hustle. The discussion might have just as well turned on Newman giving pointers to Cruise on how to act at this early point in his career. That's not meant to be a put down but you can definitely see the difference between the actor Cruise of today compared to two decades earlier. Just an observation.I suppose my qualms about the picture have to do with it's pacing in the latter half when the focus is on Fast Eddie's decision to compete again. There's that swimming pool dive that comes from nowhere and the attendant visit to the optometrist when he realizes his sight is impaired. That just seemed to break the flow of the story enough to give it a disjointed feel. Later Eddie's victory over Vincent in the tournament seemed tainted and then of course that's revealed to be true. I guess I was looking for the picture to end on some kind of message shedding light on the underlying decency of the principal players but instead it looked like they both wound up behind an eight ball.".

But This aging 'dinosaur' who is making a comeback on the poolcircuit has a new hotshot in the picture that being Tom of course that is great but green as anything. Being and acting on the mind that he Fellson has...he pursues an idea to take and mentor this 'grandstander' who already has a lot of talent. If he can teach him. The jury isn't out yet on that one though. But I was in awe of this movie even before I took an interest in writing. The images of Newman are so powerful to me taking a hold of my mind with an encapsulating effectiveness. As I took new interest in a story that would have otherwise board me I saw a man attempting to hold onto his own life in the process. He a business man and a hustler a sensitive lover and still a player but faithful to all how rare. There was this since of him being strong and a fighter and yet at a moment in weakness but also reflective wiseness that came through. He was attempting to not lose his handle on a large piece of his life. A passion and a honed Careerhobby all in one. He loved his work and struggled to reach a young upstart named Vincent a rousing hothead with a propensity for blowing it because of needed egostrokes. A hard head with ability but in need of mentoring to save him from himself. 'The Color of money' for me is a man trying not to lose himself in a vastly enveloping world. He is trying to stay alive. He's attempting to keep his life 'in play'. So that he doesn't die a career and identity 'self esteem' death on the side. The 'Color of Money' is a seminal work. It's brilliant and pleasing with a sense of accomplishment. If you haven't seen this one find the DVD. I rate it a 10 for excellence.".

	schema:reviewBody "The teacher is hasbeen pool shark Eddie Felson Paul Newman. The student is Vincent Lauria Tom Cruise a cocky overconfident kid who knows how to beat opponents but whose swaggering attitude gets in the way of being taken seriously by professional pool players. At face value The Color Of Money is a character driven story of Felson's efforts to teach young Vincent the importance of psychology and subtlety en route to the bigtime pool tournaments in Atlantic City. At a slightly deeper level the film is the story of how Felson with his own personal agenda uses Vincent as a means to an end.For pool players the film offers lots of terrific pool playing. For everyone else the story can seem dull and claustrophobic. Most of the film is set indoors in dark pool halls. Except at the very beginning there's a curious absence of cigarette smoke in these places perhaps an oversight in production design. Camera takes are rather long at the film's beginning. And that gets the movie off to a slow start.Pool playing is not real conducive to great cinema as it is not particularly visual. Director Scorsese does his best to make the visuals interesting through quick editing and camera dissolves especially in the film's second half. And there's plenty of story conflict between Eddie and Vincent even though one wonders how Vincent can be so mentally ... dense. Perhaps his attitude is more a character contrivance to add interest to the relationship between him and Felson.Despite wearing too much makeup Paul Newman gives a fine performance. By contrast Tom Cruise with his big pompadour hairdo is simply annoying. He struts his stuff huffs and puffs on cue pardon the pun but otherwise lacks any sense of subtlety or refinement in emotional expression. I will credit both Newman and Cruise with skill in playing pool as they made many of the shots themselves.Overall Newman's name and the story's connection to The Hustler 1961 are what carry this film. The Color Of Money is a rather dull slightly depressing movie that's not nearly as good as the 1961 original but one that will nevertheless appeal both to fans of Newman and to viewers who enjoy the game of pool.".

Until he comes across a guileless but prodigally talented youngster with incessant bad hair days called Vincent Lauria Tom Cruise who with ease and mirth dispatches the best pool player in his establishment. Enticed by the hapless youth Eddie soon ventures to take him and his girlfriendmanager Carmen Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio on the road to throw them into the world of pool hustling and then to finally bring them to the Atlantic City to compete on the big stage...Paul Newman easily dominates proceedings with his restrained gentlemen charm residing somewhere on the verge of skewed morality  a place of pool cons made hardearned money and just reward fuly deserved Oscar winning role. Opposing him Cruise delivers a rather bland outing in part due to attention subconsciously shifted north of his forehead to his 'dead beaver' hairdo. Thankfully however Cruise's character is essentially a counterpoint to Eddie  initially an uncouth naive jester under tutelage evolves into a selfconscience and moneyorientated player much in the mold of the hustler himself. Roles however change when Eddie rediscovers the joys of simply playing pool undercut by being hustled himself by a random Joe. As Vincent immerses further into the life Eddie rediscover the pure joy of playing and enters the Atlantic City competition thus basically completing a full circle Vincent now the king of the world Eddie once was whilst Eddie mature has now grown to appreciate the little things.The story itself tries to indulge the viewer but watching balls being struck rarely builds enthusiasm whilst the moral ambiguity of proceedings shadows the film in both greyness as well as dullness. Though Eddie especially is vividly evoked The Colour of Money drags along with an unflinching incapability to make thunderbolting racks into a thrilling watching experience instead drenched in smoke lethargy and morose buildup not helped by dim grainy cinematography. As stated in the movie the 9shot is essentially nonstrategic based on luck noisy quick and essentially crass making the whole experience feel like nonsubstantial style.Coupled with bumbling chemistry between the two leads and some drunkenly built dramaturgy pieces fail to emotionally fall into place in some part owed to the selfevident premise which makes proceedings overly predictable. Despite Newman's best efforts overall the limping dramatic side and marginally interesting subject matter cause Scorsese to fail to lift off the ground.".

As Vincent immerses further into the life Eddie rediscover the pure joy of playing and enters the Atlantic City competition thus basically completing a full circle Vincent now the king of the world Eddie once was whilst Eddie mature has now grown to appreciate the little things.The story itself tries to indulge the viewer but watching balls being struck rarely builds enthusiasm whilst the moral ambiguity of proceedings shadows the film in both greyness as well as dullness. Though Eddie especially is vividly evoked The Colour of Money drags along with an unflinching incapability to make thunderbolting racks into a thrilling watching experience instead drenched in smoke lethargy and morose buildup not helped by dim grainy cinematography. As stated in the movie the 9shot is essentially nonstrategic based on luck noisy quick and essentially crass making the whole experience feel like nonsubstantial style.Coupled with bumbling chemistry between the two leads and some drunkenly built dramaturgy pieces fail to emotionally fall into place in some part owed to the selfevident premise which makes proceedings overly predictable. Despite Newman's best efforts overall the limping dramatic side and marginally interesting subject matter cause Scorsese to fail to lift off the ground.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've never been more aroused by a film's editing and cinematography than that featured in The Color of Money a film which I ultimately enjoyed more than it's predecessor The Hustler. It just so happens I first watched The Color of Money during my time as a film student and attempted to replicate many of the film's shots and edits for a music video and an intentionally 80's music video at that as I studied the cuts present in the film frame by frame. Needless to say I was not entirely successful in my endeavour.The Color of Money has the fast pace and rhythm of MTV music videos but still with a sense of oldschool class and sophistication right from the opening credits I can tell this would be a movie dripping in atmosphere. A movie so snappy fastpaced and full of quick edits many of which come unexpectedly along with many unconventional camera movements yet it never feels disorientating or distracting as the scenes glide with such fluidity and ease. The cinematography on display here isn't that of a David Lean production no this is a movie which largely takes place in bars and pool halls yet it still has a sense of majesty and scope even if the shot in question is a close up of a drinking glass. Really the only edit I can fault is the very cheesy freeze frame of Paul Newman jumping out of a swimming pool. On the other hand nobody uses licensed soundtracks better than Martin Scorsese. I get the impression scenes in the film were shot with the music in mind and not as an afterthought. With the opening scene it feels like Phil Collins' One More Night was specifically composed to fit the mood and tone of the scene.The Color of Money however is not style over substance. I love the intriguing character triangle of a trio of hustlers as well as the harmony of two generations coming together. Tom Cruise is an actor I only like in certain parts but in roles such as Vincent a cocky male fantasy indulging character who embodies the entrepreneurial and capitalistic spirit of the 1980's like his character in Risky Business I simply revel in  as Eddie puts it a natural character. Just as impressive are pool shots done by Cruise himself he performed all but one of his own trick shots makes me energised to play some pool myself.".

	schema:headline " Newman shines Cruise dazzles Scorsese disappoints slightly.";
	schema:reviewBody "I understand why Martin Scorsese directed The Color of Money. I just wish this smalltime genre picture had been made at a little higher quality. After an attempt to film The Last Temptation of Christ in 1983 failed Scorsese turned to smaller pictures made at lower budgets in order to get clout with studios. In 1985 he released After Hours a strange weirdly entertaining film of one man's wild and crazy night in Soho New York. The Color of Money couldn't be more different in tone or style yet it isn't able to conjure up the same energy or driving force After Hours did.What does work in The Color of Money is the acting. Paul Newman a legend of the silver screen reprises his role as Fast Eddie Felson who is now 25 years older and comes across a young pool player that revives the competitive spirit in him. The player is Vincent an extremely cocky and selfaware young man with a gorgeous yet somewhat detached girlfriend Carmen. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Vincent able to capture every amount of arrogance and superiority a young successful player would have. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as well beautiful mysterious and with a subtle underside to her character that gives her more of an edge than the main characters.This in turn becomes one of the main problems of the film. What the screenplay lacks is an intriguing setup between Newman and Cruise. Here we have two bonafide stars of the screen yet it becomes rather obvious what is going to happen in nearly every single scene between them. The generation gap as well as the differing personalities creates such a predictable conflict that the film loses much of its suspense and edge. Another problem is the flashy photography and editing tricks Scorsese utilizes in the pool scenes. More often than not it probably would have been more effective to simply shoot it straight instead of trying to dress it up with so many effects and techniques. I understand why Scorsese did it this way to draw in the large audiences to maintain his status. In the end however the final result doesn't add up to much of a great entertainment. With all this talent on display it leaves something to be desired.".

By working on a commercial project like this Scorsese then had leeway to make his next film the ultrapersonal and controversial The Last Temptation of Christ 1988. Consequently because this wasn't material he was fully passionate about it's not so surprising that this isn't amongst his best work. That said it is still a good film. Scorsese still manages to employ much of his typical energetic style into the flow of things making even the game of pool pretty dynamic to watch.The film is maybe even better known for its acting though with Paul Newman returning to play an older version of the character Fast Eddie Felson who last appeared in The Hustler twentyfive years previously. His character now manages young hustlers like he once was and in doing so takes a huge slice of their winnings. It's a rolereversal for the character and Newman is once again very good although despite the Oscar win he was even better in The Hustler. Tom Cruise plays off him as the cocky youngster in a type of role that we've seen him perform many times in fairness. He is good enough though and the two actors do work off each other well. The dynamic between them is reasonably predictable to an extent with a plot arc where their relationship starts off shaky gets worse then finally clicks. But off course success breeds complications. Events do ultimately reach an unusual and ambiguous conclusion which I wasn't too sure about personally but at least it ended things on a less obvious note.".

Don't get me wrong this is still effective but if you're going to release a movie and promote it as Based on the True Story then you might wanna make sure that the movie at least RESEMBLES the original story.In fact George Lutz is currently in litigation with MGM films over the content of the movie claiming that it shows his family in a potentially damaging light.

	schema:headline " Decent enough for Amityville and haunted house film fans otherwise approach with caution";
	schema:reviewBody "A remake of the film by the same name from 1979 which was based on Jay Anson's book about a supposedly true haunting Amityville Horror begins in familiar territory by showing us Ronald DeFeo Jr. Brendan Donaldson murdering his family. A year later newlyweds George Ryan Reynolds and Kathy Lutz Melissa George with three kids from her previous marriage in tow buy the vacant house at a steal although they hesitate a bit once they learn why it's so cheap. Strange occurrences begin not long after they settle in. George becomes increasingly impatient and hostile daughter Chelsea Chloe Moretz begins seeing the dead DeFeo girl and so on. The film recounts their very brief but tumultuous stay at the home the Lutz's believed would be their dream home but which turned into a nightmare.After seeing the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 which had the same production team principal scriptwriter and visual effects team and which I lovedI gave it a 10I was completely psyched for the Amityville Horror remake. After all unlike my view of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 which I also gave a 10 I think the 1979 Amityville has more than its share of problems. I like the original in spite of that but producer Michael Bay and crew had plenty of opportunity for improvement. Unfortunately although some aspects of this remake are better in my view it suffers from a host of new problems. Like the first the assets are good enough to transcend the flaws so that it squeaks by with a very low B or an 8.In my view there are two primary problems with at least one a bit ineffable. The more effable problem is that relative newcomer director Andrew Douglas his previous effort was 2003's relatively littleknown documentary Searching for the WrongEyed Jesus instructs cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister to shoot the film using way too much close framing. I repeatedly felt the urge to take a couple steps back so I could better discern the action the settings the staging of scenes and so on.The second problem lies more in the realm of writing and editingthe film just doesn't seem to flow right. The transition from scene to scene often feels almost arbitrary. Even though Reynolds does a great job in his transformation as George Lutz and the acting is superb all around there was a sense of buildup in the original that this remake is missing. Further indicative of the transition problems although seemingly minor is the fact that the date or the day of the Lutz' stay at the home is sometimes given as a title and sometimes not. It seems like they just forgot to add the day titles for half of the scenes. Overall the final cut gives an impression of being hastily put together.And that's a shame because there is a lot of potential here. The house itself is impressive as it needs to be and the overall style of the film is nicely atmospheric. I was also impressed with the production design by Jennifer Williams which among other assets tends to have the period setting spoton. For example I was a huge Kiss Alice Cooper etc. fan during this era and I'm still a fan. Williams has a number of Kiss and Cooper images in the film. She very carefully ensures that none are anachronistic. Even though scriptwriter Scott Kosar disappointingly expressed a lack of enthusiasm for Anson's book and the original film he reintroduces a number of elements from the book that work well but which were left out of the original film. He also introduces new scenarios that in some cases are among the best material of the filmsuch as a breathtaking sequence on the roof of the home and the extension of the mythology behind the haunting. He also greatly improves on sequences such as the babysitter. But on the other hand he inexplicably changes core elements of the story like the kind of being that Jody is.Anyone frustrated with the typical horror style of the later 1990s and early 2000s may find this remake troublesome. As one might expect with Michael Bay producing Douglas is encouraged to use MTVstyled cinematography and editing. There are a number of extended techniques that have become somewhat clichd in recent years. Douglas has characters do that fast headshaking movement ala Jacob's Ladder 1990. There are sections shot in a cinema vrit style. There are instances of quickly changing film stocks and processing methods and so on. Even though I usually love all of that stuff and I'm actually a fan of Bay's work I have to agree that it's not exactly the most natural fit in this case. But for me it's not something I would subtract points for either.Maybe the most surprising fact is that this version of Amityville Horror is so close structurally to the original. There is nothing here that is a big surprise and anyone who has seen the 1979 film a number of times will know exactly what's coming next or close enough to it. Whether this is positive or not depends on your opinion of the original film and just how highly you cherish originality for its own sake. Big Amityville fans and big haunted house film fans will probably enjoy the film enough. Everyone else should approach with more caution.".

	onyx:emotionText "A remake of the film by the same name from 1979 which was based on Jay Anson's book about a supposedly true haunting Amityville Horror begins in familiar territory by showing us Ronald DeFeo Jr. Brendan Donaldson murdering his family. A year later newlyweds George Ryan Reynolds and Kathy Lutz Melissa George with three kids from her previous marriage in tow buy the vacant house at a steal although they hesitate a bit once they learn why it's so cheap. Strange occurrences begin not long after they settle in. George becomes increasingly impatient and hostile daughter Chelsea Chloe Moretz begins seeing the dead DeFeo girl and so on. The film recounts their very brief but tumultuous stay at the home the Lutz's believed would be their dream home but which turned into a nightmare.After seeing the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 which had the same production team principal scriptwriter and visual effects team and which I lovedI gave it a 10I was completely psyched for the Amityville Horror remake. After all unlike my view of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 which I also gave a 10 I think the 1979 Amityville has more than its share of problems. I like the original in spite of that but producer Michael Bay and crew had plenty of opportunity for improvement. Unfortunately although some aspects of this remake are better in my view it suffers from a host of new problems.

	schema:reviewBody "In terms of cinematic legacy the original The Amityville Horror managed to foreshadow both The Shining and Poltergeist while swiping a few nods from The Exorcist. But time has not been kind to the hit 1979 horror film once considered spooky but now considered at best a camp classic.The remake opens in the late 1970s with George Lutz Ryan Reynolds and his new wife Kathy Melissa George getting what appears to be the deal of a lifetime. A colonial era Long Island home that is within their price range has just come up for sale and the two decide the place would be perfect to raise their children all from Kathy's previous marriage.Little do they know that the house comes with loads of supernatural baggage. The previous owner had killed his entire family within 28 days of moving in claiming there was a demonic presence in the home that drove him to do so. It's not long before strange things start to happen with the new family as well.Chelsea Chlo Grace Moretz starts seeing the ghost of the previous little girl who occupied the house Billy Jesse James and Michael Jimmy Bennett see supernatural activity while also being blamed for the trouble it causes and George begins to go mad taking increasingly drastic steps to maintain order and discipline the children. It's not long before Kathy begins to suspect that all is not right in their quaint little home.The Amityville Horror is such a mediocre film you can't help but wonder what was once considered so shocking about the original story. In truth with all the negative reviews the original movie received it's obvious that that film and its numerous sequels is merely famous for being famous. The thing that most people seem to remember is the front of the house itself which actually is scary looking. It's just a shame there's never been a horror movie filmed in the house to do its spooky appearance justice.The other thing to note is that the remake still claims to be based on a true story which is partially true. The real life Lutz's account was eventually proved to be a hoax to cover up the fact that the family couldn't pay their mortgage but not before the family made millions on everything from talk show appearances to the movie rights.The movie never really lets you into the horror that is occurring and director Andrew Douglas does a very workmanlike job directing the story never really doing anything to interest us in the characters or situation. Special effects run amok like walls that ooze blood and jackinthebox scares like decomposing ghosts jumping out at you but it's all for naught. The movie can only scream boo! at you so many times before you start booing back.Actingwise the movie is decent but not terribly inspired. Just like Jack Nicholson in The Shining Reynolds seems to lose his sanity just a tad too early for the rest of the story to be believable. As Kathy George manages to be the emotional anchor holding the film together and does a good job however her character puts up with far too much stress before she finally acts. The child actors all do okay but they merely exist to be put in danger.So what was the purpose of remaking a horror movie that hasn't aged very well over the last quarter of a century? The main reason I can think of is the house itself which still manages to scare people. Other than that there's a big market for remaking classic horror films right now though hardly any of been able to justify their own existence including last year's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre also produced and written by the same team behind this film. The Amityville Horror is likely to join that undistinguished canon ultimately being a horror movie about a group of people too dumb to leave a house just because the script requires them to stay. It's movies like this that make you want to root for the ghosts.5 out of 10 stars. It's hard to feel sympathetic for characters in a movie who have to stay in a stupid situation just because the script says so.".

It's just 89 minutes of very frightening ghosts popping up and some surprisingly appropriate acting. In fact I would say this movie has one of the most petrifying ghost scenes ever.The boy in the bathroom!The costumesmakeup were really good too. Also I loved Ryan Reynolds in a scary movie. I thought his quirky style was a perfect complement to the cast. He makes a smooth transition from Van Wilder to Blade 3 to Amityville because he seems to just be himself.".

	schema:headline " Better than the Original?";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to making a film in Hollywood these days it would appear that they are running out of original material. Any film that is over 10 years old has the chance of being remade but the real question is which will be better. This is a film that breaks the normal mold of being awful compared to its predecessor. I actually really enjoyed this remake and found myself more scared in this one than the original. Was this film Better? No. But it holds its own on its own merits. Having read the book this one is a little more true to the story and for that I applaud the film makers. The film was very good and I rate it in my Horror Hall of Fame.In this particular version of the film it could be said that it was more accurate to the original book. And for those who consider this to be a hoax there has never been any proof either way. It is quite interesting to hear people who think they are authorities on the matter. Most people probably have not even read the book. There have been more than one book written about what happened in the house and the house the stood on the same location prior to the incident with the Lutz family. This film represents more than just the book the Amityville Horror. It takes its cues from the different novels that have been written about the event and the location. This movie is very scary and has lots of good jumps in it. The director of the film was obviously very interested in not making a film that came across as a remake but one that could stand on its own merits and not those of its previous incarnation. When I go to a film I judge it by several different criteria since I used to be a movie critic for a reputable newspaper. These criteria are the following. 1. How did the movie effect the audience in general? 2. Storyline cohesion. 3. Special Effects ie. did they detract from the movie overpower the movie or just assist in the telling of the movie 4. Can it stand on its own if its a Prequel Sequel or Remake. 5. When I left the movie did I feel like I had been part of it ie Suspension of DisbeliefWhen I look at the Amityville Horror it scored highly in all of these categories especially the last which in my opinion is the most important of the 5. When you walk out from a film and you were ready to leave because the movie was good enough to make you feel as if you were part of it it was just a good movie. Most people have preconceived ideas about what a movie should be like when they go into it. I on the other hand go in as blank slate as possible so I can take the movie for its own worth and nothing else. It is a suggestion that I would give to all movie goers don't go in prejudging a film because of the movies prequels or predecessors. This movie is a prime example of trying to compare it to the original. The two movies were very different takes on the story and should be viewed as such.".

Seriously you just figured out there is major evil at play here and you go and face it on your own?There's suspense there's definitely horror and there is so much potential for a good story here particularly with the connection between Chelsea and Jodie what is afflicting Jodie the explanation for the evil the degeneration of the the main character throughout the movie and even the housegrounds themselves. Reynolds was so good in his role but as the narrative didn't flow and everything felt staged it just didn't deliver. Another horror let down for me.For the record I did not watch the original version. Maybe it's better.".

Seriously you just figured out there is major evil at play here and you go and face it on your own?There's suspense there's definitely horror and there is so much potential for a good story here particularly with the connection between Chelsea and Jodie what is afflicting Jodie the explanation for the evil the degeneration of the the main character throughout the movie and even the housegrounds themselves. Reynolds was so good in his role but as the narrative didn't flow and everything felt staged it just didn't deliver. Another horror let down for me.For the record I did not watch the original version. Maybe it's better.";

Refresh my memory..at what point in the book does George Lutz become an axe wielding psychopath??? Where does it mention some ignorant Indian killing preacher that lived in the house and had a torture chamber in the basement? When in the hell did they get this stuff. I seriously think dimension films owes me a refund for the time spent at this movie. I went to their website but there is no way to contact them no surprise there. If they keep putting out garbage like this I wouldn't want anyone being able to contact me either. I really don't remember any part in the book or original movie where Mrs. Lutz turns into some Bruce Willis oneliner spouting action hero. No one dies today! before wacking George with a shotgun or whatever the hell she picked up. If I were the Lutz's I would be ticked to be portrayed in this way. After making this movie poor Ryan Reynolds actually has to keep Blade Trinity and Van Wilder on his resume as his best work todate. Sorry Ryan hope things get better for you. Please avoid this movie if you can and if you did already see it let me know if you know how to get a hold of the studio so I can demand a refund.".

	schema:headline " Amityville Horror Remake  Worth 50 Cents?";
	schema:reviewBody "There MAY be spoilers although you will probably thank me for the one's I point outFor those of you who haven't seen the original?Do not see this movie.For those of you who have?For the love of God stay away from this movie!Now I've only seen about 80 of the original Amityville with chunks missing from the middle but I think I can safely say  the original was better than this train wreck in every way1 The new Amityville is not a horror movieThis requires a bit of explanation  the remake is not a scary movie it is an occasionally surprising movie. Sure there are dead people ghosts blood etc but it's nothing horrific per se. Hell how hard is it to scare somebody when they're sitting in the dark staring at a 40ft lighted screen and surrounded be loudspeakers? If I were watching a movie about puppies and you suddenly shifted the screen to a picture of kittens but played a really loud 'scary' sound effect I'd probably sht my pants.2 The term 'Remake' is very loosely impliedIt would have required a lot less time and energy just to make a new film instead of butchering the original plot to make room for more BOO! moments. Whereas the original showed the father George slowly coming under the influence of the house it seems that after stepping foot in this new version of the house George goes completely psycho. Within a week he's yelling at his stepchildren and bitching at his wife. Oh yes the house... now like I said I didn't see ALL of the original but I'm pretty sure I don't remember the part where the spirit of an evil Quaker Oats guy who tortured Native Americans and then committed suicide was the cause of all the trouble. Again maybe that's just me. Also did I miss the part with the crazy ass potsmoking babysitter in the original? I don't know!3 The DogIn the remake they find it necessary to have George axes the hell out of the family dog and then show it's mangled corpse. In the original I seem to remember George running back into the house after his family escapes just to save this dog! Now one may seem sappy but the other one involves a mangled dog corpse so you can see which one I prefer.4 The Softcore Sex SceneThe softcore sex scene between George and his wife Kathy played by the surprisingly hot Melissa George it starts out with so much promise! She disrobes and mounts her husband which is followed by a minute and a half of implied humping where you get a great view of her back from the waist up. So far so good. And then... BAM Dead girl being hanged. My reaction? JESUS! What the fck?! God damnit! That's... God DAMNIT! And so on so forth. Definitely one of the movie's most startling moments but also it's most brutally disappointing. You expect a treat and you get sucker punched right in the family jewels.I could go on but I think by now you've got the picture. Having seen this movie at the dollar theater where I got a halfoff discount because it was Tuesday I can safely say that I feel grossly overcharged for having wasted my time on such a blatantly bad movie.".

I did think that first hour was amazing. Faster paced than original and it went for the more visceral scares which do work most of the time. I give this flick a 7 out of 10.

From the very first frame to the very last you will be terrified. I could keep going but I wont because you should be in the car going and seeing this horror masterpiece.

There is a lot more information in this movie than there was in the original. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George did a great job especially Ryan I have never seen anyone who can look so mean. If anyone remembers Jodie from the first movie she was a pig she isn't a pig in this one she is just a little girl but a creepy little girl. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD I liked it that much. If you are looking for a good scary movie I would recommend this movie. This movie does not have a lot of gore and does not go to over the top with things that could never happen it is done just right.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the theatre with mixed expectations... Thinking of Ryan Reynolds in a serious character position Blade Trinity doesn't count here sounded dangerous but interesting and I wasn't disappointed. He plays George Lutz an easygoing guy with a great lifestyle. Recently married he lives with his new wife Kathy Mellisa George who most Aussies will recognise from the longrunning series 'Home and Away.' Reynolds doesn't let us down in one of his best performances considering before this his history contained comedy all around. The movie starts off in good fashion also. Instead of a long boring start sequence the action kicks off around 10 minutes in and i'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this.The main storyline revolves around the Lutz family including Kathy's children Billy Michael and Chelsea who have recently moved into a deceivingly beautiful Victorian house inside a gorgeous forestlike surrounds of Amityville and their 28 day stay before fleeing the house in terror never to return again even for their possessions. The movie tells as much as possible on what the Lutz family encountered in those 28 days and all I can say is this... a terrifying sequence of events which in turn turned out to be a true story. If you're like me and enjoy a fasterthanaverage storyline with fast thrills and action this is the movie for you...But I warn you the jumpy fright scenes aren't seen coming so be careful!!! 810".

One thing that makes me EXTREMELY happy is that the movie doesn't have the obligatory shot of a woman's bare chest. You do however see a short sex scene with nothing more than a bare back. Being a girl I really don't want to see that. It's totally stupid and unnecessary anyway. No boobiesA ...

	schema:headline " Michael Bay is Dangerous!";
	schema:reviewBody "My take on this film is best expressed in the form of a letter to director Michael BayDear Mike I don't know who your Hollywood studio friends are but I'm certain they're in very high places. How you are continuously allowed to take these wonderful stories with great movie potential and simply make a joke out of each and every one of them is beyond my understanding. I know it is not cheap so I assume your friends have money to burn. Perhaps making a good film is never on your agenda to begin with. Maybe its all about taking sensational subject matter and backing it up with millions of dollars worth of marketing and publicity. I thank God you weren't trusted with Titanic! Either way I beg you to stop this madness at once!As for my opinion of the Amityville Horror another one bites the dust. Amityville starts out looking like it might just be good. A great story that many of us are familiar with given a just redo with all the benefits 25 years of cinematic improvement can offer. Not to mention a big studio budget. Unfortunately the beginning of the film is about all thats worth seeing. Once we are introduced to the new and improved Lutz family things start going sour fast. The excessive smooching between Cathy and George was overkill. Casting a closet homosexual as the burly blue collar Mr. Lutz made every scene with him in it very difficult to watch or even try to believe. No offense intended toward Mr.Reynolds If Kiss and Alice Cooper were the only period references you could think up to bring us back to the 70s then you should have hired a consultant for a couple dozen more. Ever heard of Led Zep? By the way what the hell was that montage music supposed to be 70ish? The crap hits the fan a little too fast and George starts to loose the audience before he had the chance to win them over to begin with. Your fixation on Jodie really killed what could have been a significant and scary character. The first few shots of Jodie worked well but the remaining 18 or so were almost sleepinducing. You showed us in the beginning that you knew about all 6 people who were murdered yet you decided to leave all the haunting to Jodie alone. Thanks for trying to clean everything up with the Ketchum theory. Unfortunately it did not work well. Perhaps in the horrorthriller genre its best to leave some things in the realm of the unknown. I took the liberty to rent the DVD of the campy lowbudget original 1979 film and watched it the night before your film8217s release just to get myself revved up. Heres what I want to point out You had the budget and technical advantage but still could not scare your audience. Shock yes. Scare no. The original inspired many horror films to follow including Steven Spielbergs Poltergeist. Your film only drew from past works and was very clich. The original did not discount the effect of good film MUSIC! Its score alone was the definition of creepy to the 10th power! Your .50 cent score was difficult to remember even while it was still playing. The HOUSE in the first film was just that...a house. In fact in reality it was just a house. It was the portrayal of the house in the first film that made it so scary. The slight redness in the upstairs windows was more than enough to drive this point all the way home. Your house on the other hand was hollywoodized to the MAX. Just from the poster I could tell you went way over the edge and built yourself a Psychoesquire MANSION!!! The Lutzs paid 80 thousand not 500 thousand Mike! From the peeling paint all over the exterior and the multigabled roof to the labyrinth in the basement and the cartoonishly skewed upstairs windows your version was definitely bigger but not better. One more thing did you think you had to do that to Harry the dog in order to appeal to the desensitized youth of this generation? Big mistake. You might as well have superimposed Jack Nicholsons character from The Shining in Georges Place. and the Silent Hill scary effect has been overdone. It is no longer effective. I must admit that some of your cinematography was beautiful but it happened to be in a very bad movie. Bad writing directing scoring and overall bad decisionmaking. You could have seized this opportunity and put a lot of good material into this film. Material from the book the old movie and from interviews with the Lutzs themselves. Instead you chose to dwell in the realm of typical and blas and so you have yet another Michael Bay dud to show for it.In closing I hope you make a hell of a lot of money off this film and go into an early retirement PLEASE!!!JM".

The kids are great the girl who befriends Jodie DeFeo The only downside to the film is that they changed Allison's name to this to fit Jodie in my opinion it would've worked better if she just made up a name for her old name. It also serves as more of a complete film. It goes more on the John Ketchum aspect of the story. There is no red room thank god.It is SCARY. Its use of suspense is great. There's one particular scene in the bathroom with one of the children and the closet scene which are must sees. Jodie is the creepiest ghosts ever. There is actually a story to it unlike most horror movies.The 87 minutes which it runs will feel like you lived the 28 days the Lutzes experienced in that house not only because it follows you through the days but because you're put in their shoes How much can wethe Lutzes take of this before we leave? When they leave you want to leave. Before then you just want to wait things out. And the waiting feels like 28 days because the evil never stops.".

When it first started I felt like we were sitting through some sort of satire of the original...Ryan Reynolds is too much of a comedian so I had a hard time believing a lot of his serious delivery of lines. Then in the middle I thought I was watching a really bad Britney Spears music video A 16 yr old scantily clad babysitter asking a 12 yr old if he's ever french kissed?? and finally towards the end I thought it was another remake of 13 Ghosts. Yes...if you liked the original then it is safe to say you will hate this film like me. Don't bother going to the theater to see it or even waste the 4.00 rental fee to rent it. Wait till it airs on TBS about 3 yrs from now at 8 o'clock at night...trust me...you will appreciate the warning. 3.510".

By comparison we've come along way since the days that the horror movie genre had to depend on sound tech for the scary effects of a film. The 2005 version has been anticipated for years because there was so much creativity in the story. Now it can be brought to life on film. It was a shocking movie that will be enjoyed long after the credits roll. It will probably be scary for some after then too.".

However the girl is revealed to be harboring motives of her own as she proceeds to poison and rob her wealthy admirers for the sake of her true love! Worth noting here  apart obviously from the luscious Pierros classical beauty  is the period dcor especially the labyrinth in which Raffaellos quarters are concealed.The second episode is the most notorious and consequently gave the film its controversial poster  featuring a rabbit slowly disappearing under the skirt of a teenage girl played by Gaelle Legrand. This segment is also a period piece but its set in 19th century France  with the girls excessive fondness for her pet bunny she likes to spread on the garden lawn stark naked and let the curious furry little animal explore her body! falling foul of her condescending and slightly barmy family. She then visits the horny black butcher who supplies them with lamb chops ostensibly to steal his carving knife but he proceeds to ravage her immediately regrets his selfish act and decides to hang himself  leaving the girl free to exact her bloody revenge on her oblivious sleeping parents. The latter event then subsequently becomes a bedtime story told by Legrand to her companions at the orphanage she ends up in! The third and final episode which has a modernday setting is the shortest  but also possibly the most outrageous Pascale Christophe is a young married woman whos abducted on a busy Parisian street by a smalltime hood hidden inside a cardboard box! They move inconspicuously i.e. the box moves! through the crowd until they reach his van from where he starts organizing her ransom. She goes to a phone booth to call her husband all the while being in the criminals line of fire the womans faithful Doberman senses that something is wrong and sets out in pursuit of her. Amazingly the dog manages to locate the van by a river and savagely attacks the young man who at the time was raping its mistress as soon as he appears out of the vehiclebut the same thing happens when the husband finally arrives both he and the criminal screaming in pain eventually tumble into the water.

IMMORAL WOMEN therefore provides many of Borowczyks typical ingredients  filmed in his traditional dreamy softfocus and set to the equally familiar strains of a harpsichordsynthesizerbased score sexualized objects suggestions of bestiality a depraved religious environment which includes depicting Michelangelo as a neurotic homosexual given to liberating bouts of mudslinging! snooty bourgeoisie etc. As was the case with IMMORAL TALES the cumulative experience of the film is somewhat underwhelming and at nearly 2 hours decidedly draggy such slight and fanciful pieces are perhaps best sampled individually! Even if Borowczyk started his career by churning out surrealist animated shorts it seems to me that he did his most potent work when his themes were fleshed out to featurelength form a case in point being THE BEAST 1975 whose bizarre centrepiece was initially intended to form part of IMMORAL TALES itself  but was ultimately given added texture by being framed inside a modern and quite fascinating morality play!.".

I finally got a copy of this film that is fully uncut and it is much better. Of course the story line is quite simple. A ship is found with some extremely mangled bodies on board and some eggs that look similar to the eggs from the movie Alien only much smaller and when picked up they explode causing anyone around to basically explode from the inside. So you can only imagine where the story line is going from here. Great gore effects Zombi 2's Ian McColluch and a good score by The Goblins make this a descent Italian horror flick. I enjoyed it and I think most fans of the genre will. And by the way other than the exploding eggs this movie is in no way like Alien.

Alien 2  On Earth was much more fun.Anyway the narrative begins as an exact copy of Zombie Flesh Eaters with the appearance of an abandoned boat floating into New York Harbour. Even the dialogue is copied from that film  The skipper of that boat must be a real turkey!. Not only do the Italians ripoff Hollywood movies they rip each other off as well.Predictably the police who investigate the boat stumble across the dead crew who fall out of cupboards and look as if they have been ripped open from the inside! They then discover some strange egg like shapes Maybe they're avocados! enthuses one policeman. However when they try to pick one up it explodes showering the police in sticky goo. The goo leads to immediate imflammation of the belly and pop! they're guts fly out all over the place. Not a bad effect although if you look closely at one of the victims he has suddenly become a foot wider to make room for all those animal entrails.The police captain escapes and helps Commander Stella Holmes Louise Marleau in the hunt to discover the origin of the eggs.They visit Hubbard Ian McCulloch who was part of an expedition to Mars some years previous who was declared crazy after talking about seeing thousands of eggs there. Now living in alcoholic squalor he moans at Lt. Holmes before telling his story. Cue flashback of the expedition to a Martian cave and a terrible attempt at recreating the exact scene in Alien. The acting in this bit is truly atrocious as McCulloch delivers his lines I looked at Hamilton  and he was his eyes he was beginning to....Hamilton.....HAMILTON! Followed by a Daa Daaa DAAAAAAAA on the soundtrack. Truly the funniest part of the movie using that same useless Goblin soundtrack that for some reason everyone raves about  why? It's terrible!Well it's not great and nowhere near as fun as Alien 2  On Earth but it's better than the average trash movie.

A freakin' mess that's what.Contamination pits the unlikely team of Col. Stella Holmes a coldhearted intelligence officer Tony Aris an obnoxious NY cop and Ian Hubbard a washedup bitter exastronaut against an evil organization planning to smuggle thousands of bacterialaden alien eggfruit into New York City. Their investigation eventually takes them to a South American plantation where Hamilton Hubbard's old crewmate from an expedition to the Martian polar ice cap is revealed as the architect of the plan at the behest of his cyclopean alien master.Sounds like a perfectly serviceable Bmovie plot line you say? I suppose it could have been if anything in the movie had made any sense. For instance can anyone explain to me the point of the Cyclops' plan? Are the eggfruit supposed to wipe out humanity? 'Cause if so they're woefully inadequate for the job. Sure anyone caught in the splash radius when they ripen and burst immediately dies a hideous death from fastacting Explosive Ebola but the disease is never shown as being able to spread beyond that initial release. So to kill everyone you'd have to explode an eggfruit next to every man woman and child on the face of the Earth. Are they part of the alien's reproductive cycle? Hamilton seems to think so in one scene but we see no evidence of that and Col. Holmes' crack scientific team finds no sign of any embryonic creatures in the eggs just lethal bacteria. Good thing too because otherwise judging from the number of burst eggs just left lying around during the course of the film there'd have to be quite a few baby Cyclops wandering around at the end of the film that no one is even bothering to look for. Another bit of absurdity  Col. Holmes was a major player in the investigation which declared Hubbard insane when he returned from Mars babbling about footballsized green eggs. Yet when she is called in to deal with the NYPD's discovery of deadly footballsized green eggs she doesn't make the connection until her science team connects the dots for her.And those are just two of the bigger holes in the plot but let's move on to the other problems. Like say extensive padding. From supposedly tense scenes that drag on way to long like when Holmes is trapped in a hotel bathroom with a ripe egg travelogue scenes showcasing the native splendors of South America and utterly pointless transitional sequences Contamination milks virtually every known strategy for extending runtime without advancing the plot.Or how about those famous Italian gore effects? Sure a couple of the early deaths are fairly effective but by the end of the film things get really sloppy. Character deaths are foreshadowed by a sudden conspicuous weight gain due to the size of the blood'n'guts pack under their costumes and obvious patches are blown off their outfits when their guts explode. And of course there's the Cyclops. Not a bad design from a pure looks standpoint kinda reminiscent of the avocadocreature from one of the old invasion flicks It Came from Outer Space? It Conquered the World? It Did Something I'm Sure but spiffed up with nicer materials facial articulation and a few buckets of slime. But the finished creature is too big and bulky to actually move around so it has to be given mind control powers so it can force people to simply walk into its mouth at mealtimes. One could also assume that that's how its getting all these thugs smugglers and exastronauts to work for it but that's never addressed in the film. Maybe it just pays really well.So while Contamination starts out strong it rapidly collapses under the weight of its absurd plotting clichd characters and generally poor filmmaking. And the saddest thing? They wasted a perfectly good Goblins soundtrack on this debacle. My advice? Don't bother with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Luigi Cozzi scifi horror movie gained some infamy here in the UK for being one of the films which made the infamous video nasty list i.e. films released on home video in the early 80's which were regarded as criminally obscene by the British authorities. Like many others from this list it's hard to work out exactly how this one made such a notorious list as while it is gory in places it's quite far from being ultrashocking stuff. It would probably be fair to say that this one takes some influence from Alien 1979 with its focus on scary throbbing eggs which explode it also shows the influence of Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 with the idea of alien mind control. A boat drifts into New York harbour with all its crew dead and mutilated. It soon becomes apparent that this was caused by the aforementioned strange eggs. Before long it becomes apparent that they are related to a recent Martian expedition in which one astronaut made odd claims about a cave full of eggs. The authorities get in touch with this now alcoholic exastronaut and a small team head to South America in search of the origin of the shipment of deadly eggs.You wouldn't describe this as a stellar example of Italian horror but for me it is a perfectly entertaining one. The storyline while influenced by other films is distinctive enough to stand on its own while the gory effects were executed well enough and kept things interesting. There was some attempt at generating tension with a suspenseful scene in a bathroom where a woman is trapped in the small room with a pulsating egg. While the final scenes with the cyclops were good enough too. Aside from its video nasty status the film is perhaps best known nowadays form featuring a score from soundtrack legends Goblin. Its maybe not up to the standard of the work they did for Dario Argento but it is still very good nevertheless and adds some class to proceedings. It's hardly an actors film but it was good to see regular of Italian exploitation movies Ian McCulloch Zombie Flesh Eaters 1979 appear as the bitter astronaut. Overall you could do worse than check out this bit of scifi horror hokum.".

	schema:headline " Green eggs that go SPLAT!";
	schema:reviewBody "A crewless ship that's supposedly carrying coffee sails into New York but when a police officer and some scientists board the ship they discover the gruesome bodies of the crew and plenty of boxes filled with large green eggs. Which explode when the egg warms up and anyone who gets in contact with the substance that shoots out of the egg explodes as well. So now the government gets involved and the surviving officer a colonel and an astronaut discover that these eggs may be linked with the disastrous mission to Mars. The more they look into it they discover a conspiracy that threatens the world and leads them to a coffee plantation in Columbia.Coming straight off the back of the success of Alien is an ultragooey and clunky delight of a lowbudgeted Italian knockoff. And there's no shame about it stealing ideas but it still does delivers it's own variation to the premise with a modest quota of adventurous aspects and developments that occur on earth. There's even a touch of James Bond about it in the villain and motivation side of things. Actually the film probably leans more towards that later statement than a fully blooded Scifi caper. The ticking time bomb of a story is pretty much pure hokum and there's very little in the way of sense but it's the dominating grotesque visuals and the intense gallery of cheap thrills that certainly makes this outing lively.

	onyx:emotionText "A crewless ship that's supposedly carrying coffee sails into New York but when a police officer and some scientists board the ship they discover the gruesome bodies of the crew and plenty of boxes filled with large green eggs. Which explode when the egg warms up and anyone who gets in contact with the substance that shoots out of the egg explodes as well. So now the government gets involved and the surviving officer a colonel and an astronaut discover that these eggs may be linked with the disastrous mission to Mars. The more they look into it they discover a conspiracy that threatens the world and leads them to a coffee plantation in Columbia.Coming straight off the back of the success of Alien is an ultragooey and clunky delight of a lowbudgeted Italian knockoff. And there's no shame about it stealing ideas but it still does delivers it's own variation to the premise with a modest quota of adventurous aspects and developments that occur on earth. There's even a touch of James Bond about it in the villain and motivation side of things. Actually the film probably leans more towards that later statement than a fully blooded Scifi caper. The ticking time bomb of a story is pretty much pure hokum and there's very little in the way of sense but it's the dominating grotesque visuals and the intense gallery of cheap thrills that certainly makes this outing lively.

	schema:reviewBody "Good gooey undemanding entertainment directed by Luigi Cozzi The Killer Must Kill Again and more than obviously inspired by the huge success of Ridley Scott's blockbuster Alien. The most memorable sequence in that particular SciFi classic involved one of the spaceship crewmember's chest exploding onscreen. If you were thrilled by that scene and if you're a SciFi  horror fan I can't imagine you weren't you will absolutely LOVE Contamination as Cozzi revolves his whole film on the given of nasty chest implosions. A gigantic cargo ship arrives in the New York harbor but there isn't a crew member in sight. It's quickly discovered what happened to them as a research team stumbles upon hundreds of big green eggs that explode when temperatures increase and cause to implode anyone standing near them. The eggs are clearly extraterrestrial but they're transported in coffee cases so a female military major starts an investigation to find out who's shipping these alien murder devices to all corners of the world. Contamination has quite an intense and suspenseful opening but then it rapidly becomes the gory and unscrupulous videonasty it's reputed to be. The dialogues and acting performances aren't very impressive but the gore is delicious and leaving very little to the imagination. Plus the makeup effects are actually quite convincing and professional not nearly as cheesy as in most other and often nonItalian Alien ripoffs. The ending is marvelous as we get to see the Martian monster that breeds the murderous eggs and I assure you it's bigger and uglier than the average earthchicken. Oh another great Goblin score too!".

Yes this movie probably deserved winning in the category Best exploding torso in a dramatic context in the GOREZONE magazine. Inbetween these rather cool sequences there are sometimes painfully slow exposition and dialogue which varies between dull and hilarious. Some cool sound effects though and nice Goblin score.

Afterwards the movie came out in many versions so it became hard to find the uncut version. Anchor Bay is a DVD label that sometimes brings out limited editions mostly numbered that are full uncut. Alien 2 was one of the rip offs also being cut but couldn't deliver any suspense although it contained some gory moments. the same with this flick. It all starts with a ship were some bodies are found bodies terrible mutilated. Soon they discover that they exploded from the inside out when they notice some glowing things they found out that they contain acid that make you explode. Guess what the eggs hatch within reach of the newcomers aboard and they explode in full vision. Wow gore galore but after 15 minutes the movie decays into a thriller nothing happens until in the last 10 minutes. A real shame that they didn't do anything between those first and last minutes of the movie it's all blah blah blah. Be sure to have the full uncut to see the exploding bodies otherwise you will have some crap.".

What followed next was one of the cheesiest films from that golden era of Italian gore the ridiculous but undeniably entertaining Contamination. So if Zombie was Italy's answer to Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 this was their answer to Ridley Scott's classic Alien 1979. In some territories Contamination was even retitled Alien 2 to cash in on that film's success. Don't be fooled though this has nothing in common with Scott's horrorscfi classic.The film opens in New York Harbour a la Zombie with an abandoned ship drifting in the dock. A group of detectives and an annoying downtown cop board the vessel and find the remains of a few crewmates. They then discover boxes containing green eggs. Unfortunately for these sorry policemen an egg has began to ripen. Suddenly it explodes and sprays the bystanders with deadly alien ooze that causes stomachs to explode. Great gruesome special effects here all shot in slow motion a trick shown again later in the film. The only survivor happens to be the annoying cop. He befriends the Colonel of Special Division 5' ? played by Canadian actress Louise Marleau and together they remember a Mars expedition where an astronaut named Hubert apparently went insane after seeing a load of green eggs' hidden in a cave on the red planet. Hubert McCulloch is now an alcoholic who reluctantly puts down the bottle to join the pair and solve the mystery. The aforementioned ship was supposedly delivering coffee beans so the brave trio head off to the base in Columbia to prevent an ongoing conspiracy organised by Hamilton another astronaut from the same Mars expedition. Inept cop drunken astronaut and the liberated Colonel' are then introduced to The Cyclops A huge creature that Hamilton somehow brought back with him from Mars without anyone noticing. This alien produces the green eggs in the basement beneath the coffee factory. The manufacturers of this company are all under The Cyclops' hypnotic influence and plan to bury the eggs in the New York sewers and blow up the city.From the plot synopsis I hope you can gather that this film is unbelievably silly There's the weird outofsync dubbing which includes some great jaw dropping hilarious dialogue said with ridiculous melodramatic voices Where else will you find a movie including a woman screaming  Help me there's an egg!'? The green eggs are obviously painted balloons For a film of the period it seemed ludicrous but necessary to include the mention of zombies' who here are just men dress in protective suits similar to those found in Romero's The Crazies 1972 McCulloch's performance indicates his awareness of being in such an inept film but remains enjoyable all the same.Contamination also includes a fine soundtrack by Goblin which was later stolen as was their music from Dawn of the Dead and Beyond the Darkness for Bruno Mattei's uproarious Hell of the Living Dead 1982. This film was directed by another Dario Argento collaborator Luigi Cozzi who's worked on Four Flies on Grey Velvet 1974 Vampires in Venice 1986 and Dario Argento Master of Horror 1991. Contamination is one of his best directorial efforts that unbelievably found itself on the Video Nasties list in the UK.".

I've been told that another Italian knock off from this period Alien 2 On Earth is more fun than Contamination. One misses that deep space atmosphere a good deal. That said it's still a hoot to check out these effects and these performances. Also starring are Siegfried Rauch as the astronaut Hamilton Gisela Hahn as his associate Perla de la Cruz Carlo De Mejo as Agent Young and Carlo Monni as the illfated Dr. Turner.

Horrible alien parasites were top of the range. Then a year later Italy churned out its answer to ALIEN which of course upped the gore stakes but destroyed any atmosphere that the original may have had. Yes they served up a cheap exploitation film. But boy is it a good one? You bet. The alien eggs in this film are a lot similar to those in ALIEN almost identical in fact. There is a scene where a man wanders into a cavern full of them... just like in ALIEN. And yes they burst open too. But really those are the only similarities between the two films. From the moment CONTAMINATION begins you know this is something different. Something else. An Italian crime flick mixed with a surreal alien plot to take over the world. Is this class or what? Okay so the logic doesn't work in this film. The acting is bad and the dubbing is worse as per usual but thankfully these things don't detract from the film. Oddly they make it more appealing! Our friend Ian McCulloch ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS renowned ghoulzombiecannibal hunter looking a little older and wiser now gets a sub machine gun and goes around shooting people like a secondrate James Bond! What more could you possibly want? This is part of his Italian exploitation trilogy and although it's less entertaining than those other two trash classics it's still a winner. McCulloch is teamed with a surprisingly effective Marino Mase in a comedic role as a police inspector and the overthehill Louise Marleau who thankfully doesn't strip for the hilarious PSYCHOrip off shower scene in which Norman Bates is replaced with an alien egg! Fans of Italian cinema will also spot BATTLE OF THE STARS's Gisela Hahn as an icy villainess and Fulci regular Carlo de Mejo in a lacklustre role as a barelyseen agent.It's a slow starter and most of the film is at a snail's pace but the chest explosions that bookend the movie are well worth seeing. The Italians really reinvented the term 'chestburster' and took it to the extreme with flying entrails filling the screen at every opportunity in glorious slow motion. The dialogue is amusing too for example I feel like somebody's scratching my head but from the inside. or You'd need a crane to get it up. The Goblin score is jazzy as well. If you manage to sit through the film there's an extra surprise in store at the end a huge Alien Cyclops monster built out of cardboard and papiermache. Excellent! Someone gets eaten by it in closeup detail. It's the icing on the cake really. CONTAMINATION is typical Italian exploitation. It's not well made and has bad production values but it's fun and that's what really counts when it all comes down to it in the end. A classic grindhouse Bmovie that has thankfully received the uncut DVD release it always deserved.".

	schema:reviewBody "A cargo ship drifts into New York harbor carrying alien eggs that explode and cause everything they spray with their egg juice to explode also. There's a lot of exploding. A dumb New York cop Marino Mas and a bitchy Colonel Louise Marleau team up with a former astronaut Ian McCulloch and head to Colombia where they find a coffee plantation full of alien eggs. Oh and there's a big ugly alien cyclops.Italian scifi horror film written and directed by Luigi Cozzi Lewis Coates was his pseudonym. Cozzi is not one of the more respected Italian filmmakers but he did make some lowbudget trash that I enjoy like the awesomely bad Hercules movies starring Lou Ferrigno. This is a movie that borrows heavily from Alien and also a little from Lucio Fulchi's horror flick Zombie two hits from the year before this came out. Of the handful of Cozzi movies I've seen this is actually one of the more technically proficient. Don't get me wrong it's still only enjoyable as the cheese that it is but there are no visible boom mics or anything that would put this in Ed Wood territory. There's a good deal of gore and splatter effects which are fine considering the budgetary constraints. The music is provided by Dario Argento's favorite band Goblin. It's actually the best part of the movie and helps to build tension and create atmosphere in some scenes such as when McCulloch's character recounts what happened on Mars. Speaking of McCulloch he's just one of the hammy actors displaying their talents here. You have to expect a degree of bad acting from these things particularly where dubbed dialogue is involved. It's not a good movie but it does have some so bad it's good qualities that make it watchable. Spaghetti horror fans will like it more than most.".

In Zombie Flesh Eaters he took on a zombie horde and escaped only with a bum leg . In Zombie Holocaust he shot loads of cannibals and shouted at his own guides before pulping a zombie's head with a boat motor. Now in Contamination he gets to be an alcoholic actually emote for a change and turn a machine gun on guys in biosuits.But he doesn't turn up for the first half hour because first we've got to introduce our threat  egg like things.These egg like things turn up initially just like zombies and cannibals seem to do in New York. On a boat no less in boxes of coffee. When the cops and some scientists board to see what's going on they find loads of sploded bodies and some of those eggs including one that's pulsating. One of the doctors touches and the next thing you know everyone's exploding in extremely grotty detail. No matter how daft this sounds I fell in love with the film at this point.One cop survives and ends up in quarintine and is eventually let out to help a scientist chick track down whoever thought sending eggs that make people explode to New York. On the way they pick up washedup Jakeball astronaut Ian McCulloch because he was on Mars and might have mentioned something about strange eggs when he came back.From then on out it's talky bits double crossing romance gun battles a couple of more exploding people and an alien so crazy looking I couldn't help but grin as it ate one of the lead characters whole! Things might seem to drag for a bit once our protagonists head for Colombia until you concentrate and hear all the mental things they're saying to each other. The scientist chick gets locked in a bathroom with one of the exploding eggs and starts hammering the door screaming 'Get me out of here! There's an egg!' while McCulloch's speech about being on Mars and encountering something creepy stretches the endurance of any cheese lover.Still this film doesn't set out to be high falooting chin stroking scifi oh no. This is exploding people chick slapping plane crashing madness on a low budget scale with Goblin playing some funky stuff in the background. The low budget helps endear the film to the viewer even more  especially the bit where the cave on Mars was really a model filled with green olives instead of alien eggs! The usual unnecessary crazy epilogue seals the deal. Oh yes.".

	schema:headline " Good gory fun  a nice Alien ripoff";
	schema:reviewBody "If a movie was popular in America it's safe to bet that there'll be a load of cheap Italian ripoffs of it and Contamination is of course a Spaghetti impression of Ridley Scott's Alien. Despite being an obvious ripoff however Contamination has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that the film works as a standalone piece. This film was one of the 74 included by the British censors on the infamous 'Video Nasty' list and after the first ten minutes it's easy to see why. While the film is never extremely gory there's enough blood and guts to both satisfy gore fans and annoy the censors. The film differs from Alien first and foremost because it takes place mostly in New York rather than in space and actually reminded me a lot of Lucio Fulci's Zombie FleshEaters in the way that it starts out in the USA and then moves elsewhere. The plot follows a team that discovers a load of singing eggs yes singing eggs on an abandoned boat. It's not long before one of them explodes near to an unfortunate man who promptly finds himself without his skin. This prompts an investigation into the mysterious lifeform...The main reason why this film is so enjoyable is the sense of humour that runs throughout. There's a scene towards the start in which a police offer finds himself in quarantine which sets the film up nicely and makes sure the audience knows that they're not going to be in for an entirely serious ride. The plot plays out well and the way that it sets itself up for the twist midway through is good. The special effects aren't very imaginative as most of the aliens take the form as the aforementioned singing eggs although there is a scene towards the end of the film which features a full alien and while it doesn't give Ridley Scott's film a run for its money it is rather nice in a kitschy sort of way. Luigi Cozzi clearly isn't the best Italian director but he does a rather good job with Contamination and considering The Killer Must Kill Again also he's a little better than he gets credit for. The only real nasty scene in the movie for me sees an experiment performed on a mouse but overall I'd say this just about deserve its Video Nasty status and fans of Italian horror shouldn't be too disappointed by this cheap little flick.".

In my opinion Contamination is a reminder of all that was great about this now virtually extinct filmmaking phenomenon.Contamination is generally regarded as the embarrassing bastard child of Ridley Scott's Alien. While the film does shamelessly steal certain elements from Scott's masterpiece it is by no means a boring copy. The plot is so twisted and demented not to mention ludicrous and ridiculous that it transcends its borrowed elements and becomes something almost entirely unique and wonderful. For example whereas Alien takes place on a deserted spacecraft Contamination begins on a deserted boat then moves to New York City makes a detour via Mars and ends up in a Colombian coffee factory! In addition to the utterly preposterous storyline the joys of Contamination are manifold. There is the wonderful 80s synth score some of the most atrocious acting committed to film sidesplitting dialogue fantastically ancient cuttingedge technology the science lab is a marvel of 70s80s set design fabulous euroeffects among them glowing musical alien eggs exploding rats and better yet exploding people and then there is the Cyclops.I could probably write a novel just on the glorious Cyclops. What a wonder of latex and wire! The film is worth viewing just for this magnificent creature with its big glowing eye and vile snout. This kind of craptastic special effect died a painful death with the introduction of CGI and movies have been all the worse for it.Forget the pretentious rubbish clogging up IMDb's top 250 and watch this stunning opus instead.

	schema:reviewBody "I avoided this when it came out in 1989 having seen Coming Home 1978  and not wanting to revisit the theme of paraplegic sexual dysfunction  and frustration. I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our  involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to  serve up. And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic? I just didn't think it would  work.  Well my preconceptions were wrong.  First of all for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another  pretty boy which was basically my opinion this movie sets that  mistaken notion to rest. He is nothing short of brilliant in a role  that is enormously demandingphysically mentally artistically and  emotionally. I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be  the same person. Someday in his memoirs Tom Cruise is going to talk  about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.  And second Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in  wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.  There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling. There was no Jane Fonda  as in Coming Home to play an angel of love. Instead the high school  girl friend understandably went her own way and love became something  you bought if you could afford it.  And third Stone's depiction of Americaand this movie really is about  America from the 1950s to the 1970sfrom the pseudoinnocence of  childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to  having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothersinarms  being sent home in body bagswas as indelible as black ink on white  parchment. He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the  shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes  between antiwar demonstrators and the police outside convention halls  where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.  I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic  detail and sustained concentration this is his best. There are a  thousand details that Stone got exactly right from Dalton Trumbo's  paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I Johnny Got His Gun that sat  on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed to the black medic telling him  that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the  Vietnam war namely the civil rights movement to a mother throwing her  son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision  of what her son ought to be to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you  have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.  Also striking were some of the scenes. In particular the confession  scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot the Mexican  brothel scene of sexlove desperation the drunken scene at the pool  hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches and then the drunken  hatefilled rage against his mother and of course the savage hospital  scenesthese and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me  for many years to come.  Of course as usual Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily  upon his artistic purpose. Straightlaced conservatives will find his  portrait of America onesided and offensive and something they'd rather  forget. But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed  to get back somehow and see this movie will find it redemptive.  Certainly to watch Ron Kovic just an ordinary Joe who believed in his  country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics  go from a depressed enraged drugaddled waste of a human being to an  enlightened focused articulate and ultimately triumphant spokesman  for the antiwar movement for veterans and the disabled was wonderful  to see. As Stone reminds us Kovic really did become the hero that his  misguided mother dreamed he would be.  No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one. There is something  about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at  all that eats away at our consciousness. And yet in the end there is  here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a  man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.

	schema:reviewBody "You've heard the express can't see the forest for the trees right?  It refers to someone who gets so caught up in details they miss the big picture.  Reading other comments on IMDb regarding Born on the Fourth of July I think people have the opposite problem with this film.  So many people seem to get caught up in talking about Vietnam war Nixon America Communism and hippies that they totally overlook Ron Kovic. Ron Kovic is the center of this film.  In Platoon war was the center and the central character Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor was merely a POV character through whose eyes we could see war.  Not so in Born on the Fourth of July.  Vietnam is the setting the context and the backdrop. But Ron Kovic is the story.  Oliver Stone really understands a character arc.  Look at Kovic's life where it starts where it ends.  The film is the journey how he got from A to B.  It is a dramatization of a life as opposed to an actual life but it still rings true.  It feels true.  It reaches an artistic level of truth even if some literal truths are overlooked distorted or rearranged. That's what Stone is trying to do.  People who quibble about the facts miss the point.  This is a theme I will take up again when I review some of Stone's other films as Stone is constantly being bashed for historical inaccuracies.  The connections from one point to the next work admirably and the progression is completely believable which is quite a feat for such a dramatic change of attitude compare to American History X where the main character goes through a similar about face with scant motivation. Anyway what impresses me about this film is the honesty and respect with which Stone presents the opposing views of the film.  Say what you want about Stone's political beliefs but the argument in this film is presented in a very neutral light.  It's a story about Kovic's choices Kovic's politics Kovic's judgments.  And the antiVietnam beliefs he finally supports in the final act are a very natural and believable outcome of the story.  This film isn't anywhere near as didactic as some people like to imagine.  The tragedy of Oliver Stone is that because he has been so edgy so controversial so deliberately provocative no one can really just sit down and with a neutral eye watch his films.  They have become so burdened by this giant irrelevant political squabble.  The films have been subsumed by the very issues they sought to raise.  And it's a shame with this film especially because it is excellent.  Tom Cruise gives possibly the greatest performance of his career I can't think of anything that tops it though his performance in Eyes Wide Shut for very different reasons is just as remarkable.  The script is fantastic taking time where it needs to take time but not overly deliberate in its approach.  It's very economical with time.  It knows what each scene needs to say and says it without any excess baggage wasted space or dead time.  The direction is excellent as is the editing and cinematography.  The supporting cast is excellent.  But this movie would be nothing without the remarkable heartrending true story of Ron Kovic.  So while we admire the technical achievement of the film while we debate the points raised while we enshrine or excoriate the director as the case may be let's not forget the story.  Let's not get so fired up about Vietnam that we forget Ron Kovic.  He is the heart and soul of this film.  One final note  I bristle when people call this an antiwar film.  That really diminishes it I think.  It's so much more than that.  It's not just saying that war is brutal nasty and horrific.  It's saying something far more specific about a specific war and about the effect of that war on a specific man.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you see a war veteran campaigning against the very war in which he was willing to die once you begin to have second thoughts about the intent behind the war. Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US's offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war the question will haunt USA forever was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.Oliver Stone's Born on Fourth of July  based on the true story of Ron Kovic  takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence not for the first time though.Over next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece the character of Ron Kovic played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will love him now that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam the reality that he would not be able to father a child the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war  it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus 'ended' the patriotic fervor of a driven person but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.Born on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran's. At the end there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not  the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK's historical urge  Ask not what your country can do for you See what you can do for your country  only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty  the human spirit. And this reality hurts.".

While Platoon Stone's totally personal account of the Vietnam war is quite accurate and superb in many ways this film is better if only because it's not Stone's story. He takes the tale of Ron Kovic who wrote the book with the same name as the film and scripted by him and Stone and turns it into a blisteringly awesome and ultimately harrowing picture that has performances scenes and direction that top Platoon maybe it's a sign that practice makes perfectAnyway the tale centers on Ron Kovic played to a utter T by Tom Cruise good oldboytype of American kid who decides he wants to fight for his country in the Vietnam war even if he has to die for his country. He fights witnesses horror and makes a tragic mistake and comes back home a crippled from the waist down veteran who has to endure the emotional and physical pain of just being a veteran of Vietnam in a country where they are put down more than revered. All this and more including one of the most volcanic scenes I have ever seen between Cruise and Dafoe on a Mexico road lead him to become a antiwar activist.In making the big theme of the picture Kovic and his feeling on the war Stone depicts his journey excellently by showing his desire to be in it his confusion afterwards his eventual hatred and then placement in being against the war all the while still being a patriot. Not only does it work as a sagawar movie but also as a 180 degree change tale. Must must see for all Stone fans and for anybody who wants to see what Cruise can actually do with proper direction and script.".

	schema:reviewBody "What defines a great film?  I believe that for a movie to be great it should move you.  It should make you think.  It should make you reconsider your views and outlooks.  It should make you take a closer look at its subject matter.  It should draw attention to itself.  Above all you should gain some amount of enjoyment from a great film.  I believe that BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was a great film.  I say this because whether or not you agree with Ron Kovic's message and although Oliver Stone almost ruined it with his attempts to personalize reality the movie still made people stop and look.  It literally defined the Vietnam War for a generation of Tom Cruise fans and made many more aware of what the vets went through.  The cinematography score and fabulous acting made it a pleasure for many people to watch if only to see how Cruise would deliver his next line.The film grossed 70001698 nationwide.  In 1989 when BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was released movie tickets cost five dollars.  Therefore over fourteen million American people went to the theater to see this movie. The number of viewers increases when you take into consideration the people who rented it on video or watched a television broadcast.  It had that special something that made people think about issues that they might not have thought about before.  It is lamentable that by 1989 many of the members of Generation X had paid little or no attention to the Vietnam War even though only sixteen years had passed since the war's end.  The younger generation was reminded that the war did indeed happen and that the country was still being lambasted with the side effects.The camera work was extremely effective in relaying the messages in the film.  Different moods within the film were indicated by different tints in the color.  Combats were filmed in red while blue indicated sadness and white tints where used in the dream sequences.  Whether intended or not the colors of choice also coincide with that of the American flag which is very appropriate for the film.  The film also employed a wide variety of interesting angles without becoming confusing to the viewer.The musical score is one of the best of all time.  John Williams is a genius in the music industry.  His fabulous music can make a film feel the way it was intended to.  He seems to simply know what sequence of notes will produce what emotions.  Along with Williams' music the score also includes some of the popular music from the time of the film's setting.  For instance AMERICAN PIE by Don McLean MY GIRL by the Temptations and MOONRIVER by Henry Mancini all give the viewer who remembers the music a sense of nostalgia taking them back to those years.Two words sum up why the movie got the attention it did Tom Cruise. Many critics were skeptical whether or not the pretty boy of RISKY BUSINESS and TOP GUN fame had what it took to portray a real life Vietnam veteran and make the audience believe he was that person.  Fans crowded into the theaters to watch Cruise's handsome face which was not so attractive through most of the film.  Critics went to watch him blow the role.  But he proved himself and went above and beyond what was expected of him in one of the most moving performances I have ever seen.  He literally became Ron Kovic.Many people were affected by BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  It had great cinematography.  Its soundtrack was inspiring and beautiful pulling out of the viewer all possible emotions.  Tom Cruise's performance as Ron Kovic blew almost everyone away.  In short BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY has what it takes to be a great film.  It overcomes Stone's blatant manipulation of facts such as the violent conflict that in the movie occurs during a republican convention but in reality occurred during a democratic convention.  Powerful and touching it drives its point home and back again never missing a beat.8 out of 10 stars".

	onyx:emotionText "What defines a great film?  I believe that for a movie to be great it should move you.  It should make you think.  It should make you reconsider your views and outlooks.  It should make you take a closer look at its subject matter.  It should draw attention to itself.  Above all you should gain some amount of enjoyment from a great film.  I believe that BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was a great film.  I say this because whether or not you agree with Ron Kovic's message and although Oliver Stone almost ruined it with his attempts to personalize reality the movie still made people stop and look.  It literally defined the Vietnam War for a generation of Tom Cruise fans and made many more aware of what the vets went through.  The cinematography score and fabulous acting made it a pleasure for many people to watch if only to see how Cruise would deliver his next line.The film grossed 70001698 nationwide.  In 1989 when BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was released movie tickets cost five dollars.  Therefore over fourteen million American people went to the theater to see this movie. The number of viewers increases when you take into consideration the people who rented it on video or watched a television broadcast.  It had that special something that made people think about issues that they might not have thought about before.  It is lamentable that by 1989 many of the members of Generation X had paid little or no attention to the Vietnam War even though only sixteen years had passed since the war's end.  The younger generation was reminded that the war did indeed happen and that the country was still being lambasted with the side effects.The camera work was extremely effective in relaying the messages in the film.  Different moods within the film were indicated by different tints in the color.  Combats were filmed in red while blue indicated sadness and white tints where used in the dream sequences.  Whether intended or not the colors of choice also coincide with that of the American flag which is very appropriate for the film.  The film also employed a wide variety of interesting angles without becoming confusing to the viewer.The musical score is one of the best of all time.

Cruise gives the best peformance he ever will in a film as Kovic.....the golden boy who comes home paralysed and confused at the way his country is reacting to Vietnam. Some of the  scenes in the film are very disturbing but the ones that affected me the deepest were not any battle scenes. When Ron comes home and looks at himself as a young boy in his wrestling kit was almost unbearable to watch. Also the scene when he is drunk in the bar and comes out of his wheelchair had me turning away from the screen. This is a true epic film and the support cast and soundtrack are also superb. 55 easily.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start with the good news. Born on the Fourth of July is an absorbing piece of work based on a true story about Ron Kovic Tom Cruise a gungho Marineturnedwarprotester. We first meet Kovic as an allAmerican boy as strong in his faith as he is in his will to succeed. After high school he proudly joins the Marines hoping he'll be shipped to Vietnam to stop the spread of communism. But the barbarities of war including civilian casualties friendly fire and a paralyzing bullet through the chest gradually turn him against the conflict. Director Oliver Stone's method of telling Kovic's story over a period of several years is highly effective and convincing. Cruise is at his best as Kovic portraying a wide range of emotions and developing apathy with the viewer. The audience feels what he feels from confusion on the battlefield to the terror of being paralyzed from the waist down.Now for the bad news. The picture is overly political with Stone once again and unnecessarily casting Republicans as the bad guys and Democrats as the good guys seemingly ignoring that the Dems initially sent the troops to 'Nam. The film also takes a while to build up steam and the allAmerican life of the preMarine Kovic seems a little too perfect to be believable. Obviously a story such as this requires adequate screen time but the 145 minutes is slightly drawn out particularly toward the end. And although one of its central themes is the opposition to the war that greeted returning vets the genesis and rationale of that opposition are not adequately explored.As a whole however Born of the Fourth of July is recommended. Kovic's biography and Stone's masterful storytelling are a perfect match. It's not your typical war movie. In fact it's not your typical movie period.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is without doubt a very good wellmade film exploring the effect the Vietnam War had on America and its values.The film is based on the truelife experiences of Ron Kovic and is scripted from his book by director Oliver Stone and Kovic himself. Tom Cruise continuing his move away from teenage heartthrob plays the lead character whom we follow from freshfaced youth to frontline soldier in Vietnam to hospitalised patient right through to embittered wheelchair bound protestor.'Born on the 4th of July' revolves around Kovic to such a degree that any flaws in the characterisation would be fatal. It is some achievement that Cruise more than pulls off the part and despite the straggly stuckon moustache never fails to convince. Supporting performances are universally good without the story or script requiring them to particularly stand out.Praise aside the film doesn't achieve the epic status it strives for and it was no real surprise that it lost out on the Best Picture Oscar to 'Driving Miss Daisy'  in similar circumstances 'Apocalypse Now' was beaten by 'Kramer vs Kramer' 19 years earlier. Comparisons with Coppola's masterpiece are a mismatch however  'Apocalypse Now' is clearly the superior effort. To be fair 'Born on the 4th of July' doesn't try and cover similar ground but herein lies the problem. I'm not sure what ground Stone and Kovic were hoping to cover and whether the methods employed played strictly by the rules.It appears to be a hardhitting antiwar film criticising the very fabric of America in the late 60's. The audience is lulled into this premise the effect heightened with disturbing scenes to make sure the point is rammed home  Vietnamese women and children are accidentally killed by US soldiers Cruise is left lying wounded on a stretcher given his last rites the hospital back in America is a sordid filthy hellhole etc. These images are in our face so we unwittingly embrace the film as being highly critical of the circumstances behind the story it is telling. The problem is that 'Born on the 4th of July' isn't an antiwar film it is a propaganda film. The story takes the angle of naive youth being drawn into horrific events because of a blind adoration for the Stars  Stripes and Mom's Apple Pie. Despite the pain which then had to be endured by the end we are celebrating the resilience of the allAmerican boy who has come through with his personal values intact. The system may have been rotten around the time of Vietnam but the people and their beliefs were to be celebrated. The concluding atmosphere is of hope and light with a stronger America emerging from the dark in a new blaze of glory and jingoism. After seeing the film spotty teenagers are more likely to grab those Marine enrollment applications again  this is why the film is very subtle and clever in its underlying message.'Born on the 4th of July' hits all the right notes and is rightly acclaimed for this  I'm just not sure that the notes it aims for are as wholesome as they first appear. The excellent music by John Williams is perhaps the final giveaway  its just a little too rousing at every key scene trying to make us react like Pavlovian dogs whenever the high notes are struck. Like everyone else I salivated at all the right times but afterwards I found a sour taste in my mouth.".

Some of Stone's other films JFK and Nixon for example are very political as is Born on the Fourth of July but Born on the Fourth of July handles the nature of the politics in this film much differently and explores both points of view on the given topic as the main character switches his stance on war gradually throughout the film.JFK and Nixon Oliver Stone's other political dramas both start out slow and start to lag in some areas by means of slow pacing strongly evident in JFK and poor character development Nixon even though America knows the real Nixon but Born on the Fourth of July avoids these which comes surprisingly to me considering it's an Oliver Stone film. The hues of color each scene was filmed in provides different feeling throughout the film instead of being left with the same feeling throughout the entire picture.Born on the Fourth of July is the story of reallife activist Ron Kovic played by Tom Cruise based on his book and his screenplay cowritten with Stone. In the 60's in the midst of the Vietnam War as a high schooler the teenage Ron Kovic is sucked into becoming a U.S. Marine through lies and halftruths. When the Marine Kovic gets to Vietnam he engages in battle with Vietmanese villagers which results in him accidentally killing on of his squad. However the U.S. military fails to realized the accidental killing by Kovic thus adding to the lies and halftruths of the military.It is in another battle where the real story of Ron Kovic begins to form. As he fights in another battle Kovic signals men of his squad to come over when a bullet goes through the side of his chest severing the spinal cord and paralyzing him from waist down leaving him wheelchair bound for the rest of his life. It is in recovery in the mucky filthy VA hospital where Kovic's strength and determination are put to the testthorough the corruption of the doctors and the neglect of the workers and further injuries to his legs.When he comes home finds his life is completely changed but yet his entire family is changing their lives to help him more but his younger brother a teen against the war outrages Kovic for going against his Kovic beliefs saying the war is wrong. Over the course of several years through ups and downs Ron slowly realized the sin of war and he becomes an activist. This is just summarizing it up quickly though.Kira Sedgewick gives a satisfactory performance but one that wouldn't have have made much of an impact if it weren't included. Willem DaFoe's performance is one that could have been edited out without any harm to the story line seeing as he is only in the film for what seemed like twenty minutes. It is for these unnecessary roles that don't give this movie a ten.Born on the Fourth of July is movie different from other waractivist films and is one that should be appreciated for years to come.".

	schema:headline " An ambitious film but it doesn't pull it off despite being worth a look for Cruise alone";
	schema:reviewBody "Having had an allAmerican upbringing in Long Island Ron Kovic leaves school and decides to sign up for the marines to represent his country in Vietnam and make a difference. Having seen all manner of horrors Ron is shot and wounded in the field and finds himself in a veterans hospital where he hopes to regain the use of his legs despite the advice of doctors. When he realises he will never walk again it starts his mental collapse and he becomes increasing disillusioned with the country and he lost his legs for.There is nothing I dislike more than hearing uninformed people from other countries spouting about Northern Ireland so I'll be very careful about launching into any sort of preaching  I'll leave that to Stone himself. It isn't that I don't want to know more it's just that I have so much to learn about my own culture and history that who has the time for wandering off to learn about America's! Anyway there is no need for me to get on a soapbox because this film has a darn good go at doing it by itself. The basic plot is fine and very involving mostly because it is a real person not just a character but it weakens its impact by playing to the simplistic side of things. For example there is no question about Ron being a clean cut shy boy nor is there any complexity about how badly he is treated afterwards. In some regards this is fair enough but at times I wished that Stone had not been so strong in his sense of moral outrage because it doesn't give the subject the balance and subjectivity that it deserves to be presented with.This alone does not make it a bad film however and it isn't ever bad  just a touch heavy handed at points but it is very difficult to watch impassively and uninvolved. The film shows Kovic's collapse and gradual disillusionment really well in a way that stands for the mental andor physical suffering of many vets who must have come back to find that the sacrifice they had made was not even supported by the vocal section of the populace. In a way focusing on this one man makes for a story that is intimate but also has wider significance but in another way it means the film has to go into very specific areas that don't work so well. In particular I didn't think that Ron's Mexican trip worked that well and some aspects of his life were simply forgotten about Donna? and I wondered why they had even bothered to include them at all. Anyway despite these comments the film still worked for me and it is an impacting story even if Oliver Stone is not the person I would have chosen to tell the story  a very good director but 'nonpartisan' is not a term that could ever be laid at his feet and at points this film gets a little sermonising as a result.A big factor in this film working is a superb performance by Cruise who was still at this point a clean cut poster boy and not the one I would have imagined taking this role! In the first of two performances that I believe he should have won an Oscar for the other being SA for Magnolia Cruise is very brave and very strong in the lead convincingly taking us from a patriotic young boy to a injured soldier to a broken man to a man trying to put all the pieces together. Credit to both Cruise and the editor that this is done convincingly and without too many big jumps in character. Outside of Cruise though nobody is really given a great deal of material to work with and all their characters are pretty twodimensional and fleeting. If anything the support cast's main impact is to keep bringing well known faces to the screen these include Barry Sedgwick Whaley Baldwin times two! Dale Dye Berenger LeGros Bob Gunton Vivica Fox Mike Starr and brother Dafoe Sizemore Eagle Eye Cherry Wayne Knight and John C McGinley. Few of these have much to do but it is impressive how many faces there are that have since gone on to become wellknown actors in their own right I personally was surprised to see McGinley's only contribution being pushing a wheelchair or Fox being on screen topless for about 3 seconds with only one line but this actually takes away from the film more than it gives now.Overall this is an impacting film but not a great one. The story has a few bits that don't really work and aren't delivered very well while Stone's direction occasionally gets all preachy on us but although the now allstar cast are not great Cruise is superb and deals with the difficult role well.A very ambitious film and not one that manages to get it all right but still a film that is hard to ignore even if the same subject has been done better in other films.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a lifelong fan of Oliver Stone films I felt betrayed after seeing this on video for the first time. More than just about any other filmmakerscreenwriter Stone has inspired me to attempt to write my own screenplays. His movies always display a plethora of technical wizardry rendering the artistry of cinema in its boldest colors. Indeed so impressive is Oliver Stone as a showman that it is all too easy to overlook that many of the stories he tells range from the mediocre to in this case the horrid.Tom Cruise plays the famous Vietnam Warera Marine Ron Kovic the man himself appears in a small role in the film. But I am surprised that Kovic would have wanted anything to do with the filmic adaptation of his book considering how unflatteringly Cruise portrays him. As Kovic Cruise proves to be deeply unlikable and often unintentionally funny. He very poorly takes a stab at Kovic's Long Island accent. He brays Love it or leave it! as if that were some magical mantra. By the time we see him and Willem Dafoe spitting on each other I was laughing uncontrollably. I felt bad about laughing at what was ultimately a tragic story but I didn't really consider it my fault. I put the blame on the director and especially on the actors who look like sitcom stars being directed in an embarrassingly inept TV movie.All of this might have been forgivable if Stone had at least put some effort into the story but his efforts are hitormiss at best. The script is riddled with historical errors from Kovic's assertion that the North Vietnamese were fighting for independence blatantly false to the appearance of a rock singer belting out Rock Around the Clock in a Fourth of July parade taking place in 1956. Was rock 'n' roll really socially acceptable enough then to be a theme in a smalltown community parade? I think not. Then just to prove that he managed to stay awake in history class Stone hammers home every 1960s trope he can remember from burning the flag to the Black Power movement to the supposed sexual repressiveness of suburban Americans he misses no opportunity to play up the clichs. The fact that this movie won some Academy Awards tells me only that Hollywood will lavish honors on any halfbaked historical epic as long as it's done with enough chutzpah.Is there anything at all good about BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY? Well Stone does prove once again that he knows how to paint actionpacked panoramas on the screen his scenes of riots and firefights and parades are extravagant masterpieces at least when taken on their own terms. But they have been put at the service of a story that plays out like a twisted satiric comedy. Mark my words you will feel ashamed to be an American after watching this for it depicts us as profoundly delusional and dysfunctional and ultimately pathetic. It is a mystery to me why Stone who professes to harbor so much fondness for American history would go out of his way to squirt huge yellow gobs of macaroni at the Yankee Doodle Boy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone once posted To view this movie is an exercise of visual torture coupled with the bleed through view points of O. Stone. Some movies shouldn't be made but since this piece of garbage was then it shouldn't be viewed. Naturally this is just my opinion and generally I am not a flamer but I see no redeemable value in this film whatsoever.My take on Born on the Fourth of July As a moviegoer I wouldn't criticize this film as simply a piece of garbage but yes what the above poster had mentioned Born on the Fourth of July is rather an exercise of visual torture. The movie's slow there are grotesque scenes violence profanities etc.This film tells the true story of Ron Kovic a Vietnamwar veteran's tortuous life after the war and what we see here is basically the aftermath of how the Vietnam War has transformed himmentally physically emotionally shaped his attitudes of war affected his selfesteem and so on. However in my opinion for the above poster to see no redeemable value in this film whatsoever is a pitiful remark of one's unfamiliarity with facts and unawareness about history. Prior to Platoon Oliver Stone may not have done a great job directing this movie. But Born on the Fourth of July is THE kind of film that had to be made for the story had to be told  what the Vietnam War did to people in this case the main protagonist Ron Kovic was devastating. The wounded or suffered were innumerable. Thousands and thousands of Vietnamwar veterans were permanently scarred physically and psychologically and they found it difficult to return to civilian society while Ron Kovic was just one of many who were guiltridden about their role in the war paralyzed and suffered from post traumatic stress disorder. In all contrary to what the above someone mentioned this film DOES have a redeemable value for it tells an American tragedy through the perspective of Ron Kovic.".

Some movies shouldn't be made but since this piece of garbage was then it shouldn't be viewed. Naturally this is just my opinion and generally I am not a flamer but I see no redeemable value in this film whatsoever.My take on Born on the Fourth of July As a moviegoer I wouldn't criticize this film as simply a piece of garbage but yes what the above poster had mentioned Born on the Fourth of July is rather an exercise of visual torture. The movie's slow there are grotesque scenes violence profanities etc.This film tells the true story of Ron Kovic a Vietnamwar veteran's tortuous life after the war and what we see here is basically the aftermath of how the Vietnam War has transformed himmentally physically emotionally shaped his attitudes of war affected his selfesteem and so on.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful film. It captures and encapsulates the viewer in it's depiction of one man's life torn apart in turn becoming a metaphor for a broken nation. The crippling of Ron Kovic was a mirror to the crippling of the United States of America because of the Vetinam war. A country divided and a young mind changed forever in it's on going struggle to understand the insanity and horror of war.Tom Cruise gives the performance of his career as Ron kovic going from shy high school all American kid to wheelchair bound Vietnam veteran. His transformation downward spiral and consequent salvation are handled with masterful strokes by Oliver Stone. He himself a Vietnam veteran was able to capture the disbelief and feelings of betrayal from the wounded and crippled soldiers as they returned from a war with no basis or grounds to a country that gave no hero's welcome. The fire of their rage only fueled by the apathetic Nixon administration calling upon it's silent majority to endorse his war tactics whilst ignoring the cry of the returning soldiers.As a film it strays somewhat from the book it was based on and there are events depicted that were completely fabricated but overall the feeling of innocence lost come across well. The low and tight camera angles used to heighten the claustrophobia when Ron returns home in his wheelchair is a clever cinematic devise. The performance of the actors in this film are believable and true to the area the story is set in.I urge people to read Ron Kovic's book as well as seeing this film. They are both important topical period pieces of the late 60's early 70's Vietnam era in America.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first half of the movie is actually pretty good. A young high school athlete Ron Kovic proud of his country and eager to do his duty in Vietnam enlists and rises to the rank of Sergeant after a couple of tours. However on a patrol gone haywire he accidentally shoots another Marine and things begin to go downhill from their. He is later shot and is sent to a Veterans hospital and learns that he will now be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life. His friends and family begins to treat him differently and his own friends abandon him as they fall victim to the procommunist rhetoric that comes with the peace movement.This film is blatantly antiwar. Despite what others may say this was Oliver Stone's intent. This is a man who after September 11th said I think the revolt of September 11th was about 'F you! F your order Stone is a Vietnam Veteran and actually did more than one tour but said in his director's commentary in the Platoon DVD that the North Vietnamese Army were people who were fighting for their country making it seem that they were reasonable people fighting for a truly righteous war and not as what they truly were the sprouting tentacles of communism that was trying to spread like the plague throughout Asia. Something we were able to halt in Korea but too undermined from within by the antiwar movement to stop in Vietnam. His war films depict American servicemen as aggressive babykillers who come from the lowest depths of society. Enough about Stone let's address the movie's sole issue Kovic's alienation.When Kovic comes back to the States his friends practically ignore what he had done and ignore his personal suffering. When I say suffering I'm not just talking about his paralysis. I'm also talking about his innersuffering as he sees American flags being burned and even being harassed by hippies at a parade he attends in full dress uniform. Slowly time passes and begins to believe that the government has abandoned him and wonders around until the end of the movie when he becomes an antiwar advocate something he abhorred at the beginning of the film.If you want to see this movie make sure you keep the director's intent in mind. Not all experiences in Vietnam were bad for every single Veteran. Most of the Vets I have met are proud of their service and don't regret enlisting. Do not listen to the folks here at IMDb that equate this movie with Iraq. Today the commanderinchief treats his servicemen with the utmost respect something lacking 8 years prior to President Bush taking office. The government does its best to accommodate Veterans. Every now and then things get messed and some things do get hidden by pencilpushing bureaucrats but it's not the black helicopter cloak and dagger type stuff you see in the movies. Unlike what Born on the 4th of July implies every servicemen is a hero because he takes on the selfless task of enduring harsh extremes and the violence of war when others are too cowardly to do the same. Pacifist inaction does not keep a country free it's the armed servicemen that stand ready to do violence on those who threaten freedom.".

Unlike the John Wayne flag waver BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY is an entirely different type of movie  it's pro soldier but very antiwar  it's graphic  disturbing  foul mouthed  unsubtle but ever so slightly uplifting at the end Despite being made in 1989 and despite first seeing it in 1993 I can't help notice that this movie is more relevant today than it was in the 1990s . Whatever the rights and wrongs of the American led invasion of Iraq it saddens me to see coalition troops coming home in body bags  worse it saddens me more to see young servicemen return from the Middle East missing limbs  maimed for life with psychological and physical wounds that will never heal . Better to fall quickly in battle than suffer a handicap that will last 40 or 50 years is my meaningless abstract opinion on the matter  and Ron Kovic's and thousands like him injuries will never heal  a point made very well .I also couldn't help noticing there's an election going on for US president with the democrat candidate making a big song and dance number about his service in Vietnam . Is it just me or does anyone else think the democrats should have gone for Ron Kovic ? No one can question Kovic's patriotism unlike Kerry  no one can question Kovic's courage unlike Kerry's and no one can question Kovic's supposed injuries unlike Kerry's . Okay Kerry has three purple hearts against Kovic's one but Kerry can still run for the White House while Kovic will never be able to walk which shows that the purple heart is the most unfair military decoration ever invented and should be scrapped As for the rest of the movie Tom Cruise is an absolute revelation as Kovic  I've criticised him before notably in VANILLA SKY as an actor unable to put enough anger in to a performance but as a sometimes bitter man Cruise is superb here . Stone's direction is also good though it's by no means his best work  That would be PLATOON  and the story isn't always as focused as it should be but with the exception of JFK it's better than any of the over directed nonsense he's made since Seven out of ten".

He was still at it in 1986 with Platoon. He still obsesses over every Liberal cause like a conspiracy under every rock. Sadly like Moore Stone has the power and finances to inflict all his prejudices on the public in the form of movies.....and people what they see on screen.For every Ron Kovic the main subject of the film and a reallife guy who turned out to be a very bitter exsoldier there are thousands of military heroes who are proud to have represented the U.S.A. in Southeast Asia and have no regrets for doing so but filmmakers like Stone will never do stories about them. Kovic by the way was wounded on his second tour. He was awarded medals for bravery. If he won a dozen medals but did not turn out to be an antiwar spokesman you would have never heard of him. Hollywood and the media only glorify the left side of the political spectrum.Casting Tom Cruise in the lead was a good idea. Most people can't stand him in real life so playing a nagging whiner for much of the three hours made him easy to dislike.Stone is a capable knowledgeable filmmaker who isn't afraid to try different techniques witness the unpleasant but fascinating Natural Born Killers..

Everything is narrated with great image and dialogue realism. The only flaw in my opinion is the not so good performance of Tom Cruise whom I never considered a very good actor and seems not very authentic abusing some times of histrionic hysterism.

The only flaw in my opinion is the not so good performance of Tom Cruise whom I never considered a very good actor and seems not very authentic abusing some times of histrionic hysterism. Anyway a movie that can be considered a strong libel not only against the Vietnam war but against all wars.";

The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish.I literally couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that's a sign of a good movie when you just can't believe that you're already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene.The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film keep up the good work Rob.If you're into romantic comedies then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren't really into the whole romantic part of it the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film.I hope you like it. Thanks for readingChris".

I'd only wished I'd seen the film sooner because this seems like that perfect film for discussion with a circle of good friends at Pizzaria Uno. The movie came out in 1989 but for some reason I think this is one even our kids may like.Like all good films coming from the genere this film thrives most on its witty dialgue and cleverness in not sentimnetalizing it too much. In other words there is that perfect equilibrium between scenes of sheer poignancy and scenes of brutal comic relief. The thespians involved of course have a lot to do with the film's success and overall appeal. Ryan and Crystal are perfect for the roles assigned each one of them bringing their charisma and fresh breath of life to the screen. Crystal fits snugly into that character we find all too obnoxious but can't help but loving and Ryan well she is as adorable as always.The issue the film tackles is an important one I think. It asks us a question of universal importance namely can women and men ever be friends?. I'll leave that for you and your friends to talk about at Pizzaria Uno. For now I'll just say that with heaps of quirky funny dialogue a taut script from Nora Ephron and clean directing form Reiner When Harry met Sally is a highly enjoyable film that unsurprisingly has held strong a decade after its inception.dan".

Today it's Hanks and Ryan who are paired thanks undoubtedly to Sleepless in Seattle but one wonders why no one has tried to get Crystal and Ryan back together again.

	schema:reviewBody "Can men and women ever be merely friends without the temptation of sex rearing its ugly head? This is the question that this movie so famously posed  and so glibly answered  almost fifteen years ago. As it follows the progression of Harry and Sally  a pair of charming if neurotic Manhattanites  from enemies to confidants to lovers it seems to smugly relish the fact that it has proven its point men and women can never just be friends  sex is always the bond that unites them. But the film is so manipulative so dogged in its pursuit of this goal that it never appears an alternative position was ever considered. So as philosophy chalk When Harry Met Sally up to around zilch.Now disregard the above paragraph. Because When Harry Met Sally makes up for its slights to credibility and lack of rigorous thought by being easily the funniest movie of its year 1989. This humor flows mainly from the beautifully crafted scenes and dialogue indeed each scene is a dialogue set piece and could be transferred to the stage quite easily  surprising no one's ever done it actually which flows with the firm and confident rapidity of a 20th century Shaw or Oscar Wilde. Of course this approach has its downside too mainly that the lead characters seem less and less like real people and more like tools for the brilliant lines and conceits of the screenwriter Nora Ephron  never better in fact never even remotely close ever again. This may have something to do with the film's inability to seem completely real or true to human nature as it actually plays out  but with lines like these who's complaining?For what is great about the movie is not its originality it steals from all over especially Woody Allen movies and the few ideas it can truly call its own are as I've said not particularly bright or wellthought out but its ability to hone in on stereotypes of character and situation and offer pithy and hilarious precis of the malefemale condition through the witty banter and interaction of its characters. As such the film is less like a conventional movie and more like a standup routine dealing with life and love in the Big City it is to be judged not by its content but by the dexterity of its putons and oneliners. It is not surprising for example that several of its setpieces and comic notions were revisited just a few years later and in much the same manner on Seinfeld. In that regard it succeeds flawlessly.Just think of all the conventions it gets in and skewers the onetrack mind male Harry the sensitive and practical female repulsed yet intrigued by said male Sally the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field Carrie Fisher who keeps an index card file of available men the liveins who can't commit Sally and her exboyfriend women's concern with middle age and their biological clock I'm gonna be 40 weeps Sally. When? asks Harry. Someday. the male's tendency to skip out after making love the horror and unpredictability of blind dates and in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry  predictably perhaps as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still seeing him in this after years of halfbaked movies and fawning Oscar presentations it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and still be likable. Yo Billy if you're listening out there try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry though Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system. This role deservedly made her a star  but she has tried to go back to this particular well once too many times and it's become way too familiar you know the adorable brighteyed bit  mentally disheveled prissy around the edges with just a wisp of klutziness all topped by that cute megawatt smile.  It has become now the Meg Ryan character but back when Sally came along it was still fresh and it was tied to a particular personality. Ryan gives Sally a shycumtoughness as well as a moody slightly cynical and selfdeprecating wit that is just totally right. She and Crystal play off each other like two old pros and they weave in and out of some charming and hilarious verbal music. It's funny but I just recently saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon television marathon of Romantic Weepies  and it struck me as an odd designation because this movie is anything but a weeper. It takes a cleareyed almost cynical view of love and companionship and creates around it a charming tapestry of bracing wit and crunching dialogue. So save the violins and the handkerchiefs for romantic comedies less sure on their feet  whose deficiency in wit must be made up for by a surfeit of melodrama and manipulation. This movie is manipulative too of course but its manipulation is almost beside the point. It's the laughs along the way we remember here not the big kiss or the grand embrace. That Harry and Sally were meant for each other and that the film proves it is much less important than the fact that Sally does one hell of a great orgasm.Waiter I'll have what they're having . . .".

	schema:reviewBody "When Harry Met Sally may not at first seem to be the kind of film that remains classic and timeless. In this very cute exploration of an ageold question Can men and women truly just be friends? Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play the kind of characters we have come to love to see them play. No surprises there as they skillfully banter back and forth between adorable hysterical and morose as the plot rolls on. But upon closer inspection this film is actually full of nice surprises including its durability. Watch carefully and you will find one of the best examples of the way an excellent script can propel the plot character development and pacing of a film perfectly from start to finish. Many lines may seem to be merely entertaining oneliners but they also serve these other purposes simultaneously. This is a well crafted and well acted script. Even the most dated aspect of the film the intentional focus on clothing hair and makeup styles as they change throughout the decades has taken an unexpected poignancy now that the styles we may remember as current at the time have come to be oldfashioned themselves. The end result is that When Harry Met Sally speaks to us if we remember the times portrayed in the film or not. We're still asking questions about men and women and friendship and films such as this still help us answer them.".

	schema:headline " the perfect modern take on a classic idea";
	schema:reviewBody "Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenlymatched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another but over the course of the film this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON  he worldlywise and cynical she spoiled and certain of what's what. Neither of them it turns out is as right or as selfconfidant as they believe. What's very modern about WHMS is its attitude to longterm relationships. It's no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what or who they're letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together. Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There's an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film's structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There's a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship  the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film it comments on the action. The acting is superb with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher all giving careerbest comic performances. Without such fantastic performances it's very possible that the film could have failed these are essentially selfindulgent people that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it's funny. The oneliners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing and the setpieces are beautifully realised the orgasm scene is only the most famous  check out Harry's olympic sexdream speech  Must have been the dismount  or the I'm through making a schmuck out of myself phone call. All this and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? Nah you pretty much want to nail them too.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have only been but a very few films that have tackled the friendshipturnedtolove theme as beautifully as 'When Harry Met Sally' did. There have been numerous attempts thereafter the most recent one being 'A Lot Like Love' but none of them come close to this wonderful gem. Nora Ephron's writing is top class as it provides clever oneliners great dialogues wellwritten characters and a lovely story. Rob Reiner tells a common story in a very uncommon way. A lot of the movie is based on both Ephron and Reiner's experience. Similarly the characters of Harry and Sally are based on themselves. However they allow the actors to insert their own input which leads to the electrifying chemistry between the lead actors. The cast and crew have had a lot of fun during the making and the amount of heart that's been put into the film is quite obvious. The story obviously revolves around Billy Crystal's Harry and Meg Ryan's Sally. The two actors are fantastic to say the least and bring magic on screen. I wonder why they were never paired again. Perhaps it's for the best as they are remembered for this movie rather than what happened with Gere and Roberts after 'Runaway Bride'. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher deserve mention too for their great support as Harry and Sally's friends. Together with Crystal and Ryan they create some of the funniest scenes. The background music flows in a subtle way giving voice to the city and the songs fantastically add to the narration. Without a doubt 'When Harry Met Sally' is one of the finest films of its genre and one of the very few that stood the test of time. Even today people vividly remember Meg Ryan's memorable orgasm scene. Not that that's the only great scene in the movie. There are too many to list but to mention a few that I liked include the scene where Harry and Sally date each other's best friend but things take an unexpected turn the carride to New York the scene where Sally for the first time opens up to Harry about herself...For some people the film raised a question whether men and woman can be platonic friends without having sex ruining it. I don't think it was the intention of the movie as it's only about these two characters who have very different viewpoints and when they meet the first time there's a very strong attraction which stays throughout the end and Crystal and Ryan display that in a very subtle way. As the friendship grows stronger so does the attraction because it's not just physical anymore. The more they know each other the more they're drawn towards one another and the love gets stronger. Thus it's not about whether men and woman can have a successful platonic friendship but about two people who were always fond of each other become friends and gradually realize their love. 'When Harry Met Sally' isn't only for those who like romantic comedies because it can absolutely be enjoyed as a hilarious comedy.".

	schema:headline " Arguably the best romantic comedy of recent years.";
	schema:reviewBody "By the late eighties the romantic comedy as a movie genre had been in a sort of disturbed sleep for twenty years with only an occasional and disappointing movie outing between snores.Yet when they released 'When Harry met Sally' in 1989 it signified to the world that the RomCom was not only out of bed but it was showered shaved dressed in a brand new suit and ready to take on the world once more with new found confidence.It's 1977 and Harry Burns Billy Crystal has just graduated from the University of Chicago and is moving to New York to start his career. He's a nice enough guy who's only flaw seems to be his apparent misogynistic and macabre outlook on life.Also New York bound is fellow graduate Sally Albright Meg Ryan who as a favour for a friend agrees to take Harry along. The two have never met before and almost immediately Sally takes a dislike to him. His brash and over flirtatious demeanour irritates her intensely and her quirky prissiness becomes a natural target for his humour. He even sexually propositions her which she of course rejects outright.In view of all this coupled with Harry's somewhat blinkered idea that men and women can never be friends without sexual attraction becoming an issue they reach New York and mutually call an abrupt halt to their 18 hour friendship both convinced it has lasted 18 hours too long.Fast forward five years and Harry and Sally meet again at an airport and when he discovers they are on the same flight he approaches her to rekindle their friendship and this time things are even worse.Despite both finding love and success in New York the years have done nothing to kerb Harry's sexist and irritating views and Sally's abject disapproval of everything that he stands for seems even more pronounced.

	onyx:emotionText "By the late eighties the romantic comedy as a movie genre had been in a sort of disturbed sleep for twenty years with only an occasional and disappointing movie outing between snores.Yet when they released 'When Harry met Sally' in 1989 it signified to the world that the RomCom was not only out of bed but it was showered shaved dressed in a brand new suit and ready to take on the world once more with new found confidence.It's 1977 and Harry Burns Billy Crystal has just graduated from the University of Chicago and is moving to New York to start his career. He's a nice enough guy who's only flaw seems to be his apparent misogynistic and macabre outlook on life.Also New York bound is fellow graduate Sally Albright Meg Ryan who as a favour for a friend agrees to take Harry along. The two have never met before and almost immediately Sally takes a dislike to him. His brash and over flirtatious demeanour irritates her intensely and her quirky prissiness becomes a natural target for his humour. He even sexually propositions her which she of course rejects outright.In view of all this coupled with Harry's somewhat blinkered idea that men and women can never be friends without sexual attraction becoming an issue they reach New York and mutually call an abrupt halt to their 18 hour friendship both convinced it has lasted 18 hours too long.Fast forward five years and Harry and Sally meet again at an airport and when he discovers they are on the same flight he approaches her to rekindle their friendship and this time things are even worse.Despite both finding love and success in New York the years have done nothing to kerb Harry's sexist and irritating views and Sally's abject disapproval of everything that he stands for seems even more pronounced. They part once again at journeys end this time with Sally making it quite clear she wants nothing whatsoever to do with him again.Another five years pass and both Harry and Sally meet in a bookshop both having recently lost the loves referred to in the previous paragraph. Harry is divorcing his unfaithful wife and Sally has just dumped her longterm relationship as it was becoming clear to her that it was never going to end in an 'I Do'.This time however possibly due to them both being humbled by recent events in their life they find that they have empathy with each other and a friendship starts to build a true platonic friendship to the extent where they finally become inseparable and reliant on each other almost on a brother and sister level.They partner each other at functions when neither have a date they set each other up on blind dates and even take day trips together to the museum and by using each other as an emotional crutch they finally learn to settle the demons of their previous relationships.It seems like Harry has finally realised and now thoroughly excepts that men and women CAN be friends without a sexual entanglement.

	schema:reviewBody "When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that I was in no way prepared for which is my favorite kind of new favorite film to watch. Having never seen a Rob Reiner film I wasn't sure of his style or technique or how he approached his subjects. I quickly learned through his 1989 feature that he provides a very real look at the lives of people in relationships. When Harry Met Sally tells the tale of a chance meeting between two strangers who then continue to reappear in each other's lives. The way in which Reiner exposes the truths of finding someone you can best tolerate in a partner rather than the person that makes your heart turn to mush is a brilliant grasp of how to illustrate the human condition. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star in the titular roles and provide the brilliant illustration of everyday flawed human beings often sensationalized for cinema.Sally Meg Ryan agrees to give her friend's boyfriend Harry Billy Crystal a ride to New York upon their graduation from the University of Chicago. After a long car ride of sharing all the quirky details that make up their existence completely uninhibited since they are unavailable to each other. After the journey to New York is complete the two part ways not thinking much of each other. Harry and Sally keep bumping into each other over the years as their lives intersect. They finally decide to maintain a friendship and quickly become friends and confidants. As they see each other through each successive stage of their lives it becomes increasingly more difficult to watch the other date. Neither of the two has ever shared such intimate details of their lives their hopes fears and dreams with another person so it only makes sense that the two fall in love. Two people with such neuroses in some ways make a perfect match but in other ways are their own biggest obstacles in love.A film that looks and feels this much like Annie Hall is obviously going to rank highly on my list. I had begun writing about the similarities this film shared with Annie Hall but I soon gave up because there are just too many. The dialogue is fantastic and the entire film is so wellwritten. Even though the famous line I'll have what she's having. has worked its way into the American lexicon it loses nothing when it is spoken. Oftentimes with a line so popular the audience member has the rollyoureyesoh moment when it's spoken but that's not the case with When Harry Met Sally because the script is so perfect. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfect in their roles with just enough chemistry to make their unconventional friendship work. Despite how great Meg Ryan was in the role and also despite the fact that the fate of the universe wouldn't allow it I couldn't help but think all throughout the film how perfect Gilda Radner R.I.P. would have been in the role opposite Crystal. Anyway When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant look at the lives of real people and an exceptional film that has already become a new favorite.".

It's the best Woody Allen film not directed by Woody Allen. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's quirky chemistry in this movie is probably one of the best I've seen in any film. Reiner is a director that is hard to categorize since he has worked with different genres thriller with Misery fantasyadventure with The Princess Bride coming of age with Stand by Me mockumentary with This is Spinal Tap drama with A Few Good Men and comedy with The Bucket List. He's made his share of bad films his latest films are probably his weakest but he seems to have excelled in every genre without establishing a common trademark. You could watch When Harry Met Sally back to back with Misery and you'd never guess it was directed by the same person. The secret to his success with this romcom is that the relationship feels true to life as he first introduces these flawed characters that don't seem to care too much for each other but over the years they begin bonding and establishing a strong friendship. These characters are so relatable and we can see ourselves or our friends in the film. It reminds us of that friend of the opposite sex we had and how easy it was to blur the line between friendship and love. It makes us think of that universal question Can a man and a woman be best friends without falling in love with each other? A lot of credit must be given to Nora Ephron's Oscar nominated screenplay because the dialogue and debates between the main characters are authentic and sharp at the same time. There are so many memorable scenes including the fake orgasm which turned Meg Ryan into such a star but the final tear jerking scene is my favorite because Billy Crystal delivered his lines in such a perfect way. Even the scenes where old couples are being interviewed in documentary style works perfectly and serves a purpose other than simply serving as transitions taking place in the story. The honesty that comes through in each conversation between Harry and Sally and the incredible chemistry between them is what makes this one of my go to films when it comes to recommending a romantic movie. Did I mention that the film takes place in New York of all places? httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

Oh and a nice touch with those scenes where old married couples explain the sometimes almost unbelievable circumstances in which they met.

On a whole it's a cute story about falling in love and finding love where you least expect it.

Even fifteen years later I'm finding it difficult to cope with the trauma of having been shut in a darkened cinema with 'that performance'.As for the 'memorable dialogue'  it's possible I've blanked it out to protect myself but I certainly couldn't repeat any of it now. Or even a minute after I left the building. Apart of course from the 'hilariously' original orgasm scene. Aaaagh!

	schema:headline " Haunting Morricone Score is Highlight of Comedy Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah such beautiful music! This film opens with a classic sequence. A stagecoach is attacked by a gang with all the passengers brutally massacred. Cue Morricone's haunting soundtrack as the camera focuses on the dead and in particular the face of a blonde girl. A hand brushes the dust from her faceand the camera pans up to show the sorrowful face of Billy Giuliano Gemma. A truly moving scene but made particularly so because of Morricone's music.In a way this opening sequence is quite out of place with the remainder of the movie. The rest is a lighthearted affair based around the partnership of Billy and Larry Mario Adorf. Billy is a smart worldwise man whilst Larry is not gifted with the greatest amount of intelligence. This is a perfect foil for Billy who is a convincing conman and successful in getting the better out of his gullible partner throughout the film including robbing him of his entire life savings.The action really hots up when the character of Roger Pratt Federico Boido is introduced properly until this stage he is purely the face of the gang leader from the opening ambush. He is a brutal man tracking down Billy on behalf of his father Samual Pratt Anthony Dawson. The second half of the movie concentrates on this pursuit with Samual also arriving on the scene and proving to be as barbaric as his shortfused offspring.Director Giulio Petroni of Death Rides a Horse fame adopts a similar style to the one used in his later Milian cast Life is Tough Right Providence?. It shares its episodic structure and clever manthick man partnership. Anyone that has read my other reviews will probably have noticed that I do not generally like the more lighthearted westerns. However I did very much enjoy most of this particular film the same could not be said of Providence incidentally.Gemma does not look as comfortable with the more comedic role as he does to that of an angelfaced gunman. But he still looks and acts the part  as likable in this film as ever. Adorf meanwhile is suitably oafish in a role that would have been perfect for Bud Spencer as Boido and Dawson are villainous.A particular highlight of the film is a superb scene as Billy cons his way into the house of a beautiful Widow played by the frankly gorgeous Magda Konopka. Another very beautiful Spaghetti Western actress part sorrowful and part sexually teasing.As my review closes I must dwell further on that opening sequence. The background to this massacre is never fully explained  perhaps those killed have been unfortunate acquaintances of Billy and suitably punished by the Pratt gang. I don't know. And in its serious nature it perhaps feels like a scene that doesn't really belong in this film. But... if you watch it for no other reason then watch it for this powerful prologue even close your eyes just to hear Morricone's score. I am also quite confident as you sit through the whole film that you will find other scenes that you will enjoy.".

Still it's such an engaging consistently entertaining and often uproariously funny film that rating it any lower than  would suggest that it's less than good which certainly isn't the case! The film's rambling narrative revolves yet again around the buddybuddy formula in an obviously broader vein even so the film has its serious side since it opens with a stagecoach massacre and a similar fate befalls a couple of traveling circus performers towards the end  the perpetrators are a gang of criminals hotly in pursuit of excomrade and sharpshooter Giuliano Gemma who wants out he doesn't even carry a gun anymore preferring to make his living as a confidencetrickster which as it turns out is no less precarious or lawabiding than being a bandit!.His companion more often dupe is Mario Adorf turning in an inspired performance as the gullible and gruff yet amiable wouldbe rancher whom Gemma embroils in many a scheme  fake telegraph service circus acts involving a siren and Adorf himself fitted with a loincloth and breathing fire  to fleece the unsuspecting townsfolk. At one point Adorf himself is made to invest all his savings in an inexistent bank and later falls for his partner's ruse that a funeral procession they meet up with is for a famous bandit who has a fortune buried in his backyard only to learn after having dug a hole all the way down to Hell that he had been wheelchairbound since childhood just so Gemma could make out with the deceased's luscious young wife  the dinnertable scene between Gemma and Magda Konopka here is highly reminiscent of the celebrated one featured in TOM JONES 1963. Forsaking Gemma for a visionary drunk Adorf manages to rob a gold shipment by posing as a Wells Fargo employee  though his partner in this venture turns out to be a bloodthirsty maniac who mows down an entire Army platoon which sets out in pursuit of them! Anthony Dawson turns up at the climax as the sadistic chief villain having taken refuge in Adorf's dilapidated ranch which they leisurely restore our heroes then see their dreamhouse literally go up in smoke when they are forced to blow the place up with Dawson's gang still inside! The tireless Ennio Morricone provides yet another exemplary score the wistful main theme is especially striking.".

Anthony Dawson turns up at the climax as the sadistic chief villain having taken refuge in Adorf's dilapidated ranch which they leisurely restore our heroes then see their dreamhouse literally go up in smoke when they are forced to blow the place up with Dawson's gang still inside! The tireless Ennio Morricone provides yet another exemplary score the wistful main theme is especially striking.";

Among other things the two leads here have some of the trademarks Terence Hill and Bud Spencer sported in the later movie. However Hill and Spencer's comedies didn't sport some scenes of harsh violence as this film does which doesn't fit at all with the otherwise lighthearted spirit. Also the comedy in this movie really isn't all that funny being mostly simpleminded slapstick and silliness you will have seen in other comedies before. The script also suffers from the fact that there is hardly any plot  for the most part it's just a series of vignettes that have little to no consequence to what comes afterwards. And under the direction of Giulio Petroni the movie unfolds at a really slow pace. There is some merit to be found here and there particularly a fine musical score by the ever reliable Ennio Morricone but as a whole the movie is a really tired and uninspired effort.".

	schema:headline " A Cut Above";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite enjoying a highprofile in France where he has been writing directing and starring in films for 20 years exSplendid member Gerard Jugnot remains virtually unknown outside his own country. As an actor only he is starring in 'Les Choristes' which opened in April and is still playing in several large salles in Paris in September. Clearly this year's 'Amelie' it has already been seen by well over one million people which SHOULD justify release abroad but distributors are queer cattle we wait in London for 'Le Choristes' yet a piece of merde like 'Merci Dr. Rey' which played two weeks in ONE salle in Paris before being yanked has already been and gone in London leaving as much trace here as it did in Paris. Meanwhile this entry from 2002 shows Jugnot at his best in all three departments he has written a good solid wellmade script directed it to perfection and for good measure thrown in a leading performance as good as anything around. The setting is Paris under German Occupation. Edmond Batignole is a middleaged henpecked butcher living with a wife daughter and the daughter's fianc JeanPierre Lamour JeanPaul Rouve an open collaborator who writes vitriolic articles for a fascist journal. At the outset a small boy crawls through a grating to steal a precious ham from the shop and when the theft is discovered Lamour is quick to point the finger at Simon Bernstein Jules Sitruck the small son of a Jewish doctor who lives in a lavish apartment. By coincidence the Bernsteins en masse are just about to flee so for good measure Lamour places the telephone call which results in their arrest and subsequent detainment in Vel d'Hiv Velodrome d'Hiver a large stadium on the outskirts of Paris which was used at the time as a holding centre for Jewish detainees prior to their shipment to Germany.Given Lamour's connections the Batignole family are soon living in comparative luxury in the Bernstein's apartment and Batignole has a lucrative contract to supply meat to the German High Command. Then one day Batignole answers a ring on the doorbell to find young Simon Bernstein standing there. Having somehow managed to escape from Vel d'Hiv he has not unnaturally returned to his old home and is disconcerted to find it occupied. Against his better judgment Batignole hides the boy and brings him food then learning from Simon that two female cousins Sara and Guila Cohen are being 'looked after' elsewhere in Paris Batignole attempts to offload Simon on the same carer but to no avail. Things come to a head when Batignole brings food to Simon only to discover the two girls have joined him. Their raised voices attract the attention of Lamour who after breaking down the door reveals his intention of denouncing everyone including his prospective fatherinlaw. During a heated exchange Lamour winds up slightly dead and Batignole flees with the children and eventually is able to leave them at the Swiss border where after a moment's hesitation he joins them. This is much more than the cross between Noel Coward's 'Fumed Oak' in which a henpecked husband finally leaves his wife daughter and his country and Nevil Shute's 'Pied Piper' in which a middleaged man caught in France in June 1940 agrees to take two children back to England and winds up with seven that it appears on first sight. The period detail is spot on and Jugnot has managed to coax brilliant performances from the three children primarily Jules Sitruck as Simon. There's also a nice putdown which may appeal to French culture buffs. In addition to his articles Lamour is also an aspiring dramatist and whilst dining in a large restaurant he notices Sacha Guitry coming towards his table. He accosts the great man and reminds him that he Lamour sent him a play to read. Guitry speaks scathingly of the play and stung Lamour says 'You have insulted me' 'Yes' replies Guitry 'but I don't do it for a living'. Until the distributors get real there is probably little chance of seeing this film other than on DVD and even then you'll have to buy it in France. In my opinion it is worth it. 810".

As an actor only he is starring in 'Les Choristes' which opened in April and is still playing in several large salles in Paris in September. Clearly this year's 'Amelie' it has already been seen by well over one million people which SHOULD justify release abroad but distributors are queer cattle we wait in London for 'Le Choristes' yet a piece of merde like 'Merci Dr. Rey' which played two weeks in ONE salle in Paris before being yanked has already been and gone in London leaving as much trace here as it did in Paris. Meanwhile this entry from 2002 shows Jugnot at his best in all three departments he has written a good solid wellmade script directed it to perfection and for good measure thrown in a leading performance as good as anything around. The setting is Paris under German Occupation. Edmond Batignole is a middleaged henpecked butcher living with a wife daughter and the daughter's fianc JeanPierre Lamour JeanPaul Rouve an open collaborator who writes vitriolic articles for a fascist journal. At the outset a small boy crawls through a grating to steal a precious ham from the shop and when the theft is discovered Lamour is quick to point the finger at Simon Bernstein Jules Sitruck the small son of a Jewish doctor who lives in a lavish apartment. By coincidence the Bernsteins en masse are just about to flee so for good measure Lamour places the telephone call which results in their arrest and subsequent detainment in Vel d'Hiv Velodrome d'Hiver a large stadium on the outskirts of Paris which was used at the time as a holding centre for Jewish detainees prior to their shipment to Germany.Given Lamour's connections the Batignole family are soon living in comparative luxury in the Bernstein's apartment and Batignole has a lucrative contract to supply meat to the German High Command. Then one day Batignole answers a ring on the doorbell to find young Simon Bernstein standing there. Having somehow managed to escape from Vel d'Hiv he has not unnaturally returned to his old home and is disconcerted to find it occupied. Against his better judgment Batignole hides the boy and brings him food then learning from Simon that two female cousins Sara and Guila Cohen are being 'looked after' elsewhere in Paris Batignole attempts to offload Simon on the same carer but to no avail. Things come to a head when Batignole brings food to Simon only to discover the two girls have joined him. Their raised voices attract the attention of Lamour who after breaking down the door reveals his intention of denouncing everyone including his prospective fatherinlaw. During a heated exchange Lamour winds up slightly dead and Batignole flees with the children and eventually is able to leave them at the Swiss border where after a moment's hesitation he joins them. This is much more than the cross between Noel Coward's 'Fumed Oak' in which a henpecked husband finally leaves his wife daughter and his country and Nevil Shute's 'Pied Piper' in which a middleaged man caught in France in June 1940 agrees to take two children back to England and winds up with seven that it appears on first sight. The period detail is spot on and Jugnot has managed to coax brilliant performances from the three children primarily Jules Sitruck as Simon. There's also a nice putdown which may appeal to French culture buffs. In addition to his articles Lamour is also an aspiring dramatist and whilst dining in a large restaurant he notices Sacha Guitry coming towards his table. He accosts the great man and reminds him that he Lamour sent him a play to read. Guitry speaks scathingly of the play and stung Lamour says 'You have insulted me' 'Yes' replies Guitry 'but I don't do it for a living'. Until the distributors get real there is probably little chance of seeing this film other than on DVD and even then you'll have to buy it in France. In my opinion it is worth it. 810";

Yet the movie is effective since it is well made has nice characters and a rather nice main plot line that it follows.The movie is build up well and sets up a good feeling and atmosphere of 1942 occupied Paris and the characters of the movie. Too bad that about half way through the movie the movie suddenly takes another approach and becomes an almost entirely different movie with different settings and also for some part different characters. It's also obvious that they spent most time and effort on the first halve of the movie that is definitely better looking more believable constructed and has a better flow. In the second halve of the movie some unlikely events occur and the movie and story at times feels like it was done in a hurry and not everything flows well or reaches a satisfying conclusion.The movie has some good and enjoyable characters in it and the movie gets carried by Grard Jugnot who also directed and wrote the movie who plays a rather unsympathetic and antihero at first but as the story develops he gets more and more human so the speak and starts showing his emotions and expresses his thoughts. This is a nice approach for the main character that also works well for the story. It's a great role by Grard Jugnot who shows how multitalented he is. The young Jules Sitruk also was great in a quite big role. JeanPaul Rouve was also greatly cast as the future soninlaw and collaborator.The movie is a good watch but overall the movie is just a bit too light and simplistic to leave a really lasting or powerful impression.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "With his bald head bushy mustache and below average stature Grard Jugnot has always been typecasted as the typical French guy definitely not the leading type by Alain Delon or Lino Ventura's standards.Yet for an audience avid of characters to mock andor to identify with Jugnot's always been one of the most instantly recognizable and popular of all the French actors thanks or because of the physical qualities I described. To give you a hint when he shaved his legendary mustache for the first time it was like a national event in France. In fact though they played in different registers Jugnot was the eternal 'average Jean' like Woody Allen the 'neurotic nerd'. And with the same artistic talent Jugnot was capable to turn what could be seen as a handicap into a true career's asset when he started directing himself in the early 80's.Jugnot had his breakthrough film as an actordirector by playing Pinot simple cop in the underrated Wonderful Times he embraced the economical crisis of the early 90's as Berthier a guy who lost everything and started living in the streets. And in 2002 he played another memorable antiheroic role as Edmond Batignole a Parisian butcher who starts hiding Jewish children and helps them to get to the Swiss border during the Occupation. Although the film can be seen as the typical 'ordinary hero' tale and lesson of courage and integrity it's not Life is Beautiful material and looks more like the kind of TV drama you'd watch on a Thursday night. Strangely enough the film doesn't have the stylish ambition its story would have called for a pity considering the potential of the titular character.Batignole's qualities are efficiently highlighted by contrast he's not as opportunistic as his wife or as zealous as his soontobe soninlaw Pierre Jean a wannabe playwright and notorious collaborator. The film opens in 1942 Batignole as the brave worker who gets up early finds out that his rabbits were stolen. Convinced that only a child could have entered the warehouse he questions Dr. Bernstein about his son keeping him upstairs while PierreJean smelling the attempt to escape calls the police Batignole has some rude words against Dr. Bernstein not because he's a Jew but because of his snobbishness. The family ends up being arrested and realizing his participationPierreJean calls it a deliberate diversion Batignole understands that his views about class struggles are outdated by a much bigger issue.Yet he acted like a collaborator and thanks to his help PierreJean pulled some strings to convince Gestapo officers to take Batignole as a caterer. He reluctantly accepts this promotion he who fought the Germans during the Great War and it's obvious that there is a big part of remorse regarding the Bernstein family. One day though he finds Simon Bernstein who managed to escape from the Police and an opportunity to redeem himself. He hides Simon and two other girls in his cave and in the process kills PierreJean offscreen when he was about to call the Police. The film's first act is an occasion to remind of the disgrace of the collaboration and humanity of those who jeopardized her lives by protecting Jews.JeanPaul Rouve is a scenestealer as the treacherous PierreJean and received a Csar award for Most Promising Newcomer the film's only win and nomination. I personally believe that not showing PierreJean's death was a mistake that hurt the film's impact regarding the significance of the character as a firstrate villain and the pivotal role his killing played in Batignole's life. I wonder how the death of PierreJean would have looked onscreen maybe it wouldn't have worked but it would have liberated the kind of energy the film mostly lacked. Instead Jugnot chose the 'easy way' and wasted acting talents for scenes that only consisted on words while the actions speak much better.The most significant moment is the climactic confrontation with the Vichy Police the level of tension is perfect when Batignole is asked about Simon but then realizing he's not believed Batignole pretends to be a Jew and starts an inspirational speech accusing the French collaboration. More than a genuine expression of disgust it sounds like the kind of crowdpleasing statements intended to raise the eternal 'what would have we done?' question about France's responsibility in the deportation of Jews. Some viewers believe that France resisted and movies like this continue to convey a negative image. Some others believe that such films are essentials and then some consider that France should approach other historical themes like the unwounded war with Algeria or slavery.I'm sure Jugnot didn't just make another 'Holocaust' film but his climactic speech would have made a more impacting payoff if the film had featured more intense moments before. Instead it flirts with many war dramas' archetypes the goodhearted bishop the lonely woman who gives her house and body with such a sort of detachment that I wonder if Jugnot really trusted his material. Jules Sitruk also gives a nice performance as Simon Bernstein but he never seemed to grasp the gravity of his condition. The film lacked the kind of powerful shocks where Batignole would have slapped him for his own good would Simon scream or insult him? Maybe but that's because the kid acted more like HIS generation and his performance needed a 'better' directing. And the two girls didn't have much screen time to grab our interest.The film is a good tribute to anonymous heroes who helped France to keep its honor and only Grard Jugnot could have pulled such a performance. But it feels like he took the premise of granted and shot the film in a rush filling it with inspirational speeches yet preventing it for the kind of energy and tension we expect from a WWII drama.".

As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city.

After Scarface was released Muni was inundated with offers to play gangsters which he rejected. Interesting because without knowing it another of the cast in Scarface Boris Karloff would be ultimately trapped in the horror film genre.

He'll rise by any means possible use anyone it takes kill anyone who gets in his way. He has only two weaknesses an obsession that borders on incestuous desires for his sister Ann Dvorak and a kind of affection for his factotum Vince Barnett. That's the kind of affection you have for a pet.Barnett who usually played drunks and hangerson got his career role out of Scarface. What comic relief there is in the film he provides. He's got some good moments as a 'secretary' trying to take a phone message with bullets flying all around him. Had he been not dispatched to take the message the machine gun bullets would have found their mark easily in the taller Muni.Scarface is also art that imitates life. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of the history of gangland war in the Chicago of the Twenties will recognize Muni as Capone Boris Karloff as Bugs Moran and Osgood Perkins as Johnny Torio. Capone could have sued but right about then he was having much bigger problems with Internal Revenue.We can't forget Karen Morley who played Poppy the girl who likes to go with a winner. She shifts from Perkins to Muni and away from Muni when it becomes necessary. In her own way she's as amoral as Muni.Scarface along with Public Enemy and Little Caesar set the standard for gangster films. The updated 1983 remake with Al Pacino in Muni's part is a good film itself and got a lot of its audience with some really gory scenes.Muni did it with talent alone.".

Robinson rises to the top by the use of a crafty intelligence as well as violence Cagney by a type of shrewdness and personal charisma. Paul Muni's Tony Comonte is neither intelligent nor personable his manners are crude and at times he is almost childlike in his behavior for instance when he is enjoying a play and is interrupted after the second act summoned to do another killingand leaves a henchman behind who can tell him later how it came out then is delighted to hear that the guy with the collar didn't get the girl rather the rougher suitor. He can be described as cunning and animistic a young wolf who eliminates any rival who stands in his way finally the leader of the pack One can be moved by Robinson's last words Is this the end of Little Caesar? or by Cagney's body falling through the open door of his family home he having been killed offscreen. Comonte's death is that of a trapped or cornered animal wordless in a beautifully staged sequenceas brutal as his life depicted for the audience in every detail. Of the three portrayals Muni's comes across to me as the most chilling in its enactment of instinctive evil.

It's a film that does take its subject seriously while on one hand one argues that the film is an indictment of crime and peoples responses one could also argue that it's a subtle indictment of the prohibition however it's also an exciting and sometimes wickedly funny take on a genre that would flourish in the thirties and forties. What comes most surprising and I mean that as a big compliment is how it hasn't lost much of its vitality in seventy years. The implied violence in the film is in fact shocking in places and while it lacks the blood content and major shocks of the De Palma remake it doesn't compromise to showing the slightly Hollywoodized truth of the matter crime doesn't pay but sometimes it's all people know.Tony Camonte is played by Paul Muni in a performance that wonderfully ranges from angry to sarcastic funny to romantic and just downright crazy it's no wonder that Pacino was inspired by his performance to take on Tony Montana in the remake though one could argue that Muni's bravura presence and delivery in this film outranks Pacino's in the later. He is surrounded by supporting players that also give very good work as well with the story being told in various threads that work perfectly. There's one semicomic story around one of Camonte's assistants who is rather illiterate and slow though it's also a subtle commentary on the lack of prospects for immigrants at the time. Another which was given much prominence in the remake involves the powerstruggle between Tony and his younger sister. And then there's the goodold mixture of solid fascinating bits with the cops and other criminals not to mention a boss that has to control Tony's manic ideals of taking over the city and perhaps the world.I once heard Quentin Tarantino in an interview say that Howard Hawks is the 'single greatest storyteller in the history of cinema'. Although that could be a heavily debatable statement with this film Hawks proves that he definitely can do so very well and of the few I've seen of his so far this is my favorite. On the technical side of things some of the technique is very straightforward but then there is also proof that Hawks was a stepahead of the crowd that would bloom out in the filmnoir period a decade later. Shadows used with a fine flair great overhead and deadon shots of cars riding and shooting a couple of really keen closeups. Add to that a script from Hecht that doesn't go too deep into character for too long and you got your basic powerhouse gangster picture. And believe me it's a mustsee if you're into the genre or if you'd like to have a comparison test with the highly revered remake.".

	schema:headline " Say Hello to the Original Scarred Madman...";
	schema:reviewBody "The early 1930's produced a whirlwind of mobster films commenting on the reallife problem of organized crime throughout Prohibition America. LITTLE CAESAR and PUBLIC ENEMY were the first significant films of the genre but not until Howard Hawks tourdeforce smash SCARFACE  did the public get to see what was going on.  Hawks' film came out in 1932 and has been a mainstay in filmmaker's minds and fans alike ever since.  Scorsese Coppola and especially De Palma have all drawn inspiration and the '83 remake from Hawks and Ben Hecht the picture's screenwriter.  Paul Muni was loosely based on Al Capone and SCARFACE begins with yet another message to the government telling them to get off their butts and rid the country of Tony Carmontes everywhere.  I think the picture works more as brutal realistic entertainment than moral message.  In hindsight SCARFACE made it all look fun.This searing flick looks so spooky and dark you truly get the feeling of the real underworld and how uncompromising it was and still is.  Some brilliant images grace the screen the passage of dates on a calendar by machine gun Muni's gruesome scar an opening murder scene done with such subtly the mere sound of Muni's whistle triggers doom a sideshow of possible incest between Tony and his tortured sister.  No joke.  It appears almost blatantly in varying scenes of building jealousy and murder. Many of the elements show up in De Palma's remake such as the sister her relationship with Tony's best friend and his disapproving mother.  The original packs more substance into a shorter film and is clearly better than the flashy remake which I also loved.This was one of Howard Hawks' 1st films and he continued to make pictures that differed so completely one after the other.  SCARFACE is his landmark film a mustsee that was considered by many to be unreleasable to the audiences of 1932.  It is a predictable rise and fall portrait of a brooding goon however the techniques and blunt force of the film make you come back for more.  Watch it before the Pacino remake and see what you think.  They are excellent representatives of Hollywood storytelling then and now. Keep an eye out for a svelte Boris Karloff in civilian clothing a rarity as a sinister enemy of the scarred one.  He rolls quite a memorable strike in a bowling alley.  A masterpiece of character story mood and bullets flying.RATING 10 of 10".

Scorsese Coppola and especially De Palma have all drawn inspiration and the '83 remake from Hawks and Ben Hecht the picture's screenwriter.  Paul Muni was loosely based on Al Capone and SCARFACE begins with yet another message to the government telling them to get off their butts and rid the country of Tony Carmontes everywhere.  I think the picture works more as brutal realistic entertainment than moral message.  In hindsight SCARFACE made it all look fun.This searing flick looks so spooky and dark you truly get the feeling of the real underworld and how uncompromising it was and still is.  Some brilliant images grace the screen the passage of dates on a calendar by machine gun Muni's gruesome scar an opening murder scene done with such subtly the mere sound of Muni's whistle triggers doom a sideshow of possible incest between Tony and his tortured sister.  No joke.  It appears almost blatantly in varying scenes of building jealousy and murder. Many of the elements show up in De Palma's remake such as the sister her relationship with Tony's best friend and his disapproving mother.  The original packs more substance into a shorter film and is clearly better than the flashy remake which I also loved.This was one of Howard Hawks' 1st films and he continued to make pictures that differed so completely one after the other.  SCARFACE is his landmark film a mustsee that was considered by many to be unreleasable to the audiences of 1932.  It is a predictable rise and fall portrait of a brooding goon however the techniques and blunt force of the film make you come back for more.  Watch it before the Pacino remake and see what you think.  They are excellent representatives of Hollywood storytelling then and now. Keep an eye out for a svelte Boris Karloff in civilian clothing a rarity as a sinister enemy of the scarred one.  He rolls quite a memorable strike in a bowling alley.  A masterpiece of character story mood and bullets flying.RATING 10 of 10";

Watching it I can only imagine how bad the missing material was. The film is full of shootouts and gun fightsthey're quick violent and just incredible. The body count has to be in the triple digits. The best scene has Boris Karloff as a gangster !!! shot to death in a bowling alley. As incredible as the violence is the film condemns itthey make it clear that Scarface and his gang are coldblooded killers and nothing more.Also the film has PLENTY of sexual innuendo. Ann Dvorak plays Scarface's sister and it is made clear that she and her brother are VERY interested in each other. Also she does a very sexy dance in front of George Raft which is more than a little suggestive. I'm surprised that the censors let all this get by! The acting is superb. Muni plays Scarface as dumb stupid violent and uglyand in a way very sexy. When he shoots down people it seems that he's actually getting a sexual charge from it! Also Muni a very handsome man was purposely made to look ugly. He looks more like an ape than human. George Raft as his best friend is also goodcoldblooded and heartless. Dvorak overplays it a bit but she is incredibly sexy. Hell even Karloff is good as a gangster! The film is very welldirected by Hoaward Hawkshe pulls no punches. The script is quick and intelligentit never stops moving.After it was released to great acclaim in 1932 it was abruptly pulledmany people said glamorized gangsters which is just ridiculous. It didn't surface until 1979 Francis Ford Coppola helped get it rereleased and it was finally recognized for the classic it is.Quite simply a GREAT film. Don't miss this one!".

One brilliant innovative idea follows another. An example is the notshownscene of the St. Valentine's massacre. Another beautiful intuition a keypoint of the story is the arrival on the scene of the machine guns destined to bring the gangwars to an unheardof level of violence. Look at Tony's scaring bliss when he handles the terrible weapon for the first time... The montage is extraordinary. Take the celebrated bowlinghall scene we have a dozen of distinct splendid shots perfectly tied together. Scarface has a pace impressive for intensity. Not a single second is wasted in its narration.The cinematic language attains its highest level. Look how Guino Rinaldo the great George Raft is introduced. A man is reading a newspaper in a barber shop. The approaching siren of a policecar is heard. Without even leaving his chair the man throws his gun in the basket of towels and impassive he restarts to read. In few seconds we have got a precise hint of the personality of Guino smart coolheaded laconic professional. Soon we will see that in fact he is the cornerstone of Tony's power and success in crime.Another gem of cinematic language. Tony and his boss Lovo in the chamber of Poppy Lovo's girlfriend. Poppy is doing her makeup. Tony tries to chat with her. Poppy doesn't pay attention. She is even rude with him. Her dressinggown has slipped showing Poppy's legs. Tony peeps at them.

And then there is Paul Muni as Tony Camonte... how good an actor he is could only be eyewitnessed words can't describe the power of his performance. Tony is cruel loathsome brutal hideous we all hate him. Tony's clash with Lovo with the sadistic suspense he deliberately creates is a really ghastly scene. Nonetheless Muni succeeds to be even touching when Tony shows his childish enthusiasm for badtaste expensive stuff ties silk shirts luxury restaurants etc. Tony's final nervous breakdown is essential for the moral message of Scarface but it could have been a weakness of the film. Yet Muni is so great so intense that he can render Tony's disgusting sudden cowardice in a smooth realistic way and without provoking in the audience any sympathy for the gangster an important aim for the filmmakers.A crucial theme of the movie is Tony's morbid affection to say the least toward his sister Cesca Ann Dvorak. Well... Scarface would deserve a book not just a comment. Let me skip this important motive of brotherly love which is extremely difficult to judge correctly in my opinion.How can a comic character like the illiterate gangstersecretary who never gets the name at the telephone fit so well in the tragic actionpacked story of Scarface?

	schema:headline " A Monster Who Whistles Opera Arias";
	schema:reviewBody "According to a book about the films that Howard Hughes produced while SCARFACE was being produced in Hollywood the director Howard Hawkes got a visit from two rather unfriendly gentlemen. They had been sent by their employer one Alphonse Capone of Chicago to find out the truth that the movie Hawkes was directing was about him and his career. Hawkes assured them that it wasn't as everyone knew what a smart man Mr. Capone was while the central figure in this film ended up dead. Somehow Hawkes' reassurances worked and the great director did not find his career ended prematurely with a cement kimono or a severe case of lead poisoning. How he was able to get away with this I can't figure out. Capone was known behind his back as scarface because of a knifing scar which was given to him and which he well earned when he insulted the knife wielder's sister in the Red Hook area of Brooklyn in the late teens of the 20th Century. The name of the antihero at the center of the film is Tony Carmonte which sounds vaguely like Capone. He is brought to the city to bump off the old boss by Johnny Lovo Osgood Perkins just like Capone was brought to Chicago by his uncle Johnny Torrio to kill Torrio's friend and boss Big Jim Colosimo in 1920. Maybe various incidents are not precisely like those Capone did but enough were left in to leave little doubt. SCARFACE is to Capone as ALL THE KING'S MEN is to Huey Long and CITIZEN KANE is to William Randolph Hearst.SCARFACE has frequently been put into a select group of gangster films that popped up between 1930 and 1932 LITTLE CAESAR and THE PUBLIC ENEMY are the other two that are grouped with it. Each has elements of real violence in it and it is amazing that Paul Muni Eddie Robinson and Jimmy Cagney all became stars from these three performances. This is not to knock their performances they are all great ones but the acceptance of the three stars as stars for portraying such antisocial types is incredible. My guess is the growing disillusionment of the public with federal and state and local government in the depression may have affected the audience's low threshold of normal tolerance for the gangsters in society. Suddenly they were supermen who knew how to get things done and how to force their views on society.Muni's performance has been likened to that of an ape or gorilla man as his body movements are not very gentle bur forceful and all threatening. He is only capable of feeding his own desires at everyone else's expense. Yet Muni does manage to leaven this monster's habits. First most of the people he deals with are little better. Lovo is not as obviously murderous as Carmonte but he brought him to Chicago and until Tony starts muscling Lovo out of his center of power and his relationship with Poppy  Karen Morley he turns very nasty. George Raft's Rinaldo is loyal to Tony until he romances and marries Tony's sister Cesca  Ann Dvorak but he is a merciless killer to all of Tony's enemies. Tony's habit of whistling an air from an opera before he shows his vicious streak is mirrored by Rinaldo's now celebrated coin flipping. Vince Barnett's Angelo is the type of lowlive hangeron that services these criminals. We tend to like Angelo because he is so stupid at times and his death scene is a pathetically sad one but he is not a good citizen. As for the opponents of Carmonte in the underworld a typical one is Boris Karloff's Gaffney a British criminal?  possibly based on Owney Madden the English born New York criminal. He is not only vicious when his gang was active but his Gaffney mirrors Carmonte when he is in hiding trembling about being bumped off as Tony does at the end.Tony does have some cultural pretensions unlike Capone who openly preferred sports like baseball and boxing. Not only his whistling habits he also enjoys plays  we see him watching a production of RAIN by Somerset Maugham. He likes the character of Sadie Thompson and he even notes how the production keeps a steady stream of rain going on stage. But it is pure veneer. He leaves the theater to commit a murder.He also shows a degree of incestuous interest towards Cesca. It leads to a growing series of confrontations with his sister over her behavior with men he wants her to remain pure at home. He even kills the loyal Rinaldi before he learns the latter married Cesca. Yet it is a curious relationship  Cesca is the last loyal member of his mob and dies for him at the end.As a study of uncontrolled brutality run amok SCARFACE is still powerful. One might say that Muni's performance goes over the top with lines about allowing his machine gun to spit. But so did Al Pacino in the remake introducing his enemies to his little friend.".

SCARFACE is to Capone as ALL THE KING'S MEN is to Huey Long and CITIZEN KANE is to William Randolph Hearst.SCARFACE has frequently been put into a select group of gangster films that popped up between 1930 and 1932 LITTLE CAESAR and THE PUBLIC ENEMY are the other two that are grouped with it. Each has elements of real violence in it and it is amazing that Paul Muni Eddie Robinson and Jimmy Cagney all became stars from these three performances. This is not to knock their performances they are all great ones but the acceptance of the three stars as stars for portraying such antisocial types is incredible. My guess is the growing disillusionment of the public with federal and state and local government in the depression may have affected the audience's low threshold of normal tolerance for the gangsters in society. Suddenly they were supermen who knew how to get things done and how to force their views on society.Muni's performance has been likened to that of an ape or gorilla man as his body movements are not very gentle bur forceful and all threatening. He is only capable of feeding his own desires at everyone else's expense. Yet Muni does manage to leaven this monster's habits. First most of the people he deals with are little better. Lovo is not as obviously murderous as Carmonte but he brought him to Chicago and until Tony starts muscling Lovo out of his center of power and his relationship with Poppy  Karen Morley he turns very nasty. George Raft's Rinaldo is loyal to Tony until he romances and marries Tony's sister Cesca  Ann Dvorak but he is a merciless killer to all of Tony's enemies. Tony's habit of whistling an air from an opera before he shows his vicious streak is mirrored by Rinaldo's now celebrated coin flipping. Vince Barnett's Angelo is the type of lowlive hangeron that services these criminals. We tend to like Angelo because he is so stupid at times and his death scene is a pathetically sad one but he is not a good citizen. As for the opponents of Carmonte in the underworld a typical one is Boris Karloff's Gaffney a British criminal?  possibly based on Owney Madden the English born New York criminal. He is not only vicious when his gang was active but his Gaffney mirrors Carmonte when he is in hiding trembling about being bumped off as Tony does at the end.Tony does have some cultural pretensions unlike Capone who openly preferred sports like baseball and boxing. Not only his whistling habits he also enjoys plays  we see him watching a production of RAIN by Somerset Maugham. He likes the character of Sadie Thompson and he even notes how the production keeps a steady stream of rain going on stage. But it is pure veneer. He leaves the theater to commit a murder.He also shows a degree of incestuous interest towards Cesca. It leads to a growing series of confrontations with his sister over her behavior with men he wants her to remain pure at home. He even kills the loyal Rinaldi before he learns the latter married Cesca. Yet it is a curious relationship  Cesca is the last loyal member of his mob and dies for him at the end.As a study of uncontrolled brutality run amok SCARFACE is still powerful. One might say that Muni's performance goes over the top with lines about allowing his machine gun to spit. But so did Al Pacino in the remake introducing his enemies to his little friend.";

Viewers who know just the basics of Capone can identify most of the characters by their reallife names. This is so much more than simply the original version of the Al Pacino cult flick. Paul Muni a brilliant and flexible actor is the lowest of lowlifes base and amoral with incestuous leanings. There isn't a hint of respect for human life. There is nothing glamorous in his portrayal of Tony or in the film at all. As repellent as he is Muni is riveting.Of huge importance in the longrange scope of crime film is George Raft's image here. Though his Guino Little Boy Rinaldo is a still man with few lines he leaves a whammy of an impression. His constant flipping of a coin  suggested by Howard Hawks  created a prototype for nearly all gangster films and spoofs to follow. It was also an inside joke in Some Like It Hot. Every gangster film needs a sharpdressing wiseguy coin flipper  and you'll even see it in softies like Singin' in the Rain Guys and Dolls and even the weasels in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? This is where it started. When other gangster film stars got a breakthrough it was in a starring role. Raft's came here as a killer and ladykiller hovering in the background with a face the camera loved like a woman. It helped that he was surrounded by plain and ugly thugs.Like the cinematic use of the X's Hawks used the coin flip as a signal of death. And there are a lot of deaths. Such imagery by cinematographer Lee Garmes contributes significantly to the power of this film. By the time Raft meets his stunningly restrained end the audience has already had the warning of it telegraphed through these images. While this is a very black violent film there is also bleak humor such as Boris Karloff's fate in a bowling alley.

Vince Barnett's vaudevillian comic bits are too long and the constant underscoring of the film's antiviolence message is awkward. But I still think the film has a lot of great things in it and I would definitely recommend it. As everyone else mentioned Paul Muni is excellent as dopey gangster Tony Camonte and this time I was knocked out by Karen Morley's performance as a nononsense moll I hope I can find some other films of hers. I'm not sure the movie works as the antiviolence film it claims to be Although Tony Camonte has a lot of faults the nongangster characters are mostly undeveloped and dull if not downright problematic like the police inspector who apparently likes to beat up arrestees. Edwin Maxwell's toughtalking Chief of Detectives has the right idea about the lice who shoot innocent bystanders during their crime sprees but his character is a bit too onenote to compete with Paul Muni and George Raft. In fact I think George Raft's character is subtly made into the hero of the film despite all the illegal things he does. Interestingly the film is probably just as violent as many modern picturesthere are an awful lot of gunshot victimsbut because it's in black and white and each killing goes by quickly audiences of today might find it rather tame. But Hawks makes excellent use of sound to try and convey the horror of some of the crimes a woman screams chillingly a dog barks in the distance. Did this film help rouse the public against Prohibitionera gangsters or did it just continue the public's romance with them?".

Howard Hawks 'Scarface' is an amazing product of the 30's a PreCode gangster film that broke many many boundaries.Muni's Tony Camonte is an ugly apelike figure who is supposed to represent Capone scarred cheek and all. Camonte is psychotic primitive volatile and ambitious ardently believing in a sign that beams 'The World Is Yours'. His Napoleonic delusions and drive lead him to break more than a few vital 'mob rules' and he quickly goes from being the hunter to the hunted as he rises in power.The first time I viewed Muni in the role I thought he wasn't very good at all with overthetop gesturing and crude attempts at psychology...then I rewatched. Now I believe that Muni's performance is one of the best you'll find in in the gangstercrime genre. So why the change of heart? Well at the time I wasn't very exposed to early 30's talkie acting styles so I thought he was overblown. Then I realised how convincingly brutal and animalistic Muni is in the role and I was bowled over with his skill. Needless to say I'm a Muni fan now.This film is PreCode and has to put it bluntly a lot of sex in it. Most of the women we see in the film are prostitutes like Poppy scantily clad tart who Muni leers over. But the most interesting sexual element is the incest angle. Muni may make a play for Poppy but it's blatantly obvious that it's his kid sister Cesca who he lusts after and truly loves. Their encounters are raw and brutal but tinged with a steamy very sexual element. In one encounter Muni rips off half of Dvorak's dress revealing her bra in anger and jealousy. In another he shoots down Cesca's loverhusband Guino Rinaldo because he believes that Guino has violated her what Tony wishes to do to her himself?. Strong stuff.Dvorak is quite good in her role nailing most of her scenes with an effective manner. She overacts a little but her last scene with Muni is great. She's also sexy. George Raft seems to be doing little more than coinflipping in his role and it does bug you after a while. But he has a strong screen presence despite his lack of dialogue so he comes out of it OK. Karloff even portrays a gangster! I'm not too sure whether it comes off that good but it's an interesting role for him and he does get the best death sequence in the film.This is a very fast paced movie the action never lets up. Hawks made a name for himself with this film and his direction is a credit to the film's success. The only thing I wonder about is the material that would have been left on the cutting room floor...Hawks is having a lot of fun here with Camonte. The film is very entertaining and one gets the sense that the moralizing typed prologue is only halfhearted slipped in occasionally to appease film executives who couldn't possibly be seen to be glorifying the mafia How times have changed look at Penn's 1967 effort 'Bonnie And Clyde'.The expressionistic lighting and sets would contribute to the noir genre that took off in the 40's.1010.".

The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it? Having asserted some sort of moral value to their depiction of organized crime the story proceeds. It's the story of Tony Camonte Paul Muni who rises through the ranks of bootlegging and enforcing until he runs his outfit but only after he escalates the territorial wars and ups the violence level. He supplants his boss and patron and takes his girl Poppy Karen Morley and furnishes his apartment with steel shutters. His two closest companions are the quintessentially cool Rinaldo George Raft small well dressed and barbered stoical of expression and much given to flipping a coin over and over and the comic henchman Angelo Vince Barnett with his big ears illfitting dandy's hat poor grasp of the language and dogged loyalty. Tony also has a family which he bullies especially his little sister Cesca Ann Dvorak. Boris Karloff plays a gaunt rival gang leader Gaffney. The whole city is under siege and in the one false note of the movie a newspaper publisher indulges in a demagogic set speech along the lines of the preface calling for martial law if necessary. But the story must have its sad end. Cesca marries Rinaldo while Tony is out of town and Tony misunderstanding shoots him. The police come down on Tony for the murder and Cesca plans to kill him in revenge for her husband's death but can't. First the loyal Angelo dies in the siege and then Cesca and then Tony makes a dash out the front door to die in a hail of bullets. So much of the style of the gangster ethos seems to be set here the calm the swagger the maniacal edge the long periods of quiet and the explosive violence the edge of menace. Raft is brilliant at all this so much so that he almost steals every scene except that he just stands there and waits. Very cool. Chilling. Muni is brilliant too even though the part calls for him to be a little slow on the uptake perhaps and practically demented in the final scenes. His goofy courtship of Poppy and the running joke about his taste for the garish and expensive shouldn't work but it does. And his Italianate gesturesthe toss of the hair the sardonic touching the rim of the hat the grin and nodall seem to be the prototype for countless later actors who follow Muni in portraying Italian criminals with style.".

	schema:reviewBody "What are you going to do about it?' Hawks' question begins this film along with a claim that it is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government'.  This film is not an indictment against organized crime and crooked politicians but rather an entertaining rise and fall story of an ambitious and arrogant gangster wrapped around an impossible unrequited love for his own sister. Loosely based on the life of Al Capone it is wanting to know when this wild cannon will get mowed down in gunfire as he continuously ups the stake to increase his power that keeps me riveted not the depiction of a wronged society.Pocked with symbolism and shadowy cinematography Howard Hawks takes us right into the underworld of the gangster through the life of Tony Camonte Paul Muni the rough but charming gangster whose goal is to take total control of the bootleg beer business with the help of machine guns. Realistic car chases crashes rattattat drive by shooting and plenty of violence are shown to us as part of this gangster's working day.  While it follows the Classical Hollywood Style and lowkey lighting for the stark dark world of crime the film runs at a steady building pace.  This gangster life is exciting  it comes with girls silk robes and fancy cars but it is always choked with danger from enemies a doublecrossing boss to police who are keen to do final judgment on the spot. But it is this danger that increases the urgency of Tony Camonte to take over the world' and with this urgency is the chance that he will make a mistake  and we wait for this mistake. Each scene tops the last in terms of the stakes and danger. He does make a mistake and that is revealed in a slow build up with warning signs splattered as often as machine gun fire. All of his actions up to that was part of a strategy to gain complete control of the booze empire once he crosses a sacred line he is doomed.In the life of Scarface we see his personal life as the only son in a poor fatherless broken home with a reproachful mother and fun loving sister whom he protects violently. We see his career life with his smart Brutus style crime. He is a keen strategist with a strong grip on reality. He can clearly spot weaknesses in his bosses and his enemies and then quickly take advantage of them. Camera closeups to his steely looks let us know he is always on the verge of violence or a joke but you never know which. He disregards authority but recognizes the power of the gun. His strategy is made clear when he points to the machine gun in his hand There is only one thing that gets orders and gives orders and this is it'. In an earlier scene he tells his right hand man Guino Do it first do it yourself and keep on doing it'.  This clearly shows how he intends to go about his goal. However what does he really want? This is symbolized in an obvious way by the neon sign for a travel agency outside his apartment window  The World is Yours' But why does he want it? This is hinted throughout the film as we jump into both his personal and 'business' life and spot his own weakness.Though Tony seeks the pretty girl the real girl he wants is his sister There are several examples in the film where the relationship was less than squeaky clean  see if you can spot them but look at the poster for this film shows Tony going for his Sister in a lecherous way with her in a skimpy dress. No sign of supposed love interest  Poppy the platinum blonde. This relationship with his sister certainly makes the movie more interesting and is a theme often copied in more difficult American showpieces such as in Arthur Miller's play  A View from the Bridge' 1960 . The production code was not in full use until 1934 but the censors had plenty to say about the indecent relationship between the two requesting that some scenes be reshot. His sister is quite a cookie  passionate sexy and has designs on the opposite sex. I have adult ideas' she tells Guino.The film makes plentiful use of symbols. The X for death is used liberally I spotted 5 scenes with the X see how many  you can find. This X seems to symbolize the fatalistic nature surrounding Tony when he decides someone is to die death itself comes and helps him out. Other techniques such as a man whistling every time someone is killed is copied in more recent movies like Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction when Jules recites Ezekiel from the bible before killing people.The film opens with a statement of purpose as an indictment' against gangsters. But the film clearly is no such thing. There are however several scenes where this opening statement ties in and each scene has it's own purpose though they definitely distracts us from the full' life of the gangster we are connected to and I wonder why they are really there.  The police chief symbolizing the good solid American elucidates what is wrong with gangsters lawyers and politicians. The rulingclass meetings discuss the problem and decide that it is the lack of gun laws and illegal immigration that supports the gangsters.  These topical issues are cited as root cause. Whether they are or not is irrelevant what is important is that they incite public reaction. The  opening statements only purpose is to get the viewer even more riled up about the film. Hawks cared less about society's gangster problem than his film as he rejected censors requests for inclusion of changed scenes.The movie's dark substance is complemented with humor and romance. There is a running joke throughout the film where Scar face's secretary can't answer the phone properly until the very end which is funny. Sexual humor surrounds Scar face's ambition to claim Poppy. In an early scene she is bent over with her rear to the camera and says Why don't you do it' in reference to sending flowers the next shot is of him giving a protracted gaze in the direction of her butt only to be moved on by Johnny Lovo.What are you going to do about it?' Well enjoy this well made fast paced gangster flick! A great show of tough monkeys sultry dames and great car chases.  A film about blind ambition for an impossible love.Scarface was one of Howard Hawks most famous movies and is the standard for the gangster genre influencing future directors such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Though Scarface was not the first gangster movie similarities and copycats followed quickly and often.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as gangster movies go Scarface together with Little Caesar and Public Enemy are at the top of the best of this genre. Director Howard Hawks showed a tremendous courage in getting involved in this project. which had the subtitle Shame of a Nation when it was first released. Ben Hecht one of the best screen writers of all times shows why he was a genius the way his screen play unfolds on the screen. It also help to have had Lee Garmes one of the best cinematographers of the time placing his cameras at angles that enhance the film in unexpected and original ways.This is the story that follows the rise and fall of Tony Camonte who loosely resembled Al Capone in the story. Tony Camonte a poor kid from Chicago had the ambition and the wherewithal to go far as he proves in the story. Tony in addition was ruthless to his enemies. His lucky break comes in the person of Johnny Lovo a higher up in the crime family of the Roaring 20s. Tony who has an eye for Johnny's paramour Poppy was a man that clearly understood what to do to make it in the underworld.It's interesting to watch how Howard Hawks inserts the symbolism in the letter X as Tony and his men keep on eliminating the opposing factions. Tony's sister Cesca gets involved with his right hand man Guino Rinaldo. The deception proved to be too much for Camonte. The film served perhaps as a cautionary tale to an impoverish nation that was going through that black period of its history during The Great Depression.Paul Muni an actor that came from the theater tended to overact in much of his work. This side of him served to emphasize that Tony was an awkward man without much sophistication. George Raft another actor who played enough gangsters during his career makes a wonderful contribution to the success of the film playing most of his scenes opposite Paul Muni. Ann Dvorak is seen as the rebellious Cesca who fell in love with Guino Rinaldo in one of her best roles. Oswood Perkins plays Johnny Lovo with his usual style. Boris Karloff has some good opportunities with his Gaffney Tony Camonte's rival. Karen Morley C. Henry Barnett and the rest of the cast do excellent work for Mr. Hawks.Scarface is a classic movie that shows a great director Howard Hawks at his best. The remake by Brian DePalma pales in comparison with this enormously entertaining film.".

	schema:reviewBody "As other have accurately pointed out this is an unusual film for Hawks. For one thing there really is no hero. Muni looks rather anthropoid in this movie. He seems to live in a dump and is content to let his mother and sister live in a similar dump. He throws his mother around too the swine. There is little of the male solidarity we've come to expect from Hawks. Everyone in the film seems manipulative.There are a couple of other uncharacteristic features here. Some fancy editing takes place as a chattering tommy gun seems to blow away the pages of a calendar. And the later Hawks would have considered the symbolic use of all those Xs to be pretentious. Hawks claimed he got the idea from a photo in a tabloid newspaper of a murder scene after the body had been removed but an X was entered into the pic to denote the body's position. Of course many of his characters had little quirks rubbing their noses with a finger or whatever but they were behavioral touches rather than artifactual. After this film he seems to have given up on builtin symbolic oddities and gone with George Raft's coin flipping instead. But the main plot aside Tony Camonte's attitude towards his sister a characteristically nonobedient babe with melanic eye rings like a panda's is straightforwardly covert. I've never been sure he knew exactly what he was doing with forbidden impulses like incest or homosexuality. I mean the guy was from Goshen Indiana! He didn't know from Freud. As he once put it in an interview They attribute all these things to me. . . . It's completely unconscious. Ann Dvorak as the sister does a mean kootchy kootchy for Raft in the nightclub vestibule by the way. This is definitely worth catching although it doesn't seem to be shown much on TV. It belongs with Little Caesar and Public Enemy as one of the films to establish an entire genre.".

'Why do they want to spoil the classics?'I told him that the the 1983 version that he loves so much was a remake!Howard Hawks 1932 original is a pre Hays code version based on mobsters in Chicago at the time. Tony 'Scarface' Camonte Paul Muni is a bodyguard for a bootlegger Big Louis Costillo who he kills. The ambitious Tony wants a piece of the action a step up the ladder and joins up with another mobster Johnny Lovo who arranged the hit and got Tony out of police custody.This is the beginning of the gang wars in Chicago as Lovo expands his operation Tony who is more aggressive in taking out his rivals is aided by his coin flipping sidekick Guino Rinaldo George Raft.Tony is attracted by Lovo's dame Poppy Karen Morley and plans to one day bump off Lovo. After all Tony thinks the world is his and there for the taking. However he also has an almost incestous obsession with his sister the floozy Cesca who herself is attracted to Guino.This is a violent gangster film with some grisly dark humour. There is a tabloid feel to this picture. It starts of with some moralising that the government is doing nothing to stop the gang warfare there is talk at one point of deporting these thugs they are not even American citizens.I was rather taken aback with how strong the violent action scenes would be for the audience of the time. Tony loves firing that machine gun. The film rattles along at quite a pace and yet also feels strangely offbeat.It is noticeable how much of the fundamental story is later used by Brian De Palma for his updated version.".

	schema:headline " Classic gangster picture is a mixed bag";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're in the mood for a classic gangster film with a lot of action and violence this one may suit you. Paul Muni is in the role of Tony Camonte an up and coming gangster with a scar on his face that resembles a giant cross. He's far from saintly though and aggressively pushes to expand his territory piling up bodies as he goes and lusting after both his boss's girlfriend Karen Morley and his own sister Ann Dvorak. Muni exaggerates his facial expressions a bit too much but he's fantastic in some scenes such as the one where he fixes an icy stare at his boss Osgood Perkins when he finds he's been betrayed. As an aside some of his expressions reminded me of James Franco see if you agree. As for the rest of the cast it's a mixed bag. Perkins incidentally Anthony Perkins' father isn't all that convincing as his boss he's just not tough enough. It's interesting to see Boris Karloff and in one scene bowling no less but he doesn't quite seem to fit. Ann Dvorak is strong as his sister who has just turned 18 and is looking for a good time. My favorite scene with her is when she tries to get Muni's righthand man George Raft to dance. Raft turned in what I thought was the best performance understated but tough flipping a coin menacingly so iconic! and really looking the part. Most of the scenes director Howard Hawks gives us aren't all that special from my perspective. The ones that stand out are the St. Valentine's Day massacre execution shot which had seven shadows on a wall mowed down by machine gun fire and then later a body dumped out of a moving car with the ominous note stay out of the North Side.The political messages in the film are heavyhanded but it's interesting in that they span both sides of today's political spectrum arguing for tougher gun control laws while at the same time to deport illegal immigrants. It's also interesting that while the film ostensibly states it purpose is to show true events to spur action against gangsters and violence it seems to do a fair bit of glorifying them just as 'The Public Enemy' had the year before. Oh how America loves its guns and gangster films and how well this film fits in with understanding its character and a long history of violence.This is certainly a decent film especially if you like the genre though I liked 'The Public Enemy' better mainly because of Cagney. Muni himself is far better in 'I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang' which he also did in 1932 and I would recommend it over 'Scarface' as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Scarface is a top notch film. The evolving characterization of Tony played by Paul Muni creates a story line of young man just trying to make it in this world the way he saw fit. You have to give the guy some street cred he normal handles whatever is thrown at him with ease. I mean picking up a machine gun that someone just tried to shoot you with is no big deal or anythingThis movie is classic and just due to that fact none of the reproductions will ever be able to live up to it. The characters are impressively authentic. They grew up in this time period when gangster crime was a part of city culture. It is easy to act out what you see in the papers every week. By no means am I saying its easy to act the way Muni does. He becomes completely submerged in his character absorbing all the emotions characteristics and even scars that come with the gangster territory.The film quality of this piece is jaw dropping for this time period. The shooting of guns and shattering of windows matched with sound effects that fall exactly at the right mark is just another part that creates this magnificent movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall this film was welldone keeping in mind the technology available at the time and the time period in general. The stated goal of this film was to raise awareness of gang activity promoting antigang governmental policy. The question did it really do so?Despite some validity in the criticism that the film exaggerates some aspects of gang activity from the viewpoint of someone watching this movie at the time it was produced it seems that the material would be very relevant and influential. I think that really getting into a gang's behavior and mindset along with its interactions with other gangs like South Side vs North Side in the film was something that people at the time had never experienced. If I were living in the 1930s watching this film it would certainly give me a new perspective and would encourage me to have an antigang stance as well. Keeping in mind its popularity it is rational to think that this movie was very significant in changing the mindset of its viewers on gangs and making them more adverse to gang activity as they watched Tony Camonte's brutality. The character arc of Tony and his rise to power most likely contributed the greatest to this change in perspective but even small metaphors that Wellman included like the sign outside of Tony's house allowed viewers to appreciate the irony of the situation. All in all Scarface is not only culturally significant but also historically significant as we look back on gang activity and its implications for America at large. From my knowledge as of now I would argue that Wellman did effectively meet his goals for his movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The name Scarface is most notably associated with the 1983 remake of the same name. That iteration raises the violence level and modernizes the film for that particular time. It's highly acclaimed and for good reason it's a fine film. However the original is no slouch either. My initial reaction to hearing about the original Scarface piqued my interest as I was unaware there was an original. That being said I was worried it wouldn't have the same gritty atmosphere as the arguably more well known version. My expectations were blown out of the water. Even as an older film the 1932 Scarface portrays a believable rise to power for an aspiring gangster and it's a great watch. Paul Muni's depiction of Tony is definitely different from his 1983 counterpart but it's still a riveting performance. The film may not dabble in cocaine and fantastical scenes of bloody shootouts but the tone is ever present. Visually it may seem more tame but it has the same heart as the 1983 version and it's a solid film because of it. I'd argue this iteration is even better albeit a bit dated. Even with its age Scarface is a great film that entertains to this day.".

	schema:headline " Libyan resistance hero Omar Mukhtar leads a guerrilla campaign against Italian colonisers.";
	schema:reviewBody "I came across my video copy of this film in 1995. I was surprised that I had never heard of the film as it uses such star actors as Quinn Gielgud Papas Steiger and Oliver Reed. It is the only copy I have ever come across in UK shops. To the best of my knowledge it has never been shown in the UK on either terrestrial or satellite TV. The reason for this remains a complete mystery to me. It may be because it was financed by Gaddafi who has been the subject of international embargos for many years.The ArabAmerican Moustapha Akkad produced and directed the film in Libya with Gaddafi's full support. The film is reasonably accurate and in my opinion fair and balanced. Anthony Quinn had a long and distinguished career playing 'ethnic types' and his portrayal of Omar Mukhtar is undoubtedly one of his finest performances. Omar in the film is probably much more of an action man than the real Mukhtar who was more of a strategist than a fighter. Or so I was informed whilst on holiday in Tunisia. The film is understandably one of the most famous in the Arab world dealing as it does with Arab suffering under recent European colonialism.Akkad uses original black and white archive film to underpin its historical authenticity. At the start to set the scene of the Italian conquest of Libya from Turkey in 1911. In the middle to show an aerial view of the concentration camps built by the Italians and also the barbed wire 'Hadrian's Wall' built along the Egyptian border. Both these strategies were intended to cut off Mukhtar from his supply sources. At the end of the film there are still photos of the real Mukhtar in chains and also of the main Italian protagonists we see in the film.Rod Steiger blusters through his role as Mussolini the fascist dictator who wants to send Italian colonists to a peaceful Libya an ambition being thwarted by Omar Mukhtar's stubborn 20year long armed resistance. Oliver Reed plays a suitably ruthless General Graziani the man charged with crushing Mukhtar. But his character is no twodimensional brute.There is a very engaging private dialogue between himself and the captive Mukhtar. The two men debate historic claims to Libyan soil with Graziani pointing out that the Romans were there before the Arabs. Reed gives a very controlled performance one of his best.The film is very balanced in its portrayal of the Italians. On the one hand we see some terrible reprisalsshootings and hangingsagainst civilians. On the other hand we have two sympathetic Italian officers whose conscience is afflicted by by the war they are forced to wage. The Raf Vallone character is particularly sympathetic very courteous generous and kind to the captive Mukhtar. This is history telling at its best. Italian fascists were not all the same. Individuals matter. Likewise the Italian officer chosen to defend Omar at his trial argues that Mukhtar never committed treason against the Italian state because he never accepted it rule.On the Arab side we have John Gielgud playing the highranking Sharif elGariani character who is sent to ask Omar to end his struggle. Some Arabs were willing to collaborate with an Italian rule which was helping to modernise their country. There is a nice reference to the fact that 'the League of Nations will not help you' highlighting the limitations of this predecessor of the UN. Come to think of it things have not changed very much!The action scenes are spectacular with some inspiring ambushes by the insurgents against the Italian forces. The film credits Graziani wrongly? with being the first general to bring tanks into the desert. The Italian assault on the oasis town of Kufra is a theatrical masterpiece. Some viewers may think that all this is probably a bit over the top. It probably is but it certainly boosts the film's entertainment level. In fact the film could have shown Italian planes dropping poison gas bombs as they did in Abyssinia a few years later. In his biography of Mussolini the eminent historian Denis Mack Smith maintains that this did happen in Libya.The music is very effective and the film is emotionally charged throughout especially during the hanging scenes. The Omar Mukhtar character is accorded a great deal of dignity and honour. The film is hagiography but so are 'Spartacus' 'BenHur' 'El Cid' and scores of other epics. Does this make the film a piece of Arab propaganda? Yes and no. The film emphasises the central role of Islam in giving Omar the inner strength to continue his fight. It tells an historical tale with a great deal of accuracy but it is also a feature film which aims to entertain. In that respect it is no different to any Hollywood blockbuster about the Alamo or Pearl Harbor. In my opinion it is superior to many such blockbusters. It's just that white Caucasians have to get used to being the bad guys for a change.Gaddafi is now coming in from the cold and opening up his country to tourism. I can only hope that this will result in the film becoming more widely available and betterknown in the UK. 'Lion of the Desert' is an excellent historical epic which tells one side of the story. Some historians would argue that Mukhtar's defeat and death paved the way for the enlightened rule of Italo Balbo who governed a 'pacified' Libya after 1934 with few executions and much building of infrastructure. I would not accept this view as all imperialisms are selfjustifying and ultimately unacceptable.".

Some historians would argue that Mukhtar's defeat and death paved the way for the enlightened rule of Italo Balbo who governed a 'pacified' Libya after 1934 with few executions and much building of infrastructure. I would not accept this view as all imperialisms are selfjustifying and ultimately unacceptable.";

It will take your breath away ... You will laugh and you will cry ... You will scream and shout ... You will hope it never ends. BraveHeart? Yeah that was a good movie but nowhere as brilliant as this is. This does not only tell the life story of a Great man it also teaches you the noble aspects that build up a truly Unforgettable Warrior. It explains what Tolerance is all about.This movie truly shows the the savage means which the conquering Italian army used to treat the Libyan natives. The struggle for freedom took place in the heart of the African desert. Omar Al Mukhtar The Lion of the Desert who led the Libyan resistance a role played in this movie by Anthony Quinn ... this has to be his best ever performance. An Oscar Nominee worth ... nothing less. Director Moustapha Akkad who is also famous for the great yet unknown classic Rislah al 1976 gives his best shot at direction here. Excellent work.Rent this now if its available Its worth every penny. You will be the witness of utter brilliance and great performances. Watch it vote for it Give it the respect it deserves.".

His first the relatively forgotten film The Message about Mohammed and the Koran it was mistycal enough for me a huge success worldwide. Then Akkad lured Libyan dictator Molomar Qaddafi to invest million 35 in the war epic Lion of the Desert.... One of the largest financial disasters in film history though one of the greatest films I've seen... Does this make sense???..Anthony Quinn somehow reprising his role in the epic Lawrence of Arabia portrays the Libyan Guerilla fighter Omar Mukhtar who pledged his as well as his countrymen's life to drive the invading Italian forces out.The story depicts post World War 1 pre WW2 era where Benito Mussolini played by Rod Steiger tries carving up the globe with empires for Italy. He uses Libya as an easy stepping stone to the the Middle East Libya's occupation was not started by him.. funny and demagogical enough the young Mussolini demonstrated against the occupation of Libya in 1911.Mukhtar the village teacher on the other hand made this difficult and was so successful waging his campaign against the Italians that Mussolini sends in his top general The Butcher Graziani played deliciously by the late Sir Oliver Reed the Trap 1966 The Four Musketeers 1974 Gladiator 2000 and many more to straighten things out.First the Italians just tour Libya raiding burning killing and raping... but when an entire attack convoy is completely wiped out by rebels Graziani decides to wage an allout war against Libyans. Graziani pretends to come to terms with Mukhtar but at the same time brings thousands of fresh Italian troops to Tripoli and marches them inland. He is the first general to use planes and tanks in the desert destroying town after town. This way he successfully corners Mukhtar and his rebels in the mountains.Historically accurate in its portrayal of the Italian army and of the campaign itself Lion of the Desert is an action packed nearly I say nearly.. flawless epic war film.Rod Steiger starts with some overacting marching around his offices barking at people. But the film quickly shifts towards the vastness and splendor of the Sahara desert. It has excellent action sequences that employ splendid special effects and lots of stunt work.On top of this it's one of the bloodiest war films I've seen with bullet wounds spraying blood and people smashed to pulps by Italian tanks. God knows how this film faded away with a mediocre rating but then again noone really saw the film right?The film is also a fascinating portrayal of the Arabs way of life and how it conflicts with European ideals.The musical score of this film by Maurice Jarre Lawrence of Arabia is only great at times but often seems uninspired and lame compared to his previous works on David Lean's great films.The cinematography and editing are classy one con though.. the cameras seemed a little shy of hanging around close to the big gasoline truck explosion. The best scenes in the film are battle scenes one involving a vast army of extras destroying a nearly helpless arab village another with Graziani's army battling the Libyans for control of a mountain bridge. Other than those two I can't say great about the 3 or so other battle scenes compared to these two.The overall effect of battle senes is though quite satisfying.The cast of this film doesn't lack bignames like Irene Papas  and Sir John Gielgud but the roles were inconsequential as Mukhtar's friends. Then there's a lot of the old Italian Bmovie stars in small roles as Italian soldiers and aides..Akkad's strong point seems to be showing Italian artillery blowing the bewildered Bedouin warriors while his weak point seems to be spending the money. The film didn't really need the lavishness and authenticity of the picture. Do you really have to hire thousands of extras and build many many replica tanks just to go destroy them for the authenticy? No surprise this movie lost money but the fact that it made almost no money astonishes me. Could be cause early 1980s were wrong timing for an epic film. People watched The Empire Strikes Back and didn't want to see a thorough recreation of some war most never heard of.Lion of the Desert may not be perfect but it's just as splendid a viewing as any of the old bigbudget war films like Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago only this one's got a bit more action and politically ignored as propoganda or is it the propoganda that endorses ignoring it??.I highly recommend seeing the DVD in Widescreen crisp quality and good 5.1 Dolby Digital sound plus lots of informative extra features.".

Omar Mukhtar a brilliant Bedouin leader wages war against oppressive Italian Fascist forces led by the bloodthirsty General Graziani in his native Lybia.Director Moustapha Akkad The Message clearly learnt a few lessons from Lawrence of Arabia mainly how best to use the charismatic Anthony Quinn. As Mukhtar Quinn gives a nuanced portrayal of compassion and wisdom. Whenever he features in a scene it becomes impossible to tear one's eyes off the screen. Thankfully Oliver Reed proves a magnificently cruel and seething counterpoint as General Graziani. Irene Papas provides strong supporting work and Rod Steiger turns in a delightful cameo as Benito Musslini.Moustapha Akkad uses a solid structure and keeps it riveting throughout extracting fine performances from all his actors and technical collaborators. Where The Message was impressive but cold due to its invisible hero and reverence Lion in the Desert has an emotional core and throws up scene after impressive scene. The desert battle scenes are incredibly messy and savage and have a sense of multiple individual action amid chaos rather than elaborate choreography. This perfectly suits the theme of Bedouin guerrilla. Production values are considerable and Maurice Jarre provides one of his most underrated scores.Some viewers will find qualms with the fact that despite the coda that proclaims that Lybia managed to liberate itself the country was then for long under the oppressive rule of Kadaffi. In truth this little addition might have something to do with the fact that Kadaffi assisted in funding the film. If you can overlook this not to difficult you can appreciate the true focus Mukhtar. This remains a beautiful film about a people's resistance.Lion in the Desert is an important film if only because it offers a very accessible to Western audiences Arab perspective. It is also impressively well made an accomplished chapter in the era of great epics that flourished with David Lean's masterpieces and ended with Richard Attenbourgh's Gandhi.See this!".

For starters it's director Moustapha Akkad employed the same cinematographer and soundtrack composer that David Lean had for Lawrence of Arabia which is the film both historically and thematically related to Lion. The lead players are Brits or Yanks diminishing the impact of the film considerably at least Lawrence had Omar Sharif play its most significant character other than O'toole in the title role. Having said that credit must be given to Quinn Steiger Reid and Gielgud for giving solid and credible performances. The action scenes are pulled off with considerable lan. It's one of the last of the films with thousands of real extras rather than computer generated soldiers being masterfully orchestrated to provide great verisimilitude and a sense of genuine chaos which would be inherent in such pitched battles. Well worth watching is the Making of bonus material in which Director Akkad discloses not only his meticulous devotion to historical accuracy battle scenes were filmed on the actual locations where they transpired costumes copied from the extensive Italian photograph and film archives of the period and even Mussolini's old barber was hired to cut Rod Steiger's hair precisely as the Duce had his done. Akkad and his cast obviously were passionate about making this film in very difficult desert conditions and it shows nearly every scene. I was particularly impressed with Reid's ability to make the villainous General Graziani seem an interesting if repellent character. I recommend this film highly to David Lean fans or anyone who likes to see historical epics unstintingly produced and handsomely mounted.".

	schema:reviewBody "A pretty good desert epic with lots of action this film is often thought to be a propaganda piece for Libya and Islam with antiItalian overtones.Not quite.The film is no more antiItalian than it is proIslam.  That is to say it is neither.  It's a grand scale film that shows a Facist state's attempt to colonize and reign over north Africa in the early half of the 20th century and how the native populace waged a guerilla war against this effort.  It does not cast aspersions on Italians nor pushes Islam as a religion.  Italy happens to be swept up in a facist mindset whose forces are at odds with a people who are predominantly Muslim.Anthony Quinn himself states in the Making of... documentary that the lead character Omar alMukhtar was not fighting for Islam nor proselytizing in any way.  He was one of many guerilla leaders who was trying to push the facists out of Libya.  And even then he's only trying to regain that which was taken by facists and not so much force Italians themselves to leave. Facists who at the time happened to be from Italy.  From what I've seen the film does its best to accurately depict what went on during Italy's expansionist period under Mussolini and shows this episode of political and military contention between the two sides in Libya.There's lots of good acting here and grand battle scenes.  The cinematography is the usual style for this sort of film.  Unfortunately the cast was chosen more for their names to sell the film than anything else. Even so they Quin Reed Steiger and the rest do a pretty good job of showing us how the men of the time acted and behaved and Quinn does en exceptional job of showing a humble but resolved Mukhtar.  The battle scenes for the most part are pretty good.  There's one or two hammy performances by a couple of the supporting cast members but they're overshadowed by the rest of the film.The DVD transfer is OK.  Anchor Bay's gone to some extra lengths to put some extra goodies on the disk but the film's image could've used a dual layer process.If you're a fan of military epics this film should entertain.  A good watch.".

	schema:headline " Old style Hollywood converts to Islam pt 2";
	schema:reviewBody "The second follwing Mohammed Messenger of God of producer turned director Moustapha Akkad's rather foolhardy attempts to create a popular Islamic cinema using Western cinematic and narrative forms which were 20 years at least out of date even in Hollywood Lion of the Desert tells the story of the 20 year campaign of resistance against Italian imperialist occupation by the Bedouin desert armies of Omar Mukhtar. Anthony Quinn who was also in Mohammed play Mukhtar as someone's kindly old uncle a wily old desert lion with one spectacled eye on the Koran and the other on the field of battle. Oliver Reed plays his nemesis the Italian fascist General Rodolfo Graziani.The film is a fairly simplistic affair. Mukhtar and his fellow Bedouin are the personifications of good patiently and relentlessly opposing the mechanistic might of the Italians. It's horses and guns versus tanks and bombs for the most part and the film makes no bones about being propaganda for Mukhtar's resistance movement  not too difficult to swallow considering the army he was facing. Yet in creating such a black and white view of reality reminiscent of the many popular films the allies produced during and after the 2nd World War the film comes across as dated unambiguous and conceptually crude. The society that Mukhtar was defending is not questioned even though it is clearly a society which is relentlessly antimodern and in which women have very little active role to play. There is an intriguing scene in which a grieving war widow brings her son to Mukhtar's tent and the old lion gives the boy his father's book and instructs him to tell your mother to keep it safe for you. The woman must be told by the man even when the man is her tiny child...The film is pretty successful in cramming a long historical story into two and a half hours of screen time and the narrative is pretty clear. H.A.L Craig's screenplay makes rather too much use of repetitive motifs which don't develop as the story goes on but simply come up again and again at intervals. The two most notable of these motifs are the constant encounters with good Italians who although they wear a fascist uniform shrink from the more abhorrent crimes they are asked to perform and have a scarcely hidden admiration for Mukhtar exemplified by Raf Vallone's veteran negotiator and Bedouin children in jeopardy but learning from the spirit of Mukhtar  this latter strand of motif leans towards the cloying and sentimental.There is a lot to admire in the film as an achievement in bigscale moviemaking. The camerawork is excellent throughout the battle sequences impressive and certain setpieces the montage of the concentration camps the Italians put the Bedouin in the hanging of Mukhtar are impressive and worth watching the film for. The performances are pretty ripe except for Quinn who overeggs his pudding by being too kindly too scholastic too intrinsically good to convince as a real human being. We expect Reed to be hammy but he is large without being absurd and predictably outdone by Steiger doing a shouting turn as Mussolini a role he also played in 1974's Mussolini Ultimo atto. Far worse is the tendency to cast veteran British Thespians as elder Arabs Andrew Keir just about gets away with it but John Gielgud as a wily old collaborator with the Italians is preposterous with his rich upper class English tones and pale skin.There's a certain panhistorical element to the story  the Bedouin stand for all colonised peoples fighting their colonisers this is made explicit in the film by Mussolini comparing the wall Graziani builds with Hadrian's and one gets the feeling watching the film that it could be inspirational to the oppressed people of Palestine now. Mukhtar with his high ideals and refusal to torture or kill prisoners is a very different Muslim fighter to the popular Western image of the suicide bomber today which only makes director Akkad's death in 2005 in Amman Jordan by an AlQaeda suicide bomber the more bitter and tragic.".

	schema:headline " Interesting epic strongly acted by its leads and impressive in scale but hurt by occasional imperfections.";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite being one of the most financially disastrous films ever made costing a lot to make and making very little back Lion Of The Desert is a surprisingly good epic film about the Italian occupation of Libya in 1929. The film focuses on two of the key players on each side  the Italian forces are marshaled with ruthless ironlike discipline by their notorious Colonel Graziani while the Libyans defend themselves under the guidance of spiritual guerrilla freedom fighter Omar Mukhtar a.k.a the Lion of the Desert. It's an interesting clash of ideals and personalities which makes for a worthwhile  if never truly outstanding  historical epic.In 1929 the Italians grow desperate as their occupation of Libya reaches crisis point. The Libyans simply refuse to accept that another country has any rights to their homeland and reject all attempts by the Italians to justify their presence there. Mussolini Rod Steiger sends one of his most promising and fearsome soldiers to resolve the tension  Colonel Rodolfo Graziani Oliver Reed. Graziani's approach is one of ruthless and merciless force  he has Libyans executed in front of their families for working with guerrillas he sets up concentration camps in the desert where Libyans are frequently hanged or starved to death he orders his tanks to wipe out villages and towns with the aim of total annihilation. Yet somehow against this modern army armed with their tanks and machine guns the Libyans manage to fight back under the guidance of an elderly freedom fighter named Omar Mukhtar Anthony Quinn. Mukhtar continually embarrasses his mighty opponent by leading cunning Arab attacks against them. They come from the desert like lightning strike at the Italian soldiers and communication lines then fade back into the landscape before they can be caught or killed. It is nearly two years before Graziani finally captures and hangs Mukhtar in front of his people hoping to finally crush the spirit of the Libyan resistance.Lion Of The Desert has plenty to admire. Quinn's performance as Mukhtar is certainly very convincing and Reed belies the fact that he was making one terrible film after another at this point in his career by turning in a very menacing portrayal of Graziani. Both of them almost have the film stolen from under their noses by Rod Steiger's immense cameo as Mussolini  exuberant acting by an exuberant actor. The film is also strong during the battle sequences  the size of the forces involved is impressively captured in some genuinely epicscale clashes and we are spared nothing of the unpleasant reality of combat. People are shot to pieces tanks roll over legs and bodies crushing the lifeblood from them and none of it is hidden or glamorised for the viewers. We certainly get to glimpse the full horrors of a battlefield. There are still flaws with Lion Of The Desert one being the unfathomable decision to have several wellknown British actors play Libyan freedom fighters. With their tooproper Queens' English accents blue eyes and faketanned skin they look foolish rather than convincing. Poor John Gielgud suffers most of all in this manner. Also the film's narrative is not always as clear as one might hope with some characters and events that don't feel as if they've been developed properly and come across as rather hard to follow. Generallyspeaking Lion Of The Desert is a good film though certainly worth a look.".

Perhaps too few know the history which I must admit that I myself was unaware of though it feels quite authentic. It could be the violence... this is rather brutal and there are those that would call it downright distasteful. Personally I call it realistic and not unnecessarily toned down. War is not pleasant much less glamorous. That is a myth perpetrated by those who wish to keep it going the people who benefit. This gives an accurate depiction of the fighting for both sides. Regardless of the reason I hope that this film is no longer overlooked. Akkad directed three times and I've now seen and rated perfect 10's two of them the one remaining being an Arabic version of Mohammad Messenger of God which was in English. I don't know what kept him out of the chair apart from these instances but I hope he felt he had told all that he had in him for it would be a true shame if he did not get the chance to. The plot is incredible and genuinely inspirational. Writing all the way is excellent the credible characters with proper motivation the memorable and quotable dialog and the script as a whole all amazing. The music is an epic orchestral score. All of the effects and action are impeccable. The acting performances are beyond reproach. While this does off course hold some bias I never felt manipulated or lied to as I watched it. Instead I was engaged and experienced a recreation of the past and a portion of it that should not be forgotten. In spite of the listing here on the site the cut I saw was 153 minutes or about two and a half hours long. There is no sexuality or language in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer and a making of produced around the same time as the feature and they are good and welldone with that in mind. I recommend this to anyone who believes they can stomach the gruesome visuals that are foundI maintain that the use and amount are not gratuitous in it. 1010".

For Steve Martin to be in a nonJerk type roll makes seeing this movie next to impossible for a great number of people. No he's not acting weird. No he doesn't have an arrow on his head. No he isn't going for the laugh. This is Mr. Martin at his acting best. If you were impressed by his recent turn in 'Shopgirl' the do yourself a favor and go out of your way to find a copy of this movie. Are there times when humor finds its way into this movie? Oh yeah but for the most part there is nothing but good solid storytelling with excellent casting and an excellent script. See this movie if you want to see a wonderful character study acted out by a superb cast.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding adaptation of a great novel";
	schema:reviewBody "I had never even heard of this movie until a couple of years ago.  This is yet another stellar movie from the tremendous class of 1994.I was absolutely enthralled by this story so I went and read the novel it was derived from Silas Marner by George Eliot.  It was a really good story as well but Martin's adaptation was outstanding.  He managed to modernize the story so it could be more meaningful to new audiences and yet still preserved the heart and soul of the story.  While the original story was good the novel was difficult to read not just because of the time difference it was written in 1861 but also because of Eliot's overly descriptive language making a wonderful story fairly unapproachable to most people.For me the most successful adaptations must start with a great story then keep the best parts and lose the worst parts while understanding and compensating for the differences between the mediums.  Martin's screenplay excels at this even surpassing Darabont's outstanding adaptation for The Shawshank Redemption.The acting in the movie was very good as well.  There's just something about a gifted comedian playing a dramatic role.  Kind of like the image of a clown crying when someone you normally associate with happiness and laughter convinces you that they're sad there's a finer point to it it has more impact.  Think of Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society Awakenings and more recently Good Will Hunting.  Steve Martin was convincing and provided a character that you could empathize with.  Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney were very good as they always are.  The girls that played Mathilda were just rightextremely adorable and convincing yet not so cute that you couldn't take it.This is one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen it give it a try.".

I think that Mr. Martin has kept the feelings of loss and rebirth for lack of a better phrasing vibrantly alive in this adaptation. Steve Martin CAN do drama and he does it so well. The story and characters are rich. You are drawn in to the despair of the main character feeling for him but still wanting to kick him in the pants and tell him to get on with not just life but living. And when the opportunity to do so presents itself to him. It is a joy to watch him become human again. I could go on forever but I'm only allowed 1000 words.

It only lasted a couple of weeks due to poor marketing but the customers leaving the auditorium after the movie all had tears in their eyes. It's not a depressing movie just so emotional you can't help but get drawn into it. Steve Martin adapted the George Elliot novel about Silas Marner to modern day in a brilliant way and it's such a shame so few people saw this.This is my favorite movie tied with The Sixth Sense. It incorporates all of the elements needed for an engrossing story. If you have not seen it please check it out. Steve Martin is usually associated with comedy but this movie is a wonderful and touching drama with some comedy sprinkled in. It is intellectual moving and draws you into the story like the best movies of all time. Please watch it.".

Here he tackles a more dramatic role with so much warmth and sincerity and he even manages to inject some comic moments in his typical style.To know that he also wrote this screenplay is not surprising as he's a gifted writer as well. The story in this film is tremendously lifeaffirming. If nothing else it illustrates how even the most serious or threatening situation can turn around just like that in the blink of an eye. As with M. Night Shyamalan's Signs Christians might be thinking of Romans 828 when they see this film  how events good or bad are so often intricately orchestrated to a better end that we really can't see coming.My favorite point in the film is when Steve Martin's character having just been robbed of the fortune he's amassed in gold coins he stored his cash in these coins rather than in a bank sees this sweet toddler girl wandering aimlessly into his home as an event that was simply meant to be as the gift he is given because his money has been taken away.

But new hope for Martin arises when a dead mother's child shows up on the doorstep or IN the house for that matter at Martin's he takes her in after the frozentodeath mother is shoveled off the driveway with a steamroller no no I'm joking.

The judge says without money for college Martin won't be able to keep the girl. So his only hope is to find the money that was stolen from him all those years ago.A Simple Twist of Fate is a decent film with a few laughs but it's about a half hour too long and doesn't contain quite enough laughs. It's pretty sad when Catherine O'Hara generates more laughs in the film than Steve Martin himself.Martin does well but there is no explanation as to some of his quick character changes. I understand the girl changes his life and turns him from a private person to a social person but it's not a gradual change One day he is a man who hides in his cabin all day the next day he's a regular Joe saying Hi to everyone in town. Gabriel Byrne plays the real father of the girl and he does pretty well though it's not his most fondly remembered costar role.Catherine O'Hara as I said before delivered more laughs than the hilarious Steve Martin which makes me wonder if the director wanted to give Martin a new look so to speak. Unfortunately I like the old Martin better.In the end A Simple Twist of Fate is a pretty decent comedydrama that I watch whenever it comes on TV but I'd never buy it. Worth seeing once or twice.35 stars John Ulmer".

It's pretty sad when Catherine O'Hara generates more laughs in the film than Steve Martin himself.Martin does well but there is no explanation as to some of his quick character changes. I understand the girl changes his life and turns him from a private person to a social person but it's not a gradual change One day he is a man who hides in his cabin all day the next day he's a regular Joe saying Hi to everyone in town. Gabriel Byrne plays the real father of the girl and he does pretty well though it's not his most fondly remembered costar role.Catherine O'Hara as I said before delivered more laughs than the hilarious Steve Martin which makes me wonder if the director wanted to give Martin a new look so to speak. Unfortunately I like the old Martin better.In the end A Simple Twist of Fate is a pretty decent comedydrama that I watch whenever it comes on TV but I'd never buy it. Worth seeing once or twice.35 stars John Ulmer";

But holy smokes this crosses the line a little bit with the glorification of such....at least with the ending which I won't give away but involves Sharon Stone's character.Along the way is a fun ride as the revengeobsessed Stone hires Sylvester Stallon The Specialist a term for his bombmaking talents to kill all the people responsible for her parents' murder years earlier.The villains are overthetop to say the least. One almost has to laugh out loud at one of them James Woods. Few people in his era 70s and 80s mainly were better at playing despicable villains than Woods and in this film he plays that role to the hilt. He also rattles off the best line in the movie when he tells some tourist to get a new shirt too.The other villains are played by Eric Roberts and Rod Steiger. Roberts is nasty and arrogant all the way and Steiger  as he has so often since the 1970s  appears cartoonish in his overacting.The film moves quickly which means it's very entertaining and some of the bombing scenes are quite memorable such as a chunk of a condo building falling into the ocean.Even though the villains are really nasty there are no good guys here either. Everyone is seriously flawed as is the message of the film. I guess this is one of those guilty pleasure movies they talk about because I still enjoy watching it every five or so years.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about The Specialist is the performance of James Woods who really sinks his teeth into his villainous role and is enormously entertaining. What he also does that is good is making his material more interesting than it deserved to be much has been said about the scene with the shirt and for good reason. Eric Roberts is pretty good also he doesn't have anywhere near as much to do and his character is rather onenote but somehow Roberts does bring some intensity and menace whenever he appears. The scenery is lovely too the sex scene was appropriately steamy and John Barry's score is the other of the two assets most worth noting about The Specialist. Barry was one of the alltime great film composers and I have yet to hear a bad score from him and the music for The Specialist has his typical lushness beautiful harmonic writing and moodiness these things may seem out of place for a film such as this but actually it works. Unfortunately very little else works. Sylvester Stallone is not the best of actors but as an action star he showed great charisma. Here he is very wooden and mumbles his way through his lines. Sharon Stone also flounders Stone has shown she can be goodshe is brilliant in Casino but she does look awkward and there is the sense that her heart wasn't really in it which makes her character's predicament difficult to engage with. Regarding the chemistry between them too the only time where it works is in the sex scene everywhere else you'll struggle to find any kind of passion. Coming off worst was Rod Steiger giving a performance so embarrassingly overthetop it was like watching a cartoon which was completely out of kilter with the rest of the film. The characters have no real depth and personality the most colourful character was James Woods's and his performance itself has a lot to do with it. The dialogue has its moments all of which with Woods again but on the most part it's very weak often lacking sense and flow and often aimless with far too much talk. Storywise the lack of originality conceptwise can be forgivenrevenge thrillers often have that but it's not always a bad thing but for it to be plodding laughably implausible and at times incoherent is less forgivable as well as parts being so predictable any suspense and tension is severely diluted and having parts that have little to no relevance. Other than revenge you don't have a clear idea as to what the heroine's motivations are. The action sequences lack any kind of momentum or excitement and just looks so awkwardly staged and passionless a few are so ridiculous that it brings unintentional laughter. The direction is flat and with the vibe that he didn't know how to direct a thriller and visually only the scenery really impresses some of the colours are nice but others are garish and the film in terms of photography and editing does often look like directtovideo quality. Overall Woods the shirt scene and the score are great Roberts the sex scene and scenery are good but the script story leads and Steiger are just bad and the film on the whole is mediocre. 410 Bethany Cox".

I'm not sure if he was bored in the role but he sleep walks his way through the movie. Like with 'Cobra' we get shots of Sly looking mean and moody behind his shades or intense and moody as he works on a bomb. Lots of posing as he listens to Stones voice over and over as he stalks her. Lots of posing not much actual acting. Sharon Stone does what Sharon Stone did at that point of her career look good and take her clothes off. Eric Roberts how did this man not have a bigger career?? I'd much rather watch him on screen than his sister is a lot of fun and actually under used. Steiger is surprisingly under whelming which is a shame. But it's James Woods who this movie belongs too!! He is simply fantastic and the movie is s lot poorer when he is not on screen. So once again for the second movie in a row Stallone is completely overshadowed by his costar. Like Wesley Snipes in 'Demolition Man' James Woods not only steals every scene he is in he walks away with the full movie!! You could argue three with John Lithgow in CliffhangerAs with Nighthawks and Demolition Man Stallone had scenes cut featuring the villain This time Woods and more shot with himself the scene with the thugs on the bus and the one where Roberts threatens Sly with a knife at the last minute. It made no difference Woods still stole the movie. Despite a relatively short running time it actually feels a lot longer than it is. An interesting note on this is David Fincher was set to direct this at one stage. Stallone liked Fincher and wanted him but he was overruled by the producers because of the failure of Alien 3. Instead they went with Luis Llosa who had directed the straight to video 'Fire On The Amazon' with a Sandra Bullock and Sniper with Tom Berenger in 1993. Whilst Llosa's career went nowhere he only directed 2 more movies after this whilst Fincher made the mega hit Se7en a year later.".

	schema:headline " Defending an underrated and misunderstood Stallone's Action Thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Specialist 1994 is the most underrated bashed hated Stallone action thriller flick from it's fans and critics! I grew up with the film and it is still one of my best favorite action Stallone films! People seriouslysimply don't understand what the movie is about. It's an action thriller revenge Flick! The film is misunderstood and it is different Stallone film than in any other action films he played. The Specialist is not a masterpiece the greatest or the best action film but it is solid and good. It is an Entertaining action thriller from the beginning to the end.Stallone plays an trained Ex CIA agent who kills accidentally in Bogota Colombia a wife and a kid and the bombing goes awry. I loved it how a CIA agent went trough hell than he leaves the business and becomes a gun for hire. I love the character Ray Quick I even memorize Stallone's Character! He is a trained henchman an Ex Special Forces The Bomb Specialist expert and Ex CiA Agent turned mercenary for hire I love that! In this movie Stallone doesn't use a hand gun or any machine guns trough whole film but he uses his expatriate high explosives and hand to hand combat to kill a mobster and corrupted cop who was once a promising CIA agent but killed an innocent people and set up Ray!Stallone's character is well done written he has a heart. He refused to kill innocent people women and children when he set up the bomb in Miami to kill Tomas Leon inside was May and the bomb explodes Ray cared and run to stop the bomb but he was too late. Stallone goes to the funeral of the woman identified as May Munro he mourns and he is filed with quilt with killing an innocent person again. On a bus ride Ray gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman. The people haven't see that or noticed how a good hearted person the character is. He even took a cat under his wing. I love Ray Quick I don't care what anyone says! This movie has always been flawed with it's screenplay a powerful score lush cinematography and a solid cast. It has plot holes but I still love it. I love the twists the action sequences the erotic's sex scenes in the hot tub this scene really never bothered me. The special effects were great the bomb explosions. I absolutely love this movie. It is very stylish sexy and explosive. Stallone and Stone were perfect together. The Miami scenery was awesome. The music score was amazing. And the action was intense. Sylvester Stallone is truly an amazing actor and a truly a great talent. Also James Woods gave a powerful performance as Ned Trent a vengeful a hired assassin and a corrupt cop! Sharon Stone did a wonderful performance as a dropdead beauty! I love the bus ride scene! Ray Quick gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman only to have a young hoodlum take the seat instead. Quick calmly beats the crap out of the hoodlum and all his friends throwing one of them out a window not open and then reoffers the seat to the woman. This scene has no bearing on the plot but helps us get to know Quick. It is awesome powerful scene! Why I love this movie? I love it because in this movie Stallone doesn't use gun or machine guns but he uses his expatriate high explosives and hand to hand combat. The Specialist is the most Underrated Action Thriller. I love Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct to another action thriller The Specialist and I love James Woods playing a villain in this movie. This was the only action movie that Stallone made in 1994 it was success but it turned in to one of very underrated movie and honestly I don't care.This movie is apart from the film music as a whole a mustsee for action movie lovers with erotic scenes built in smoothly. The double role of May makes the movie richer there IS a plot possible in these kind of movies!. Action abound and well distributed over the time. Eric Roberts and James Woods play their roles at the same high level as Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. I see originality in the sense of action the highly developed explosive devicesdo hey really exist? CIA will know.. A flaw which I do not understand up to now is that the getaway boat from MM seafood seemed to be so readily available. The goofy trick with the telephone in the Fontainebleau Hotel as well but those are not disturbing details. The movie has a steady pace and ends with the Miami Sound Machine!. Best scene is of course  the intimate scene in the hotel. Superb entertainment! Two of Hollywood's biggest stars combine fiery action with steamy sensuality in The Specialist. Sharon Stone a dropdead beauty with a fatal past. She's sworn death to the mobsters who murdered her parents and she's decided the method of their disposal blast 'em one by one to kingdom come. She also knows the right man for the job coolfire exCIA explosives expert Ray Quick Sylvester Stallone. That is your basic plot! I am giving this film a 8 because what the hell this film deserves it! I love this film it is my best Stallone fifth favorite film! The Specialist is a 1994 American action film directed by Luis Llosa starring Sylvester Stallone Sharon Stone and James Woods. 810 Grade B Studio Warner Bros Starring Sylvester Stallone Sharon Stone James Woods Rod Steiger Eric Roberts Director Luis Llosa Producer Jerry Weintraub Screenplay Alexandra Seros Based on The Specialist novels by John Shirley Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 50 Mins.

	schema:headline " Hardly Stallone's worst but it's not worth mentioning.";
	schema:reviewBody " 12 out of Arguably Sylvester Stallone's last box office hit unless you count Cop Land The Specialist is not the typical Stallone testosterone fest.  In fact it remains a fairly atmospheric thriller revolving around obsession and revenge.  But it's not as interesting as it may sound thanks to the generally lackluster script and mostly unlikeable characters. Stallone plays Ray Quick an exbomb specialist who works for hire.  After the movie's requisite prologue he's in Miami working for May Munro Sharon Stone who wants him to kill three mobsters especially the head mobster's son Tomas Eric Roberts because they murdered her parents when she was a little girl.  Quick contacts her only by phone they are to never meet but he's admittedly intrigued by her and vice versa.  However she's actually working for Ned Trent James Woods Quick's former colleague who's out for revenge.Action fans expecting bombastic and overthetop action sequences should steer clear this movie will be too sluggish for them.  The Specialist has no desire to function as a typical Stallone actioner.  There are no largescale gun battles fisticuffs or car chases.  In fact I gather Stallone received the role purely on the basis of his box office clout and perhaps also his ability to brood and act generally depressed fairly well.  So what is The Specialist then?  Is it a thriller?  Yeah sort of there are a few suspenseful moments mostly pertaining to Stallone using his bombs to knock off the mobsters.  Surprisingly enough the twist of having the hero kill the bad guys with explosives Speed and Blown away came out the same year works well enough mostly because the villains' impending doom bears a certain inevitability that plays to the movie's advantage. But there's little else about the movie worth recommending.  The story doesn't make much sense as soon as it's revealed Roberts' murdered Stone's parents when she was a child I scratched my head in confusion.  He couldn't possibly be more than a year or two older than Stone meaning he committed the murders when he was about what ten or eleven?  More likely it appears the filmmakers are trying to pass off Stone as a twentyyear old bombshell. Sure Stone looks great and I do mean great in this film but she can't even pass for thirty.The romance is unsurprisingly perfunctory and generic.  As soon as the hero and heroine meet they almost immediately tear their clothes off and go at it.  This is neither romantic nor sexy even with the undeniably hot Sharon Stone as part of this tryst.  I've always kind of liked Stallone subpar an actor as he may be.  He's always had a fairly commandable screen presence though he has yet to translate that to genuine charisma which is what puts him considerably behind that other big lug Arnold Scwarzenegger. Neither suspenseful nor exciting enough to recommend The Specialist is of little interest to anyone except for Stallone and Stone fans and maybe James Wood fans who will either delight or wince at his maniacally overthetop performance.  I'm still waiting for Stallone to revive his career with a bigbudget action blockbuster but I don't see it happening. Hey I'm one of the few guys out there who actually liked DTox so I wouldn't necessarily say his career has gone down the drain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Specialist may not be great cinema but it does offer some good bangbang explosives action and also some interesting characters. Sly Stallone is a former CIAattached Army explosives expert Raymond Quick skilled at focus detonations that blow up certain areas while leaving surrounding areas unharmed.  In 1984 he and his partner Ned Trent must blow up a bridge frequented by a Columbian drug lord but a civilian bus enters as the explosives are set to go off.  When Trent callously goes through with the mission Ray disarms the bombs then beats up Trent before having him discharged from the Agency.Ten years later Trent now works as security chief for a Miami mafia chief who years earlier had a former underling named Munro killed  in front of the man's daughter May.  May Munro now wants her parents' killers blown up and she wants Ray Quick for the job.  Ray is initially reluctant believing it to be a setup but eventually accepts and starts blowing up the three thugs responsible one by one.  But it is a setup  May Munro is in reality working for Trent who is using her very real desire for revenge to smoke out Ray.  Quick though is too smart for Trent's traps  until Ray and May's passion heats up ad Trent gets the break he needs to finish off the both of them.The film's highlights are James Woods' overthetop performance the explosion scenes and also John Barry's haunting score fleshed out by Gloria Estefan's garish cover of Vicki Sue Robison's 1970s disco classic Turn The Beat Around.".

	schema:headline " A terrible 'action' film that is more accidentally humorous than seriously suspenseful.";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Stallone was already a big budget Hollywood star with many a title under his belt with Sharon Stone who also had a few films most noticeably 'Basic Instinct' going for her and James Woods again with some reasonably successful outings most notably in my opinion a 'Simpsons' episode 'The Specialist' fails to live up to its talent hype and attempt as a film noir come action film.What struck me upon looking this film up after seeing it was the director. He'd had hardly any experience previous to this film and thinking back to the film itself it's no wonder it really turned out the way it did. A big budget and a big cast with a screenplay that wasn't terrible probably demanded a bigger and better director. I could kick around a few names like 'John Woo' but I won't get too into that.Fatally The Specialist doesn't do right what it's supposed to do right. The camera work is bad I actually spotted one instance of camera shake in this film the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and badly executed the dialogue is a bit iffy at best and is rather clichd at times and the stereotypes of Colombian drug lords are laughable. With the action scenes the extras just sit up waiting to be hit and are poorly put together in a way that you can see Stallone's next move as he wins the punchup from a beaten position. The dialogue put across via the recorded phone messages feels forced and they snap back at one another too quickly. The character played by Rod Stieger is a little too stereotypical and his pronunciation of the word 'you' like 'jew' can only be taken seriously for so long before a serious scene involving intense dialogue is broken up by a smirk here and there.What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points. Early on in the film a character threatens Stallone at knife point and asks him a question. Cut to a reaction shot of a silent Stallone and immediately the character asks the question again  not even giving Stallone the time it takes to blink to reply. This was very noticeable and good editing as they say is unnoticeable. One other incident is where Stallone sneaks up on a pistol wielding guard during a hotel evacuation and knocks him out from behind in the lobby area. We keep on the same camera and pan as he runs away. From this we see that for the entire time people extras have been running right past merely feet from the assault and don't even batter an eyelid at what just happened as Stallone runs off in the OPPOSITE direction.Every action film has its effects and this films' was poor. The blatant blue screen effect of the water getting closer and closer via the window as the suite breaks off the side of the hotel and falls to the sea as a guy waves frantically at the camera crashing towards him without trying to get away really brought out a long shake of the head from me. The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room one guy fell down before the other was also laughable. These are the action scenes of the film and should be suspenseful and nervewracking  not humorous instead.If you're looking for a decent Stallone actionbased film from the midnineties avoid this and see 'Assassins' instead. That film's particularly large cast rivals this one and the direction and script are a lot better.".

If you're in for a plot go see 'Usual Suspects' I'd say.By the way if you're being led by all the negative comments you'll miss the chance of yet again seeing Sharon without clothes.....mmmm! 8 out of 10 to push up the score.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have mentioned James Woods is the only really entertaining asset this film has. Even a good dosage of Sharon Stone in the nude cannot elevate this film above the level of crappola.The plot isn't worth commenting on. You just have a vengeful woman Stone hiring Sly Stallone to blow up a crime family who killed her parents when she was a child. By the way does anyone else find it totally ridiculous that Stone's character is a child when her parents are killed by Eric Roberts  co. but now she's supposed to be all grown up and he still looks the same? Totally laughable.Anyway just watch James Woods do what he does best. He goes way over the top with his portrayal of a former colleague of Stallone in the CIA I think now trying to help mob boss Rod Steiger hunt him down. Woods easily steals every scene he's in. He looks like he's having a blast with the corny dialogue.My favorite sceneWoods and some hit men are on their way up to Sly's hotel room to waste him. About four of them jump on an elevator and just before the door is about to close a couple of senior citizens try to get on with them. The man is wearing a godawful brightly colored shirt and woods not only tells him and his wife to get lost but also insults him about his shirt! You can just tell Woods adlibbed the line about the shirt just as the doors were closing on the old couple. Truly hilarious!The rest of the film besides Woods is terrible. Stallone never knew how to say no to a bad film and that is why his career has bottomed out. Stone bounced back with a big role in Casino the following year. Woods is also in that one and once again he steals every scene. At least Casino was good though!The Specialist is worth about 4 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.".

Also I missed the first hour so part of my brain was able to work at reconstructing the plot while I watched the eyecandy. I agree with the reviewer who said that it looked terrific Miami was beautiful and the colors were sparkling clear.What I enjoyed POSSIBLE SPOILERS BUT DOES IT REALLY MATTER?James Woods of course. I only managed to see Eric Roberts for about five minutes before he had that fatal cup of coffee but I liked him in their final confrontation scene. Then when James lost it on the phone with Sly I think he earned his paycheck in ten minutes of screen time. Too bad about that innocent phone...The sexintheshower scene. Sly looked and acted like a Classical Greek sculpture. I don't even remember what Sharon Stone looked like naked but then to be fair she was covered up a lot of the time. I do remember that Sly had better breasts. Not surprising that he has a porn background. One question does the shower drain leave a permanent mark?Finally I loved the small touches of humor and there were a few. I especially enjoyed the scene when Sly blew the Crab Shack and it began raining live crustaceans. You just don't see that often enough in today's films...So two out of ten with an extra point for being there when I needed it.".

But when his partner refusesand the bomb subsequently explodes and kills both passengersa fight ensues which results in extremely bad feelings between them afterward. The scene then shifts to Miami where a beautiful woman named May Munro Sharon Stone has request that Ray kill three men who murdered her parents when she was a child. The problem is that Ray is an explosives expert and doesn't feel comfortable with the job at hand. But after following May in order to gather more information concerning the task at hand he reluctantly agrees. Yet even though his assignment is certainly difficult what he doesn't know is that Ned has formed an uneasy business partnership with these men and he has been forewarned that Ray might be coming after them. Needless to say Ned would love another opportunity to get back at Ray for what happened earlier. At any rate having reviewed the basic plot I must admit that in spite of the solid cast this film turned out to be more than a little disappointing. For starters it appeared that neither Sylverster Stallone nor Sharon Stone really cared that much about this film and simply went through the motions. Be that as it may while those who like pyrotechnics might enjoy this film I must say thatgiven the quality castI don't think it lived up to its potential and I have rated it accordingly.

	schema:reviewBody "After the failure that was Rocky V Sylvester Stallone was officially off the Alist and tried his hand at comedy. But it was a failure for him being reduced to an atrocious movie with Estelle Getty as well as a movie that is named after the most coveted prize in acting Oscar. Cliffhanger got him back into the game though only for a brief shining moment. It pretty much all ended with Judge Dredd and Daylight both substantial failures in many aspects. But I believe that it was The Specialist that sort of started the downfall for Stallone after a successful year in 1993. While it technically counts as a hit so many things go wrong in it.Departing from over the top solo efforts The Specialist tries to steer Stallone in a different direction in this slightly erotic but mostly derivative revenge thriller. Twists and mayhem ensue yet it never quite does much for us to be honest. 10 years after a bombing that gets him kicked out of the CIA Bomb expert Ray Quick Stallone is in Miami waiting for his next targets on the orders of May Munro Sharon Stone who wants revenge on the men that killed her parents when she was a child. The men are made up of the Leon family in Joe Rod Steiger and Tomas Eric Roberts both who are vicious and cold blooded to May.Old friend turned enemy Ned Trent James Woods overlooks the situation though he knows that Ray can kill just about anybody without really trying. While killing some associates of the Leons Ray gets a little too close for comfort for May and soon becomes personally attached to her past. Despite accomplishing the necessary killings it isn't quite over for Ray and May who still have to deal with Ned before they can get away. Plus one of them is not telling the truth to the other so it will be a matter of who gets who in the end.The Specialist hardly represents the worst of Stallone but it's closer to the bottom than the top to be honest. An unusual film even for Stallone The Specialist is darker and more subdued for the typical Stallone film. Sadly that's where the film loses us in trying to rebuild Stallone's image despite him retaining muscles for a role that definitely didn't need it other than one erotic but hopelessly pointless scene. Moody but cheesy The Specialist tries hard to be a throwback revenge film but ends up getting tangled into too many webs and doesn't deliver the necessary thrills.Surprisingly based on a series of novels I'd have to imagine that the novels at least seem more interesting than this joyless action picture. For what the film tries to be in a dramatic thriller the end result makes it cheesy and depressingly routine for Stallone. The script mostly plays like a series of puzzles that never seem to make sense though the film tries hard to fit them. The only enjoyment you'll get is the many ways that Stallone kills his targets which sadly provide only some pleasure when they pop up. Without those bits of overkill The Specialist is an empty spectacle full of fireworks but no thrills.The screenplay wants us to buy into the various twists and turns but eventually they'll leave your head either shaking or sleepy though it wouldn't matter because the script runs out of ideas halfway through. When the movie goes through its targets it's as if The Specialist seemed to stall and just wanted to end with even more fireworks than shown before. Eventually it gets tedious to get to a finale that sadly is as big of a letdown as seeing James Woods and Rod Steiger being conned into a film made for Stallone and Stone. Woods does his best to inject the movie with life but even his hammy performance can't cover his lack of enthusiasm for the role.Woods chews the scenery and rarely gives it back  that is until Stallone comes into the picture. His lack of conviction hurts his role greatly giving us a character that looks good on paper but often seems underwhelming and lackluster. Stallone distances himself from being a macho action hero in The Specialist yet the look on his face makes you think otherwise. He gives us enough mystery to give us an occasionally interesting character but even he can't hide his muscles from becoming a distraction. The lack of background story on him makes us even less interested not to mention that Stallone isn't what he used to be.Stone fits the manipulative woman well but that's a role she's been known for her whole career. She certainly has the body and looks but she doesn't have the brains to pull off a part that Kathleen Turner did well in Body Heat. While her intentions are modest it's the plan in action that makes Stone's character less than believable. Steiger is more hammy than Woods here yet he seems less interesting because he becomes irrelevant in the long run. Roberts either seems too old or too beat up to pull off the beautiful tough guy lacking any sense of morality and becomes a distraction for The Specialist.Some of the action pieces can be fun but since they aren't the focus of The Specialist they seem less than stimulating to be honest. A few exhilarating moments are negated by bad twists dull characters and an atmosphere that's more tacky than mysterious. I suppose setting the film in Miami had something to with it for it seems that the cast had more fun off the set than on it. Barry's music is better fit for a romantic drama not something as mysterious or dull as The Specialist amounts to be. The Specialist gives a few cheap thrills but it simply never does much for its characters or atmosphere.Grade D".

Sharon Stone is also a good choice to play the girl since her and Stallone have good chemistry on the film. The mutual attraction on both characters is divinely shown by the two actors. Although a lot of people didn't seem to enjoy this film or even think of it as acceptable this movie is actually quite amusing. It is mostly to divert yourself for a while so don't expect a big film with deep dialogues.

Sly stars as an exCIA agent who is hired by a mysterious women Sharon Stoneto blow up the men who murdered her parents.  The explosions are awesome and the fight scenes are great too.

Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5 of his dialogue is intelligible though this is probably a plus given the quality of the writing.Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry. Her character is so unlikeable I cheered up when Woods slapped her around. Rod Steiger's accent which I believe is supposed to be Cuban because he pronounces you as chew a la Scarface comes and goes. James Woods plays a parody of himself this was actually the most entertaining thing about the movie. They show Sly working out and all he does are balletlike stretches to show off his bod and it was not a pretty sight. He is so overpumped that there are alarmingly bulging veins on every inch of his body visible. Stone and Stallone has a nice ring to it huh? have no chemistryduring their big sex scene they look extremely bored instead of aroused as if they are about to doze off but the only thing keeping them awake is to make sure their buff bodies are displayed carefully so they look their best on camera.  Continuity is terribleSly's character adopts a fluffy grey kitty which I guess is supposed to make him sensitive I was just worried he'd crush it accidentally but in a scene towards the end the cat is dark brown. I give a grudging point towards the kitty not being killed by the Columbians or Woodsthe one thing that I didn't see coming because every time Sly came home looking for his cat I expected him to find it nailed to the wall or something equally hideous. Woods does have a great scene a couple really where he does a little trick with a pen and some plastique to frighten his office staff. I also laughed at the way he'd constantly be yelling Shut up! to characters who hadn't even said anything yet.The movie is I have to admit one of those that is so bad it would qualify as one of those 'love to hate it' movies that you sit around with your friends with to watch and make fun of. Worth renting if 1. you are a Woods fan and find him entertaining in any movie no matter how terrible it is or 2. you have a free rental coming at the video store or both of the above like me. If you can't stand all three of the principal stars skip it by all means.".

This is hands down one of the most showstopping stunts I've ever seen but sadly there are only a handful in the film. Other bits to watch out for are the explosive finale where just about everything blows up and the short scene where Stallone takes on a number of bad guys in a kitchen one guy gets chucked in the deepfat fryer I like it!. Or how about Stallone's incredibly overthetop reaction to a punk sitting in a taken seat on a bus  he beats him up and chucks him outta the window.Stallone himself gets a chance to flex his muscles and worryingly veinlined physique here but not his acting abilities  in fact he's extremely wooden. Sharon Stone is quite alluring as the female lead and predictably gets to shed her clothes in a ludicrously laughable sex scene which sees the naked pair romping around in the shower. However the star of the show is the memorable James Woods putting in a great psychotic performance in the tradition of Jack Nicholson and Joe Pesci  it's just a shame his role isn't a more interesting one and rather clichd.There are remarkable moments here  a bomb causes an entire apartment block to fall into the sea  but half an hour could have been shorn off with little impact. There are far too many characters who come and go  Eric Roberts seems to be one of the major players until his sudden death halfway through  and as I said previously too much plot and not enough on the action side.

Stallone and Stone are both great as the leads and I reckon this is certainly one of Stallone's better films compared to the ones he's been in recently. You get to get away from the action side of him and see more of his personality and emotions which is good as we usually see as  the action hero. Steiger and Roberts are both decent as the supporting villains but stealing the honours from the rest of the cast is James Woods who gives a quite outstanding performance as the key villain.

	schema:reviewBody "The master of surrealistic cinema Luis Buuel changed his approach to the bourgeoisie after Tristana and his last three films are all comic and prevail through a mixture of pure surrealism extreme irony and the one consistent theme of Buuel's auteurship hatred of the ruling classes.Le Fantme de la Libert is perhaps Buuel's least accessible work since his first two films Un Chien Andalou and L' Age d' Or. It is a thematic continuation of Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie where the seven protagonists just couldn't finish or even start a meal. This is a strong metaphor for Buuel's view that the bourgeoisie is a dying class and that not even a violent revolution is needed to remove the bourgeoisie from power and wealth. They are perfectly capable of doing so themselves through their indulgence in pathetic etiquette and decaying sense of morality. Le Fantme is not funnier than Le Charme but it is harder to understand and this is exactly what Buuel and Carrire wanted after the success of Le Charme at the previous Academy Awards. In Le Fantme not even the characters are consistent throughout the film. This film is like a relay where one member of the ruling class passes the stick to the next and never comes back to the vision of the audience. They just leave like Buuel wanted them to perhaps but in this film is an important factor because it confirms Buuel's nonhuman view of the people of this class. His was a collective hatred and this film reflects his collective view of the bourgeoisie. The film contains absurd surreal incidents like priests playing cards while smoking and drinking parents reacting to postcards of famous buildings given their daughter by a stranger as they were obscene and a writer killing tens of people from his snipingposition at the roof of a building. The writer is found not guilty and the continuing mixup of characters two actors competing for one role makes for a very confusing narrative. Or maybe the story is just a mockery of traditional storytelling in film. Resnais and RobbeGrillet made Last Year in Marienbad just to prove that telling stories is a bourgeois thing and not necessary for modernist or revolutionary cinema.This film is actually based on a painting by Francisco Jos de Goya called El Tres de Mayo The three in Mayo and Le Fantme starts with a short episode of how Buuel depicts the incidents during the Napoleon Wars. But it's the theme of Goya's painting that Buuel is concerned with and this film is more than a mockery of the bourgeoisie it is also an attack on communist doctrine which all over the world only seems to take from the people what is was supposed to give to the people Freedom and also an attack on leftist defeatism. The glorification of the defeat is perhaps the modern Left's biggest problem which only leads to a move away from power. Down with freedom! Buuel's revolutionaries shout and the firing squads start firing at the dying revolutionaries.".

The bourgeoisie family sat on toilets in the dining room and producing crap while having a conversation is fantastic reflecting his opinion about the dominating class.

	schema:reviewBody "Luis Bunuel's Le Phantme de la libert is a movie whose episodes are only loosely connected because the watcher is a part of the society whose liberty and freedom is a phantom. Moreover it is man who watches this movie that also creates the story  not on the screen of course but in her or his mind. This is a movie that does never go out of your mind.The clue scene is in the episode where Margaret Mead's books are mentioned. And in fact since this movie deals with liberty and with persons of very different cultural religious and aesthetic backgrounds it is a sociological movie. It was Mead who gave the direction to the late cybernetician Heinz von Foerster's 19112002 work Secondorder cybernetics. It is called second order because this theory has an environment in which subject and object have a space of liberty. Only in such an environmentbased logic it is possible to reflect to oneself. And this is exactly what happened in Bunel's corescene The teacher speaks to his students that laws have exceptions because they are depending on man and man is depending on evolution. Therefore there can be no laws at all because they also stay and fall with evolution. And if they are no laws at all then they are no causal relations. And if there are no causal relations then form and function vanish exactly like in Bunuel's movie. But the most important point is that this conclusion is reflected in the movie itself. The teacher who makes this selfreflection moreover has much in common with Bunuel so for example when he criticizes the standard level of human life in Spain  as Bunuel did in an interview.Another interesting point is that the physician's name is Dr. Pasolini. Bunuel's movie was released in 1974 thus just at the time when Pier Paolo Pasolini started to film his last work Salo in which amongst many other marvelous events there is the famous or infamous scene where people are forced to eat faeces. But faeces play an important role in Bunuel's Phantom of Liberty so the English title of this movie too The teacher explains his friends how many kilograms of faeces a human produces daily and since there are so and so many billions of people on this world this makes so and so many tons of faeces per year. Then the teacher has lunch in the restroom one of the most famous scenes of this movie. And finally in his regular bar the teacher explains the girl who resembles to his sister that this sister died because her intestines exploded. This threetimes occurrence of faeces the mentioning of Pasolini and the insight that form and function must abolish only because of human evolution leads the critical watcher to a conclusion about the sociology of human life that is not too far away form that of Pasolini All mankind is able to produce is faeces.Although Bunuel made one more movie Cet obscur object du dsir in 1977 he considered the Pantom of Libery his testament. Pasolini's testament was the Salo. Bunuel still lived nine more years after his Phantom Pasolini was killed shortly after the postproduction of Salo. Pasolini was radical and consistent Bunuel still had kept his sense of humor the Phantom ranges under comedy at least officially. Perhaps in the end it was the humor that let Bunuel alive while its absence killed Pasolini. Or was Bunuel's humor gallows humor? He drank himself to death.".

The film follows many characters on its way shifting effortlessly and playfully from the central ones to the minor ones making minor ones the central and going back and forth from one time period to another. It opens in Toledo during the Napoleonic occupation then jumps to the modern day Paris. It could've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character  it still would've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity his inquisitive mind his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images his sense of humor his childhood dreams his fantasies dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do.

	schema:reviewBody "Luis Bunuel's final film from an original screenplay by him and collaborator JeanClaude Carriere The Phantom of Liberty befuddled me so much more than the other Bunuel films I've seen that I had to turn it off after twenty minutes thinking I'd get back to it at some point. I finally did and it turns out to be maybe not one of Bunuel's absolute best but it has many memorable moments in his twilight years as a surrealist master. The strange thing is about this film and I've come to realize it more after seeing Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie again recently my favorite feature length film of his is that there is such a line that is walked like a tightrope walker holding an elephant in one hand and a thumbnail in the other that one wonders whether this should be taken totally seriously or just with the general hysteria and crucially absurdism that laces much of Bunuel's work in his post Mexico period. Sometimes much like with The Exterminating Angel it's a little frustrating even once one understands that having no structure to the film is the point. For example in one of the segments that make up the film's loose structure a woman is visiting a group of Priests out in a house on the outskirts. Much of this sequence is rather serious dealing with a young man's lusting for an older woman the rousings and thoughts of the old priests...and then it suddenly finally breaks up the tension with an SM gag! This is very tricky ground that Bunuel covers in the film and for the most part he ends up pulling it off. At times I wondered if a film like this would work in other hands. It wouldn't there's a sense of pacing that makes the film seem rather serious but as it says on the back of the original video box it owes as much to Monty Python as it does to the oldschool 20's surrealism that got Bunuel up off his feet and into the cinema scene. Sometimes I laughed cause I felt terribly uncomfortable other times because there was a real payoff. But in reality the Phantom of Liberty is the kind of film where many times you just stare and go 'huh what'? And I mean that as a compliment.By the way the film also has two other interesting factors to note one about an infamous scene that did leave me laughing hard and another more of historical note. The scene where the rich people sit around the table toilets as their seats pants down doing their business is true absurdism at a peak of intelligence. The other note is that if you wonder if this structure has ever been repeated or expounded upon Richard Linklater's first film Slacker comes closest though with a much different tone and style of comedy. Here we get the upper class religion oldtime armed forces gotta love that statue slap the guard in the 19th century segment and the struggle between keeping with dreams or reality or both. This is the kind of film that almost puts me off with its irreverence but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stunned and amazed by the audaciousness as well.".

So I just wanted to establish right away not so much that I necessarily understood the film but that I consider one of the film's greatest weaknesses to be the fact that it must be intellectualized in order for value to be derived. There is a constant filter between the audience and the film caused by the film's all too transparent surrealist technique.I suppose a good example would be the scene with the people sitting around a table each on an individual toilet doing hisher business. One man retires from the table to go to the seclusion of a small compartment to eat. The audience is immediately taken out of the film while an intellectual process takes place by which the audience member will analyze what he's seen and figure out its meaning. Which is pretty easy to discern I suppose as he's basically talking about the arbitrary nature of social convention which seems to be part of a larger critique of social manners and behavior. The entire movie is full of clever skits like this.... sadly this scene seems to actually be considered a highlight of the film. It's not unintelligent necessarily and I can see that Bunuel has a point  but the film has very little or no actual cinematic value. The film's humor is not very appealing to me there are no sustained characters and the cinematography is reminiscent of a Jess Franco movie.Bunuel apparently thinks that his social satire  such as it is  will sustain the entire film despite the lack of story and logic. But even satire has its own internal logic whereas this film does nothing but debunk and present evidence for various ideas that should already by painfully obvious to most thinking people while providing nothing in the way of an alternative value structure. It's thoroughly deconstructionist and I just do not believe that process has much intrinsic value. I found myself sitting through so much garbage  for example sustained shots of a bird's head looking at the camera  that would need to be deciphered or translated through a mental process before they would have any value at all that's what I'm trying to say.There's a whole section of the film where there is a search for a missing girl  even though the girl is right there in front of the parents and police. Yes the scenes made me think about the fact that some people out there somewhere  presumably aristocratic folks who the director and writer dislike  probably don't pay much attention to their children even though they would probably throw a fit if the child was gone. But what a painfully drawnout and pretentious way to make such a statement!".

Sometimes one story will be within another and other times a character from one story meets one from another and the camera abandons the previous story for the next. There is to be sure a larger story and message presented. For example the first episode shows an execution in 1808 and the last shows a presentday riot where people are shot. There is a question being asked by comparing these two episodes. How much progress have we made over the centuries? Beyond the important points being made in this film it is highly entertaining funny and aesthetic. Part of what is amusing about it is that I found myself laughing at myself after expecting something specific and finding that I was making assumptions based on my stereotypical thinking. Also the way he strips characters down making them all too human is hilarious. One example of this is the scene in which the monks are gambling smoking and drinking.

Those are all responses to social norms being broken but their not real answers. This movie takes those ideas and other just as crazy weird and disgusting and asks so?. He takes social norms like the social formalities sexual taboos religious authority and the western justice system and turns them upsidedown just to see what happens.

They ask her if she has seen any foxes on the road. She tells them no. Next they ask her if she has seen any foxes crossing the road. She say she did not see a thing. Then the soldier tells the other soldier that there were indeed foxes because I had first hand information sir. Maybe it's the storm. As idiotic as this may seem military wasting their time and money on looking for something that is not there it is not far from truth in the real world. How much time and money did Bush spend looking for Weapons of mass destruction under Saddam Hussein? In the end of the investigation nothing was found.Bunuel goes on to mock our culture and taboos when the professor attends a respectable dinner party. All seems normal until the party sits on toilets instead of chairs at the table. Later he goes to the bathroom alone for a meal. The professor even goes as far to say that he had to cut his trip in Spain short because Madrid was filed with the stench ofpardon my languagefood. It was indecent. Bunuel points out the strict guide lines that we adhere to in regard to taking in energy or nutrients and excreting waste which are both natural bodily functions. Although this scenario may seem far fetched one begins to question the necessity of our customs and how ridiculous they may be at times.In the scene of the sniper it is shown how killers become famous and are set free. He is dubbed the Poetic Killer by the press and has a big court hearing where he is sentenced to death. Some how he is set free to enter the general public again signing his autograph as he exits the building because he is now famous. This has been seen in the news. Sometimes criminals that commit heinous crimes somehow are set free and kill again.Overall Bunuel does a incredible job of representing society's morals and cultural taboos through the actions of fictitious characters that serve as humorous symbols of our life.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was Luis Bunuel's final and most personal work which he completed while he was in his 70's. Bunuel was always interested in the surreal and dreams Phantom of Liberty especially. The movie constantly shifts in narrative beginning to develop some story or character and suddenly switching to another minor character as the scene peaks in interest the minor character is then developed in a new scene. Each situation is more ridiculous and surreal than the one before it. One of the early scenes in the movie is a creepy looking man in a park who shows some pictures to little girls and tells them not to show any adults. When the girl's parents find the pictures they are disgusted to find images of famous landmarks. It challenges our assumptions in a brilliant way the viewer assumes that the pictures are inappropriate and sexual in nature and that the man in the trench coat at the park is a pedophile when in reality the pictures are of buildings and landmarks. My favorite is the dinner scene where people sit defecating together at a table and individually excuse themselves to privately eat in a little bathroom. When a little girl at the table tells her mom that she is hungry her mom warns her not to talk like that at the table.The movie is filled with the sort of irrationality that is completely rational. It's strange twisted dream logic that shouldn't make sense yet it does like the little girl who is simultaneously lost and sitting right next to her parents who politely ignore her while worrying about the whereabouts of their daughter. And yet to Bunuel these things are completely real dreams and fantasies are a part of our individual realities so why shouldn't they be portrayed in movies? This movie is a lot of fun and is a truly surreal experience.".

Foreign films surreal films transgressive films love 'em. But they have to be done well. The Phantom Of Liberty isn't. If it's an attack on anything it's the most timid polite attack I've ever seen. It doesn't say anything original and it doesn't even say it loudly enough to cover up that fact.Also its supposed themes don't come across. There's not enough happening in the movie to hang them on! The content of this film is stretched nylonthin. Scenes are padded out to agonizing length either taking too long with the setup or belaboring the point to new frontiers in redundancy. Supposedly Luis Buuel and JeanClaude Carrire wrote the film by telling each other last night's dreams. Someone should have informed them that nothing in the world is more boring to have to sit through. If this movie meant a lot to Buuel that's great. But he failed at conveying why these ideas should be important to me also.But there are bright spots. A few good ideas and punchlines. But as I was watching I realized exactly what this movie really is IT'S A MONTY PYTHON EPISODE WITH GLACIAL PACING. Am I wrong? Think of all the movie's cleverest most surreal ideas aren't they exactly the sort of things the Pythons would think up? The dirty photos the gambling monks the toilet table the missing girl the celebrity sniper? The difference is they would have either added more material instead of just presenting the premise and then doing nothing clever with it or they'd have made the joke without lingering on the punchline until it was dead and buried. And the kicker is they were doing this same material four years earlier!Is this what it takes to make arthouse critics fawn over lowbrow humor? Add eighty minutes of tedium?There's a certain class of films which I detest ones that coast by on name recognition. If you watch a boring movie and assume that there must have been some deep deep meaning going on that you didn't catch because obviously the director is such a genius you're letting them get away with a lazy film. They might indeed have had deep layers of meaning sure. But if the cues to them are so vague that the audience has to go sift through books and articles to have someone else explain it to them it's the same as if the director had said nothing at all. Because if a movie is vague enough that the audience can't hope to even get a feel for the meaning as they're watching it then that's a movie so vague that anyone can slap their own intellectualsounding analysis onto it and look real smart. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and sometimes a movie with indecipherable meaning just isn't made very well. If you think I'm wrong then why aren't you defending Zak Snyder's Sucker Punch?Luis Buuel I accuse you of the worst crime a surrealist can commit being dull.".

Then an officer tries to kiss a stone statue lady and is struck by an adjacent statue's arm. The film then moves to present day France and a man giving postcards to children who he tells don't show them to adults. You see the postcards contain the shocking images of structural landmarks. The short stories begin and disappear quickly with one of the characters exiting a scene and leading off into another different location. The viewer doesn't have long to think and is suddenly thrown into a new unusual episode. Other memorable scenes include one where guests sit on toilets at a dinner table then ask to go to a small cubicle to eat on their own. One where a sniper shoots many people and when tried in court and found guilty is sentenced to death. His handcuffs are then removed by police who shake his hand and outside a gathering of people ask for his autograph. My favourite scene is when a couple are told to go to their daughter's school because she has vanished. They arrive there and find her in class the school register is read out and she replies then they take her to the police station. The police sergeant then questions the young girl about her height weight and so on then calls an officer in and tells him to look all over the city for this girl the officer then replies Can I take her with me?. Marvellous. It is all quite superb. It would be unfair to describe all the scenes you really have to see this picture and allow them all to soak into you preferably after several viewings of the film. A picture made with utter abandon and liberty. Classic Bunuel. One of his very best.".

Phantom of Liberty for the most part is quite a normal film with a structured narrative and some quite well defined characters What makes it brilliant is the fact that one minute its just a normal film and then a scene where a family sit at a table on toilet seats is thrown at us. Followed by each family member coming to another room to eat on their own. Distorting reality. Weird! Some parts of the film are so absurd they are funny. Such as an early scene where some parents look at pictures and deem them 'disgusting' when they are just pictures of buildings. Its very strange and humorous in general.The are minimal cuts in the camera work shots flow together nicely. For example a two shot may not cut to an over the shoulder shot but just adjust to it. A technique which I liked.I found this film to be quite oddly lit. Is often dark and light is used kind of sparingly. Odd as the film sometimes almost looks like shades of grey through its darkness.I'm guessing that the criterion version is the way to go I saw a version taped from TV about 6 years ago which was at times fuzzy and grainy. Anyway to sum up. A mad film that defies logic is funny shocking and engaging to the last perfect frame. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Not Bunuel's best by a long shot but could be the best place for a novice to begin.";
	schema:reviewBody "I feel the same way about 'The Phantom Of Liberty' as I do about Bunuel's previous movie 'The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie'. I think they are two of his most accessible movies and while I certainly enjoy watching them I think they are a little bit shallow and lack the impact of his real works like 'Viridiana' 'Diary Of A Chambermaid' and especially my favourite 'Belle De Jour'. 'Phantom' is even more episodic than 'Bourgeoisie'. Comparing it to Monty Python isn't that farfetched in my opinion. It's a freewheeling movie full of invention and sly humour. The actors are all very good and include Bunuel semiregular Michel Piccoli 'Belle De Jour' Monica Vitti 'L'Avventura' Adolfo Celi 'Diabolik' and Michael Lonsdale 'The Name Of The Rose'.  There are a few very inspired and memorable sequences in the movie especially the dinner party scene which has entered into legend but overall I think it's a little bit contrived and just has too many bits that don't add up to a particularly satisfying whole.  I think that 'The Phantom Of Liberty'  might be the easiest way for a novice to get into Bunuel but it's not his best movie by a long shot. Try instead the three I mentioned earlier and 'The Exterminating Angel'. Still even average Bunuel is better than 99 of the mediocre crud around these days so despite some reservations it comes with my recommendation.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I watched this movie I was as confused as ever. This movie is about surreality in its greatest measure. Things that you never thought would or could happened in real life did happen in this movie. And it is to a hundred percent true that it could happened but as it did it in front of my eyes I was as confused as ever. I'm not a very big fan of surrealism as it appears in this movie because it made me a little upset to see how things happened that was not suppose to happened and people accepted it instead of trying to fix it. For example in one scene a man get rewarded for his actions which are completely out of order and actions that he should have been convicted for instead of rewarded for. Not a movie I would watch again of recommend for someone else but worth seeing if you're interested in weird events at its highest point.".

The integration of unexpected shifts  sometimes cinematic and selfdescribed as surreal are the foundation for films that matter to me. It is just that I feel his concerns are trivial that the focus on a critique of society with the critique being as flawed as superficial.There is one quality of this film in particular that I would like to recommend the seamless continuity across many episodes and characters. I don't know if it originated with him but it is now widely used to escape the constraints of a single character and give us larger long form.It allows humor and puzzlement to be spread as comment.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".
