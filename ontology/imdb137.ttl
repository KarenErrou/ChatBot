In here Kiarostami proves he is not only a talented writer and director but also succeeds as a narrator. There are a couple good moments in here but I personally think it may have been better and more essential at 15 minutes max. Kiarostami uses dogs again in here just like in some of his older films especially the very early short films. The good thing is that this film never seems pretentious but it never seems too relevant either. It is one of these films that probably has a much bigger impact on the big screen but seeing it there is almost impossible these days. I cannot recommend Roads of Kiarostami. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "This criminally neglected film has a lot going for it and is certainly well worth tracking down! The comparisons to the Alfred Hitchcock classic 'Psycho' are obvious due to the fact that the film stars Norman Bates actor Anthony Perkins in another offcentre performance but other than that Pretty Poison is a law unto itself and not quite like any other film that I've seen. The first thing that struck me about this film was the cinematography the film somehow manages to look old and dated yet beautiful at the same time. The fact that it's set in a serene little town does it some favours also but it's the plot that is the biggest standout here. Anthony Perkins is Dennis Pitt a mentally disturbed man who is given a job in a lumber yard. He soon bumps into the beautiful Sue Ann Stepanek and she learns that he is a CIA operative working undercover and has chosen her to be his 'partner'. However that is not really the case at all as Pitt lives in his own little fantasy world and after the pair slip up with a murder they find themselves under suspicion.Anthony Perkins may not be the most diverse actor ever to grace the silver screen but he certainly plays the disturbed young man well! Here he has the beautiful Tuesday Weld as his costar and the two performances compliment each other excellently as the pair have a great onscreen chemistry and the plot is always interesting enough to ensure that the film succeeds. It has to be said that Pretty Poison has something of a low scope where plot and plotting are concerned but this isn't a problem as the modest way that the film pans out is good in that it's interesting and also rather intimate so the film feels more realistic. The film is excellently paced and there aren't any moments where nothing is really happening. At just eighty five minutes Pretty Poison still manages to get its story and character profiles across in a way that is interesting and exciting. The conclusion to the main plot line is good and something of a shock while the ending itself is predictable but still works well. Overall Pretty Poison gets my HIGHEST recommendations and I hope this one doesn't stay buried for too much longer!".

	schema:reviewBody "It was great to see Tuesday Weld again and in her prime physically. She was a real looker to use an old phrase. Just seeing her was worth the price of the rental. Usually I point out the photography or the riveting story as the facet s of the movie I enjoyed best but in this case it's the actors and characters they played. It was also fun to see Tony Perkins Dennis Pitt play his Norman Batestype Pyscho character again although I prefer Bates over Pitt. At least Bates wasn't all talk like Pitt was in this story. Norman delivered the goods when needed! Here Weld's Sue Ann Stepanek walks the talk. Tuesday Weld by the way proves in this film she's a lot more than a pretty face. She also looked her age when she shot this film. That was 25 and here her role is that of a 17yearold which is stretching it a bit...but who's counting?The most interesting character might have been Mrs. Stepanek played by Beverly Garland but she really had too small a role just a couple of speaking scenes. I think this film would have been better had Garland's character been expanded regarding the exposing of Pitt as a fraud. She was just getting into that but it was never followed up. Before you know it  poof!  she's gone.The two other main supporting actors in here also played intriguing characters John Randolph as the parole officer Morton Azenhauer and Dick O'Neil as employer Bud Munsch. Randolph and O'Neill were excellent character actors for many years.For those watching for the first time I would advise being patient with the first half of this film. The story doesn't really have much spark to it until Sue Ann begins to reveal her true inner self. which is not pretty. Until then we just get Perkins' nutcase character going on and on to Weld about his supposed CIA connections. Fortunately as soon as this becomes tiresome Sue Ann saves the film by springing into action.Some reviewers thought the ending was unsatisfying but I had no problems with it since you know thanks to movie's final shot that justice will be served. Sometimes it just takes longer.Overall as most people observe this a good movie that has been largely ignored over the years. This recent DVD release will help but at this point I doubt it will ever been a known film except to fans of either Weld or Perkins or by word of mouth on websites like this. Sadly you won't find this DVD at the big rental stores. You'll just have to take the word of reviewers here beginning with JSlack  who gives more of an indepth account of the film's characters  that this film is worth renting or buying sightunseen.".

His confused state of mind is exploited by a premature smart and amoral girl played by Tuesday Weld who is also terrific. The world this confused character had constructed for himself and which gave him some kind of self confidence and cockiness crumbles fast and leaves him a helpless quivering bundle.There are some quirky details which lift the story from the ruts of formulaic story telling. The lower middle class girl drives a snazzy powder blue Triumph convertible sports car the couple make excursions into the wilderness the Perkins character has a nightmarish night out in hiding with hooting owls red lizards and headlights piercing the forest. It all has a slightly surrealistic quality which reflect the character's state of mind and gives the movie a dream like quality. The dialog is also good  the best scene for me was Perkin's phone call to the local sheriff in order to report a murder. Check it out.In the final scene the girl meets a new boyfriend. I bet this is young Joe Pesci but he is not in the credits.  Thanks to the IMDb message board I know now that I would have lost the bet. Still it's a pleasant and exciting discovery.".

If you've never appreciated Ms. Weld before this is the one you should try to track down.  Strange story wonderful cinematography and sensitive lead performances make this one special.";

	schema:reviewBody "An insightful and witty script assured but understated direction plus inspired performances by Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld make Pretty Poison a unique experience.Towards the end of the film Anthony Perkins' character Dennis Pitt is visited in jail by his case officer Mr Azenauer played by John Randolph. Azenauer has begun to realise that Dennis is innocent of the crime for which he has been jailed. Asked why he doesn't protest his innocence Dennis replies with a classic line 'I've learned that people only pay attention to what they discover for themselves'. Pretty Poison is full of offbeat wisdom such as this. The story begins as Dennis Pitt is paroled from the mental institution where he has been for a number of years. Among other issues Dennis is thought to have an overactive imagination and trouble separating fact from fantasy. Before he leaves he is warned that he is going out into a very tough and real world that has no place at all for fantasies. Dennis travels to a small town where a job has been arranged for him at a chemical plant. He becomes involved with a 17 yearold high school student Sue Ann Stepanek played by Tuesday Weld. He attracts her by pretending to be an undercover agent. Sue Ann goes along with this pretence but it seems more a way of injecting excitement into her dull and restricted life much of which she blames on her mother.Alarmed at pollution to the waterways caused by the chemical plant Dennis plots a little sabotage. He involves Sue Ann in the plan but this proves to be the catalyst for her to reveal her sociopathic tendencies. She gets her hands on a gun and has a scheme of her own with matricide in mind. It is a reversal of roles Sue Ann now takes charge while the increasingly apprehensive and guiltwracked Dennis is no match for her ruthlessness or cunning. Their feelings for each other change with the changing circumstances. At the end Dennis is back in prison a far wiser soul with few illusions left only Azenauer suspects he is innocent.As the plot gets darker the film retains a lightness of touch  its wry humour helped by the great screen chemistry between Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld  although their roles seemed to be the stereotypes from which both actors were trying to free themselves. In Perkins' case it was from the neurotic arrested personality of Norman Bates that he had made famous in Psycho. Tuesday Weld on the other hand brings to her role memories of Thalia Menninger the gaptoothed nymphet she portrayed in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. Both their parts in Pretty Poison while not parodies of those earlier roles are beautifully realised variations with a twist. Perkins invests Dennis Pitt with a vulnerability and sensitivity that makes him the most worthwhile character in the movie especially when contrasted with the meanerspirited but more 'normal' people around him.Don't be put off by the 1968 date of manufacture  other than superficialities such as cars hairstyles and lack of iPhones Pretty Poison hasn't really dated it is still a surprising and rewarding experience that to paraphrase Dennis Pitt is waiting for people to discover for themselves.".

The sex is subdued and there is little violence. No computergenerated images. I wonder who had the huevos to greenlight this. Somehow I doubt it would ever be made today.Anthony Perkins is a young man who has just been released from a psychiatric facility having accidentally burned his aunt to death when he set fire to the house years earlier. John Randolph is his sympathetic but skeptical parole officer. Perkins sets up residence in the town of Winslow Massachusetts evocatively photographed by David Quaid in a flat TV style. You get to know Winslow  the chemical factory the river that purls through the town the modest workingclass home that Tuesday Weld lives in with her mother.Weld is the champion member of the highschool band and what a succulent piece she is with her lustrous blond hair her voracious and toothy grin her unimpeachable figure. She bumps into Perkins at a hot dog stand. Perkins is a fabulist maybe a trait he picked up in the funny farm and he sweeps Weld up in his narrative.Perkins pretends to be a secret agent from the CIA keeping an eye on the chemical plant where he now has a job. They may be polluting the river. It's his job to find out if they're poisoning the water. In a few years there may be nothing but monster fish between here and New York. One should not believe that the pollution is a symptom of Perkins' derangement. In 1968 there were virtually no laws governing the process. The film illustrates this lack of concern when the owner of the hot dog stand dumps his garbage in the river then stops to wipe some mud spatters from his motorcycle. Two kids in New York caught cholera of all things from eating a watermelon they'd found floating in the Hudson. In any case Weld is thrilled. She's eager to help him and wants to be a deputy secret agent.The plot gets complicated and twirled around but not to the extent that we can't follow it. If at first Perkins is the fake and Weld is the naif it gradually becomes clear that it's the other way round. I don't want to give away too much of the plot.I attribute the success of the movie mostly to Lorenzo Semple's screenplay which is full of oddments and stylishness. Noel Black's direction is functional  not more than that  but the story becomes so gripping that one's attention never drifts. Semple was also responsible for the outr and equally paranoid The Parallax View. After Psycho poor Anthony Perkins seemed consigned to the role of not just maniac but maniac being taken by thyrotoxic storm. Jerky and twitching and stuttering. Here he's merely given to excess fantasizing but is otherwise intelligent and well normal. Smart maybe but he doesn't know much about women and he's abrasive towards his dumb superiors.Perkins' and Weld's roles are pretty complex. They both handle the complexity well. Perkins must change from being slyly but playfully conspiratorial to being aghast. Weld has to morph from a gullible teen ager into a calculating young woman thoroughly committed to pursuit of hypothetical imperatives.It all comes together quite well and I applaud everyone involved. Wish there were more like it today instead of all those trumpeting mastodons and monsters thumping their way across the megascreens.".

The former never seems to age while the latter never looked so young and beautiful. There is a little of Gun Crazy in the pairing at first but the teenage Weld quickly shows her true colors. How my heart goes out to the young man fresh from an institution trying so hard to be something posing as a CIA operative or the like. They never warned him before they let him go about the spiders that inhabit those parts. The film moves quickly to its inexorable conclusion. Seeing the setting made me want to go back to upstate New York near the Massachusetts border where I lived. That town cannot have changed much today though the river perhaps the Housatonic flows cleaner. I can't rate this film high enough.".

I feel it never really got the credit it deserves as both Perkins and Weld probably turn in the best perfomances of their careers. Perkins is great in the role of a deluded arsonist who while on probabtion arrives in a sleepy little town. Once there he enlists the help of juvenile cheerleader Weld to help him in his schemes after filling her head full of his delusions about him being in the CIA. She of course is thrilled to escape her rather dull life and agrees to help him. It's interesting to note that Weld thought this was one of her worst performances when it's bloody obvious it is anything but. She is quite simply superb turning from an innocent cheerleader to an amoral killer. The range of emotions she displays is amazing. Perkins character of Dennis Pitt hasn't got a chance as behind her sweet innocence lurks someone far more deadly than he who ultimately goads him into matricide. If you can see it!!!".

All the characters are excellent and the story is just great plus Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld are simply incredible in this!. It's just so wonderfully creative and unique and I thought Perkins and Tuesday Weld had amazing chemistry together plus the ending will make you feel uneasy as it was pretty intense in my opinion. I was lucky enough to catch this on The Scream Channel and it's extremely well made and written as well plus it's so unpredictable you will never know what is gonna happen next. Perkin's character is crazy as usual but you can't help but like him and a lot of shocking stuff happens as well plus It's truly and underrated gem!. It would have been cool if they made a sequel to this but sadly that didn't happen and all the characters are very likable plus it's also quite disturbing at times too. This is one heck of a unique thriller that I really enjoyed as it was so mysterious and unpredictable Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld were brilliant and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Noel Black does an excellent! job here with awesome camera work great angles and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace throughout. The Acting is incredible!. Antohny Perkis is amazing as always and is incredible here he is incredibly odd and creepy yet very likable at the same time he had amazing chemistry with Tuesday Weld and as always was fascinating to watch he is just so amazing at these roles!. Tuesday Weld is also incredible here she is incredibly gorgeous unpredictable sexy and was just incredible this is a veryvery underrated performance in my opinion!. Rest of the cast are fine.

The highest compliment I can pay to Perkins and Weld is that they are simply believable and they are a credit to Lorenzo Semple Jr.' script which won the NY Film Critics Circle award for best screenplay. This sleeper along with four other 1968 releases Night of the Living Dead Faces Rosemary's Baby and RachelRachel is one of the essentials of 60's American cinema. Released without fanfare by 20th Century Fox Pretty Poison is rarely shown and the remake is UNsurprisingly inferior. The original is available on DVD and definitely worth your time and money.".

	schema:reviewBody "This forgotten 1968 sleeper Pretty Poison is an underrated classic. Directed by Noel Black who hasn't really made a decent film since this film is the story of a recently released Dennis Pitt from a mental hospital who's trying to begin a new life in the real world while still stuck in his childhood fantasy world of his mind. Anthony Perkins plays Dennis Pitt the nervously energized accident prone sapp that will be the victim to high school femme fatale Sue Ann Stepanek brilliantly portrayed by Tuesday Weld. Dennis after being released pretends to be a secret agent that's recruiting Sue Ann to assist in the sabotage of the factory he is currently working at. Sue Ann goes along with Dennis in playing out his fantasies only to ensure that she adds more havok to his already goofy plans. What starts off as a childish prank and most of his schemes are childish turns into complete collapse of the factory structure and the death of one of the security gaurds due mostly through Sue Ann's intervention. The search to find and question Dennis leads to his hiding out with Sue Ann's help. Between dodging his old doctor who's responsible for him since his release Morton Azenauer reliable actor John Randolf and being manipulated by Sue Ann to kill her mother a wicked Beverly Garland Dennis has turned into a nervous twitching idiot. He really hasn't the bottle to kill anyone and Sue Ann begins to use him as the patsy. What's interesting about this film is that the whole story of Dennis being set up as the sapp for a murder he didn't commit can be connected with the time of the John F. Kennedy assasination and the country's suspicion to foul play. It's the losers like Dennis that the country won't believe while honor role students like Sue Ann are looked at as nice girls. Sue Ann Stepanek is one of the few trully bad seeds of cinema. She has absolutely no morals or concience. She can commit murder and resume living as if nothing has happened. But she's also terribly exciting. She's sexually active she'll live out your childish fantasies and games and she's very clever. But she's poison. Incidentally the factory that Dennis works at dumps hazardous chemicals in the lake everyday. This innocent looking chemical which has a pretty glow is a toxic compound that is being dumped into the cities water supply. Not only is this just a metaphore symbolic to Sue Ann's character but I can't help feeling that maybe Sue Ann's Mother was digesting some of these toxins while pregnant with Sue Ann. Because Sue Ann is trully a bad seed from birth. An intelligent sleeper that never received it's fair dues. Highly recommended.".

Weld and Perkins are darn near perfect as the young couple from heck. And to think that the sweetfaced little Sue Ann Weld turned up at random out of a highschool drill team. No wonder Pitt Perkins wants back into the safety of an asylum. If she's the outside world we'd all better hide. He may be a James Bond fantasist but at least he doesn't straddle corpses in ecstatic delight. In fact he's got a social conscience when it comes to what his employer is doing. And that's the problem. He's got a sense of limits but she doesn't.So why does he go along with her betrayal of him. I can understand why he wants back into confinement but why turn seductive Sue Ann back loose on society. After all he's trying to keep mill gunk out of the stream. Maybe it's because unlike the ugly river poison she's a pretty poison.Really original premise expertly played out. No doubt the screenplay couldn't have been produced ten years earlier. The sixties lifted the lid on the exotic and this one goes about as far as any. I like the working class locations that lend both realism and flavor. And get a load of the stream that's used as everyone's dumping ground. No wonder the two kids are weird. Stodgy old Hollywood would never give awards to a movie like this. But in my little book I'd give oneeyed Oscars to both Perkins and Weld and a real one to screenwriter Semple. Meanwhile I'll never look at a girls drill team the same way again and you may not either.".

And that's the problem. He's got a sense of limits but she doesn't.So why does he go along with her betrayal of him. I can understand why he wants back into confinement but why turn seductive Sue Ann back loose on society. After all he's trying to keep mill gunk out of the stream. Maybe it's because unlike the ugly river poison she's a pretty poison.Really original premise expertly played out. No doubt the screenplay couldn't have been produced ten years earlier. The sixties lifted the lid on the exotic and this one goes about as far as any. I like the working class locations that lend both realism and flavor. And get a load of the stream that's used as everyone's dumping ground. No wonder the two kids are weird. Stodgy old Hollywood would never give awards to a movie like this. But in my little book I'd give oneeyed Oscars to both Perkins and Weld and a real one to screenwriter Semple. Meanwhile I'll never look at a girls drill team the same way again and you may not either.";

A wonderfully odd neonoir that's as cunning as a fox Noel Black's movie flummoxed many upon release but the underground swell of the cult enthusiasts has ensured this particular poison is still around to be swallowed.Plot finds Perkins as troubled Dennis Pitt an arsonist as a youth and fantasist as an adult he's just been released from a mental health facility in spite of his parole officer's reservations. Beginning his employment at a chemical factory Dennis comes into contact with young high school drum majorette Sue Anne Stepanek Weld and lets her believe he is a secret agent.

Dennis Pitt has absolutely no idea how not in control of the relationship he is he's beguiled by Sue thinking he has finally found a soul mate to share in his fantasies but she's pulling all the strings luring him into a web of chaos from which he is completely incapable of escaping from.With the characterisations firmly in place where both Weld and Perkins are on top form Black and his tech team pump discoloured blood through the picture's veins.

Although the remake in 2003 was excellent and had a tighter more involving plot than this film it breaks a barrier because rather than directly approaching the style of the remake and trying to live up to its success this equally grisly thriller ignores all of the gloss cinematography pacing and story that it was inspired from. Instead it goes back to the film style which made the nightmare in 1974 a more direct homage to the in your face horror that started it all.This story is in 1963 right before the events of the 2003 film which took place in the early seventies. Jordana Brewster plays Chrissie who is on a fun roadtrip across Texas with her friends Eric Dean and Bailey played well off of each other by Matthew Bomer Taylor Handley and Diora Baird.Shortly after the terrifying recognizable psycho Leatherface commits his first murders a cross story involving an encounter with some nasty bikers throws the doomed teenagers flipping across the road in a surprisingly brutal accident.After Sheriff Hoyt arrives R. Lee Ermy in another chilling performance to take control of the scene the nightmare begins for Chrissie's friends as she watches them get taken away in his police car unknowingly headed for the house which would become a place of torment and nightmares for years to ensue.Appropriately gory and noholds barred Jonathan Liebesman creates a tight slick and sadistic thriller in the eyes of Chrissie as she endlessly attempts to rescue her friends from a demented madman's clutches. This is a highly worthy and satisfying entry in the horror series that will make an indelible mark on your imagination if not already done by the seemingly endless spew of remakes and graphic horror films.".

Along are their two girlfriends Jordana Brewster and Diora Baird. But they're stopped by crazy Sheriff Hoyt R. Lee Ermey who is Leatherface's uncle...and the fun begins.Very grim and graphic with no humor and shot in muted color...just as the 2003 one. The gore is strong and disgusting this got trimmed to get an R rating and I can't say I liked it...but it did it's job. It scared me. I was cringing in my seat a few times and jumped more than once.Another plus is ALL the acting is good. Brewster Handley Baird and Bomer are all goodlooking and likablewhen the violence starts you really are horrified at seeing such great characters being tortured. Ermey is on hand giving another terrifying performance as Hoyt. His character is so twisted violent and sick that when he got a taste of his own medicine my quiet audience broke out in applause. Also there's good old Leatherface and his chainsaw chasing everybody.In some ways I applaud a grim graphic R rated horror film that pulls no punchesI HATE the watered down PG13 crap we usually get.

For instance Leatherface is one bad mutha...he's huge he's powerful lifts one guy up off the ground impaled on a chainsaw and he causes the ground to shake when he walks. Yet he hides in a car he can't be seen by a passing vehicle and his stealth like nature allows for a very stupid and very gory finale that perhaps gives this wretched fraud the only genuine feeling of originality it deserves. Its original in this...but its also very VERY stupid! This movie is throughly pointless. Hoyt wasn't the actual sheriff...well there's a shocker. Gee could a man in a dead town be pretending to be a sheriff? Or that Leatherface had birth defects? Or that his mother gave birth to him on the floor of the slaughterhouse as she was dying yeah this was one grotesque scene...I can't even imagine someone being proud of producing that scene...let alone choosing to keep it in the movie and he found a home away from home in the confines of the slaughter house? I'm of course off on a tangent here...but literally there is NOTHING in this movie...nothing at all. Simply put this is a rehashing of the remade TCM repackaged as a beginning chapter that simply was not needed.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was gore merely for the sake of gore. There was zero suspense knowing that all of the characters would die. The problem I've always had with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies is this idea that the state police never seem to come knocking after these gruesome deaths occur and the victims go missing. It's a kind of oh well we'll just overlook that one glaring plot hole but unfortunately it's a big one and just too big to ignore. This Chainsaw film just seemed utterly pointless based on that fact and completely insulting to average intelligence. At least in the 2003 film the main character Jessica Biel manages to escape. Every single character is so one dimensional and disposable that I didn't feel anything for the characters. What I did feel was sympathy for the actors playing these meaningless parts. I just sat there waiting for the next one to die and other than being mildly curious about what kind of morbid way they would be offed I was far from being on the edge of my seat. The first act of the film is by far made the least amount of sense and just seemed like filler to get to the gory stuff and chainsaw scenes. The subplot with the bikers made zero sense. There is absolutely no explanation why the biker chick just suddenly starts pursuing the jeep out of nowhere to rob it. Uh where was her boyfriend and what was he doing? At least in the 2003 film there were a lot better struggles and chase sequences and at least the setup made more sense. This film's ending was by far the biggest slap in the face of the horror genre. After sitting through 91 minutes of grotesque sadistic torture the one single remaining character is killed in the most clichd ways imaginable. This movie deserves to be banned  banned for being stupid beyond belief.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an idiom about the way a human being feels painwhen a surge comes it makes a brief period of time sometimes only a matter of seconds feel like an unbearable eternity. Sometimes situations like a pulled muscle or a banged kneecap are hard to endure without just a minor yelp of protest.The same idiom can be applied to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning a film that runs 84 minutes but is packed with so much gratuitous meat gore slime urine drool grime screaming agony sadism misogyny and outright misanthropy that it feels like 10 hours10 long extremely unpleasant hours and that's putting it generously. This is the most uncomfortable 10 hours I mean 84 minutes sure... I've ever spent in a darkened theater. The Beginning is not only a repulsive film within the horror genre which has been on a rapid downhill slide some are calling a renaissanceit could very well be the worst film I've ever had to misfortune to waste my cash on. Period. By the time the credits roll you'll officially know how Marsellus Wallace felt in the basement of that pawn shop.I have seen many horror films in my quartercentury on this earth from early blackandwhite classics '60s kitsch gritty '70s realism including Tobe Hooper's original Chainsaw '80s slashers '90s badness and a healthy dose of ubergory European selections from the likes of Fulci Argento Pasolini Deodato Buttgereit etc. I'm far from a prude when it comes to cinematic violence and it takes a lot to offend my otherwise salivating horror sensibility But The Beginning is absolutely wretcheda rockbottom low in horrorand film in general. If ever there was a case where I would put my stamp of approval on the protest censorship banning or outright incineration of a film into the stratosphere so that it may never be viewed by human eyesand I am usually against such thingsthis would be it.This is a film that produces zero scares but an overflow of disgusting artless imagery wrongly assumed to BE scary. Its villains are grotesque unfunny inbred sickos and its 'heroes' including 2 guys who resemble Christopher Atkins and Robby Benson and their girlfriends with less definition than their Gapmodel looks exist only to have all manner of beating torture and mutilation inflicted upon them. Chainsaws and other sharp implements are plunged into flesh in gory closeup. The Vietnam War is cynically exploited to analogize two characters coming of age and becoming men while suffering the torments of the savage Hewitt clan also given an unironic layer in R. Lee Ermey's war veteranship. In a slasher film where the overriding intentions appeal only to the basest most reprehensible urges in man trying to infuse commentary into the proceedings comes off as profoundly as a monkey reaching for guano.Like so many lowbudget horrors of the 1950s'70s the title of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a misnomer. The film featured a handful of deaths only one of which was committed with the titular weapon and even then only shown a few drops of blood the movie was an absurd comedy of sorts shrouded in a gritty documentarystyle realism that fueled the terror brewing beneath. There's a good word terror. Hooper's 1974 original is as others before me have said brilliant for what it doesn't show it created a terrifying atmosphere and utilized locations and techniques that made the events seem very real. By comparison the 2003 remake was slick overproduced and took the carnage of the title quite literally offering little more than a plot less torture show and Beginning takes that nihilism to a whole new level.This time around it's the subtitle that's misleading as any insight into Leatherface oh excuse meThomas Hewitt's madness is limited to a gratuitous shockprologue and vague flashcuts over the opening credits. The Beginning then dives into a story we've all seen too many times before. To those who have seen the 2003 version it's the same thing. And to those who haven't it can be summed up as simply as 2 young couples relentlessly tortured for 84 minutes by a family of cackling psychopaths.Seriously that's all there is. It's a nihilistic grueling and utterly unredeemable excuse for inflicting pain under the banner of horror when it is really anything but. If Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes company has proved anything to the world it's that he hasn't the foggiest idea how to scare people. Horror's recent shift toward hardR films where dismemberment and gore are the order of the day The Devil's Rejects Hostel etc. has been a thorn in my side as of latenot that I have any problem with these elements of horror but that few filmmakers know how to back up their excesses with a good scary story. The underrated Wolf Creek is as grimif not morethan TCM The Beginning but at least gives us a trio of realistic likable characters whose side we are squarely on counterbalancing the actions of the psycho terrorizing them evil is not vanquished but at the end there is a faint sense of hope regardless. The Beginning in all its proudly repulsive glory gives us villains who aren't served a lick of justice and heroes who by the insulting sickjoke climax have all met with the service end of Tommy Hewitt's 'saw.It's not an ironic sort of injusticeit's merely depressing and infuriating. 'Irony' in this case would be knowing that High Tension was threatened with an NC17 while this geek show passed through the everastute MPAA with an easy R. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning shook my soul with ragea truly vile worthless bit of cinema with no redeeming qualities. If ever there's been a reason to abort a wornout franchise this is definitely it.".

Not with better special effects or cinematography. But acting writing and suspense. Not once was I scared felt any type of suspense....anything. I hope you did I pretty much just sat there waiting for something cool to happen.The movie was pretty hardcore though. Extreme fans of horror people who have seen Untold Story and stuff like that will have no problem with this. But the average viewer should have a sweet time with this. You'll be sucked into it.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been sat here reading through all the different user reviews of this film and have really found a mixed bag. One minute I will read a review laden with positive feedback and singing the praises of the film. The next I am met with someone complaining about every single aspect of the film so to say that this was a universal success would unfortunately be a lie. In my humble opinion I found this film to fulfil everything I wanted when I picked up the disk and more. New to this franchise I was happy to finally know the context of it all. The performance of Matt Bomer Eric should be highly commended and this is no surprise considering his other endeavours. I have seen people complain about the colour filter used in the film but I actually thought that it added to the atmosphere of the story and enhanced the thrilling nature. While watching the film I did wonder how on earth it was going to end but I was more than satisfied with the ending that I was provided with. As I have the film on DVD I then looked at the additional features to find the alternate endings and I must say that the final one was by far the best. This is definitely one for gore fans because there is more blood than you can shake a stick at. In particular the scene when Thomas gets his 'new face' to become Leatherface is subtle yet effective. The scenes preceding this withholding some information I don't want to ruin the film are definitely not for the fainthearted and even as a fan of gore of this sort did find myself wincing. Overall as seen in my star rating I thoroughly enjoyed the film and cannot recommend it highly enough and will be sure to watch it again. All I am saying is watch the film for what it is not comparing it to the others. If you keep an open mind as I did you're sure to enjoy it. Happy watching!".

One minute I will read a review laden with positive feedback and singing the praises of the film. The next I am met with someone complaining about every single aspect of the film so to say that this was a universal success would unfortunately be a lie. In my humble opinion I found this film to fulfil everything I wanted when I picked up the disk and more. New to this franchise I was happy to finally know the context of it all. The performance of Matt Bomer Eric should be highly commended and this is no surprise considering his other endeavours. I have seen people complain about the colour filter used in the film but I actually thought that it added to the atmosphere of the story and enhanced the thrilling nature. While watching the film I did wonder how on earth it was going to end but I was more than satisfied with the ending that I was provided with.

	schema:reviewBody " MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS Well kiddies just got back from taking in an afternoon matine of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning  I got 4 words that best describe it BRUTALGRUESOME and INTENSE! The film is gorier  more unrelenting than its predecessor from 2003. And actually we learn almost from the start that Leatherface isn't the antagonist who got the whole grisly ball of wax rolling it was his Unclethe Sheriff wannabe played of course by Lee Remey. We are shown the wouldbe mother of Thomas Hewitt aka Leatherface giving birth to the deformed child right on the floor of the slaughterhouse where she works. She abandons well we are led to believe it was her said child in the dumpster behind the slaughterhouse where he is subsequently discovered by a hobo woman  taken to his permanent place of residence. From there we are shown snapshot glimpses of his early childhood I use this next term very loosely development. Fast forward to 1969 where little Tommy is now 30 years old face covered virtually all the time with a dingy blue scarf and of course he is employed at the local slaughterhouse where he's referred to in usually hush tones as retard. All is well until the day when the place is shut down by the Texas Board of Health for obvious  serious health code violations. The little town down in Texas is now a ghostville USA because of the plant closing and the only inhabitants left are the deranged Hewitt clan sounds just like Michigan under Governor GranholmLOL. During the remainder of the film we see how dear old Uncle transforms little Tommy from a mere butcher of dead animals into the chainsaw wielding maniac we've all come to know  love so well. And as a pleasant bonus we also are given glimpses into why the Sheriff is such a twisted wacko. TCM for what it lacks in suspense it more than makes up for with gruesome deaths intensity some gore  sheer madness. Wait till you see how the old dude in the wheelchair from TCM 03 gets in that exact condition both shocking  hilarious. Some of the scenes do mirror those from the original dinner table scene from TCM 74  others from TCM 03. So yes a little of TCM the Beginning will feel like 'old hat' but then again we're not talking Shakesphere here. I also think many will be surprised at the ending of this film. Is Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning as good as TCM 74?NO! But it does offer one thing I wish the original 74 version had done. We find out exactly why the family are cannibals  it has nothing to do with having the best barbque either. This film is a good not greatinstallment in the series. My only real complaint outside of the lack of suspense is that we are never really shown Leatherface's mug. I can't decide if that is a good thing or not or intentional on the directors part to perhaps keep the mysterious aura of Leatherface intact. Side note I do hope this is the last of the TCM films because I feel there is nothing left of interest to do with this franchise that we haven't already seen.BloodStone's Recommendation A good noteworthy addition to the TCM legacy  definitely worth a look.BloodStone's Rating 8.0".

	schema:reviewBody "I had gotten a break from the usual drama of my daily life and decided to go see the Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning TCM. Being a lover of TCM I was rich with enthusiasm when I heard that another chapter the beginning of the Hewitt family saga was about to unfold. When I came out of the movie theater I was very disappointed.I almost fell asleep twice during the movie. It had all the makings of a great horror film but it lacked the kick in the ass that it needed it was full of blood and guts lots of chainsaw action but the story line was weak at best. Toby Hooper the original creator of TCM CoProduced the beginning and there were a few scenes from the original TCM movie which were poorly regurgitated in the beginning. When I heard the phrase the beginning connected to another sequel of the TCM I got goose bumps at the prospect of a peak inside the mind of a truly deranged and abused serial killer and from the past portrayal of Tommy aka Leather face as America's favorite chainsaw slinging serial killer I thought this was going to be an intricate and very detailed account of what really made him the stellar man he was now not so much. The movie grazes the surface of what I hoped Tommy's beginning would have been.TCM The Beginning lacked the macabre scenes of the original which made the TCM so horrifying in the original film the house was a collection of filth human remains piles of bones chairs refurbished with human arms upholstered chairs with human skin etc. There was so much decorative and gory paraphernalia created by human remains in the first movie that just silent shots of this disarray made the audience truly terrified and it made movie goers really stop and think about Leather face's psychosis. Now you may be able to argue well it's the beginning but in the movie Tommy Leather face was already filleting skin origin not known and covering his own disfigured face to create a sense of normalcy within himself. The rational behind the cannibalism in the movie stems from the dying town only kept alive by the slaughter house that was condemned and shut down so instead of relocating their dysfunctional family they begin hunting down humans torturing them ultimately killing them and surviving on their remains. The film was lack luster at best.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the 2003 remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre I immediately became hooked on the Texas Chainsaw movies. When I heard there was a prequel being made I was skeptical like most fans probably were since remakes are usually terrible attempts to make money off of an original movie that was successful. After seeing this movie I can safely say that it is one of the scariest brutal depressing dark emotionally taxing horror movies I have ever seen. What makes this movie stand above the rest are the characters. Jordana Brewster Taylor Handley Diora Baird and Matt Bomer the four main victims of the Hewitt families brutality play their parts extremely well. The characters are certainly likeable and they give the viewer no reason to want them to die or to not care when they are disposed of in the worst way. Jordana Brewster and Matt Bomer are a couple in the movie and in the beginning of the movie they talk about how many kids they want and Bomer tells Brewster that he will never leave her. It's hard to watch good on screen chemistry like this and then watch them meet their demise later in the movie. It honestly made me feel bad for them they had their entire lives planned and by no means were deserving of the fate they became. The hardest scene in the movie to watch is when Bomer is nailed down to a table and Brewster is trying to desperately to save him. Leatherface is heard coming down the stairs and Brewster is forced to hide under the table that her loving boyfriend Bomer is nailed to. Leatherface gives Bomer a look of hatred then fires up his chainsaw and plunges it deep into Bomer all the way through the table so that Brewster is not getting sprayed with the blood of the man she loves. This is just a hard scene to watch not because of the gore but because I honestly just felt bad for Brewster knowing that her boyfriend was being brutally murdered right above her head and their was nothing she could do about it. Another thing that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning has going for it is that there is no nudity or pointless sex scenes for the sake of filling up the Rrating. This film does not want to satisfy 16 year old boys need to see nude girls instead it wants to scare the hell out of them. After about the second or third murder you can see the hope in Brewster's character just start to diminish. The lighting and camera angles help to add to this sense of no hope for the remaining characters and if you stop for a second and put yourself in Brewster's shoes you really start to understand how hopelessness she must feel at this point in the movie. Now of course this movie is not PERFECT there are a few minor flaws here and there I wont add them so that you are not looking for them when you watch the movie for the first time but in my opinion there are so many worse horror movies out nowadays. See this movie!".

Great character development for the very beginning of a franchise of horror films. But the dinner scene kind of reminded me of the original 1974 version. Seeing Chrissie tied to that chair reminded me of Sally in the chair from the '74 version. It kind of makes me mad that nobody lives in this one. But hey this is the prequel to come of a series of successful horror films. But it was also great to see how Leatherface came to be known as the chainsaw man. The thing that I enjoyed about this film was actually watching Dean pushing Sheriff Hoyt's face into the ground to do some push ups of his own. This in my mind was payback for what Hoyt did to Dean earlier in the film almost breaking Dean's back with a crowbar while Dean was trying to do push ups of his own. This was a great film that I recommend checking out!!!".

Part two and three easily make my top 25. Well move over sequels. Make room for your prequel.This simply blew my mind. There was absolutely nothing to smile about and that's exactly how it should be. I couldn't believe that the finished theatrical cut got away with so much brutality. I'm very happy for this fact simply because this could be the foot in the door that allows it to open all the way allowing us to see more 'horror' films  not some film to draw teens in because they're in some dry spirited family show on WB.First and foremost character development is the main vein to any film. Secondly emotional ties with the character is a must or else one is simply watching people on a screen. Most movie fans know that the slasher film or the horror film in general is laden with their share of cheese. A few giggles here. A snicker there. A shout at the heroine to run out the door instead of up the stairs. I heard nary a giggle. This my friends is the real deal. This is what horror is all about.This is simply a great horror film. Jaded fans can either admit the fact that this is ballstothewall horror  or lie to themselves.The main story was written by David Schow. Schow has penned a number of great flicks  The Crow and TCM 3 being two of them. I knew that from the mind of this demented horror genius that his ties with the story HAD to show if indeed he was to get ANY kind of credit for the film.I love all the TCM films even TCMNG but this is now officially my favorite TCM installment besides the original.To sum it up this is a must for all horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning has a major difference to the other chainsaw movies. Actually it carries a general idea of Determinism. Plot is typical a group of teens are in a road trip and  but this time we go through Tom's life and can see how he became such a monster. This film has been made for those people whom judge criminals people whom believe in free will. Just for a minute be in Tom's shoes. You are born with a strange kind of skin disease as soon as you're born they leave you in garbage container then you're adopted by a beggar cannibal family. you actually have nothing to live for. You are born to suffer. So if you were Thomas Hewitt what would you do? yes only to kill people gives you satisfaction. Now that life world and its people are cruel to him he can be cruel too. He has the RIGHT to kill the whole world because at least he feels a little better. I mean he's not responsible for none of the murders he has done because no one is responsible for his skin disease and miserable life. So every time you start judging Leatherface just remember He ain't retarded he's misunderstood. I can't really understand why people call this an unnecessary prequel. This is one of the most awesome movies I've ever seen. The 'Sheriff Hoyt' Character really impressed me. Performances are really good. I wish they have used at least one of Cannibal Corpse's songs as soundtrack The Wretched Spawn fits really well. ambient music itself at the end of the film was fantastic. There is also lots of blood and gore which is of course one of the basic and inevitable parameters of a good horror film.".

Ermey is a true horror star and really shows of here. This is a very gory film and those of you who can't watch much blood stay away For those of you who can come on in!!!  When i watched it i almost felt that it might turn me off of making horror films but the feeling of course came right back Leatherface shows no mercy! Just as us horror freaks like it. The thing that shocked me was that i heard that they cut 17 scenes to get it an Rrating? Then i'm thinking i can't wait to see what they cut. Hopefully the DVD will show us the goods. This might sound dumb coming from a horror fan of a long time but i hope they make another one".

BUT 'The Beginning' basically beats the remake to death...literally! While the 2003 Texas Chainsaw had some bloody parts and was very in your face the new one doesn't shy away from ANYTHING! i mean IMDb says that 17 scenes were edited to get an R...I still have NO idea how this movie got an R rating. Every death is basically by chainsaw with blood guts and screaming galore. My friend who I saw 'The beginning' with last night HTED and i mean HATED the 2003 remake. She laughed her head off. This one left her speechless. This movie reminds us what true horror REALLY is! The directing is amazing the acting music and scares are incredible and Leatherface is basically my new favorite horror villain hands down. Did you enjoy the remake? You'll LOVE this movie! I gave it a 10. It's good to see Hollywood at least trying to give us some decent scary movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "We went to see this movie last night and afterwards realized that the 2003 remake of the horror classic is quite tame compared to this. It's incredible how viceral horrorslasher movies have become for this generation.The film starts off in a slaughterhouse and a monster is born. The quick run up of how leatherface became a man during the credits was impressive. The slaughterhouse in which he works gets shut down. He's got to find some new meat to chop. He sure as hell does.On a road trip across Texas four friends run into trouble with a biker gang and as a result have an accident and run into the vicious Sheriff Hoyt. As the female lead Chrissie tries to track down her friends that the sheriff has taken to that iconic house of the Hewitt residence she's faced with many obsticles on the way trying not to get caught. She fails and the unbelievable begins.The movie takes the audience on an explicitly VIOLENT journey and never ceases to grab you by the jugular. The visuals are almost too tense to bare and the acting is fantastic by the lead characters and R. Lee Ermey makes you cringe at the sight of him and at the sound of his viciously demanding tone.Definitely a step up from the PG13 fare that director Jonathan Liebsman of Darkness Falls is more associated with. The story of how leatherface became such a monster is well examined. Also some interesting bits in the film to help one understand some of the circumstances in the 2003 remake are brought to surface.In conclusion if you're a horror buff and like your slasherhorror flicks to have no holds barred terror throughout this is the HALLOWEEN ticket for you. Be warned however if you were disturbed by the 1973 original this film gives the term a whole new meaning.".

You would think rich people had more selfcentered things to do like going to the mall or something. Anyway.... the movie as a whole was very good and realistic. And the best scene by far was the part when Masterson is dancing on the boat showing off some of that 80's break dancing technique.910 stars".

You would think rich people had more selfcentered things to do like going to the mall or something. Anyway.... the movie as a whole was very good and realistic. And the best scene by far was the part when Masterson is dancing on the boat showing off some of that 80's break dancing technique.910 stars";

I give the Masterson character credit for realizing the limits of affluence and attempts to step out of this world.

The description given on the jacket added with the blurb equating it with Memento which was a very entertaining mindboggle talked me in. Call it a twofortwo deal.Reading through the commentary left by others I'm troubled by the negativity being attached. Exactly when did it become a crime to invoke plottwists as a story device? The last I knew filmmakers such as Hitchcock and Preminger relied upon them incessantly. A twist in plot if carried off well can satisfy viewers and fire the imagination.Personally I find the romantic drama as a genre in dire need of a wakeup call. Films such as this one Closer Unfaithful Wicker Park and very few others are daring to attempt something original whether it be a more frank look at relationships a less clichd or sexist view of infidelity or a new take on the love triangle... and by new I mean new in both this film and Wicker Park. Rather than recycle Shakespeare Jane Austen or An Affair To Remember for the fortybillionth time the director and cast broke new ground.This is not a perfect film and really honestly who gets entertainment from perfect films? Admiration yes. Respect yes. Are perfect films fun though? That's an argument for a forum... I gave this an eight out of ten with two points off for those imperfections.

Characters with which we identify act in ways that are incongruous and we lose connection with them.At that point the plot remains interesting but it's almost as if we were dwelling inside the story and now we've been pushed out. We still want to know what happens next but now we're distracted by the distance between us and the characters. But maybe that's the whole point  that people act in ways we don't expect given the situations they face.It's a good movie and I'd recommend a viewing. As I said the acting is excellent and the plot is very solid  what you think is one thing may actually be another  but there aren't any holes. Just the opposite.It's just that the first part the love triangle is so engaging that some of the plot twists that follow are annoying.I would still recommend this film.

And it isn't just the clever story  there are other gems for example the Registrar's face when he explains that it's too late.

	schema:reviewBody "With all its portentous winks and nods to popular older films and flashy gimmickinfused directing as another wry reviewer mentioned this is a film totally for and from a young film student. Surprisingly director Matthew Parkhill was a British history and English schoolteacher before he made this thing. If it's any consolation the futures of English lads are probably a little more secure now that Parkhill is out of the classroom.Unfortunately for the rest of us he's now behind a camera making bad movies. Heavy spoiler alert warning Parkhill's insistence on camera motifs and crosscutting techniques might seem fitting regarding the great twist in the movie but once you take away these cinematic redherrings you realize this twist is TOTALLY unrealistic and not set up in any other way than flimsy jumpcuts. I won't be completely rigid here the twist is mildly surprising but these last few minutes do not make up for what is otherwise a disaster in filmmaking. In fact in this 90minute film the first 75 are completely irredeemable. The dialogue for supposed improvisation has been harvested from the clichfields. Lines like Were you the one following me? or This is what happens when you fall in love! sound like they are straight from some bad fauxnoir. And then there are the actors. I'll try to keep this brief Natalia Verbeke again for the supposed real person is the most unnatural in the entire film. She does little else here but look hot in a bra. Admittedly she is truly truly hot. I don't know why the fairly talented Gael Garcia Bernal attached his name to this film though he might know there is a rabid Englishshrieking female audience just craving his hunky Latin looks and an Englishspeaking role can tap him into that niche market governed by the Dicaprios and Kutchers of the Western world. Other than that his forced accent is it Spanish or English? sounds like Keanu Reeves's unintentionally comical Don Juan. All the while we get the abysmal staples of postmodern MTV filmmaking headacheinducing jittery camera fragmented narratives jarring elliptical edits with some dreadful British pop rock bands and threenote ambiance chords strumming noisily and constantly in the background. By the end it is truly impossible to believe this garbage would win any recognition at the film's Sundance mock Indiefest though the sad reality is that this film indeed garnered licensing rights from some savvy business exec at Sundance intent on marketing the bejeezus out of this thing.In other words this film does everything wrong for nearly the entire movie and then expects you to forgive it for wasting your time by injecting some kooky literary plot twist in the final frames. I could go on but I don't have the strength or energy for it. For those who watch this film despite the warning listed here don't fail to succumb to your initial impulse of walking out within the first twenty minutes as you'll save yourself the instant migraine. Good god this thing is bad.".

It's 1964 and That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie Pa. who call themselves the Oneders pronounced Wonders' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the OhNEEDers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson Tom Everett Scott works in his father's appliance store but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy like when Ringo joined The Beatles and the rest as they say is history.It's a lively upbeat tale in which luck talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside  The creative differences and infighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time and the reality of dealing with bloated egos adoring fans and rude insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers as long as they're selling records.For the most part Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful which along with the original songs some of which he helped write makes this an entertaining fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugarcoats the dark side of it all to a certain extent which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story and after all this' is the film he wanted to make and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to imply' as Hanks has done or to be explicit as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors especially Scott Johnathon Schaech Jimmy the lead singer Steve Zahn Lenny on guitar and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan Jimmy's girlfriend who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself as Mr. White the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry The Bass Player Charlize Theron Tina Obba Babatunde Lamarr Giovanni Ribisi Chad Chris Ellis Phil Alex Rocco Sol Bill Cobbs Del Paxton Peter Scolari Tony Rita Wilson Marguerite Chris Isaak Uncle Bob and Kevin Pollak Boss Koss.  What Happy Days' was to television That Thing You Do!' is to movies a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the Good old days' the better they get.  In reality they may not have been better but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion this is a feelgood film you'll be able to enjoy time and again because it takes you to a place you'd like to be a place you've been to before at one time or another in one way or another if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

There is a meanspirited dig at the Frankie  Annette Beach Party flicks and the readymade romance at the end is sugarcoated but That Thing You Do! is immensely likable.

I kept waiting for that stuff and it never appeared. It also has a nice sentimental ending. The story is a simple one about a group of average guys who form a band and become onehit wonders.Tom Everett Scott a young Tom Hankslookalike is an appealing lead and Liv Tyler looks very very pretty in the female lead role. The band in this almostoldfashioned musical is good to hear too. They are a throwback to the old movie musical days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Yes you hear the same song the movie title over and over but's a great song which is very catchy. The rest of the music is decent too.Speaking of Hanks he plays the promoter of the group. It's not a huge part but Hanks as always is entertaining. The whole film is and is refreshing to see.".

Interesting that 1 they're not really comparable since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary and 2 Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actuallyalmost enlighteningHanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct effective connecting film writing. The casting directing and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets costumes general look is a delight. The music is very very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine rock 'n' roll experience because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The precredits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload the moral which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishywashy sense. What is love? According to this movie it's that multidimensional experience which includes not just finding that special someone but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write that big hit tune and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith which put him off entirely. This guy won't ever get anywhere he said. But I patiently explained that he my friend and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy Frith gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits not just music.I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass I want to plug this film's attention to a timehonored aesthetic virtue Hard work. This film is a labor of love with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the muse of that band. Something I always marveled at was how the creative process people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.There were many many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way. If you haven't seen it and you love concert films check it out.NOTE I wrote a little trip guide to TTYD! which can be found at httpwww.ronazajac.comThatThingYouDoComments.pdf . Hope you find it useful. raz".

Unless you were of that age that time and particularly if you were a male and trying to force your grimy little fingers into a C chord on a Harmony acoustic guitar that was semi in tunewell you will not understand the depth that this movie has. This movie and I Wanna Hold Your Hand capture something that was so real so tangible but has slipped so completely away from any succeeding generations grasp that to try and film it's time and moment seems impossible. And yet Tom Hanks did it. I don't know how he managed to grasp the era and the people so well as I thought he was a little too young for that time period. He nails this every boy's fantasy with wit wisdom and just a touch of sadness. The cast turns in a spot on encapsulation of people that will be very familiar to any struggling band member from the period. Tom Hanks himself turns in a solid performance as a man apart of yet removed from the music itself. Men of his age at that time all actually read the Playboy philosophy espoused by Hugh Hefner and secretly wanted to be as cool as one of the Rat Pack. He did a super job of directing this effort and keeping the frenetic pace. All of this brings us to the music which for the most part is expertly crafted and I was surprised to see Hanks wrote some of the music also to remind us of the era. I enjoyed all the songs for what they are. It is homage which is not exactly copying but using the elements to pay tribute to the influences that shaped the music of that era. People who grew up in the 80's or 90's have no conception of what the music was like then. They can hear it and yes even appreciate it but they don't understand that it was rarely on TV it was not the background music for every commercial you heard or saw and radio stations that played it were decidedly looked down upon. It was not woven into the fabric of life like it is now. It was new it was dangerous and you had to search it out. You had to want it. That's why I so enjoyed this movie. Even with some of it's false steps and it's occasional heavy handedness that would over power the subtleties of real life I found this movie a guilty pleasure that is completely satisfying and an absolute joy to watch.".

Their band  the amusingly named Oneders win the contest with their catchy song  That Thing You Do. But this is only the beginning of their success story. In a blur the newly renamed Wonders become a hit  playing at their local clubs and then moving on to a national tour with Playtone records under the guidance of Mr White Tom Hanks The beauty of the film is there is no conflict just the excitement and exhilaration that the band feels as they become celebrities and this is can't be shown better than in the scene where they first hear their song on the radio and they are literally dancing in the street you can't help but feel happy for them too. Tom Everett Scott plays the charming Guy Patterson  the electrical store assistant who becomes the  band's drummer and a national sex symbol with his trademark sunglasses.  Lenny Steve Zahn is the carefree guitarist who sees the bands success as a huge lark and just throws himself into enjoying every day. Jimmy James Mattingly II is the band's creativity  writing the songs  and also its serious side. He sees the commercialisation of the wonders as stifling his creativity and is reluctant to sign anything to do with his music. Liv Tyler is also a delight as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye and the band's biggest supporter. The success of That Thing You do lies in the little things that are so easy to miss yet are the glue that brings the whole film together. Watch out for how well Guy's family react to his success and how the bands first drummer with the broken arm keeps turning up. Also notice how it is Guy that keeps looking out for Faye. It is these little things that will bring you to the film and that find you leaving with a smile and a desire to see it again.".

With one hit single they are catapulted to cleanshaven teen idol stardom. The band The Wonders could easily have been the 60's pop group The Turtles or The Beau Brummels. The film's plot is fairly simple yet it doesn't veer off into the typical VH1 Behind The Music avenue of excessive sex and drugs. Matter of fact they aren't even mentioned. Written directed and starring Tom Hanks That Thing You Do! is honest and easily palitable for younger audiences. It rarely strays away from its theme The climax and downward slope of musical fame. Viewers can also appreciate several 60's pop culture bones thrown by Hanks himself to a nostalgic audience of youngsters such as myself. Plot occassionally gives way to hype and music but that's okay. I was sort of looking for that. I really appreciated the The Wonders drummer relationship to Dell Paxton a jazz musician that's obviously a Thelonius Monk reference. Check them out jamming together during the third act of the film. Now THAT'S what I call truly remarkable music. The song that thing you do could easily have been a number one single in 1965. It's a simple hookladen piece of popcorn that's catchy on a near paranormal level. It was written by members of the modern poprock group Fountains of Wayne. One can only wish for more music such as this today. There's enough innocence in it to guarentee parents' wideeyed approval ... and just a bit of angst to attract the attention of hormoneraging teenagers the world over. Definetly an excellent movie for your shelf ... right next to your DVD copies of A Hard Day's Night and The Beatles Anthology. Also ... check out The Beau Brummels. Rhino Records has issued a great bestof package. One has to wonder if Tom Hanks had them in mind while writing the script. They had a few hits though none will be as remembered as the poppy Laugh Laugh. A true gem from 1960's rock 'n roll.".

The music is infectious I liked the song they played in Wisconsin that Lenny sang  can't think of the title and there's a lot in there that I still remember about having a garage band back in that era.  There's just so much right about this movie that I'd recommend it to anyone.  Another impressive score for doitall Hanks.".

That's not to say this isn't an excellent film  full credit goes to Hanks as writerdirector for crafting a vehicle in which he stars that he is not the star of focusing on the rise and fall of a rock group ensconced in British Invasionera America.'Not educating' because this film deals very little in the reality of the business management behind The Wonders' success. Sure no audience will sit through protagonists sludging through reams of contracts but an audience can stomach details on the industry process of promoting an artist because we see The Wonders single rising the Billboard charts but no one ever mentions how it does this. Hanks puts in clues but the dots are never joined  which might be construed as treating an audience as intelligent  whoa! let's not go overboard...The Wonders are drummer Guy Tom Everett Scott oozing pleasantville like a bornagain on crank bandleader Jimmy an intenselyfocused Johnathon Schaech guitarist Lenny Steve Zahn also pleasant  but unbalanced in that nonthreatening way we term kooky and a nameless bassist Ethan Embry a wisp of effete lower end. Rounding out the troupe is Jimmy's unappreciated girlfriend Fay the gorgeous Liv Tyler.After a few appearances and an indie single The Wonders make it see how EASY it is starving musicians?.

When Guy expresses how easy it all seems White smoothly purrs Well papers will have to be signed and you'll have to get me the master tapes... Suddenly Reality is served  you could almost see the horns growing out of White's forehead.Hanks doesn't serve up too much of this meat and by concentrating on the endresult of all the bureaucracy and hard work  the gigs  we are given a skewed view of this job. Seems like it's all just fun but there are as many rockers who attest that they hate their job as there are deskjockeys ninetofiving. When it's your primary income it's your Job  simple. And any job done well will elicit fun. Any job where you cannot cope becomes not fun.The band guys are perceived as financially secure by movie's end but a debut artist selling one single  even to Number One  cannot possibly recoup any of the money that the record label advanced to duplicate promote and distribute the single nationally. As most veteran artists will attest they had to wait for their fourth or fifth album not single to put them in the black fiscally. And The Wonders ultimately reneged on their contract which meant that any advances assigned as living expenses on tour would suddenly dry up. It's an intimidating debilitating legal situation that ensues  but the film sidestepped this issue. Rightly so.The crowning glory of this movie is undoubtedly its synchronized soundtrack. Very few movies including monumental awardwinning productions like Amadeus or Immortal Beloved pay this much attention to ensuring that musician's manipulations on screen match the audio soundtrack except maybe This Is Spinal Tap. Of course movies about real musical artists don't enter this assessment Woodstock Gimme Shelter The Song Remains The Same etc.  although the Zep movie has its mighty share of nonsync passages. When the Eddie  The Cruisers movies surged into cinemas in the 80s I was humiliated at the lack of savvy the filmmakers exhibited in their portrayal of the rock and roll milieu. A major musical flaw was the setandforget production value for all the songs making them sound exactly the same as if they were all recorded in one place at one time with one overall mix  which is what was actually done of course  but to bring some credibility to the movie the producers should have assessed the circumstances for each scene and mixed the music accordingly  which is what Hanks and his audio personnel intuitively did for this movie.Every single time The Wonders perform their hit the eponymous That Thing You Do the sound is mixed to reflect the type of stadium bar or studio they are in every single on screen frame of the actorsplayingmusicians is synched  Hanks specifically made his principals take instrument lessons before filming began  down to every single beat of drumfill on screen being accounted for down to the guitarists changing to correct chords in correct positions in sync with the audio! If Hanks was brave enough to cast Liv Tyler a daughter of Rock Royalty he must have had heady confidence in his team of editors and sound engineers for to fail at putting across the musicality of this movie with Steven's progeny willing to be involved in it would not allow Hanks to show his face in public ever again.Of course there are minute flaws but none worth mentioning here. There are too many trinkets to keep one sated Guy's fastidious father Jimmy's fascination with punning the band's name spelled initially as OneDers and subsequently mispronounced OhNEEders continuously the welldrawn band personalities the talented one smart one quiet one zany one cameos from Peter Scolari Hanks' old Bosom Buddy Rita Wilson Alex Rocco Moe Green in The Godfather Kevin Pollak the subtle romance between Guy and Fay who are not actually an item until the last few frames of film......and you'll never be able to get that damn song out of your head!".

I was a college Freshman in 196364 when the Beatles were first gaining popularity on this side of the pond and this movie fairly accurately recreates that period the way people dressed and how teenagers reacted when seeing their pop idols live in concert.The story grabs hold of a theme I am very fond of pondering both in real life and in fiction stories. That theme is the relative randomness of our lives the things that happen and then how we react to those random events. If we look at random events in our own lives we can see how certain unexpected things shaped who we are today.In this movie a group of high school friends like to make music one of them writes songs and is the featured singer. He has written That Thing You Do and they are about to perform it in a local smallpotatoes contest. But the drummer horsing around by showing the bass player how to jump over parking meters falls and breaks his arm right before the contest.Now that is the random event and it leads them to ask another guy in town who is a good drummer to sit in for that one gig so that they will still have a chance to win the competition. Then comes the rest of the influence of that random event the drummer own his own this is important decides to beat out a much faster tempo. It is this faster tempo that makes That Thing You Do a hit with the audience attracts the attention of an agent gets them a record gets them a contract puts them on tour and has their hit rise towards the top of the charts.If their original drummer had not broken his arm they would have just remained an ordinary band. Well as the story progresses they experience all the growing pains of sudden fame and conflicting priorities among the members of the group. Tom Hanks directed has a part as a record label agent and he even wrote many of the songs. Tom Everett Scott who was in his mid20s is very good as the replacement drummer Guy Patterson. Liv Tyler still a teenager was Faye Dolan who ended up traveling with the band. Her boyfriend was Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy who wrote the song and sang lead vocals. Steve Zahn was the crazy member Lenny and Ethan Embry also a teenager was T. B. Player the unreliable bass player. Another teenager just starting her career was Charlize Theron as Tina in a fairly small part as a flaky girlfriend who dumps Guy after an appointment with a handsome dentist. Plus young Giovanni Ribisi as Chad  the original drummer who breaks his arm.All in all a fairly pleasant movie.".

I don't recall the original running time but today's version must be 30 minutes or so longer than the one I've been seeing for years. At 235 it should have been too long but it didn't seem like it.Lots of times the director's cut is just a reattachment of footage from the cutting room floor and sometimes it is footage that should have been left there. I can think of a few exceptions Jacob's Ladder is one. Aliens is another. And as it turns out That Thing You Do is still another. The extra scenes which were cleverly edited out of the short version add a great deal to the story. They help to fill out the characters and explain attitudes.Some of the addbacks were no more than a few seconds but those few secondslike the cut to the cootie DJ playing the record after hearing it livewere like the end of a sentence. They made the first part make sense. Others like the group nervous and suspicious about their new manager not coming through with with air play of their record are doubtless part of the garage band routine. And more screen time for Liv Tyler can only be good.All in all I have to say the reedit made it a better movie at least for me.".

The sets the clothes the music and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like minus the politics and Vietnam. Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were garagebands galore and many of the littleremembered names of the genre started out as such. The Wonders in That Thing You Do! could easily be a number of bands that were a onehitwonder or two or three and then just disappeared from the scene. Nevertheless they all helped shape some of the best music of that era and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie. If you remember the early 60's fondly you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories. The depiction of Erie PA during this timeframe is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by. The music rocks the dialog is hip and the love story rounds it out perfectly. Buy this movie and then buy the CD soundtrack you won't be sorry!

He did a convincing job not only recreating the time but also the music which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet but as this film shows he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always Hanks does well playing a company man and Liv Tyler is quite luminousthough I could have done without the thousand kisses speech that was melodramatic.  On the down side I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still this was overall an enjoyable movie.".

Its sheer energy the ease with which we can relate with the characters even for those of us who have ever played in a band the beauty of Liv Tyler and the natural flow of music bring it to a highly enjoyable level.Most of all what makes it interesting is the quite subtle way it handles the themes of hope and disillusion Guy's hopes for a session in a studio Lenny's hopes of stardom Faye's hopes of everlasting love. But as characters shake away their illusions they are not left bitter or empty on the contrary this film shows that to work through this and it is clearly a piece of work enables them to build stronger and truer desires.Despite its agreeable lightness this film can thus be seen as a moral fable going somewhat deeper than the classic 'from success to failure' story. The acting and reproduction of 60's sets are flawless throughout. And two moments of the film strike me as unforgettable which is more than you can say for many moviesWhen the Oneders's tune goes on the radio for the first time Hanks films first of all the bass player trying to adjust to the right channel then Faye losing it as she hears it in the street as well. They both meet and go berserk with joy running and shouting in an exhilarating  thanks to the youthful grace of Liv Tyler  moment ending up in Guy's store where everybody just dances madly with joy. Rarely has a moment of accomplishment and sheer happiness been captured with such apparent spontaneity on film.Finally Hanks delivers one of the most devastating lines I've heard when he answers the egoistic lead singer after his breakup with Faye.Jimmy I should have dumped you in Pittsburgh! Which one of you butts said we were engaged? Hanks Same one who said you had class Jimmy.That's what you get and deserve from 'dumping' Liv Tyler  poor move if I ever saw one!".

	schema:reviewBody "That Thing You Do! 1996 There are so many great things about this film that it's impossible to single out just one. The script the acting the characters...to paraphrase that old car commercial who could ask for anything more? Oh and throw in some pretty darn addictive music to boot. Add everything together stir well and the result is a terrific directorial debut for Tom Hanks. That Thing You Do! tells the tale of a fictitious band The Wonders who literally become an overnight sensation after winning a talent competition and soon find themselves experiencing the highs  not to mention the lows  of becoming rock stars. The band members  Guy Tom Everett Scott Jimmy Johnathon Schaech Lenny Steve Zahn and the unnamed bass player Ethan Embry are perfectly cast as are supporting characters such as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye Liv Tyler Guy's brusque father Holmes Osborne mattress tycoon Boss Vic Koss Kevin Pollak downonhisluck drummer Chad Giovanni Ribisi jazz great Del Paxton Bill Cobbs with the best being Lamarr the hotel doorman Obba Babatunde. Despite Hanks' considerably large amount of screen time as the band's manager his role is restrained enough so as not to overshadow the film's young players. The acting is superbly enhanced by the terrific script the dialogue is razorsharp and at times very humorous with the funniest moments involving the conception of the band's name spelled The Oneders early on as a gag on the Beatles it's constantly mispronounced as The Oneders before finally being changed to the literal spelling. Nothing ever resorts to condescension explicit language or sensuality or forced comedy. You can't help but share in the Wonders' ecstasy when they hear their single on the radio for the first time. The title song never gets boring even though it's played a grand total of 11 times yet only twice in its entirety. The production design is outstanding especially Guy's father's appliance store where did they find all those gadgets?. TTYD is recommended viewing for any budding rock band or simply for those who want to travel back to a time when music wasn't polluted with countless notalent assemblyline boy bands misogynist rappers and the like. Finally we have a feelgood movie that actually lives up to that otherwise overused title. 910".

There is a sweet wholesome quality through the whole movie and it's mood is contagious. Definitely a fun movie to watch.I will say that the most interesting characters for me were not the guys in the band they were Tom Hanks himself and Liv Tyler who's darling here as Fay. I liked the fact that these characters were not over the top and were very believable. I wouldn't really refer to this as that much of a comedy it doesn't have a lot of fall down in your seat funny lines. What it does have though is sweetness. You may not laugh constantly but you sure will smile a lot.The main thing I was surprised about was the ending which was kind of abrupt and I really did feel should have been longer. I wasn't to into the updates at the end the where they are nows to me things were just wrapped up awfully quickly and I didn't expect the movie to end that abruptly. Maybe it should have been longer.This movie has a great reputation and I can see why it makes a nice view and almost seems like it's from another time period.

Getting the crowd going at their school competition with their catchy number That Thing You Do the Oneders get offered a gig at a local bar. The local buzz takes a few minutes to get going but soon their song is the talk of the town's youth and they decide to print the record up themselves. When a small time manager picks them up they get a few more gigs but things really start to move when they get signed by Playtone and manager Mr White. However with increasing fame comes the adrenalin rush of success but then tensions creative differences distractions and all the stresses of their 15 minutes.Acting as writer and director Tom Hanks draws on the idea of fame and the setting of the midsixties to create a film that is fun even if it never consistently has the depth that it needed to make it more of a memorable affair. The plot is the rise and eventual fall of the band  this is not a spoiler as the point of the film is that they will be a onehit wonder it is enjoyable on this level because it has much that is recognisable and easily referenced to the experience of real groups down the years. It doesn't make these references in a heavy way but mostly with good humour and pace only really towards the end does the script stumble a bit as it seems to realise that it needs substance to make a good ending and then tries too hard with too little. Outside of this though it mostly moves very slickly and made for an enjoyable watch even if it isn't that memorable. It was amusing without ever being hilarious well set in the period without ever having a lot of style to it and interesting without ever really getting beyond the basic pigeonholed characters goofy one creative one girlfriend of the band etc.The cast helps by matching the breezy feel for the film but they do tend to struggle when anything more is asked of them. Scott is a point in case he is asked to carry the film which he does do when it is all slick but the attempts at substance see him seemingly unsure of what to do. Tyler is in the same sort of boat but is still a good presence. Zahn is funny without being annoying Schaech has a clear character and plays it well and Hanks makes sure he has a good support role for himself. The support cast has lots of faces in there with minor roles for Cobbs Ribisi Theron and others.Overall this is an OK film that is enjoyably breezy and nice. It references well enough to be recognisable but it doesn't have a great deal going on just below the surface that it could have done with to really make it memorable. Like the Wonders themselves it is fun and slick when it is on but when it is over you'll find yourself quickly moving on to the next film with not too many memories.".

I compare them to other mid 60s bands like The McCoys Hang on Sloopy The Beau Brummels Laugh Laugh The Easybeats Friday on my mind The Standells Dirty Water and other American garage bands that had one huge hit  then quickly faded away.It follows them from the beginning thru their rise  fast pace of fame  the fall  back to their normal life again.This film captures the feel of being young  in a band during the earlymid 60s when there were thousands of bands like The Wonders in America that hoped for that big break  to get their 15 minutes of fame.";

	schema:reviewBody "Juice is yet another hood film that presents itself honestly and with a good sense of realism. It doesn't capitalize on anything but the reality and the dangers of growing up in a city lead by gun violence and senseless murders. In the mix of it all are four Harlem boys all portrayed effectively by Omar Epps Tupac Shakur Jermaine Huggy Hopkins and Khalil Kain.The boys call themselves The Wrecking Crew and are trying to survive with what they have in a dangerous town. They spend most of their time at an arcade or a record shop when they cut school a little early most of the time being harassed by the police or a gang in the process. One day one of the boys named Bishop Shakur buys a gun and convinces the other three members to come along in stickup. They rob the store and from that moment on things go from bad to worse for the boys.There is a subplot involving another one of the gang's members nicknamed Q Epps who is an aspiring DJ and has a big DJ competition the night of the planned robbery.Writer and Director Ernest R. Dickerson has worked as the cinematographer on various Spike Lee films and this marks his very first shot behind the camera. While Juice is passable and wellmade it suffers by comparison with film's made by Lee like Do the Right Thing and School Daze. It also can be compared to Boyz N The Hood another excellent hood film by John Singleton.I believe because of Spike Lee films and works of John Singleton is the reason why Juice has slipped through the cracks. It has a following but because of strong critical acclaim surrounding the other pictures and this one just having mixed reviews is the reason why this isn't remembered as well as the other films.The moral of Juice is great about a psychological change one person can go through in a matter of time the message about gun violence and strong friendships being tested. However  this is taken in a more clichd manner than any other hood film I've seen. We don't know a whole lot about the characters and we don't know about they're raised. We don't get the parental backstory which is what Boyz N The Hood was cluttered with.I'm recommending Juice for its morals its sense of realism and its subject matter. However the delivery is a little askew and the four boys aren't developed as well as they could be. This is still one more realistic hood film that many should make time to see but this film only reaches the level of average to decent while all of Singleton's films surpassed the above average mark.Starring Omar Epps Tupac Shakur Jermaine Huggy Hopkins Khalil Kain Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson.".

	onyx:emotionText "Juice is yet another hood film that presents itself honestly and with a good sense of realism. It doesn't capitalize on anything but the reality and the dangers of growing up in a city lead by gun violence and senseless murders. In the mix of it all are four Harlem boys all portrayed effectively by Omar Epps Tupac Shakur Jermaine Huggy Hopkins and Khalil Kain.The boys call themselves The Wrecking Crew and are trying to survive with what they have in a dangerous town. They spend most of their time at an arcade or a record shop when they cut school a little early most of the time being harassed by the police or a gang in the process. One day one of the boys named Bishop Shakur buys a gun and convinces the other three members to come along in stickup. They rob the store and from that moment on things go from bad to worse for the boys.There is a subplot involving another one of the gang's members nicknamed Q Epps who is an aspiring DJ and has a big DJ competition the night of the planned robbery.Writer and Director Ernest R. Dickerson has worked as the cinematographer on various Spike Lee films and this marks his very first shot behind the camera. While Juice is passable and wellmade it suffers by comparison with film's made by Lee like Do the Right Thing and School Daze. It also can be compared to Boyz N The Hood another excellent hood film by John Singleton.I believe because of Spike Lee films and works of John Singleton is the reason why Juice has slipped through the cracks.

'Q' is an aspiring DJ who holds fierce all his intentions to stay clean and away from danger.  Steel is a chubby homeboy who wishes for nothing other than to have fun. Raheem a teenage father serves as the levelheaded leader and peace keeper and Bishop is a hotheaded firecracker eager to start war with the neighborhood gang although these 4 don't behave like or consider themselves any sort of gang.  Soon enough trouble erupts when they rob the local liquor store in search of juice power respect and a war erupts between Q and Bishop. Expectedly Q would rather focus on an upcoming DJ contest but trashtalking Bishop has other plans.Dickerson's directorial manner is sleek and balanced his camera and editing preferences are not as out there and inyourface as Spike Lee yet he knows exactly where to put the camera for each scene the crosscutting police interrogation sequence is most dynamic better than that of The Usual Suspects and it predates that film by 3 years as well.  Dickerson also chooses to avoid the obvious route expected in these kinds of films and delivers a sad somber ending.  The film is stamped hard with the look sound and feel of the early 90's an excellent era of those urban films if you ask me colorful clothing an excellent hiphop soundtrack and murky neon lighting.  If this is up your alley I also suggest Bill Duke's equally powerful Deep Cover also from 1992.  It's too bad that Dickerson's further efforts have not topped this engaging premiere.".

The real beauty of this movie is found in the harshness of the world it portrays dark mazelike and violent and the way the characters both clash with and reflect this environment. Unfiltered and realistic we can feel the griminess of these Harlem streets starkly contrasted by the life in the young men that walk them. They're a crew brothers and they display a love only truly understood by those similarly rejected by society at large. Juice it's the goal of their lusts and the cause of their fall. In the street vernacular it means power and respect and is embodied largely in the simple possession of a gun. To take this path to take up this tool will hold dire consequences for every one of the crew.It is an engrossing pleasure to watch Bishop played with disturbing intensity by Tupac Shakur as his already thin shell of morality held tentatively in place by his crew erodes completely away... spelling doom for those around him. Equally gripping is Omar Epps' Q struggling vainly against the nightmare his world has become the judgment of the ledge looming in his future. As their world falls around them Bishop Q Raheem and Steel must come to terms with the choices they've made the darkness they have embraced and the consequences of power misused. Rakim said it best Let's see if they know the ledge.".

Unfiltered and realistic we can feel the griminess of these Harlem streets starkly contrasted by the life in the young men that walk them. They're a crew brothers and they display a love only truly understood by those similarly rejected by society at large. Juice it's the goal of their lusts and the cause of their fall. In the street vernacular it means power and respect and is embodied largely in the simple possession of a gun. To take this path to take up this tool will hold dire consequences for every one of the crew.It is an engrossing pleasure to watch Bishop played with disturbing intensity by Tupac Shakur as his already thin shell of morality held tentatively in place by his crew erodes completely away... spelling doom for those around him. Equally gripping is Omar Epps' Q struggling vainly against the nightmare his world has become the judgment of the ledge looming in his future. As their world falls around them Bishop Q Raheem and Steel must come to terms with the choices they've made the darkness they have embraced and the consequences of power misused. Rakim said it best Let's see if they know the ledge.";

We're supposed to believe that before the movie Bishop was down and then all of a sudden at the beginning he turns into some cold calculating guy willing to murder his friends?  Man please.  But Tupac had a lot to say but just didn't have it figured out he was a little confused.  And he got killed before he got a chance to raise up out.  But I think Eminem has some of the same emotional complexity and while he has the same deathwish kind've attitude the rap game isn't as dangerous as it once was.

So this is one of the few cases where I did not mind there being rap music. 2Pac is one of the few rappers I like and he sets the screen ablaze. Juice follows four teenagers from Harlem Q Bishop Raheem and Steel Epps Shakur Kain Hopkins who try to get power and respect they call juice. Q follows his dreams of becoming a successful scratchnmix deejay and deals with his love life while Bishop tries more violent activities that break his friends and the streets where they live. After a heist gone wrong Bishop slowly grows into an out of control madman. Epps as Q and 2Pac as Bishop are the main characters that were fantastic. Both are developed and carried out so well both were Oscarworthy. Especially 2Pac whose portrayal of an innercity psychopath was so original and so convincing he really deserved an Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. It is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. What I really like about this is that it is purely character driven. Those are the best movies to watch and the best things to read. In fact this is almost Shakespeareanlike. I could see making Juice into a Shakespearean play with enough modifications to make it seem more sophisticated and complex.".

This movie is kind of a signpost of the whole hip hop culture and is a reflection of the good and bad sides summation in the plot. Even what happens to Tupac's character is a mirror to what was to come with him but in a mixed up way. Bishop was nowhere near as spiritually centred as Tupac.There are some awesome footage in the movie that so encapsulates 1991 hip hop culture that positive uplifting vibe that seemed to dissipate within a matter of months into 1992. The whole cast is perfect for the characters. It's not an overly complex theme or movie but it's full of neat little dialogues good acting some pretty decent cinematography and fun aspects. Q's dedication to the DJ artform is pretty good too. I'm a DJ and could relate to a lot of what he was going through and even the DJ competition was pretty close to reality but some of the audio overdubs do not match up with the action. That's probably my only negative and most of my friends never noticed those glitches because they don't spin. A great movie to give a chance if you come across it. Some dark themes and it makes a balanced picture. A classic of urban culture of the 90's.".

Personally I would have liked a bit more depth into Bishop's character as to why he behaves as he does.

I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor you will be amused.The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion the best part of the movie. It was about time that the Scary Movie franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example when Reagan says f me and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says she won't even let me touch her! and the priest responds yeah sometimes that happens you have to give candy to the children or something like that obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side the movie also has classical but always effective teen humor . For example when entering the room for the first time he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180 and the always effective vomiting cycle. After the Exorcist spoof the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials songs Vitamin C and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene and the sex ghost. Scary Movie 2 does not cross the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes of course if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut specially on dialogs.This is in my opinion the best of the Scary Movies.".

But again like most brainless comedies I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with Scary Movie 2. I mean people are being so harsh on this film I understand I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie Anna Farris a surprising return of Regina Hall and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcisthilarious scene by the way Poltergeist The Haunting Mission Impossible Charlie's Angels and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry I just had a great time. Tori Spelling yeah she's a bit scary but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes it was gross but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes yes and very crude one's this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie you'll enjoy this one too! 710".

	onyx:emotionText "OK not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with Scary Movie 2. I mean people are being so harsh on this film I understand I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie Anna Farris a surprising return of Regina Hall and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcisthilarious scene by the way Poltergeist The Haunting Mission Impossible Charlie's Angels and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry I just had a great time. Tori Spelling yeah she's a bit scary but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes it was gross but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever but it's a decent one with your brain turned off.

It was great fun and total entertainment to watch and I have watched it quite a few times.The comedy might have been a little too overthetop and repitive at times as it seemed like this one tried really hard to please the audience when the first one just went with the flow but that is really how a lot of comedies are like even more so now than then so I do not see how this one is any different. Anna Faris pulls off Cindy Campbell's character wonderfully again and nobody could have done it better than her. All the other familiar characters as well as the new ones are excellently portrayed and likable in a sense and the movie has a high replay value for me at least. This movie was not a disappoint to me either because I thought it lived up to Scary Movie perfectly.There were a lot of funny parts in this film such as the opening song the Charlie's Angels spoof scene the scene were buddy gives back Cindy's book and the Cindy singing in the car scene. If you have seen the film you know what I am talking about and hopefully enjoyed those scenes as well.

This is a great idea but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place.Yet the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film.  Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty Regina Hall as Brenda and Marlon Wayans as Ray.There are several other new cast members such as Tori Spelling who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student Alex.  Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious.  This is a great movie to see because it's short and just something to laugh about so fork over the nine bucks and laugh your ass off.".

James Woods already gives me the creeps so the last thing I need to see is him on the john.Funny Scene 2 Marlon's character teaching Anna Faris's character how to be hip and she mistakenly beats up on some unsuspecting girl.Unfunny Scene 2 Chris Elliot's abnormal hand digging into a pie as well as a turkey. Nuff said! Funny Scene 3 Tori Spelling's character becomes clingy to a ghost after a night of sex.Unfunny Scene 3 Shawn Wayan's character impaling the evil clown from Poltergeist with his third leg.

Funny Scene  4 The spoof on the Nike commercial.Unfunny Scene 4 The wisecracking parrot pooping.I could go on forever.Scary Movie 2 is a lot better than most people give it credit for but it could have been a lot better than it predecessor. What kills it is the excessive gross out gags are focused on more than the movie that its supposed to poke fun at. All in all it was a good spoof not a great spoof.

And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good right? I mean with seven writers it would have to be extremely goodor very very bad. Unfortunately it is the latter and the movie is Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teenhorror spoof Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties parodies or even big laughs the original film did. Instead it digresses to overtly sexual and grossout humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.The story line is actually a little more involved for Scary Movie 2' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous laugh scenes' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment though we never really understand what that experiment is all about. Of course this group contains most of the kids from the first Scary Movie' including innocent Cindy Anna Faris loudmouthed Brenda Regina Hall marijuanaobsessed Shorty Marlon Wayans and sexually questionable Ray Shawn Wayans. New this time is straightarrow Clark Christopher Masterson.  The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson Chris Elliot and even a ghost Night Court's' Richard Moll. The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house and make every bodily function sexually oriented inappropriate joke along the way.There are those who complain about this style of humor in general and therefor will not see this movie. However sometimes it works such as in the original Scary Movie' American Pie' and even at the far end of the scale There's Something About Mary.' There the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about or there are other types of humor going on as well. However Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the grossout humor Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit feces and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.There are a few laughs that harked back to Scary Movie' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the grossout stuff.As for performances the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teenage counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first Scary Movie' but nowhere near as funny. Plus she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this. If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel and I mean bottom! then check out Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself you managed to escape this waste of a sequel.".

Alas even geniuses make mistakes.The movie begins with promise.  I liked The Exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag.  Now that's Wayansquality material.  But other than that I can only think of two other times I laughed 1 when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him.  Meanwhile he's saying It was just a booty call!!  That was kinda funny.  2 The Save the Last Dance parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves.  But even the shortlived giggles are no match for the sidesplitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.The rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap grossout gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone.  For example in Scary Movie I several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay.  This was hilarious.  But in Scary Movie II the whole penisstrangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mindnumbing and incredibly unfunny.  This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor alone doesn't take a movie very far.  This was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately.  As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.".

Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah Shorty still smokes weed the gay guy is still gay Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line.

The sequel although it admirably attempts to separate itself from the first one would've been better off sticking with the old formula. First off the new characters were incredibly mundane and unentertaining. Tori Spelling's role as a ditz was terrible. Getting it on with a ghost was absolutely pathetic. Some of the bathroom humor which is something I normally don't mind was used to such extremes that the first 5 minutes of the movie ruined any chance of it getting off the ground. The rest feels so rushed and it seems that no thought was put into the script. The writers tried to create some new material rather than making fun of current moviesI won't spoil the story for ya but everything sounded insanely immature and insulting. Throwing ideas in a hat and randomly picking one was the name of the game here and it got ugly. Speaking of parodies the few redeeming parts such as the Nike basketball commercial ripoff and the scenes with the parrot were sufficient to prevent this film from making an alltime worst movie list but that's hardly a compliment.

Scary Movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid.The ExorcistAmityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.Now I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where I had basically seen them all.  But bad comedy is still bad comedy.Something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes.  Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.Also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again.  For example the talking bird.  Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying.  The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson Chris Elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie.  For example the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy Anna Faris was funny in Scary Movie because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her.  But this time around it was out of place and not funny.The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around.  The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.But I did enjoy Shorty Marlon Wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film.  The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.Don't get me wrong I love the Wayans family and their humor.  That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.".

He walks into the room with The Exorcist girl she spins her head around and he takes one look and says Fk this! And walks out I actually laughed at that part. The rest of the humor is just horribly crude and rarely funny. The movie is just one big spoof on many different movies done very poorly. Both of these traits can be very good if done correctly crude humor is funny in the hands of the Farrelly brothers. Spoofs are funny in the hands of David Zucker. But unfortunatly neither is funny in the hands of the Wayans brothers.I can't recommend this movie to anyone except for the most immensely immature and perverted. On a scale of 110 I give Scary Movie 2 a 3.".

Throw into the mix another coworker of Marcus named Angela Halle Berry who is nuts about him but he doesn't know she's alive. Everything works here and it is so refreshing to see a movie with a predominately black cast where the characters are people with brains and real jobs. Murphy exudes mass amounts of sex appeal in one of his best roles and Halle Berry though allegedly playing a plain Jane just couldn't come off that way if she tried. There are some wonderful comic bits contributed along the way by Grace Jones Geoffrey Holder Tisha Campbell and the legendary Eartha Kitt memorable as an aging cosmetics queen with the hots for Marcus.

Eddie really surprised me with his ability to write a story that actually had me touched. He is especially good as a player who gets played but actually falls in love. Murphy has shown a different side to him here and it is also one of his funnier films in quite some time. He is assisted in the comedy department here by two very funny guys David Allan Grier and Martin Lawrence the latter stealing every scene he is in.Martin Lawrence has never been as funny as he was in this film. He was great in Bad Boys but his supporting turn here as Gerard is a classic. There is a true camaraderie here between the three friends Murphy Lawrence and Grier and their conversation and actions around one another has the easy flow that longtime friends exhibit. They play jokes on each other they make fun of each other and they are supportive of one another. But Lawrence has all the funny lines. From burning his dinner when his friends come over to his hilarious observations about racism the game of pool is racist because the white ball knocks the  out of all the coloured balls including the black one to defending his unfortunate lack of lovemaking in the last few years his interpretation of Tyler is just perfect.Boomerang is also blessed with a truly mellifluous soundtrack. With P.M. Dawn and Boyz To Men among many of the stars lending tracks to the film it reminds me of the soundtrack to Last American Virgin in the sense that there are so many of today's superstars of music on the soundtrack. With Babyface producing this is another winning production from him.Boomerang solidifies Eddie Murphy's return to the king of comedy. He did rebound nicely after this film and it is good to see him going back to what he knows. A very very funny film.910".

Actually the movie itself doesn't know otherwise it could've been more coherent enjoyable and complete.OK it's a story of a man who sells everything until he himself becomes a merchandise to be sold. And as a romance supposedly romance ! the movie pushes this lead to learn about himself as lost person without real love in his life. BUT this movie so lousily sinks itself in a lot of details uncomic characters many conversations before hitting the right nerve.It was too late for Halle Berry to discover that she loves Eddie Murphy or that he loves her it seemed a desperate attempt for making a third act more than being the movie's main core for god's sake! Not to mention the matter of so ugly Robin Givens on screen portraying a femme fatale as well ??!! The inhumanly dreadful sight of Grace Jones who's one of a few emetic people I've watched in my entire life. The long conversations scenes which with the tepid nearly dead direction so the truly dull pace the whole thing looked close to pointless for most of the time. Many characters like the mailboy Chris Rock the mad model the French artistic director the olddeceived neighbor the friend's parents or even the annoying employee of the clothes store all of them took more time on the screen than what the original story any original story did take or should've taken.I pitied the charming and talented young Berry. Although she was a perfect princess of innocence but this dumb script and that endless digressions wasted her utterly. The movie didn't give her space to appear right or to appear right as someone would love the lead she advised him how to seduce her boss by Jazz !?. I think that it must've been clear to her so somehow us how she got something for him from the very start and how she must take over the screen at least since the second half. Instead of that they threw some real naive stuff to her like the clueless first dialog between her and Murphy and treated her like minor character the heroine's sidekick all along to suddenly remember her just before the very end! Although the intense performance that she delivered at the scene of her emotional explosion was the best most strong anything of this movie.. still one of the worst movies she was in!After many hits in the field of action and comedy why not Eddie Murphy takes on romance. It was a bold attempt. Yes he's a good actor along with being big star but the movie wasn't that good the word is  broken up. I think it got something with Murphy himself as the story's writer and maybe his fear that the movie could be just romance without comedy to end up as jammed comedy with notreallaughs that belated the romance if not suffocated it. I loved a few of his moments here on their top of course is the shot in which he finds the money for his fatigue besides the bed from his female version who's now treating him like a whore notice how Murphy  silently  pulls the sheets on his chest sad with weak feminine look in his eyes actually with wicked little reactions he mastered like these he's one of few comedians who can make comedy brilliantly with or without talking.Anyhow it seemed like many incomplete movies in one or boring stray comedy. I know that it could've been nice romantic comedy but what I've watched was an ideal example for underdeveloped one or a movie with dysfunctional personality. I read opinions about Boomerang as smart movie please it's anything but smart! P.S  at one scene when the lead was being dumped we see the lights go off at the top of one skyscraper. At later scene when the lead hugs his friends we see the lights go on at the same skyscraper !??... Naaa.. Don't bother it's part of this movie's naivety !".

And once again they got a fine supporting cast accompanying them like Lela Rochon having previously appeared in Murphy's Harlem Nights Robin Givens Martin Lawrence David Alan Grier Chris Rock Grace Jones Eartha Kitt and a newcomer named Halle Berry. Oh and Tisha Campbell also appeared before her teaming with Lawrence in his upcomimg series Martin. This time the director picked was Reginald Hudlin with his brother Warrington as coproducer after their success with their debut feature House Party. Like Coming to America this was a nice change of pace for Murphy from his previous wiseass characters but with both funny and touching scenes. Really I had a good time watching this. So on that note I highly recommend Boomerang. Oh and the person who played a commercial editor looked familiar so I looked at the cast list and found out he was played by the one and only Melvin Van Peebles!".

Boomerang has got to be one of the poorest excuses for a movie that I've ever seen. It's just another movie where Eddie Murphy plays a successful man looking for a way to bed a beautiful woman. Otherwise almost nothing happens in it. It was so bad that I didn't even bother to watch the whole thing and usually I'm very patient with movies I even watched a stinker like Town  Country the whole way through. I don't care that this movie gave David Alan Grier Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock early appearances or that Grace Jones actually manages to elicit a few giggles. You will do FAR BETTER to just avoid this movie at all costs.".

Eddie Murphy is handsome and debonair in this movie role. Martin Lawrence is hysterical. David Allen Grier plays a convincing straight man with his dorky clothes and the uncomfortable way he deals with Halle Berry. Eddie's parents. All I can say is no matter how many times I see it I end up on the floor sidesplitting. The way the father says Coooordinate became slang for dressing well in the early 90's. I still use it from time to time myself. Lastly I can't help but appreciate the way this movie for the first time really brought to the big screen the fact that African Americans don't all work in restaurants grocery stores and hair salons. Some of us are actually entrepreneurs business executives and some large cooperations are black owned. I think that's my favorite thing about this film. I highly recommend it if you are an Eddie Murphy fan and can appreciate some raw black comedy.".

He thought he was in love with her and for a while he was presumably and his work is going downhill but then later he starts dating her more quietly attractive assistant Angela Halle Berry who was dating one of his best friends. In the end after some negative turns and rejection the eventually get back together and they supposedly live happily ever after. I can definitely agree with the critics that Grace Jones as Helen Strang and The Emperor's New Groove's Eartha Kitt as Lady Eloise give the film a buzz. Jones being well herself putting on a French accent is funny taking her knickers off in public and demanding sex with Murphy and saying pussy a lot and Kitt with her funny nymphomaniac desperate for sex character really husky voice and sexy legs and body even here 65 she's still foxy. Also starring Jumanji's David Alan Grier as Gerard Jackson Martin Lawrence just before his breakthrough in Bad Boys as Tyler Live and Let Die's Geoffrey Holder as Nelson young Chris Rock not long before he started standup comedy as Bony T Tisha Campbell as Yvonne and Lela Rochon as Christie.

Both were in her younger days masters of their own quirky erotic universe and expressed it in terms of pop culture. Here they are allowed to revive that sexiness and in doing so they are the anchor to this project.

It was clearly made both consciously and perhaps subconsciously to be the Mexican Godfather film and that is hardly a bad thing. Its honesty regarding the emotional costs of violence and murder are on par with that film. I don't know what to say to anyone who critiques Edward James Olmos. First this actor's capacity to convey a complicated range of emotions without words is absolutely staggering and has been seen to great effect in many great films including Blade Runner. Additionally he is inarguably the premiere Latino  Chicano filmmaker and actor of all time. If you look at the films he has been involved with think about how they have dominated the way Hispanic people Mexicans in particular have been seen by others who would largely not even know of the experiences of their neighbors. American Me is so unflinching that after seeing it I had to see it again to believe it was actually made by or released by a major studio. Once upon a time studio films featured honest portraits of life but rarely any more. American Me tho hardly the kneeslapping comedy some reviewer wanted or expected conveys an honest sense of the life lived by many without the hope of education or prosperity but with the same need for respect and something bigger than themselves to believe in that you or anyone else has and lives their life by. If you want to see a life perhaps very different than yours depicted with uncommon honesty watch this film.".

The movie follows the lives of three street gang members who by a sad twist of fate end up in Juvenille Hall. From there they graduate to the big time. Folsom Prison. Inside the walls of Folsom the three form the most powerful gang inside the California Penal System.Olmos turns the story into a Shakespherian tragedy. A story about a dangerous cycle that repeats over and over within certain communities and how the lack of education can be dangerous. Like they say an idle mind is the devil's playground. Many of these characters had too much idle time before they hit rock bottom. Olmos' direction editing and use of lighting is that of a long time filmmaker. The cinematography complements his directorial style. He makes these figures into noble persons who live and die by a code forged from blood shanks and sweat. Great stuff from Mr. Olmos a true masterpiece from a first time director.Sadly Mr. Olmos has took a lot of flack for this film and has made some powerful people very angry. If I were him I would have taken a safer route and gave the prison gangs some fake names and cut all ties to any Technical Support but that's not his style. He should be commended for his efforts because others wouldn't have the courage or conviction to do this. Mr. Olmos doesn't glamorize the lifestyle either. Although they're men of honor amongst themselves I wouldn't want to be in their shoes. But what people have to do to stay alive in prison should not be looked down upon and on the other hand when one's on the outside they should leave what they learned within the prison walls. Because it's a whole different ball game out here.Highly recommended.".

You may not have seen him in many films but he does have a quality about him that casts him perfectly in the principal role of gang leader  drug cartel. If you like prison films this is one of the best. It hasn't got too many clichs and avoids being overtly pretentious. William Forsythe is great as Edward James Olmos's buddy and as heForsytheusually does when acting doesn't try to overact or steal any scenes he just does the business and blends in as his character engrossing you into the film giving it a more realistic depiction of the setting.Many prison films usually fit the same formula showing you the in's and out's morals and stereotypes usually associated with prison films. American ME just gets right into it and takes you along without preaching those usual morals and overdone clich characters. This film is on a par with BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT. Check it out!".

If you like prison films this is one of the best. It hasn't got too many clichs and avoids being overtly pretentious. William Forsythe is great as Edward James Olmos's buddy and as heForsytheusually does when acting doesn't try to overact or steal any scenes he just does the business and blends in as his character engrossing you into the film giving it a more realistic depiction of the setting.Many prison films usually fit the same formula showing you the in's and out's morals and stereotypes usually associated with prison films. American ME just gets right into it and takes you along without preaching those usual morals and overdone clich characters. This film is on a par with BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT. Check it out!";

	schema:headline " A Very Historically Accurate Story Of La Eme Formation";
	schema:reviewBody "Over the past few years anything that featured Edward James Olmos left be with a bit of mixed feelings about the individual. There's no doubt that he's a very talented performer but it's his film choices that gets my goat. But when seeing the movie American Me knowing that he not only starred but directed the movie I actually was starting to take him in considerably. Knowing that such a talented performer being held back by poor decisions we surely won't find him being wasted by his own movie.Based on the life of Mexican mob kingpin Rodolfo Cadena founder of La Eme it shouldn't come as a surprise that there will some dramatization being that it's a biopic and not a documentary. This movie follows his hardfought life this movie is as simple as it gets the story of how La Eme started. Montoya Santana who was in his younger days played Panchito Gomez later played by Olmos is a Chicano youth growing up in Los Angeles' Barrio section forms a posse with Mundo Richard Coca later Pepe Serna and JD Morgan Steve Wilcox William Forsythe and dubbed the group under the moniker La Primera. One day they took a detour through a rival gang's hangout spot they break into a diner. The owner who live nearby to them catches them and sends them to juvenile hall and JD gets a prosthetic leg. This further explains why Roldolfo befriends a Caucasian guy who speaks with a Latino accent and is part of their circle. These events lead up to the gang going to jail and the formation of La Eme comes into fruition.The film stands out as a personal pet project for Olmos as he informs his audience about the dangers of joining a gang. He speaks truly of this cause from experience being born in the Barrios himself. And even casted real prisoners from Folsom Prison as extras to prove his points.His choices of what he brings into his movie is quite interesting and very fascinating. Such examples including the opening settings of his interpretation of the 1940's Zoot Suit Riots and it features a city war between vicious seamen in the California area as they attack Latinos predominately clad in Zoot Suits who represented Latino pride which lead to friction between MexicanAmericans and CaucasianAmericans which was what spawned gangster life among Latinos in the California area.The soundtrack was quite impressive too featuring an eclectic array of classic songs from the 1950 1960's and the 1970's including Ike and Tina Turner's version of Sly and the Family Stone's I Want to Take you Higher and Latino group Los Lobos doing Junior Walker's Shotgun amongst others. The film is generally one big flashback focusing on Santana's story from his childhood to his prison sentence and his narration is crisp and very well detailed.American Me will not bite you to get attention nor will it annoy you in any way. But what it does is it'll tell a wonderful story. And even you root for Santana all the way he's in no way by any means an inspiring hero we can idolize with. Even when he tries to become a better more likable individual we can't ignore the fact that he is a thug and a brute who gets what he deserves. The movie can be pretty ugly at times. Not Scorsese ugly but violent enough to keep our attention going. It's a bit gooey with the rape scenes but it still contributes in keeping with the flow of the story. Overall it's an authentic and captivating film that has a steady flow about a subject never really mentioned in movies.".

Violent ugly and allegedly based on true events the film yanks you into a world that lifelong residents of Los Angeles like me have never seen. The film starts with the L.A. zoot suit riots of the 1940's as a backdrop Olmos portrayed El Pachuco in the stage and screen versions of Zoot Suit and chronicles the rise and fall of Santana Olmos who along with his boyhood crime partners the always good William Forsythe and Pepe Serna becomes the overlord of the Mexican prison mafia.From the get go the viewer is yanked down to the violent streets of East Los Angeles then it's on to Folsom State Prison for some of the most brutal prison sequences this side of Runaway Train. This film has its critics  some lambaste the acting as second rate and some view the dialog as corny the poetic voice over by Olmos worked for me. Personally I noticed none of this. I regard this as a very important film that deserves to be seen now more than ever.Not quite Scorsese but light years better and more socially relevant than the Penitentiary movies.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie needs a month long run on HBO or Showtime to remind people of how good it is and hopefully create a buzz that would lead to a bluray release. Anyone with a remote appreciation of a terrific screenplay solid acting and neorealistic direction would have to love this movie. Edward James Olmos directs and stars as main character Santana Montoya. Santana's parents are victims of a brutal and disturbing attack during Los Angeles's Zoot Suit Riots in the 1940s which sets the tone for Santana's power driven and violent life. A childhood of gang activity in East Los Angeles eventually lands Santana in Folsom State Prison where in the 1960s he starts La Eme otherwise known as the Mexican Mafia. The gang controls all illicit commerce inside of the prison walls from drugs to prostitution. While paroled in the early 1970s Santana meets Julie Evalina Fernandez. Julie who's aware of Santana's high profile in the criminal world and is resentful of it for the most part falls for him when she learns that while in prison he'd studied and read books about the Chicano political movement. Santana's childhood friend and fellow gangster JD William Forsythe also a member of La Eme despite being white is skeptical of Santana's relationship with Julie and believes Julie's pacifist politics are rubbing off on Santana which would make La Eme look weak in the gang world. When Julie's cousin Little Puppet Daniel Villareal commits a major infraction within La Eme's rules Santana is given an ultimatum by JD to either endorse a gang hit on Little Puppet or risk that his leadership of the gang would come into question likely resulting in his own death. A series of incidents including a drug overdose and a bizarre end to a date between Santana and Julia put the two at odds which leaves Santana at a crossroads of maintaining his gang status and his life or trying to salvage what little remains of his relationship with the only woman he'd ever loved. What results is both riveting and sad and as intended by Edward James Olmos leaves a message about Chicano gang life in Los Angeles. Enough controversy surrounded the movie to make another movie about in and of itself. In fact the DVD has a documentary included in the special features called Lives in Hazard which goes into further detail while also giving terrific insight to the streets of East Los Angeles in the early 1990s including interviews with real gang members who were used as consultants and actors.This one has fallen through the cracks and it shouldn't have. It has a story dialogue and even great cinematography which effectively captures downtown and East Los Angeles during three different eras in history that help the film hold up twenty plus years after its release.".

	schema:reviewBody "American Me is a story of the growth of strength in the Mexican mafia during the 1970s and 1980s. It tracks the development of some of the key figures from their earliest days running the streets and coming into conflict with the authorities to the period in which the Mexican mafia developed great influence in the California penal system and on the streets of California influencing the drug trade. The film is based on a true story and tracks some of the same ground covered by Blood In Blood Out which was released a year later. It works in flashback from the later thoughts of director and star Edward James Olmos as Santana. The film is told as a flashback as advice given to his nephew to avoid the gang life which he has embarked on.This is gutcheck cinema. It's not for the faint of heart. The acting is excellent from Olmos as gang leader Santana and his righthand man JD William Forsythe. Olmos plays Santana as extremely worldweary. One can see in Santana's face the toll that his time in prison and role in La Primera the Mexican mafia has taken. William Forsythe is fantastic playing JD very lowkey and as committed to the Mexican mafia as Santana so much so that perhaps he forgets he is not Mexican at times! The intragang and interracial conflicts are powerfully and graphically portrayed. Nothing is held back in depicting what happens in jail but it has the ring of truth and ultimately if one wrongs one's gang one will be held accountable by that gang.This movie really deserves mention along with great gang movies like Goodfellas The Godfather and Boyz in the Hood for its noholdbarred depiction of the brutality and cheapness of life but also the brotherhood and sense of identity gained within a gang.".

It tracks the development of some of the key figures from their earliest days running the streets and coming into conflict with the authorities to the period in which the Mexican mafia developed great influence in the California penal system and on the streets of California influencing the drug trade. The film is based on a true story and tracks some of the same ground covered by Blood In Blood Out which was released a year later. It works in flashback from the later thoughts of director and star Edward James Olmos as Santana. The film is told as a flashback as advice given to his nephew to avoid the gang life which he has embarked on.This is gutcheck cinema. It's not for the faint of heart. The acting is excellent from Olmos as gang leader Santana and his righthand man JD William Forsythe. Olmos plays Santana as extremely worldweary. One can see in Santana's face the toll that his time in prison and role in La Primera the Mexican mafia has taken. William Forsythe is fantastic playing JD very lowkey and as committed to the Mexican mafia as Santana so much so that perhaps he forgets he is not Mexican at times! The intragang and interracial conflicts are powerfully and graphically portrayed. Nothing is held back in depicting what happens in jail but it has the ring of truth and ultimately if one wrongs one's gang one will be held accountable by that gang.This movie really deserves mention along with great gang movies like Goodfellas The Godfather and Boyz in the Hood for its noholdbarred depiction of the brutality and cheapness of life but also the brotherhood and sense of identity gained within a gang.";

	schema:reviewBody "American Me stands on a course with Stand And Deliver among the finest performances by the ever talented Edward James Olmos. Other than starring in this film Olmos also supplies the direction for this brutal and sometimes disturbing to watch prison and street drama. The story has to do with a well respected gang leader Olmos who is released from prison and tries to go straight but his many years of experience among leading street gangs comes back to haunt him. Olmos is highly effective in the role. The film may not be for all tastes but if you are a fan of Olmos or of the genre it is highly recommended.".

A gripping gritty no non sense tale of growing up in the gang culture of East Los Angeles. It follows the life of SantanaPlayed brilliantly by Edward J. Olmos who's mother was raped in  the Zoot Suit riots in L.A. back in the 1940's to produce him. So he comes out of the womb on the bad foot. Then the guy who he thinks is his father hates him and it takes his mother's death before he knows the truth and understands why. Meanwhile he grows up into the gang culture of East Los and spends the majority of his life in jail. It's in jail that he discovers his power and becomes the leader of the powerful La EME The Mexican Mafia. The Gang has the numbers and they control life inside the prison which in this case art does truly imitate reality. Once he is released from prison and returns to his old neighborhood he discovers love and he starts to view life in a different perspective. However the power of the gang won't let him change for it's viewed as weakness. He ends up back in jail on a rap he actually didn't committ where he has to decide stay true to the gang or to himself.A harsh look at how the gang is family and your family is the gang. A must see movie. William Forsythe also delivers a great performance.".

It is one thing for the characters themselves to be misguided as they are most certainly are but the movie itself seems not to realize what big losers these guys are.

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this movie in the theatres as it was released just a few days ago overhere. What can you expect from it? You've seen the trailers... It looks pretty much like Dead Poet's Society doesn't it? But with women instead? D.Well I had that feeling indeed. It felt like Dead Poet's Society during some periods in the movie. But overall it was still different. The surface story isn't that complicated and easy to follow. It's nothing new either. But it was displayed very well.Sure it's about a teacher... her passion to teach and the way she outwitted the students to get the best out of them... It also shows the way a good teacher cares for their students and so forth... and the way contradicting ideas may blind one's ideas and actions towards those who they are meant for. Did that sentence sound weird or what? .You can't go wrong with the cast here. You've got Julia Roberts Kirsten Dunst Julia Stiles Maggie Gyllenhaal Ginnefer Goodwin etc. They played great in the movie.Julia Roberts is just great at playing these emotional roles. It was believable as well. I at least could feel the frustration which she had. Her character is more of a confused type. She reminded me of Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds... There was basically a mixture of confusion and dedication... thus as a teacher despite how sure of she may be of her teaching methods you also sense a nervousness in her... a feeling of uncertainty as to whether her methods of getting the messages across to the students or not will work. I thought Julia Roberts did a great job in that area.Kirsten was just excellent. You could feel the internal turmoil going through her throughout the movie. One might argue that she had a pretty wack role and that she overacted etc. but I don't agree with that. She's practically a heartless b through the movie but you can't help but understand why. The same goes for Julia and Maggie. Just the way they were depicted in the movie you really felt for them. Ginnefer Goodwin's character was also funny and emotional to watch.Marcia Gay Harden as Julia's friend was great. She was a pretty funny character to watch but at the same time you just can't help but feel sorry for her.Times have changed... from those times and now. Many might watch this movie and go Uhm okay what's the big deal? But the problem is that women have gone through a great ordeal and struggle to get to where they are today in society. Even today they still fight to gain respect in many areas in the world today.I've heard many bad comments about this movie. And funnily enough most of them come from guys... whilst the females found it a bit better. There were some negative comments but many said that they loved it but felt that it wasn't a movie for everyone.The movie tackling the issue of feminism only touches upon a small part of it all of course. One cannot tackle the whole aspect of feminism in any one single movie at all and I found the focus to be good enough. There are many stereotypes here and I found them necessary to get the points across. If it were not for the stereotypes people would be wondering what the point really was. But now that there are stereotypes people will complain about them.I thought that it was a bit too short. It could have focused a bit more on the other characters in the movie... i.e. the girls in school. A few more subplots and build ups may have been better. There was a little foreshadowing in the movie but one couldn't help but wonder where the movie was going. But what overcame this from my point of view was that you just felt that you wanted to get to know the characters in the movie more. The more you knew about each character the more the characters knew about one another. I thought that was quite nice.I would advise everyone with an open mind for dramas to go watch this movie. If guys see this movie as a chick flick... they really won't know what to expect cause this would be the most THE chick flick for chicks if you get my drift. I'm a guy and I found it entertaining... Whether it was insightful or not I wouldn't say it was due to experiences and stories throughout my life.The movie isn't without flaws... There could have been even more character build up if only the director's were given more film to record the picture. But do watch this if you can . It'll be worth the time if you're patient enough .".

Mona Lisa Smile rattles off names of artists and their works as if it fully expected moviegoers to be conversant with them. In at least one case the film names neither the artist nor the work Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon. All of these things are taken as givens as part and parcel of a sophisticated audience's cultural baggage  quite a change from the usual pap that Hollywood spoonfeeds us!Moreover the film sometimes speaks volumes by what it doesn't say but simply shows taking for granted that we will fill in the blanks from our knowledge of the history of the period that is the early 1950s. There is one oblique reference to McCarthyism. A photo of an atomic explosion reminds us of the postWWII Cold War era. A game show on TV triggers a memory of the payola scandal. Again Mona Lisa Smile credits us with brains rather than insulting our intelligence.Mercifully the title of the film is not simply a reference to Julia Roberts' famous beestung collagenenhanced lips. As Kirsten Dunst's character explains toward the end of the movie Mona Lisa's smile is not necessarily an indication that she is happy and content  any more than the women of the 1950s with their dream homes and seemingly perfect lives. Mona Lisa Smile is ultimately an indictment of those in society who perpetrate and perpetuate secrets and lies and a tribute to those through whom the truth prevails.".

This one is NOT a romantic comedy although it does include several romances and there are some funny parts.

	schema:headline " Much better than I expected";
	schema:reviewBody "Another film about a progressive teacher trying to teach her students how to think outside of the box. Fortunately unlike School of Rock my views on which were accosted last week I left Mona Lisa Smile mostly satisfied with what I had seen. No it's not especially revelatory or surprising. You can more or less guess what's going to happen to each character by the end. But it does leave a little more room for characterization for slightly unexpected outcomes and it doesn't telegraph its moments quite so rigidly as the Linklater film. Julia Roberts is an actress about whom I feel nothing I neither like nor dislike her. I think this is one of her better performances certainly much better than her Oscar winning role in Erin Brockovich. She plays the progressive art history teacher who arrives at Welsley to learn that all of her students have already studied the textbook from cover to cover and can answer any question that might arise from the class's current syllabus. The curriculum and Roberts' superiors are strict in what they want to teach about art but Roberts veers towards teaching what the textbook will not despite them. The superiors are unhappy with her course but some of the students are opened up to the experience. Outside of class Roberts faces as large a challenge. Most of her students have completely resigned to the idea that they are destined for marriage and nothing more. The status quo must be challenged. The students are a nice range of characters. Kirsten Dunst plays the most conservative who is about to be married when the film opens. She of course rejects Roberts' ideals. On the other end of the spectrum is Maggie Gyllenhaal who is the sexually promiscuous girl who idealizes her teacher. Slightly left of center is Ginnifer Goodwin and right of center Julia Stiles. These four characters are set up very mechanically of course but the characters succeed and this can be said about all of the other characters of the movie including Roberts' who are all rather mechanical on the quality of acting. Each of the performers are wonderful. They manage to make you care which is something that didn't happen with School of Rock whose performers with the one exception of Joan Cusack were adequate or worse. I especially loved Marcia Gay Harden giving another one of the best performances of 2003 as Roberts' roommate who teaches etiquette. She's a pathetic tragicomic image of what some of the girls will become if they insist that the traditional concept of womanhood remain unchanged. The film also boasts exceptional technical qualities. It's simply very well made. 810.".

	schema:headline " A disappointing picture of Wellesley College in 1953";
	schema:reviewBody "As a graduate of Wellesley College 1952 I was eager to see the movie. For a while I thought maybe it was supposed to be a satire.  I had read reviews but no one mentioned satire.  It was so ludicrous so over the top so busy giving us stereotypes and so far from my experience that it was depressing. I didn't mind the Julia Roberts character although she is probably anachronistic.  Certainly those young women so well dressed for classes talking back to her in well thought out sentences full of vitriol were figments of Hollywood's imagination.  I remember no courses offered either in classrooms or rooms in dorms or faculty housing on poise proper table setting etc.  And nowhere in the movie did any of the girls discuss ideas except in the art class. The nighttime dormitory sessions were all about men getting husbands and pointing fingers at Giselle the whore.  In actuality we used to stay up late discussing ideas and we were passionate about such things as academic freedom.The plush dormitory rooms were more figments of Hollywood's imagination. Our rooms were of the bare bones variety.  I remember bringing a comfortable chair of my own from home.I loved my art history and music appreciation courses.  They changed my life.  I had known nothing of art before Wellesley and only the Warsaw Concerto for classical music.  But those two courses informed my life and have stayed with me all these years enriching my experience.  I had a career as a high school English teacher and my literature courses were wonderful for that purpose and for expanding my reading.  But the art and music courses were special.Good acting good costumes for the most part the people looked authentic for the times except too dressed up for class we wore skirts and blouses no blue jeans.  It was nice to see some of the beautiful campus.  I don't remember ever taking part in hoop rolling daisy chain the opening day ceremony in front of the chapel.Finally what was the point of making such a movie today?  To suggest how far we've come from the 1950s?  To ridicule what was then?  After all there was much that was good.  I mean I feel so lucky to have been able to go to a place like Wellesley even if it was for the privileged.  It certainly was not as conservative as the movie depicted nor was it a finishing school. Professors were continually opening our minds to more and more knowledge. The canon then may have been mostly men we read almost all male writers in our English courses but that's how it was.

	onyx:emotionText "As a graduate of Wellesley College 1952 I was eager to see the movie. For a while I thought maybe it was supposed to be a satire.  I had read reviews but no one mentioned satire.  It was so ludicrous so over the top so busy giving us stereotypes and so far from my experience that it was depressing. I didn't mind the Julia Roberts character although she is probably anachronistic.  Certainly those young women so well dressed for classes talking back to her in well thought out sentences full of vitriol were figments of Hollywood's imagination.  I remember no courses offered either in classrooms or rooms in dorms or faculty housing on poise proper table setting etc.  And nowhere in the movie did any of the girls discuss ideas except in the art class. The nighttime dormitory sessions were all about men getting husbands and pointing fingers at Giselle the whore.  In actuality we used to stay up late discussing ideas and we were passionate about such things as academic freedom.The plush dormitory rooms were more figments of Hollywood's imagination. Our rooms were of the bare bones variety.  I remember bringing a comfortable chair of my own from home.I loved my art history and music appreciation courses.  They changed my life.  I had known nothing of art before Wellesley and only the Warsaw Concerto for classical music.  But those two courses informed my life and have stayed with me all these years enriching my experience.  I had a career as a high school English teacher and my literature courses were wonderful for that purpose and for expanding my reading.  But the art and music courses were special.Good acting good costumes for the most part the people looked authentic for the times except too dressed up for class we wore skirts and blouses no blue jeans.  It was nice to see some of the beautiful campus.  I don't remember ever taking part in hoop rolling daisy chain the opening day ceremony in front of the chapel.Finally what was the point of making such a movie today?  To suggest how far we've come from the 1950s?  To ridicule what was then?  After all there was much that was good.  I mean I feel so lucky to have been able to go to a place like Wellesley even if it was for the privileged.  It certainly was not as conservative as the movie depicted nor was it a finishing school. Professors were continually opening our minds to more and more knowledge. The canon then may have been mostly men we read almost all male writers in our English courses but that's how it was.  What was wonderful however was being with all women being able to speak up freely in class being able to win positions of authority in extra curricular organizations like the college newspaper.

My review is personal as I grew up at the tail end of the 50s but so close that I ingested all the prejudices against women's roles in a larger society out side the home. I felt the girls in that senior class at Wellesley in 1953 and remember how in 1998 I spent a glorious summer week at the school attending a workshop. The school is among one of the most beautiful set just far away from Boston and the train as to have it disappear but close enough to commute. Wellesley in the 90s was certainly different but the bondage of the 50s was palpable in the dining hall among the alumni in the tone of each interaction and in the rules of decorum.I doubt that Ms. Watson would have been permitted the latitude she received that first semester but I do see how the Bettys Joans Connies and Giselles would have behaved then in all the ways the film portrays from the fussy overbearing mother to the vindictive editorials that could and did destroy careers not unlike Hellman's playChildren's Hour circa 1934 and get away with it. Family money and social standing was the cornerstone for acceptance.The film did work a little too hard perhaps in portraying stereotypes and that emphasis on the sexually promiscuous Jewess Gyllenhaal described in the last scenes as the Kike from New York may be over the top but not so far from the top to scream out that's the way it was and utterly offensive. In the 50s it was uncommon for people of the Jewish faith to enroll and be accepted in tony schools like Wellesley.Julia Roberts as Ms. Watson did a fine job but it was the girls that shined for me and became real life students working through all the proscribed patterns of their day. Joan was brave but Betty was remarkable in her conversion and gleaned knowledge that marriage is only the answer when it is a good marriage not one of convenience. Divorce in the 50s was nearly unheard of and it took a unique amount of courage to venture in that direction and not fall off the societal cliff so many women cling to with desperation. Perhaps the film isn't for everyone but I am so pleased I saw it as it reminded me of what I don't miss and what changes have occurred for educated women.".

I admit I didn't hate it the way some other males commenting on it seem to  it's passably amusing and I can see the points it's trying to make  but ultimately it just doesn't come off.Part of the problem is the casting Julia Roberts is never believable for a second as the art teacher and she spends the movie being acted off the screen by her students when they show off more textbook knowledge than she does in their first class the impression that they should be teaching her never leaves and fellow teachers. Kirsten Dunst as a prissy writer on the college newspaper who stands for The Way Things Are and Julia Stiles as an art student with a desire to be a lawyer seem to have been cast in each other's roles by mistake Stiles in particular sounds as if she's playing at being grownup throughout although both she and Dunst give it their best shot for the most part KD's big emotional scene near the end is dreadful.

In fairness Ginnifer Goodwin as the... pleasantly plump girl you can't really call her fat Maggie Gyllenhaal as a sexy free spirit Marcia Gay Harden as a fellow teacher obsessed with TV and an alltoobriefly seen Juliet Stevenson as a nurse are all much better value.But what really hurts Mona Lisa Smile isn't the acting or the music though it's no fun hearing Barbra Streisand vocally showing off over the credits but the writing. In addition to setting up all its characters as cliches and not really building up any of its plot lines with Roberts's plot the dullest of all the script's attempts to bring over the idea of women in the 1950s being who they choose to be though perfectly laudable come over as people switching to suit the plot it's never clear how one character winds up changing her mind in the end. Rather than earn the movie's wouldbe bittersweet ending it seems obligatory. Not much about the movie is honest and even less is moving  only Goodwin's and Gyllenhaal's scenes are truly interesting the former because it gives the movie some true emotion and the latter because she's an alluring and likeable creature some funny moments but not enough to make it true fun. Just enough however to make the movie endurable.Mona Lisa Smile isn't a BAD movie it's just unnecessary and not nearly the deep and moving treatise about the preWomen's Lib days that it thinks it is. It's a lot like some of the beauty contestants we see in the 1950s montage at the end  pretty but pretty shallow.".

She's edging beyond the era of the Pretty Woman roles yet hardly ready for the role of matron. Mona Lisa Smile where she plays a college instructor heading to the conservative east coast seems the perfect vehicle for Roberts to make a transition unfortunately the result is a bumpy ride in which Roberts herself seems decidedly uncomfortable and one that becomes only a faint reflection of its oppositegender inspiration Dead Poets Society. Roberts plays Katherine Watson a liberalminded westcoast art teacher who finds herself with the opportunity to take over a similar position at Wellesley College an ultraconservative women's college in 1953. Watson arrives hoping to make a difference in the lives of some of the smartest women in the country by extending the notion of traditional attitudes about art to attitudes about life and the life of women in particular.Roberts seems oddly intimidated by a role in which she is overtaken by a strong ensemble of classmates including Maggie Gyllenhaal Kirsten Dunst and Julia Stiles a powerfully dislikeable school administrator and even the house mother at her instructor's dorm played by Marcia Gay Harden. She seems at ease only in the film's lone romantic scene with her as she lounges lazily in front of a fireplace with her long hair flowing down her face.Kirsten Dunst as Betty Warren spoiled and naive daughter of a Wellseley board member is the antagonist the lightning rod for convention and propriety and wields a pen as her weapon against Watson's enlightened westcoast intrusions. We ultimately see her poison pen serve as foreshadowing of her own anger at the unraveling of her own presumably idyllic life in light of the uncapped potential of her peers. By film's end she has clearly grown and changed more than Roberts.The film ends with an attempt at a grand sendoff of the rebellious instructor in keeping with Dead Poets Society's onthedesk Captain my Captain but the characters are not drawn with sufficient depth to make us sympathetic with the loss of their mentor and the scene is only visually satisfying. If anything we are more drawn to the strength of the relationships of the students to each other rather than the instructor. Where Poets drew Robin Williams character deep into the lives of his students Watson's student relationship is manufactured at best strained and intrusive at worst.The film deserves unexpected credit for not casting itself as a unilateral message of contemporary feminism. It allows Watson as the enlightened teacher to offer her message of women's potential in nontraditional roles yet also allows one of her students to assert the right to choose that traditional role without condescension.It would be too harsh to cast the film as a failure. It is a decently written story if too thin  always a risk with a story laden with numerous central characters but often a masterpiece if done right as in Dead Poets. Smile is wonderfully photographed in the picturesque northeast and Roberts' supporting cast is arguably the very strength of the film. But for an actress who has made a career out of stealing scenes with a calculated glaze wilting in the shadow of her costars is characterized as nothing but a belowpar performance. Smile ends up being a Dead Poets for suffragettes but just not done nearly as well.And that's a shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mona Lisa Smile 2003I had no idea the theme of this movie but I teach art history and the main opening scene is a true nightmare for an art history teacherthe precocious students knew everything before the teacher said anything and then they sweetly got up and went to study hall because of course they might actually learn something there.This is 1953 at a rich private and elite college for girls a real oneit's called Wellesley. The writing is a little strained and forcing some of the sexist themes of the 1950s on the audience. So even the stellar castJulia Roberts Kirsten Dunst Maggie Gyllenhaalcan't give this the sincerity it needs. But the period looks terrific the music and the dresses are fine so the whole atmosphere frankly becomes the compelling center of the movie.Not that the plot isn't worthwhile.

Such are the movies. This could have been a better movie with the same basic story but lots better writing and directing. The ambition was kept in check and so the movie does the minimum here and not always so badly if the minimum will do.On a final note there are a number of women behind the scenes here though not the director or writers sadly music art direction set decoration and casting.

	onyx:emotionText "Mona Lisa Smile 2003I had no idea the theme of this movie but I teach art history and the main opening scene is a true nightmare for an art history teacherthe precocious students knew everything before the teacher said anything and then they sweetly got up and went to study hall because of course they might actually learn something there.This is 1953 at a rich private and elite college for girls a real oneit's called Wellesley. The writing is a little strained and forcing some of the sexist themes of the 1950s on the audience. So even the stellar castJulia Roberts Kirsten Dunst Maggie Gyllenhaalcan't give this the sincerity it needs. But the period looks terrific the music and the dresses are fine so the whole atmosphere frankly becomes the compelling center of the movie.Not that the plot isn't worthwhile.

	schema:reviewBody "Mona Lisa Smile is Hollywood's schizophrenic take on feminism. Julia Roberts plays an art history professor who takes a teaching position at the allfemale Wellesly College in the 1950s. Roberts is characterized as a bohemian who encourages female independence but it is only her kind of independence she endorses. She believes women should not marry and should be professionalslike herself. In other words trade in one role for another role trade in the apron for the briefcase.By the middle I found Mona Lisa Smile insulting and false. The young women who went to college back then FOUGHT to go to college. They wanted an educationwhether that led to matrimony or career didn't matter. Mona Lisa Smile just doesn't ring true for me. Women didn't live their lives like ads in magazine anymore than women do now. You might aspire to that but reality sets in soon enough.Roberts' pupils seem content with romanceand really don't think of much else. Even the most liberated of the bunch played by Maggie Gyllenhal is only concerned with her sexual liberation. Kirsten Dunst's character is a knowitall snob who believes marriage is the only way. But Roberts is proved right when Dunst's marriage fails. Dunst goes from being a strident traditionalist to a strident feministeither way she is annoying. The only girl who having a boyfriend is seen as a good thing is the chubby plainJane girl. The movie seems to say that she should be grateful that she found someone. Julia Stiles plays the smartest girl who is accepted to law school but she is really in love.By the end of Mona Lisa Smile Roberts rejects a marriage proposal by a male friend who she is close toand he seems to really understand her. She accidentally calls him BillDominic West's lying Lothario professor character who she really wants to be with And we are treated with Roberts and West's predictable romance which drags the movie down.. All of this puts her in a bad light. Not good for someone who is supposed to be the heroine of the movie.Roberts is furthered humiliated when she barges in on Stiles' after wedding reception telling her she could work in law school with her marriage. But Stiles has to make it finally clear to Roberts that she doesn't want a careerher career will be raising a good family. She says that no one regrets not going to law school on their death bedsomething to that effect. Aha! Mona Lisa Smile shows its real stripes here.The only positive things I can say about Mona Lisa Smile the women's fashions were authentic right down to the clip on earrings Again sometimes Roberts didn't look like she was from the '50s with her long hair. I guess they were telling us that she was the more free future. the soundtrack was good with some remakes by contemporary artists and I enjoyed the art lectures.

That leaves the story  script to comment on  Julia ROberts portrays a historyofart teacher who goes to teach in what appears to be an upper class conservative  I do NOT say that pejoratively  American University in the 1950's. She has more progressive ideas on art than the students who have learned about art from books and know it well. Her progressist teaching ideas do not go down well in the university and she receives warnings about that. IN the end she decides to leave although she would have been welcomed back if she wanted.I am very much nostalgic for the ideas of the 1950's and was thus delighted to be able to see this film. True Julia Roberts' ideas may be subversive at the time but she did have a fairly humble rle and not too aggressive. Her ideas washed off on a couple of her students but not too much. One of the students did get the entrance to Yale but nevertheless gave priority to the wishes of her husband  which was right of course . It is totally stupid to infer that a woman must have a career in life at all costs and that otherwise her life is worthless. If she is happy serving her husband then so be it. Noone not even Katharine Watson has the right to criticize her for it. On the other hand another student that was married actually left her husband because he was neglecting her  and was right to do so  and went to live in Brooklyn with another.All the above shows that Julia Roberts' intervention had some influence but not too much. Also she learned things from the students the learning was reciprocal. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having the goal in life to want to be a good wife and mother to your husband. One of the girls in the film told this straight to JUlia Roberts' face and JR just had to accept it. You can't just go imposing your ideas on everyone else people all think in different ways and that's the way the world is.The actorsactresses were all wonderful and I was not bored for one minute watching the film. I even bought the DVD over in the States. I'm not saying it's everyones cup of tea but I certainly did enjoy it on all levels.".

Of course after all the required plot points are surpassed there's a happy ending when we realize that she touched all of her students' lives and they'll never forget her and blah blah blah.

I'm all for movies about encouraging original thought and fighting tradition and being yourself but it's hard for me to take seriously when it's presented in such broad strokes that it's as if Katherine and a select few of her students are the only real humans and everyone else are heartless bloodless alien pod people. The other humans you know fellow freethinking subversive bohemians are played by Julia Stiles Ginnifer Goodwin and Maggie Gyllenhaal who predictably gives the only memorable performance.The pod people are everyone else but especially Kirsten Dunst as a student who vocally opposes Katherine's teaching with dialogue like Don't disregard our traditions just because you're subversive! and the gorgonlike campus President Marian Seldes. Of course Dunst is only a pod person until her husband cheats on her and she realizes Katherine was right all along just in time for the heartwarming ending whew! that was a close one!.I feel mean for beating up on this harmless little puppy of a movie but when a movie's trying to be serious and bungles it pretty much every step of the way and so badly it's hard not to. Every character is a stereotype every situation a cliche everything in general feels completely phony and as a result the good message that it's trying to impart is rendered meaningless.

	schema:headline " A visually interesting Movie that gets it wrong";
	schema:reviewBody "My father died suddenly in 1951 when I was 4 and my now widowed mother of 30 who had thought she would be the typical 50's housewife determined to go back to college to get her teaching degree and keep the house we had just moved into. Two years later she received it kept the house and her story and our pictures made all the city papers because here was a young single mother with 3 children who actually graduated from college. Talk about stereotypical responses of the day.I had hoped this movie would rekindle some memories of that time in me for I have very few that I do remember. The actual presentation of this movie while enjoyable on the surface if anything possibly pushed some of the few cherished memories I did have out the door.There was nothing in it that I could relate to. These were 90's people dressed up to look like a very stylized 50's period. Except that no teacher from that time ever looked like Katherine. I guess it's the era we live in that we want to express the 'now' and in certain situations dress it up to give it some flair and call it whatever year we want with little regard to what actually happened or to those who lived it.And I really don't understand the ending. Would the Julia Stiles character really get on a bike and follow and wave after Katherine as she drove away after giving her in effect the coldest shoulder possible when Katherine tried to help her? Are we supposed to think that somehow Katherine won? What did the girls who signed up for her class the next year think? Did they feel abandoned? Or did they realize the folly of their ways and all become good little housewives and mothers.The breakup between Katherine and her boyfriend was also unbelievable. So he was embarrassed about what he 'did in the war' like others would be. So he did not discourage others from assuming something slightly different then what happened. He immediately explained to Katherine exactly what happened when confronted. It's not like he tried to lie some more. At most his was a good story. It's not like he cheated on her or was a some kind of deviant. The writers just needed a cheap cheesy plot device to make sure she was free to make 'the' decision. Another poster here called the students 'boomer brats'. Now there is someone who has no idea of anything historical. These girls soon became the mothers of those 'boomer brats'. And did they recast the mother from movie Titanic to the Kirsten Dunst character's mother? a 40 year difference I could swear it's the same person or at least the same character.I remember TV from that era but were people already addicted by 1952? I'm pretty sure it was still an oddity  at least in our neighborhood  and not yet ubiquitous like it is now. The Marcia Gay Harden character did not ring true at all.And of course the Maggie Gyllenhaal character immediately after college went to Greenwich Village started a commune protested the war marched to Washington moved to HaightAsbury and became the first woman governor of California all by 1955. Well isn't that close? At least according to Hollywood? Oh yes just the rich ones the rest were too busy trying to make a decent living.An attractive movie with Julia Robert's smile and a fairly talented ensemble cast that will be a trivia question in about 20 years. And that's about it.You want a women's empowerment story? Go back and read the first paragraph. That really happened. And it was a news story because it was almost unheard of in 1953.".

	onyx:emotionText "My father died suddenly in 1951 when I was 4 and my now widowed mother of 30 who had thought she would be the typical 50's housewife determined to go back to college to get her teaching degree and keep the house we had just moved into. Two years later she received it kept the house and her story and our pictures made all the city papers because here was a young single mother with 3 children who actually graduated from college. Talk about stereotypical responses of the day.I had hoped this movie would rekindle some memories of that time in me for I have very few that I do remember. The actual presentation of this movie while enjoyable on the surface if anything possibly pushed some of the few cherished memories I did have out the door.There was nothing in it that I could relate to. These were 90's people dressed up to look like a very stylized 50's period. Except that no teacher from that time ever looked like Katherine. I guess it's the era we live in that we want to express the 'now' and in certain situations dress it up to give it some flair and call it whatever year we want with little regard to what actually happened or to those who lived it.And I really don't understand the ending. Would the Julia Stiles character really get on a bike and follow and wave after Katherine as she drove away after giving her in effect the coldest shoulder possible when Katherine tried to help her? Are we supposed to think that somehow Katherine won? What did the girls who signed up for her class the next year think? Did they feel abandoned? Or did they realize the folly of their ways and all become good little housewives and mothers.The breakup between Katherine and her boyfriend was also unbelievable. So he was embarrassed about what he 'did in the war' like others would be. So he did not discourage others from assuming something slightly different then what happened. He immediately explained to Katherine exactly what happened when confronted. It's not like he tried to lie some more. At most his was a good story. It's not like he cheated on her or was a some kind of deviant. The writers just needed a cheap cheesy plot device to make sure she was free to make 'the' decision. Another poster here called the students 'boomer brats'. Now there is someone who has no idea of anything historical. These girls soon became the mothers of those 'boomer brats'. And did they recast the mother from movie Titanic to the Kirsten Dunst character's mother? a 40 year difference I could swear it's the same person or at least the same character.I remember TV from that era but were people already addicted by 1952? I'm pretty sure it was still an oddity  at least in our neighborhood  and not yet ubiquitous like it is now. The Marcia Gay Harden character did not ring true at all.And of course the Maggie Gyllenhaal character immediately after college went to Greenwich Village started a commune protested the war marched to Washington moved to HaightAsbury and became the first woman governor of California all by 1955. Well isn't that close? At least according to Hollywood? Oh yes just the rich ones the rest were too busy trying to make a decent living.An attractive movie with Julia Robert's smile and a fairly talented ensemble cast that will be a trivia question in about 20 years. And that's about it.You want a women's empowerment story? Go back and read the first paragraph. That really happened. And it was a news story because it was almost unheard of in 1953.";

	schema:headline " Marriage repressive  intellectually stifling? I think not!";
	schema:reviewBody "Julia Roberts is normally one of my favourite actresses and is always so sympathetic  endearing in her roles. However I detest much of what her character Katherine stands for in this film. The other characters though somewhat interesting are quite stereotypical. Although the movie captures the 1950's clothing  hair styles twin sets pearls  clip on earrings depicts some possibly ? historical college traditions and has lovely musical scoring I am compelled to give it the lowest possible rating. Its portrait of marriage as a repressive institution is the underlying theme throughout the tale. Set in 1953 the movie revolves around a California feminist Katherine Watson who obtains a position as art history professor at the exclusive New England women's college Wellesley. When she introduces modern art into her curriculum she finds herself at odds with the ultra traditional  conservative faculty and alumni. Katherine views her students as highly intelligent but essentially putting in time while waiting for marriage or proposals thereof never once considering the option of wife plus career. In her personal life Katherine rejects a marriage proposal herself after a visit from her distant California lover Paul only to embark upon an affair with the college's deceptive  womanizing Italian professor Bill Dunbar.The movie focuses on the personal stories of four girls in particular. Betty who writes poison pen college newspaper editorials marries mid way through the year and acts as though skipping classes is acceptable for married Wellesley students a most improbable reality even for that era. Giselle is a sexually daring girl who sleeps around even with married men and has herself had an affair with Bill. Connie is the most sympathetic...a plain chubby girl who feels unattractive but finally finds loses  wins again a boyfriend who makes her feel desired. Joan is engaged and although Katherine encourages her to pursue her dream of Yale law school she instead elopes and gives up law school plans. Other characters include Nancy the proper  spinsterish elocution and etiquette teacher and Amanda the liberal  lesbian irrelevant here school nurse who is dismissed for illegally distributing diaphragms to the girls. Of course this upper crust society is all portrayed quite negatively especially Betty's status conscious  apparently uncaring mother. Personally I was horrified at the rudeness of these young ladies ? during Katherine's first art history class. They come across not as well informed but a group of nasty disrespectful know it all snobs talking back to their professor. This spoiled lot should all return to finishing school and learn some manners! The final scene did little to move me when the girls are all on bicycles and following Katherine in the car for their farewell tribute. This movie is most definitely NOT a female version of that incredible film Dead Poets Society. The interactions often nasty of the girls with each other are more meaningful here than their relationship with their teacher. Katherine isn't really much of a mentor to them she just tries to intrude her particular version of independence into their lives.My over riding impression of the movie is of course the abysmally negative portrait it paints of marriage. The girls are depicted as more concerned with fancy homes new washers  dryers and promotions for their husbands than with genuine love. The men are portrayed as an unsympathetic and non supportive lot. For starters Betty's philandering husband totally neglects her so she soon seeks a divorce in favour of a bohemian Greenwich Village lifestyle. Joan's fianc remarks off handedly that his wife will be unable to attend law school as he expects his dinner on the table at 500. Katherine seems to want no part of marriage herself instead strangely believing it gives her more dignity to inform lover Bill that for the duration of their affair he must promise to refrain from having sex with his students. Personally marriage with its implicit mutual respect  fidelity seems pretty classy to me when compared with resorting to such a degrading request. Can anyone figure out why she prefers Bill who quite unethically sleeps with his students to Paul? With Bill's lack of integrity here Katherine should hardly have been surprised to discover that his entire persona is based on a lie.Katherine makes absolutely atrocious statements that are incredibly insulting to modern college educated homemakers. She literally charges that these young ladies are educating themselves only so they can recite Chaucer as they iron their husbands's shirts or for the physics majors calculate the exact mass of their meat loaf. I was positively incensed by this and cheered when Joan later puts Katherine in her place Joan remarks that looking back she would be far more likely to miss having had a family than miss being a lawyer. Katherine genuinely cannot seem to grasp the fact that this bright young woman is actually choosing of her own accord family over career. True both messages are presented here but Katherine is the obvious protagonist of the piece. We are encouraged to embrace her viewpoint and consider Joan a foolish ninny for her choice.Just an aside as a former high school teacher myself...what kind of serious professor would interrupt a colleague's lecture with swearing and a little temper tantrum the way Katherine does when she barges into Bill's class making a complete fool of herself with only a brief vague muttered apology to him afterward? Not very professional I'm afraid. No male professor would emerge as sympathetic on screen after pulling that inconsiderate stunt...only the lovely  appealing Julia Roberts.Sorry but the film's ultra feminist message of wives being totally oppressed  stifled and their intellect wasted is so horrendous that whatever merits the movie has recede into oblivion. Total thumbs down to this outrage an insult particularly to homemakers but also to the intelligence of ALL women everywhere...whether single married with career or whatever the case.".

For one thing while the story focusing on feminism in the 1950s is on the whole intriguing there are parts when there is not a lot going on causing occasional pacing problems. While there are some delicious lines from Julia Roberts and Kirsten Dunst especially the screenplay wasn't as intricately crafted as it could have been and fell into the danger of being too stereotyped. Mike Newell's direction is able and while the transition from tradition and progression clashing is well captured it is sometimes too overly simplistic so the film doesn't quite give enough authenticity.Despite these flaws there is still a lot to recommend it. The film is very well made with dazzling cinematography and picturesque scenery. And the costumes hairstyles and makeup were beautiful. The music is lovely very pleasant and soothing. Making the most of their rather stereotypical characters the actors acquit themselves well. I admit it I don't often care for Julia Roberts but here she makes for a sympathetic lead as the unconventional art lecturer and does it more than adequately. Solidly supporting her as the students are Julia Stiles Maggie Gyllanhaal and Kirsten Dunst especially. The film is ably directed too and is emotionally manipulative not in a bad way though. All in all it is a very earnest and well made film but as a drama it doesn't quite convince as much as it should've done. 710 Bethany Cox".

It's clear that they just wanted to go to Europe have some fun and film one hilarious situation after the other. I've got the feeling that most of the European viewers didn't mind being the subject of the movie. Yes it's crude and yes it doesn't show anything about how Europe really is but it's also incredibly funny. I give it an 810 for that.".

Certainly not because it was from the people who gave us such gems as Road Trip or Old School that's for sure and it's not like I even recognized anyone in the cast other than Michelle Trachtenberg best known as Buffy's little sister Dawn. I guess I went because I found the trailer mildly amusing and I still had 9 on an AMC gift card that I had been given for Christmas. I've seen movies with less provocation I suppose.Eurotrip follows the adventures of four teens Scott Scott Mechlowitz Cooper Jacob Pitts and twins Jamie Travis Wester and Jenny Trachtenberg as they backpack around Europe between high school graduation and beginning college. There's sort of a plot driving the film as Scott wants to meet up with his email pen pal Mieke Jessica Boehrs whom he thought was male but finds out is actually a very attractive female. But really the movie is an excuse to have fun with typical American Eurostereotypes.Naturally the four freshfaced kids get into all sorts of hijinks as they make their way through London Paris Berlin Rome and so on. And the foursome are your basic group Scott is the wellmeaning lead Cooper the sarcastic wiseass Jamie the uptight planner and Jenny  well my first indication that this wouldn't be a typical dumb teen comedy was when the other three guys all treat Jenny as one of the guys and of course she's ubercute Trachtenberg. They repeatedly refuse to think of her as a girl despite the filmmakers really showing off Trachtenberg's budding assets which continues to play as funny through most of the film.It may sound hard to believe but I don't think I have ever laughed as hard or as long at another film as I did at this one. Maybe it's because my expectations were pretty low but this was a hysterically funny film. From the opening moments where Scott is dumped by slutty girlfriend Fiona Smallville's Kristin Kreuk in a terrific cameo to the very end of the film I pretty much laughed the entire 90 minutes. Not only is there clever verbal play and uproarious sight gags the arrival at Bratislava was so funny I almost fell out of my seat laughing but the writers were masters of the recurring gag  the best of which is a song about Scott's breakup with Fiona it makes sense in the film constantly popping up as they travel throughout Europe. One particular scene involving English soccer hooligans traveling to France led by the smashing Vinnie Jones had me laughing so hard I had tears rolling down my face.Everyone gives a game performance. Scott Mechlowitz is perfect as Scott with just the right mix of leading man humor and straight guy stiffness. Jacob Pitts' Cooper is surprisingly low key for the smartass usually this kind of character is way over the top but Cooper manages to be funny without ever taking it too far. Travis Webster plays his nerdly Jamie well we never look down on the guy even though he's the more uptight one in the group. And Trachtenberg seems right at home being one of the guys even while attempting to transform herself into an object of teenage lust. The cameos  Matt Damon as a punk singer Lucy Lawless as a Dominatrix Kreuk and so on  are all well cast and well used. You'll recognize a lot of the bit players from other places Guy Ritchie films SNL etc but they all work very well.I didn't expect this film to be so repeatedly and exceptionally funny and I guess it caught me off guard. I can't recall laughing this hard at any film in the last five years and maybe ever. I hesitate to call it the funniest movie I've ever seen because I've seen some great comedies but I was still chuckling at this film more than a half hour after I was out of the theater. As far as movies performing above expectations this is one of the tops in that category. I guess some people would be put off by the European stereotypes but the film was so inventively humorous and excessively cleverthey do a great parody of the Indiana Jones 'moving around the map' bit that I was blown away. This is a movie I fully intend to see again maybe a few times and I'm already clearing off space for it on the DVD shelf. But don't take my word for it  go see it yourself and see one of the funniest movies in years.".

The scene with The Pope is an instant classic in my point of view I haven't seen something this hilarious since the first Scary Movie came out. Some satirical aspects also take place in the movie especially funny was the scene when the characters arrive to a club in Slovakia  hear a techno remix of a song 'Scotty Doesn't Know'.

But let's face it Animal House was better than Eraserhead. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was better than Babette's Feast. American Pie was better than The Crying Game. And Eurotrip is better than Capturing the Friedmans.Now since my favorite movies include The Godfather Citizen Kane and Vertigo you may ask why I liked this picture. Is it wellacted? No. Isn't the script stupid? And how. Is there any socially redeeming value? I couldn't find any. Isn't it xenophobic? Uhhuh. Doesn't it portray women as merely sex objects? Yep. Isn't it awfully crude? Yewbetcha. But what makes this film worth watching is quite simple It's funny.Granted there's no greatness here. You will not see anyone as funny or talented as John Belushi Bill Murray Sean Penn Cameron Diaz Eugene Levy or Will Ferrell here. The only cast members with any real acting or comedic mettle are Matt Damon and Fred Armissen who only make brief cameos. On the other hand you won't see anyone as gutwrenchingly awful as Chevy Chase Rodney Dangerfield Tom Cruise Ben Stiller Tom Green Seann William Scott or Ashton Kutcher.There's not much plot to speak of. A nice guy Scott Mechlowicz who has just graduated high school goes on a trip to Europe to find the girl of his dreams a Berliner named Mieke Jessica Boehrs and takes along his three best friends a lazy ne'erdowell looking for kinky sex like in European erotica Jason Pitts a girl looking for romance like in European novels Michelle Trachtenberg  a nerd looking for museums like in European travel brochures Travis Wester. Along the way they run into all the various European stereotypes thuggish Brits pretentious French perverted Italians desperately poor Eastern Europeans etc.Yet as crude and xenophobic as this movie can sometimes be it is never anything but goodnatured. I never got the sense that the filmmakers displayed any ill will towards the peoples they were lampooning. And I must say for as much sex and nudity as there is in this movie and there's a whole lot of it the biggest laugh I got was a PGrated battle of the robot mimes in Paris which may be the only scene in the movie that can be shown unedited on TV.Although this may not be great art or even great comedy Eurotrip is a terribly crude but awfully funny movie. 7 out of 10.".

After Scotty Thomas realises he has made a terrible mistake he and his best friend set off to put things right and they run into some other friends in the process.They visit Paris Amsterdam London and many more places which are all given a very amusing stereotypical makeover from an American viewpoint. With a strong cast plenty of well written gags and an overall cheesy script  EuroTrip is definitely a winner.If you enjoy this movie then also see RoadTrip Old School and the American Pie series of films certainly the first two anyway 810 Great fun".

Then he emails a really mean letter to his penpal in Berlin Germany after thinking that the guy wants to meet up with him until his little brother points out to him that is penpal is actually a stunning gorgeous girl. So Scotty and Cooper set out to Europe and meet up with Jamie and Jenny Michelle Trachtenberg two twins who are spending the summer in Europe and they all set out to find Scotty's dream girl and they go through some pretty hilarious situations.This movie will have Nickelodeon's jaws dropped when they see their former television star Michelle Trachtenberg do the things she does in this movie. She's really grown up. She is the biggest name in this movie along side the cameo by Matt Damon but the rest of the cast were pretty good actors.This movie had some raunchy situations. We see Jenny and Jamie the two twins accidentily kiss each other and some other things I probably shouldn't mention that are twenty times worse than that but if you're curious go see the movie. The story to this movie is pretty ridiculous but you can't hate the movie for all of the good laughs it serves. 'Eurotrip' will give you some good laughs and fun and doesn't leave an empty spot anywhere. This would probably be really fun to go see with a big group of friends you will be constantly laughing together. 910.".

NONE of the jokes are funny it's racist xenophobic and stereotypical. It's poorly shot casted directed and produced. Not even slightly believable and just plain NOT funny.Notice how everyone who likes this film is American? That's because this film totally conforms to outdated American stereotypes of what Europe is like. I doubt the script writers have ever been outside the mainland US.There are plot holes and location errors all over the place perhaps if any of the lines or characters were vaguely humorous you could ignore this. But they're not. Nothing is funny about this film. Not even how bad it is. Send it to the bottom 100!".

NONE of the jokes are funny it's racist xenophobic and stereotypical. It's poorly shot casted directed and produced. Not even slightly believable and just plain NOT funny.Notice how everyone who likes this film is American? That's because this film totally conforms to outdated American stereotypes of what Europe is like. I doubt the script writers have ever been outside the mainland US.There are plot holes and location errors all over the place perhaps if any of the lines or characters were vaguely humorous you could ignore this. But they're not. Nothing is funny about this film. Not even how bad it is. Send it to the bottom 100!";

	schema:headline " A Funny but Forgettable Teen Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "EuroTrip is a decent comedy that should satisfy most teens but little of everyone else. After a misunderstanding between Scotty Scott Mechlowicz and his German Email pen pal he learns that she is a hot girl only after she breaks off contact with him. With three of his best friends Scotty treks across Europe trying to find her while meeting a lot of strange characters and getting into embarrassing situations that will do little to help American foreign relations. The plot is nothing new as this is just another raunchy teen flick. Its not out to win awards just to make a few fans and earn some money. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns. The most notable name is probably Michelle Trachtenberg and she does a good job in the film. Jacob Pitts is the funniest person in the film and he looks like a young David Spade. Scott Mechlowicz plays Scotty and I really didn't find him very funny. There's also a couple of cameos from Matt Damon Kristin Kreuk and Vinnie Jones. While Eurotrip has its share of funny moments there's also a lot of scenes that are sure to offend people. This is just a silly movie and not one to be taken seriously. One example is a German kid pretending to be Hitler not only is that scene not funny but its also bound to upset some people. Jeff Schaffer does a good job of directing and he makes up for writing the horrible Cat in the Hat. The places they visit include Rome London Paris Amsterdam Berlin and a couple of other places. It would have been better if they had filmed in all these locations instead of just Prague. I'm guessing they didn't because they wanted to save money. Like most teen flicks this one isn't very memorable. With a run time of only 90 minutes this film is definitely bearable if your a teen at least. In the end if you think your going to like this film then you probably will. If you think your going to hate this film then you probably will. Rating 610 a pretty good comedy that's for teens only.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fine performance by Susan Hayward makes all of Tulsa worth watching and the exciting finale caps it off with a bang. The tone is not always consistent varying from serious treatment of environmental and ethical issues to the folksy ultraupbeat narration by Chill Wills. But Hayward is consistently interesting to watch and the story is generally told at a good pace with some good scenes along the way.Hayward plays the daughter of a rancher seeking revenge against a large oil man who caused the death of her father and the destruction of his valuable livestock. Along the way she makes the fateful decision to beat the oil baron at his own game which has some tumultuous consequences for her and those close to her. It's quite a good role for Hayward and she is believable as her character first seeks justice and then gradually starts to become what she had been fighting against.The occasional overlypositive emphasis on the role of the oil industry is balanced out by some good efforts to discuss some of the environmental problems caused by largescale drilling. And even though it is never stated explicitly several of the scenes create a noticeable contrast between the simple beauty of the Oklahoma prairies and the bleak ugliness of fields filled with endless rows of oil wells.The firefighting climax is exciting to watch and it is a rather impressive piece of filmmaking as well with believable action and visuals. Although the finale does not really resolve most of the important issues it works well on screen.The supporting cast is solid and likable with Wills Robert Preston and Pedro Armendariz. For the most part their characters are not fleshed out since Hayward is the center of attention but the other characters occasionally get their moments.Overall Tulsa is somewhat above average with some noticeable strengths in the mix.".

The tone is not always consistent varying from serious treatment of environmental and ethical issues to the folksy ultraupbeat narration by Chill Wills. But Hayward is consistently interesting to watch and the story is generally told at a good pace with some good scenes along the way.Hayward plays the daughter of a rancher seeking revenge against a large oil man who caused the death of her father and the destruction of his valuable livestock. Along the way she makes the fateful decision to beat the oil baron at his own game which has some tumultuous consequences for her and those close to her. It's quite a good role for Hayward and she is believable as her character first seeks justice and then gradually starts to become what she had been fighting against.The occasional overlypositive emphasis on the role of the oil industry is balanced out by some good efforts to discuss some of the environmental problems caused by largescale drilling. And even though it is never stated explicitly several of the scenes create a noticeable contrast between the simple beauty of the Oklahoma prairies and the bleak ugliness of fields filled with endless rows of oil wells.The firefighting climax is exciting to watch and it is a rather impressive piece of filmmaking as well with believable action and visuals. Although the finale does not really resolve most of the important issues it works well on screen.The supporting cast is solid and likable with Wills Robert Preston and Pedro Armendariz. For the most part their characters are not fleshed out since Hayward is the center of attention but the other characters occasionally get their moments.Overall Tulsa is somewhat above average with some noticeable strengths in the mix.";

	schema:reviewBody "No need to repeat the plot. Darn few actresses can dominate a man's picture like Tulsa the way Susan Hayward does. What an exceptional combination of beauty and boldness she was. The production values of this nonstudio project are unusually well targeted. Without them the movie would be little more than a good programmer instead of the sleeper it is. Credit those values special effects location shooting etc. to producer Walter Wanger who proved he had an eye for quality material both big budget and small e.g. Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956. Credit too underrated director Stuart Heisler with a sense of pacing and an ability to redeem difficult material with intelligent touches e.g. Beachhead 1954 Storm Warning 1951 etc.I especially like the nightmare montage of Redbird's Armendariz after he's set fire to the wells. Up to that point the derricks have been portrayed as stately umbilical cords of wealth and progress the life's blood of the city and state. So it's a surprise to see them suddenly depicted as hulking black monsters threatening everything around them. Contrast that dark depiction with the uncritically sunny yet thematically similar megahit Giant 1956. It doesn't take much extrapolation to update Redbird's vision to the oilbased crisis of today at the same time the values that evolve among the movie's characters show a surprising sensitivity to the need for a sustainable environment.I also like the way Indian Charlie Lightfoot Yowlatchie is shown as excelling at white man ways by becoming a shrewd businessman. Too often Hollywood portrayed Indians at extremes either as bloodthirsty savages or as noble primitives but rarely as 3dimensional human beings. The screenplay may pander at times especially with Pinky Wills but it's also unusually wellrounded for its period. I guess my only reservation is with the splendid special effects. Those burning oil fields are just so incredibly hot it's impossible to see Brady Preston enter the inferno with little more than a squirt of water. Nonetheless in my little book the movie is a definite sleeper. True as the lovelorn outsider Pedro Armendariz is no quirky James Dean. Yet despite its relative obscurity Tulsa is as wellacted and carries as much depth as its sprawling betterknown counterpart Giant.".

Nicest bit of the film was the conservation angle about too much oil in boom times ruins the land for the future when they dry up. Good movie.".

Tulsa is one of those. I was really pleasantly surprised. Moreover I had completely forgotten how outstanding Susan Hayward was. To see her again was a real pleasure. She not only acts superbly but she is some knockout in the looks department. Really outstanding. The rest of the acting was also of very high caliber This movie is certainly worth seeing.";

Whatever role she was given from costume drama Jack London 1943 The Lost Moment 1947 Tap Roots 1948 to film noir Deadline at Dawn 1946 They Won't Believe Me 1947 she approached each role with a burning intensity that made you believe in her. The ads proclaimed Miss Cherokee Lansing  Half Wildcat...Half Angel...All Woman!!! and Tulsa gave Susan her most exciting role of the decade. It was certainly apart from The Red Shoes one of Eagle Lion's most elaborate productions and a top money grosser.After the death of her father in an oil field disaster Cherokee Lansing Susan Hayward is determined to find justice from oil boss Bruce Tanner Lloyd Gough. Her father had been a rancher and had been caught in an oil explosion when he went to complain about the oil seepage polluting his cattle's drinking water. She hits a brick wall  Tanner will assume no responsibility not only for her father's death but also for the death of the expensive cattle her father had spent all his money on. A chance meeting with an eccentric character Crude Oil Johnny Edward Begley finds her the owner of several deeds to properties that may or may not have oil on them. She is then joined by Crude Oil Johnny's son Broncho Brady Robert Preston  a geologist who helps her. Money is running out and Cherokee goes to Tanner for a deal  if within three weeks she has not struck oil the leases are his. Just when all hope is lost oil is struck and Cherokee is soon being called Oil Queen of Tulsa.Jim Redbird Pedro Armendariz Cherokee's childhood friend is not particularly happy. Cherokee is ambitious and wants to buy up more grazing land to put up oil rigs on. Jim can see the oil is destroying the grazing land but Cherokee even though she realises the danger of pollution wants to match Tanner's out put. Tanner and Cherokee sign a deal to merge and Brady disgusted breaks off their engagement. Tanner suggests they drill on Jim's land but he refuses to give permission and Tanner takes him to court. The plan is for Jim to be declared mentally incompetent unless he consents. Jim drives out to his ranch in a daze and a huge fire breaks out. The fire is a spectacular climax and Cherokee who drives out to save Jim is suddenly surrounded by a ring of fire.Cherokee Lansing was a typical Hayward heroine  tough on the outside but vulnerable inside determined to achieve success but making mistakes along the way. Lola Albright as Candy shared one of the wittiest moments in the film with Cherokee  Cherokee  isn't that kind of Indianish to which Cherry replies Candy  isn't that kind of stickyish!!! Unfortunately she would have to wait until Peter Gunn came at the end of the 50s for her to find TV fame as Edie Hart.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Susan Hayward and Robert Preston star in this story about a wildcat wildcatter. In my opinion this is one of the most appropriate roles she did considering her reported sock it to em personality. I don't understand why this film isn't better known and is not even mentioned in rundowns of Susan's major films. She plays the toughasnails Cherokee Lansing part Native American daughter of a cattleman in the expanding oil country near Tulsa OK of the 1920s. She looks great whether riding a horse around her cattle ranch or elegantly dressed in her mansion after becoming wealthy. Quite a few westerns dramatized the conflicts between cattlemen and sodbusters or between cattlemen and sheepherders in hillier terrain. This film explores the conflict between traditional cattle interests and emerging oil interests. Cherokee herself personifies this conflict as she transforms from an irate spokeswoman for the cattle interests into one of the leading promoters of oil interests then backtracks under pressure from her sometimes fianc Brad BradyRobert Preston and her native American friend Jim Redbird to repromote a more balanced coexistence of oil and cattle interests. As often happens in such group conflict films there is a disaster sequence perpetrated by the established interests to try to get rid of the invaders. In this case it is a spectacular oil field fire well done although in reality such a conflagration would have been practically impossible to extinguish with the technology of the 1920s. The perpetrator Jim Redbird could claim he was just trying to get rid of the oil slick that was killing his cattle and that the fire just happened to spread to the adjacent oil fieldIt's not clear how?.This is at least the second film in which Susan was paired romantically with Robert Preston's character the other being Reap the Wild Wind. in which both die before the film is finished. Preston generally played supporting roles often as wishy washy villains. Here he does an excellent job as the topbilled male Brad Brady. His relationship with his employer Cherokee undergoes a rollercoaster ride starting very low and ending on a high note. The son of Crude Oil Johnny who serendipitously signed his oil leases over to Cherokee just before being killed in a barroom brawl Brady shows up unexpectedly at her drill site fresh from a degree in petroleum engineering. He teams up with Jim Redbird in recommending a conservative approach to exploiting any oil found. In contrast Bruce TannerLloyd Gough the reigning oil king of this region wants to drill many wells and pump out the oil as fast as possible. At first seen as an adversary by Cherokee eventually she agrees to cooperate and do things Tanner's way rather than Brady's way. Tanner even proposes marriage when he is thinking of running for governor thus uniting the oil king and oil queen. Jim Redbird also has romantic hopes with Cherokee. The oil field fire then becomes the focus. In the aftermath Cherokee rethinks things and makes her final choice of policy and lover.This film invites comparisons with the previous film Boomtown staring Gable Tracy Colbert and Lamarr. They are both excellent stories in my opinion relating to the development of oil fields and empires. Some viewers no doubt will strongly prefer one over the other. If you enjoyed this film by all means check out Boomtown There are several obvious differences. Boomtown was shot in BW versus Technicolor for Tulsa. The featured wildcatters were Gable and Tracy and much of the movie deals with their up and down relationship and fortunes somewhat similar to the up and down relationships between Cherokee and Brady and Cherokee and Tanner in the present film. Boomtown does not explore the dimension of conflict between cattlemen and oil developers. Both films end up promoting strategies for prolonged production rather than maximal short term production. They both include a spectacular oil field fire that threatens to destroy fortunes. Chill Wills a native Oklahoman is the only actor I know of who was in both films. In Tulsa he served as the occasional narrator and as a secondary acquaintance of Cherokee. He seemed to spend most of his time singing the title song Tulsa in a local club. Lloyd Gough serves as a charming if sometimes double dealing Bruce Tannner. His film career began late and was not very long.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it's true the quality of the print seen on TCM is disgraceful. To some extent it ruins the closing minutes of the film. But that's a not uncommon fate of the smaller production companies of the past and after all how familiar are you with WalterWanger Productions and EagleLion Films. We can only hope that someday there will be a restoration of what is a darned good film.There's nothing particularly unique about the plot  cattle rancher's father is killed by an oil rigging accident and she vows revenge. Although we never quite understand why she ends up becoming a willing partner to the man she blames for her father's death and that is perhaps the one great flaw in this film. There's the interesting subplot about which man will ultimately win her? The Indian who I think most of us today would root for? The highminded professor? The man who was responsible for her father's death? It would be interesting to see how the story would be changed if it were being filmed today instead of over 60 years ago.Susan Hayward plays Cherokee Lansing the cattle rancher daughter who becomes an oil woman in Oklahoma. But in reality Susan Hayward plays...Susan Hayward. And she and we can revel in that. Lest you think is this is one of her early films no...actually her 27th credited screen appearance.I enjoyed seeing Robert Preston here as the professor and one of the two consciences of the cast. Pedro Armendriz who was actually Mexican plays the Indian cattle rancher...the other conscience in the film. Overall a good performance with a few missteps. I didn't care for Lloyd Gough as the heavy in the film. I'm no fan of Chill Wills although every once in a while he would turn in a performance that I enjoyed and this is one of those times. In fact I wish he had had more screen time in this film. Although he doesn't get much screen time it's interesting to see Ed Begley senior in a very different role for him.If we had a good print of this film the closing scenes would be down right spectacular. With this bad print they look cheap. But the conflagration scenes earned the film an Oscar nomination for special effects.I recommend this film despite the poor quality of the print. Not a gem but a rhinestone in the rough.".

Though exaggerated the characterizations aren't too overdrawn and we're willing to believe that Susan Hayward's character discards her principles in favor or money. This is human nature  unfortunately. Similarly Tanner does not change his beliefs at the end.Hayworth's performance is betterthancompetent and Robert Preston does a great job imitating Clark Gable. Note the scene where the fully clothed Hayworth kisses Preston dropping a gown she's holding to suggest youknow what. It's a fine example of directors circumventing the Code. The actors playing Indians at least look like Indians rather than spraypainted whites.Though 65 years old Tulsa has hardly dated. The issues at its center have still not been resolved  nor have human beings developed better values.".

	schema:reviewBody "The generic Hercules plot can be found here. This plot is set in a tyrannical kingdom where an evil ruler often a queen faces a revolt from freedomloving rebels. Not surprisingly the queen casts lustful eyes upon Hercules and tries to win him to her side but he's more attracted to one of the queen's handmaidens who turns out to have ties to the rebels. The queen then resorts to magic spells to temporarily cloud Hercules' mind but he soon comes to his senses and joins the revolt usually enduring some bondage torture and testsofstrength along the way. The ruler is overthrown the rebels are victorious crowds cheer and Hercules gazes lovingly upon the handmaiden. There are only minor variations to this plot in The Fury of Hercules. The queen for instance is more misguided than evil and Hercules never once winds up in chains but all this is still familiar enough to confuse with a dozen other swordandsandal productions. If there's a distinguishing factor here it's Idahoborn Brad Harris who has not only the body of Hercules but also a goodlooking face. His acting is adequate and his personality passable. One wishes he had better material to work with. He should for example have more scenes in which he's completely barechested. Get rid of that strap over his shoulder! Weaselfaced Serge Gainsbourg so villainous in Revolt of the Slaves does the same sort of job here.".

The queen then resorts to magic spells to temporarily cloud Hercules' mind but he soon comes to his senses and joins the revolt usually enduring some bondage torture and testsofstrength along the way. The ruler is overthrown the rebels are victorious crowds cheer and Hercules gazes lovingly upon the handmaiden. There are only minor variations to this plot in The Fury of Hercules. The queen for instance is more misguided than evil and Hercules never once winds up in chains but all this is still familiar enough to confuse with a dozen other swordandsandal productions. If there's a distinguishing factor here it's Idahoborn Brad Harris who has not only the body of Hercules but also a goodlooking face. His acting is adequate and his personality passable. One wishes he had better material to work with. He should for example have more scenes in which he's completely barechested. Get rid of that strap over his shoulder! Weaselfaced Serge Gainsbourg so villainous in Revolt of the Slaves does the same sort of job here.";

Now rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that the entire movie seemed to be both routine and predictable which caused it seem rather dull.

I just bought this DVD for my collection and the color and quality is awesome.In Stoker's book Mina Murray is Harker's fianc and Lucy Westenra was Arthur Holmwood's fianc.

In Stoker's book the Lucy character dies and returns as a childlusting vampire so Van Helsing and Holmwood stake her as shown in the movie.Trivia Lee said the fangs he wore were easy to speak with but not eat. The contacts he wore were very painful and made him teary eyed and his vision a bit blurry.There are some scenes that were deleted. One was of the impaled Harker in the early stages of decomposition which was removed by the British censor when it was released in English speaking countries. Surprising because it was tame compared to other scenes. Another scene that was removed by the same censor was Dracula's stages of decomposing during his death scene. This scene was reportedly left intact in foreign speaking countries and the rumor is Warner does not consider the scenes to be worth pursuing. What U.S. audiences see is the jump to the final stage of dissolving. Lee says they were kept in for the Far East parts of the world because they were considered to be too gruesome in those days. There are stills floating around of them both. A solid 9 out of 10 this remains the best Dracula film ever made. Yes much better than the overrated Bram Stoker's Dracula.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hammer made several classic horror movies  The Curse Of Frankenstein The Curse Of The Werewolf Dracula  Prince Of Darkness The Devil Rides Out She The Quatermass trilogy amongst others. However for me their first Dracula movie is a true horror masterpiece.Although based on the novel by Bram Stoker the movie doesn't even try to adapt the book. Jimmy Sangster simply took the characters and events he needed and went off and did his own movie and it works brilliantly.Jonathon Harker arrives at Castle Dracula under the guise of being Dracula's new librarian. Actually however he's there to destroy the vampire. When he fails Dracula wrecks vengeance on Harker's fianc and family while Van Helsing arrives in the hope of ending what Harker couldn't....As I said nothing like the novel but it doesn't matter. This is the best Dracula movie ever made.To begin with the set design by Bernard Robinson is superb. His design of the castle is fantastic. Jack Asher the cinematographer does a stunning job lighting the movie especially Dracula's first appearance. The music by James Bernard taking it's cues from the title Dracula is wonderful bringing excitement dread fear and everything you could ask for.Terence Fisher Hammer's most important director keeps things going at a brisk pace staging some brilliant setpieces. Fisher made most of the early horror classics The Curse Of Frankenstein The Mummy The Curse Of The Werewolf. He also made many more movies for Hammer but this is his finest movie.Where Hammer got lucky was Christopher Lee. His Dracula performance is gripping. He's charming when he needs to be  watch the brilliance of his first appearance. He appears at the stop of the stairs looking menacing thanks to the lighting and music then walks down the stairs and introduces himself! Brilliant.But Lee is scary and terrifying as he needs to be when stalking Mina and Lucy but also almost passionate with them. And he proves a worthy adversary for Van Helsing.......which brings me to Peter Cushing. Simply put the best Van Helsing on screen played by the best actor ever in the horror genre. Cushing brings compassion to Van Helsing watch the scene with the child in the graveyard but also determination and obsession at ridding the world of evil. Even though he made a lot of horror movies in his career and thus is somewhat underrated as an actor he never gave a bad performance and here like Lee he is at the top of his game. it's no wonder that they both became like a doubleact in horror movies!! Although by todays standard some of the acting may appear wooden or 'ham!' and some of the effects especially in the movie's stunning climax may have dated the movie as a whole has not.It's still a battle between good v evil which reaches a climax in a brilliant finale in the castle as Darcula and Van Helsing face each other. If you watch carefully you'll see it's Van Helsing's knowledge that wins out not strength.When I saw this a child it scared the hell out of me. Time and repeated showings may have weakened the scare factor of this movie but this is stilland will always be my favorite horror movie.".

This is far and away a better vampireDracula film then the Universal film because of its action and pace its acting and its rich musical score and lush cinematography.  Now I like the old Universal film a lot but this one just seems to have so much more blood coursing through its veins so to speak.  The story is a variation on the novel and the Universal film is actually much more faithful but Horror of Dracula compensates by having the core of the film centered around two polarized opposing forces of good and evil.  Christopher Lee is excellent as Dracula bringing to the character a genuine menace and some sophistication mixed with brutalitylacking from Lugosi's performance. The real star however at least for me is the venerable Peter Cushing in the role of Professor Van Helsing.  Cushing's character is a man single of purpose in his quest to rid the world of Dracula.  Cushing brings a great deal of charm grace and incredible professionalism to his role.  Other performers are quite good. Michael Gough is very good in his role and Miles Malleson is very humorous in his minute role of an undertaker.  Director Terrence Fisher deserves most of the credit for the success of this film and the way vampires were to be treated afterward in film. Fisher directs with precision and creates a rich tapestry of vibrant colors and wonderful sets with his discerning eye for detail.  This film's importance cannot be overlooked as it revolutionized a whole subgenre of horror...and brought us two wonderful actors....Lee and Cushing...together in two of their greatest roles.  That is enough for me!".

	schema:headline " Bram Stoker's classic gets a makeover....Hammer style!";
	schema:reviewBody "Often regarded as the highlight of Hammer horror's oeuvre The Horror of Dracula stands up today as a fresh and inventive take on what is maybe the best story ever written. Hammer is a studio that has had many a fine hour and although this is one indeed I think that there are several other films from their ranks that just top it. Just being the operative word as this is certainly up there with the best of them. As you might expect the story follows that of Bram Stoker's original novel with a young man travelling to Dracula's castle and not returning. This attracts the attentions of Professor Abraham Van Helsing an authority in the field of vampirism who then sets out to slay the malevolent fiend that is the source of all the foul play in the movie Dracula himself.Although this is based on the classic story Hammer very much makes it their own. Of course the campy horror styling that that the studio has become famous for features strongly in the movie and serves in giving it that classic Hammer feel. Furthermore this movie features both of Hammer's greatest stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Christopher Lee may be no Bela Lugosi but if there was anyone other than Bela Lugosi that I would want to play Dracula Christopher Lee is that man. He isn't actually in it that much but the moments when he is are the best in the movie. He has an incredible amount of screen presence and all of that is transferred into the character of Dracula. In a similar way Peter Cushing plays Van Helsing. Like Lee Cushing has buckets of screen presence but it's all in a very different style. While Lee is a defined evil Cushing is more subdued which allows him to adequately play the hero as well as well as he plays the villain. I've got to be honest I prefer Cushing in the bad guy role but he still makes an excellent hero.Terence Fisher one of Hammer's premier directors directs the film and does a great job with it. The atmosphere of the Gothic period setting is spot on and a constantly foreboding and intriguing atmosphere is created throughout. The way that the smoke drifts across the graveyard in the movie is among the most atmospheric things Hammer ever shot. Dracula is a great story and this Hammer yarn more than does it justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vampire films before 1958 were always in black and white and partially were not very gory considering that a vampire drinks blood. The Universal films were done producing monster movies and the scifi era was born with all sorts of creatures from outer space invading our planet. Then the Hammer Studios from England came along and the world never knew what hit them we had blood we had sex we had great actors we had excellent sets we had frightening scares and most of all we had color! Horror of Dracula was the first vampire movie we ever had that was in color and we were introduced to Christopher Lee arguably one of the best and most memorable Dracula's. Standing over six feet tall the man had a true presence and one of the most memorable entrances for Dracula. He enters the room for the first time with a gigantic BOOM and I don't think we could have prepared for such a horror film.Jonathan Harker arrives at the castle of Count Dracula posing as a librarian. He is startled inside the castle by a young woman begging for help claiming to be a prisoner. Dracula then greets Harker and guides him to his room where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary and his true intentions are revealed he has come to kill Dracula. Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does Dracula arrives and yanks her away. Armed with a stake he impales the woman. But when he turns to kill Dracula the Count has already awakened and is waiting for him. Dr. Van Helsing then arrives at the castle looking for Harker. In the crypt Van Helsing is horrified to discover Harker lying in a coffin as a vampire. Staking Harker he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina brother and sisterinlaw of Harker's fiance Lucy Holmwood. It turns out Dracula already got ahold of Lucy and turned her into a vampire. After convincing Arthur that Dracula must be destroyed Mina under Dracula's spell lets Dracula stay in their cellar and now Arthur must kill Dracula before Mina meets the same fate as Lucy.So is this film worth all the hype it gets? I personally love the Hammer Dracula films but I do admit they have a certain camp value too. Jonathan is played with such lack of personality and is so bland at times you can't take him seriously that Van Helsing would send him to kill Dracula. But Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are what make this film great they're terrific actors who have great chemistry. Their last fight scene is just incredible and the effects are still outstanding by today's standards. Plus the image of Dracula growling with blood dripping from his fangs is one of the best images of a horror film and is the definition of why we are scared of vampires. Dracula is not only portrayed as a monster but a sexual predator. The scene with him biting Mina is so intense and has a great jump moment after he bites her with an owl screaming at Arthur. Terence Fisher knew how to truly give the audience a good scare. Horror of Dracula isn't just one of the best scary movies of all time but it's a true classic in itself. It's classy it's scary it's intense it's everything you could want in a horror movie. It doesn't kid around when the first image we see in the film is blood dripping down on Dracula's coffin you know you're in for a ride.810".

	schema:reviewBody "After the enormous success of 1995's classic mix of horror and sciencefiction The Quatermass Xperiment the relatively small studio named Hammer Film Productions decided to dedicate most of their productions to the fantastic genres. A sequel to Quatermass quickly entered into the studio's plans but it would be another movie what would become a success even bigger than The Quatermass Xperiment and the birth of what is now known as Hammer Horror Terence Fisher's The Curse of Frankenstein. Thanks to its use of vibrant colors and daring for the time sexual undertones Fisher's reinterpretation of Frankenstein renewed the interest in horror films and set the basis for a new style of Gothic horror. A style that would be perfected in Fisher's next movie for Hammer another reinterpretation of a classic of Gothic literature Bram Stoker's Dracula.In this version of the famous novel Jonathan Harker John Van Eyssen is a librarian who arrives to Count Dracula's Christopher Lee castle to work. At the castle Jonathan finds a strange woman Valerie Gaunt who asks him to help her escape from Dracula's enslavement. Jonathan agrees but she is not a normal woman she's a vampire an undead creature who preys on humans to feed on their blood. This doesn't surprise Jonathan as he is actually a vampire hunter determined to kill Dracula who is an ancient and powerful vampire. Unfortunately his plan goes wrong and ends up bitten by Dracula transforming him in the very thing he was going to kill. Days later Harker's friend Dr. Van Helsing Peter Cushing arrives looking for his friend but finds him as a vampire and is forced to kill him. However this is only the beginning as now Dracula has Jonathan's fiance Lucy Carol Marsh as his next target.Like The Curse of Frankenstein the screenplay for this movie titled Horror of Dracula in the U.S. to avoid copyright infringement with Universal's film was written by Jimmy Sangster who makes a considerably different story than the one done in Tod Browning's movie. For starters this time Van Helsing is not only the one with the necessary knowledge to hunt the monster but also a proficient fighter and overall a more active character than before. Count Dracula has also been reinterpreted as Sangster takes the sensuality of the vampire one step beyond and enhances his aggressive brutality without diminishing the Count's classy elegance. A notable trait in Sangster's script is the considerable amount of development he gives to his characters as while the plot a bit simplistic he makes us really care about the protagonists while at the same time making Dracula a fascinating creature.Once again Terence Fisher's directing is what elevates this work from a good story to a great movie as in Dracula he seems to take everything that made The Curse of Frankenstein a hit to the next level resulting in the definitive example of Hammer Horror. With Bernard Robinson's beautiful art direction and Jack Asher's excellent cinematography Fisher creates an atmospheric Gothic nightmare in bright colors that even today remains as fresh and influential as it was the day it came out. Fisher's use of color in horror here is even more calculated as also uses them to shock and terrify as exemplified by his fixation with the bright red of blood. This time Dracula is a real monster and Fisher makes sure to make him the ultimate predator however his seductive image is kept intact as Fisher plays on the Victorian sexual repression with subversive subtlety.One of the best elements in this version of Stoker's novel is definitely the acting of the cast which is for the most part of an excellent quality. The stars of The Curse of Frankenstein Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee appear here in the roles that made them legends. As Dracula Christopher Lee shows his very powerful presence making a terrifying portrayal of the undead monster that almost equals Lugosi's classic performance. On the other hand Cushing truly is the star of the film with the magnificent display of talent he gives as Dr. Van Helsing. Personally I think that nobody has given a better performance as Van Helsing than the one Cushing does in this movie. However the movie is not only about Cushing and Lee as Michael Gough truly shines in his role as Arthur Holmwood Lucy's brother forced to join Van Helsing's battle against Dracula in order to save his family.The rest of the cast is also excellent with great performances by Melissa Stribling as Arthur's wife Mina and the aforementioned Carol Marsh and John Van Eyssen who make the best out of their certainly small roles. Credit must go to Fisher's directing of his cast as well as he really seems to get the best out of each one of the actors making Dracula one of the best acted movies of the ones Hammer produced. In fact if there's a flaw in this Gothic masterpiece that would be that sadly there isn't enough time to fully enjoy each one of the diverse characters that Sangster Fisher and the cast have created in this movie. Just like any other story with multiple film versions it's hard to resist the temptation to pick a best version of Dracula specially when two highly celebrated films this one and Browning's are among those adaptations. Personally I prefer Browning's 1931 version over this one however Terence Fisher's Dracula is a masterpiece of Gothic horror as good as the one by Universal and my choice is based more on personal preferences than on any superiority in terms of quality. Thanks to Fisher's masterful directing and the amazing performances of its cast Dracula or Horror of Dracula as it's known in America easily ranks among the best movies that came out of the legendary Hammer Film Productions and simply one of the best horror movies ever made. 910".

	onyx:emotionText "After the enormous success of 1995's classic mix of horror and sciencefiction The Quatermass Xperiment the relatively small studio named Hammer Film Productions decided to dedicate most of their productions to the fantastic genres. A sequel to Quatermass quickly entered into the studio's plans but it would be another movie what would become a success even bigger than The Quatermass Xperiment and the birth of what is now known as Hammer Horror Terence Fisher's The Curse of Frankenstein. Thanks to its use of vibrant colors and daring for the time sexual undertones Fisher's reinterpretation of Frankenstein renewed the interest in horror films and set the basis for a new style of Gothic horror. A style that would be perfected in Fisher's next movie for Hammer another reinterpretation of a classic of Gothic literature Bram Stoker's Dracula.In this version of the famous novel Jonathan Harker John Van Eyssen is a librarian who arrives to Count Dracula's Christopher Lee castle to work. At the castle Jonathan finds a strange woman Valerie Gaunt who asks him to help her escape from Dracula's enslavement. Jonathan agrees but she is not a normal woman she's a vampire an undead creature who preys on humans to feed on their blood. This doesn't surprise Jonathan as he is actually a vampire hunter determined to kill Dracula who is an ancient and powerful vampire. Unfortunately his plan goes wrong and ends up bitten by Dracula transforming him in the very thing he was going to kill.

The story pays only lip service to Bram Stoker's novel Jonathan Harker travels to Castle Dracula to destroy the lord of vampires Christopher Lee but is instead defeated by him leading a vengeful Dracula to prey on his fianc Lucy and her sisterinlaw Mina with Harker's old friend Van Helsing Peter Cushing as their only hope.The movie is clearly designed to work against the expectations of an audience familiar with the 1931 Bela Lugosi version. Technicolor replaces the blackandwhite photography. Instead of an old ruin haunted by rats bats and spiders and armadillo! castle Dracula is a cozy welllit seigneurial residence. Christopher Lee drops the mannerism and heavyaccented English associated with Lugosi's portrayal of the count while Peter Cushing's Van Helsing receives a similar makeover Edward Von Sloan's old foreign doctor is replaced by a younger SherlockHolmes type played in the grand tradition of Basil Rathbone. The climatic showdown has him wrestling with Dracula. More importantly Hammer amped the level of violence gore in glorious Technicolor and sex to a level which might look tame today but that at the time pushed the British censorship system to its limit. For the first time in a horror movie vampires were displaying fangs rubyred blood splattered the screen.Along the years Dracula had become a metaphor for women sexual empowerment in front of a maledominated society considering sex as a threat and trying to repress it. Earlier versions did not dare to fully portray this metaphor and later versions watered it down by trying to make the Dracula character more sophisticated both the 1979 Universal remake and the 1992 Coppola's version for instance give Dracula a romantic interest in either Lucy or Mina making him a much less permissive metaphor for love instead of sex.This is what makes the Hammer version superior as it absolutely nails down the subtext. In this movie Dracula appears as an archetypal character the inhuman materialization of some ancient primary principle of nature. Part of this effect is achieved by Sangster's decision in the script to have Dracula not utter a single word once his vampiric nature is revealed at the beginning of the movie this deprives Dracula of any distinct personality hence enhancing his mythic status part by Christopher Lee's mesmerizing performance portraying the count with all the magnetism of a dangerous but fascinating wild animal part by Terence Fisher's clever direction every time Dracula is on screen Fisher have him move fast within the frame each of his movement amplified by his long floating cape making him a dominating presence over any other characters sharing the screen with him nowhere better illustrated than in the famous scene where Dracula attacks his vampire bride and where Christopher Lee's movements across the room are reinforced and amplified by the rotating movement of a globe. Another example is the introductory shot for Dracula it starts as a long shot of Dracula at the top of a stair the character rushes down the stairs toward the camera the shot ending with a closeup of Christopher Lee's face. This fast transition of the character from the background to the foreground leaves an overall impression of energy and overwhelming power.The erotic nature of the vampire's embrace is also made clear Dracula's victims prepare themselves for his nocturnal visit as if he was a lover arranging their bed and their nightgown for him anticipating with a clear excitement Dracula's bite. The transformation Dracula brings in them is astonishing. Before their encounter with the vampire they are model examples of submissive women in a maledominated conservative society Lucy the damsel in distress in constant need of a man to protect her Mina the model wife looking for her husband's every need. Under Dracula's influence they become more sensual more assertive more rebellious and independent much to the horror of their male guardians.Dracula was a hit for Hammer which became a brand name in horror and they subsequently shot many sequels to it but none of them reached the height of this first installment one of the best movie to come out from Hammer studios and without any doubt the finest Dracula movie ever made.".

It has atmospheric lighting and cinematography and the costumes and sets are wonderful colourful. The score is also very haunting while never becoming too grandiose the script is not stilted and flows well and the story apart from the odd slow moment draws you in and does a good job condensing the source material. It is beautifully directed by Terrence Fisher and there is some very good great even from some acting. Jonathan Mina and Lucy are believable and written in a convincing manner. But this Dracula will be remembered by me for two performances. One is Peter Cushing who is the ideal Van Helsing his interpretation is eccentric yet done with charm and grace too no overtheatricality in sight. The other and this is my personal favourite is Christopher Lee as Dracula who manages to not only be terrifying but also sensual although I like Lugosi and Oldman a lot in the roles Lee for me of the Draculas is the only one to capture BOTH these qualities. All in all in my opinion because of the production values atmosphere Cushing and especially Lee this Dracula is the best one. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen quite a few Hammer horror films and was excited to finally see their first Dracula film. Unfortunately while very well made and interesting not much occurred in it that was novel or interesting. Sure the story was changed around a bit so that now the motive for the killings is more revenge than just a need to drink blood but otherwise nothing that I haven't seen before. I guess part of the problem is that I've seen a couple of Hammer's Frankenstein movies and liked how they created a very different vision of the monster and monster maker from the 1930s Universal films. Here it's not too different from the Lugosi Dracula except that I still greatly preferred Lugosi. Unfortunately for poor old Christopher Lee is that he's actually given very few lines even though he got second billing. Michael Gough a perennial performer in Hammer and other British productions actually had a lot more to say and do even though he received lower billing.So my overall rating is a 7 since it is competently made and fun for horror movie fans. However due to it being very familiar material made in a rather familiar way I can't give it a higher rating. I have 5 or 6 more Hammer Dracula films on DVD yet to watchhopefully they'll shed some new light on the Drac legend.".

Horror of Dracula is by far the most beautifully produced.Yet Tod Browning's Dracula with Bela Lugosi as cinematically primitive as it is coming just two years after the first sound film The Jazz Singer remains the most effective.Why? Bela Lugosi of course.Dracula was Lugosi's 43rd film if you include his European silents. He'd been banging around Hollywood for over twenty years before he made Dracula. He was 49 years old. He either couldn't or never bothered to eliminate his Hungarian accent in all those years unlike many other European actors of the time.His foreignness worked perfectly for Dracula. Simply there has never been another screen actor like him. Perfect casting in the perfect role. Since Dracula is a period piece to begin with Lugosi's accent and staginess fits the character magnificently. He is mesmerizing and utterly convincing.He never before nor ever again achieved anything remotely as triumphant as that performance. Boris Karloff by contrast was a far more versatile actor whose active screen career outlasted Lugosi's by decades. Almost 30 years later Hammer Films produced Horror of Dracula with Christoper Lee in the title role.Lee's characterization occupies at most ten minutes of screen time. Yet he is indelible in the role. Strikingly handsome and tall he embodies all the dangerous eroticism and supernatural athleticism of Dracula.In color yet.Magnificently produced at the Bray Studios Horror of Dracula was filmed in the same English estate that Hammer Films used for numerous pictures  simply redressing the rooms for different films. It looks like it cost a fortune. In fact it was a cheapie.Yet the conviction and talent of all the actors involved raised the bar for horror films of the time.Truly Horror of Dracula is one of the bestproduced bestacted Draculas ever filmed.Yet today it falls flat. It is dated in a way that Lugosi's Dracula can never be.Alas one wishes Christopher Lee were given more to do on screen as Dracula. But he's almost a secondary character in the script as shot. Nor is he remotely Transylvanian. His accent is straight from Mayfair.By contrast Lugosi is the centerpiece of Tod Browning's hypnotic Dracula and deservedly so. We've never seen anyone like this character on screen before or since.Nearly 80 years on Lugosi remains the definitive Dracula.Astonishing really when you think about it.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic horror film from Hammer";
	schema:reviewBody "The first and best of Hammer's Dracula films starring Christopher Lee in the iconic role in which he is the most remembered actor of alltime next to Bela Lugosi. The film is striking for its emphasis on atmospheric horror at the expense of jump scares and busses particularly considering that it was released in 1958 in the midst of the giant radiation monster phase of horrorscifi moviemaking. Compared to the great majority of such films the dialog and action here are both toned down and relatively downtoearth or heh heh beneath it.The excellent setart design is a lasting credit to Bernard Robinson probably the best lowbudget designer of all time. He innovated the concept of spacing items out evenly in the space provided as they will strike the eye of the viewer instead of cramming all the objects at his disposal into the forefront where the camera's focus is. He also does just as good a job at emphasizing the deep red color scheme in the design as he did in this film's remarkable sequel Brides of Dracula which did not feature Lee or for that matter Count Dracula.The story is more or less the original Dracula story actually this film is closer to the source material than the original Universal film with Lugosi as they actually take the time to explain how Dracula fled his homeland and include the dialog with the official who guards the port turned into comic relief in this version. One change that perhaps improves the story and certainly gives the early sequences added narrative drive is that in this one Jonathan Harker John Van Eyssen only pretends to be visiting Dracula on business but is already a fullfledged vampire hunter and in league with Van Helsing Peter Cushing. Nonetheless he falls prey to Dracula's woman who tries to convince him that she is his prisoner.Ah. The women of Hammer! They make their debut here at least in the sense we tend to think of them  in tight period costumes and walking that fine line between ruined innocence and diabolical hunger. Carol Marsh is particularly memorable in this one her face like a child wavering between fear and excitement as she's seduced by the vampire. When she herself issues forth from the crypt to sate her hunger she picks a disturbingly young victim and blood relative and her face reveals a similar childlike state in the vampiric trance  likewise her suggestive comment to her brother Michael Gough confirms a childhood fixation. Vampirism was often associated in the old world with incest a theme that Tod Browning attempted to touch on in Mark of the Vampire but met with studiocensor interference. In this film and its sequel the theme was made explicit.Christopher Lee's performance is the one that made him whether he likes it or not. His bloodshot eyes and his bared teeth are unforgettable this is the most sensual and animalistic Dracula that had been seen on screen up until its time. I love his entrance and the way he uses the cloak to bring a majestic air to the character. The way he delivers lines isn't nearly as memorable as Lugosi and he may have known it since he asked to make the performance purely visual for the first sequel in which he appeared. Lee seems to have run in fear of his association with the character I can understand the reluctance to be associated with films like Dracula A.D. 1972 and in fact the Dracula character in general is so powerful that it can be difficult to escape but there's nothing in this original film for the actor to be ashamed of.Cushing introduces his interpretation of Van Helsing arguably the best in film history although he's even better in Brides because he makes the character more ambiguous in that film. I just get a kick out of how seriously he takes vampirism and the way he manages to make those elements seem totally serious  he is not a camp actor but he is a great Bmovie actor through his ability to make us believe crazy stuff like this is actually sensible. There's really no American counterpart to Cushing because no American actor that I can think of approached horror and scifi material with as much dignity  at least no one who could actually pull it off.Terence Fisher and his photographer Jack Asher also deserve praise both for the economy of their filmmaking and the sheer beauty of the way they approach the Gothic trappings of the genre. Their photography is in perfect sync with Robinson's set designs and shows why Hammer was the ultimate Bmovie studio of its era  careful collaboration between the artists and technicians that not only hides the low budget but enhances the production values to a level that even a better funded project might not have been able to achieve. The integrity of the production and the performances are in my opinion the source of this film's status and reputation as one of the great horror films of all time  a reputation which it well deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of Hammer horror films in general but my acquaintance was born from latenight rarities seen in black and white neither their famous Dracula nor Frankenstein have managed to live up to expectations created by their later work. Not only did I not think this was the greatest horror film ever made I discovered to my disappointment that it didn't even seem to be an especially good Hammer film.The colour balance of the new BFIsponsored print seems to be a bit off which is a shame after all the trouble of getting fresh prints made. The one made in the 1980s apparently now has very serious fading issues having developed a strong red cast the new version still manages to have the Eastmancolor 'look'. The colour lacks Technicolor intensity but doesn't look naturalistic either I'm not sure if this is an issue with the original negative or a decision made while tweaking the separations for the restoration. But this really isn't a significant problem for the film as such which has other issues.Dracula actually starts off quite promisingly. The plot is changed significantly from the Bram Stoker version  more or less a Hammer trademark witness their take on The Hound of the Baskervilles  as Jonathan Harker first encounters a damsel in distress who is not what he and the audience initially assumes and then is revealed in a strangely jolting moment to be rather less of an innocent abroad than Stoker would have had him. With the revelation that Harker is deliberately running his head into the noose preceding scenes take on a different resonance and the audience is dislodged from its comfort zone we literally don't know what's going to happen next.For my money Christopher Lee is used best in these castle scenes. For the rest of the film he's barely a character at all just an offstage plot mechanic. In these scenes he actually gets to react to events whether he is playing the suave host or dragging his vampire bride off the throat of his guest who in a movement of confused chivalry tries to intervene in her favour. And he is very fast and dangerous. The effect whereby Lee's footsteps were brushed out of the soundtrack  so that we see two men walking together but hear the footsteps of only one  is subtle but well worthy of note.But after this I felt the film went downhill. The villagers' acting in the inn scene didn't seem that good and the whole scene has little bearing on the remainder of the plot there is no apparent significance to the fact that the locals seem to be shielding the Count. And Michael Gough as Arthur Holmwood manages to be plain annoying I suppose the character is a bit of a prig in the novel but Gough combines that with sheer bad acting. Perhaps he simply wasn't comfortable with 'slumming' in a Hammer production? In the scenes he shares with Cushing the contrast is all too obvious Cushing makes his lines sound credible and natural while Gough sounds as if he's forcing an overreaction  with the episode in Lucy's crypt a particular case in point.The ladies are largely Hammer stock types there's an awful lot of running around in filmy nightdresses in this film and the characters have a very obviously 'period' look. Unfortunately it's the period in which the film was made rather than the one in which it's intended to be set...More seriously some aspects of the plot are far from clear we naturally assume that the Holmwoods are based in England especially given Harker's long and arduous journey but it is suddenly implied at a very late stage that they are apparently living in Switzerland and somehow only a few hours' travel away from Castle Dracula itself! The status of the little girl who calls Lucy 'aunt' and is on familiar terms with Mina is also unclear for a long time  the obvious conclusion is that she is the daughter of the house with Gerda as her governess but eventually we are told for some reason that she is the servant's child. These points are neither explained nor made plain.Peter Cushing is excellent throughout and supplies almost all the subtlety in the film. Memorable is the scene where he steels himself to stake his own colleague and the instant cut to the Holmwoods' house where he is understandably reluctant to admit just how Harker died the line where Arthur points out that the supporting death certificate has been signed by Dr van Helsing himself gains a far more worthwhile laugh than the rather tedious clowning later on. Cushing has a good deal of exposition to get through and always delivers it naturally and convincingly. There is no hint of bloodlust in him he has no liking for what he has to do but he does not shrink from it either. The scene where he is comforting the little girl in the graveyard has been rightly cited as an exemplar of sensitivity and intelligence.Alas the muchtrumpeted death scene at the end is a masterpiece of overreliance on special effects to the detriment of pacing. Dracula thrashes around losing limbs one by one  first a foot goes then an arm  until I was reminded of Monty Python's Black Knight and the final scene where his face is supposed to crumble away is largely undermined by a penultimate shot showing a pair of bright plastic eyeballs sticking out of a dustplastered mask. Frankly more effective horror in my opinion would have been to start with the scene where he is on the floor covering his face in agony and then cut straight to the image of the trouserleg collapsing into dust in closeup. The rest could be left far more unpleasantly to the viewer's imagination.".

	schema:reviewBody "The impact and influence of the Irish writer Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula cannot be denied or ignored and its significance in the history of horror literature and horror cinema is nothing short of phenomenal. Anyone who has ever read this famous story though may just agree with my opinion that certain chunks of it are extremely boring and heavygoing! Fortunately when Hammer Studios decided to film their version of Dracula in the late 1950s they chose not to stick too closely to Stoker's original novel. The end result is a film that is regarded by many as a masterpiece of horror cinema. Hammer's Dracula a.k.a. Horror Of Dracula  an alternative title that I hate features an actionpacked script by Jimmy Sangster and stylish expert direction by the nowlegendary Terence Fisher. This film also benefits immensely from the inspired casting of Christopher Lee as the title character and Peter Cushing as his nemesis Dr. Van Helsing.Both of these wonderful actors brought certain qualities to their respective roles and gave performances that many fans and critics now regard as being definitive and both of them successfully reprised their roles in other films. Lee's portrayal of Dracula has many layers. Initially he appears to be courteous and charming but we then find out just what an evil monster he really is and what vile acts he is capable of. Lee's Dracula also possesses a sexual magnetism that was not really seen in previous Dracula films. When night falls beautiful women are only too keen to open their French windows and allow him into their boudoirs.Cushing's Van Helsing is an educated man of science who is also equipped with sufficient knowledge about vampirism and the supernatural to be a worthy adversary for Dracula and other bloodsucking fiends.This film contains pretty much all the elements you would expect to find in a Gothic horror film  terrific sets and locations brilliantlystaged setpieces atmospheric lighting scary music and probably the greatest climax of any film ever made.If you have seen Hammer's Dracula before then you will probably want to own it on DVD and watch it over and over again. If you have not seen it then what are you waiting for? Track down this DVD release and enjoy one of the best horror films of all time. I only wish I could award this film more than five stars. It is THAT good.".

	schema:headline " Hammer's Best Movie and Maybe the Best Dracula Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Until the release of Horror of Dracula as it was called in the United States Bela Lugosi had stamped his personality so thoroughly on the character of Dracula that it seemed unlikely that anyone else would ever replace him as the quintessential Count. That all changed in 1958 when Hammer Studios released its updated version of the Bram Stoker novel. Christopher Lee who a year earlier had played The Monster in Hammer's Curse of Frankenstein infused new blood so to speak into the character of the bloodthirsty count.Unlike the 1931 Universal classic Horror of Dracula was shot in color with plenty of blood. The violence was much more overt and this time Dracula and the other vampires actually had fangs! Add to that a literate script plenty of Gothic atmosphere a rousing score Peter Cushing in the role of vampire slayer Van Helsing and a stellar cast of supporting players and the result was an instant classic that rivaled if not surpassed the Lugosi version.The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster takes numerous liberties with the Stoker novel. Some of the characters most notably Renfield are missing entirely and others like Jonathan Harker are quite different from the characters as penned by Stoker. That meant nothing to me when I first saw Horror of Dracula as a tenyearold boy because I had not read the novel. In fact watching this movie is what inspired me to read the book. And as much as I enjoyed it Stoker's novel did nothing to lower my estimation of this movie.For someone who is looking for a Dracula more faithful to the original source I would recommend Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 remake. Personally I prefer the Hammer version. I have seen it many times since its first release and even after the passage of more than 50 years it has not lost its power to frighten or entertain. Christopher Lee would go on to play Dracula in numerous sequels and in some nonHammer movies as well. Some of these sequels are quite entertaining in their own right but none comes close to approaching the quality of the first. Still whenever I think of Count Dracula I think of Christopher Lee just as an earlier generation equated Bela Lugosi with the Transylvania blood drinker.I have watched hundreds if not thousands of horror movies over the years and there is none I would recommend more enthusiastically than this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "So stated a UK cinema patron on being interviewed in the queue for this film back in 1958. However Hammer's first stab at the Dracula myth is so much more than just a blood bath it's a stylish fastmoving Gothic fairy tale that plays like a demonic ballet at times. It may well be Hammer's best ever horror film.Jimmy Sangster's script achieves a remarkable condensation of the novel but takes the story in new directions. Consider the following Harker arrives at Dracula's castle to become his librarian.He is however concealing his real purpose from Dracula  he is a vampirehunter sent to destroy him! Harker is bitten but stakes the vampire woman who cursed him.However Dracula awakens and finishes him off leaving Van Helsing Harker's ally to stake his friend and colleague through the heart.And that is just the first fifteen minutes! The standout cast are simply astonishing in their parts. Peter Cushing is a brilliant Van Helsing a man of action and resource whose obsession to destroy Dracula becomes almost a mania at times. And yet Cushing also gives him a softer side showing great concern for all those touched by Dracula's curse.And then of course there is Christopher Lee who gives the Count a powerful sensuality and demonic presence never equalled to this day. He may be the most convincing throttler in screen history choking Harker with a sadistic animal fury that has to be seen to be believed. He is nothing short of sensational in the role he and Van Helsing are superbly balanced foils for each other. The legendary duel at the end between the two adversaries is exciting and thrilling  a breathtaking climax to a superblypaced film.There's sterling support from Michael Gough slightly camp as ever but still likable Melissa Stribling as his wife and soon to be vampire victim and John Van Essyn as Harker. George Woodbridge takes on the suspicious innkeeper duties with fine aplomb. And even Catweazle Geoffrey Bayldon pops up as a suspicious hotel porter. There are some scenes of humour amidst the horror and they work surprisingly well. Best of all may be Miles Malleson's priceless undertaker.With top notch direction from Terence Fisher magnificent production design from Bernard Robinson and a classic music score from James Bernard DraCuLa!it seems astonishing today that the film only cost 81000. This is the best Dracula film ever made and one of the finest films the genre has ever produced.".

	schema:reviewBody "Horror of Dracula was released back in 1958 that is nearly 50 years ago when technical resources where much more limited than today. This established it's my opinion that this film is the best on the devilish Count ever made.Hammer's favorite director Terence Fisher builds a simple product but a very effective one where tension is present all along settings are well done atmosphere is correct music matches and the whole casting is adequate. It could be argued that the story doesn't follow exactly Bram Stoker's book but since movies is images and not imagination it is acceptable to make concessions in order to improve at its most what you see and Fisher surely gets the job done in this one.The transformation of the vampire from a cold mannered sophisticated man to a raging brutal monster is really amazing if you consider the make up limitations back then. It also has to do with Cristopher Lee's outstanding screen presence and his undoubted ability to play evil characters which he did a lot in his early days in movies. In fact he has not been matched by other fine actors who also wore the long black cape and the ring among them Lon Chaney Jr John Carradine Frank Langella Jack Palance Gary Oldman or even Bela Lugosi. Lee still remains as the ultimate Dracula.Peter Cushing Professor Van Helsing renders an intense and strong performance as usual in him as the man who chases the monster to release men from his terrible menace. Michael Gough is also precise and convincing as Arthur Holmwood whose wife Melissa Stribling and sister Carol Marsh become Dracula's victims.The final battle between Lee and Cushing at he Count's castle is masterly handled thrilling and has a big impact too. I read somewhere that it was Cushing's idea to include a face to face combat instead of the rather dull death of the vampire in his coffin as it is described by Bram Stoker if this is so the actor helped a lot in improving the film.The sequels Hammer produced starring Lee as the Count although probably entertaining for fans never matched this first one actually no other Dracula movie did including Francis Ford Coppola's lavish and expensive version of the early 90's. Horror of Dracula has all a horror film requires and is Dracula's best ever and one of the genre's best too.".

Judging by the subject matter I knew Exit would be at least somewhat risque but since I found out Garry Marshall directed it I assumed it would be tastefully done with little or no nudity.  After all this is the guy who directed films like Runaway Bride and The Princess Diaries and I think he produced Laverne and Shirley.  Naturally I wasn't expecting softcore porn! Maybe this isn't an EXACT clone of a late night movie on Cinemax but it comes pretty close.  I guess I would compare this with certain adult comedies like The Bikini Carwash Company and Beauty School.I was entertained and stimulated by some of the nude scenes and I never knew Dana Delaney had such an AWESOME body!  I will never look at her the same ever again!  And you've got the handsome Aussie Paul Mercurio so there's something for the guys and gals to enjoy.  Unfortunately I kept waiting for something funny to happen and my patience was running low.Many people think of Rosie O'Donnell as an annoying youknowwhat but that's because many of those people didn't know her until she started doing her talk show.  I watched her show sometimes but I admit there were times where I just wanted to slug her.  But she was putting on a singsongy Grated persona for the show.  I've seen her one of her standup acts on television and quite a few words had to be bleeped.  So trust me she doesn't have the same cleancut persona you've seen in her talk show.  And she does have a reasonable amount of talent as a comedienne which is why I wanted to check out the film in the first place.  At times she's funny at times she's not due to faulty writing and forced comic timing.  Dan Aykroyd has a few funny moments as well but also seems humiliated to be in this movie.  Don't expect the same highenergy manic Aykroyd performance he usually delivers.Exit to Eden works out well as softcore porn but doesn't totally deliver as a comedy.  The film would've worked out better if it didn't suffer from this identity crisis.My score  5 out of 10".

Like movies which have dared to display gay and interracial relationships in a realistic light rather than pandering to cliched stereotypes Exit to Eden shows that sm culture can be a very normal nonviolent part of the average person's life. Yes some of the lines are corny and the acting is less than convincing but Delany and Mercurio make a dynamite couple with some great chemistry.

You Got Served and Glitter are obviously bad but this movie is subtly the worst movie I have ever seen. I think that after Basic Instinct some Hollywood exec thought Hmm this is the next big thing mainstream movies with tons of nudity and sex! The problem with this thought is that athat wasn't the next big thing and b this movie has none of the traits of a mainstream movie. The acting in this movie is horrendous aside from Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd who play second fiddle to a couple of porn rate actors the plot is awkward because it has to squeeze in so much sex and the directing kind of feels like a porn movie. The plot is the worst part in my opinion there are two distinct plots in the movie that intersect a couple of times and finally conclude concurrently. Nothing all that unusual there but both plots are so meaningless and free from suspense that the only plot device evident is the switch between soft core sex scenes to Dan and Rosie standing around waiting for something to happen. The only reason to watch this movie is if you really need to see some nudity and even the sex scenes are nothing special. Most are just standard soft core porn only in order to pass it off as a mainstream movie even those are cut short. I vaguely remembered when this movie came out and I was pretty excited when it came on HBO but it was so bad that I could barely go to sleep. If you have any choice in the matter WATCH SOMETHING ELSE!".

The thing that came to mind when watching it was that it seemed like it had no structure. It was almost seemed like the cast just got together and decided to ham it up and see how outrageous they could get. It didn't really flow and sometimes it almost seemed like the cast could have been making up their lines spur of the moment. Everyone involved seemed to be having a good time but it looked at times like they forgot about the audience. It was watchable but at times just sort of THERE and never hooked me in.It had no problem keeping my attention but never became compelling or even very interesting. Storyline seemed to be thrown out in favor of clowning around and trying for outrageousness but something was missing. It's not really a movie that makes you want to view it Twice.Having said that I will also say this isn't dreadful and I've certainly seen worse. I'd give this about an average rating 5 of 10.

I do love Rosie's humor I think she's great. I do love Tommy Lucy's slave he's adorable. I think Dana could have been more forceful as the Lisa of the book alas this is a Garry Marshall movie so it wasn't going to get as graphic as the book. I've read a couple postings saying this is soft core porn but it's NOT this actually has a good plot but unfortunately it didn't deliver like it could have. This is so not soft core porn and if you think it is you really need to get out more. But then I guess erotica isn't for everyone OR some people need to be more open minded about things. I would suggest this movie to people who don't really get bdsm as kind of way to ease them into the idea. It's one of my fave movies But then I dig the scene. Overall I think it's a fun movie so that's why I gave it as many stars as I did. And the actors had balls for taking on this kind of movie I totally give them credit for putting themselves out there like they did.

In fact in many ways this film seems a lot like one of the Saint films because the hero is a reformed gentleman thief who investigates crimes for kicksand chases women along the way.

This isn't meant as a negative per seit's a very familiar but also very satisfying formula.Warren William was wonderful in the lead but he was also ably supported by a better than usual supporting cast. Having Ida Lupino AND Rita Hayworth playing the female leads was pretty amazing as neither were exactly stars at the time and it was just a case of dumb luck in casting. In addition the other supporting players all provided some needed depth to the filmsomething often lacking in Bmovies.As far as the plot goes it was pretty interesting but also purely secondarynot at all unusual for this type of film.

One of these was Warren William who this writer first noticed in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK 1939. Besides playing a Musketeer his roles ranged from Julius Caesar to Perry Mason. Additionally he played detectives Sam Spade Philo Vance and the Lone Wolf his most famous role. While the Lone Wolf series was never quite as good as the Thin Man's from all I've seen and read this entry was entertaining for a good many reasons most of all for having Rita Hayworth and Ida Lupino in the cast. Although a bit long in the tooth to be Ida's love interest he was 45 when he made this picture though he plays a 35year old which means he was really old enough to be Val Carson's dad despite her line quoted above he played the character with at least as much zest as William Powell imbued the Thin Man. Add to this some wellwritten and wellplayed supporting actors and you have a pretty fair crimespy drama. It's not THE 39 STEPS but it's still enjoyable to watch Michael Lanyard and gang in a mostly fine film series. Dale Roloff".

Criminals led by Ralph Morgan who are after some plans from the war department try to frame the retired crook for the theft.What makes this film a cut above the usual B detective film is the terrific cast. Not just any B movie has Ida Lupino and preelectrolysis Rita Hayworth as the female leads. They are not only excellent in their roles but beautiful Hayworth being on the side of the bad guys and Lupino playing Lanyard's young girlfriend. He complains about being old enough to be her father which in real life was true. Here the character is 35. This would undoubtedly get a laugh from today's audience. He was 45 and in today's youthobsessed society could pass for 60. Virginia Wiedler plays Lanyard's tomboy daughter lending the same kind of terrific support she did in The Philadelphia Story. Being a big fan of Warren William I'll watch him in anything. The persona he used for many of these types of roles  relaxed unflappable charming and funny  seems to hit the right notes even though in silents he played the villain. He's like a poor man's William Powell but in his own way every bit as good.Lots of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of this Lone Wolf mystery is standard for a B mystery a spy ring wants to steal the plans for an antiaircraft gun and then plant evidence so the Lone Wolf Michael Lanyard will get the blame. The cast of characters is typical too beautiful women dumb cops and even dumber cohorts of the master criminal and a dashing witty hero. But this one also has some especially amusing bits  chief among them Jack Norton in his usual role as a drunk. This time it's as Charlie Fenton at a surrealist party the whole surrealist party was a riot and worth watching the movie just for that. Fenton comes to the part with a card board clock face on his chest and Lanyard after sticking a few tree twigs about his clothes is dressed as the primeval forest. Priceless. Then there's the bit about Lanyard's driving around and around a diner trying to get a donut eating cop to come out and give him chase. And Virginia Weidler is wonderful as the Lone Wolf's tomboy daughter who wants to be a junior G girl. Shame that she appeared in no more series entries. The best line in the movie is that of Val's Lanyard's girlfriend Senator father. When Lanyard asks the Senator who attacked him was it a man in a gray hat? he says yes he looked like a Republican. Loved that throw away line. The only bummer in the movie is the role of Val played by Ida Lupino. Her character was an extraordinarily annoying wannabe wife of Lanyard. You'd think she'd get the hint when he was willing to go to jail rather than marry her. But no. She and Lanyard's daughter giggle about having the keys to his cell. Makes no sense. Even so it's a highly enjoyable movie thanks to some very funny scenes indeed. Besides what's not to like about Warren William? Also a plus is that TCM showed a beautiful print of the film.".

In the Drummond franchise the marriage just around the corner bit was carried from film to film though I don't know how the Lone Wolf series handled it. I'll have to wait and see.The caper involving Lone Wolf Lanyard Warren William also hints at those encountered by Drummond Charlie Chan and Mr. Wong to name a few other detectives of the era even though Lanyard isn't a detective per se but a retired safe cracker who appears to be on the right side of the law. I found it odd that he considered himself 'old' at thirty five it gives one a sense of how far we've come as a society that puts a premium on perpetual youth. Can you picture George Clooney admitting that he's old?The story involves a set of plans for a new antiaircraft gun with lead villain Gregory Ralph Morgan attempting to steal the prints and frame Lanyard for the theft. I couldn't shake the feeling that the whole thing was done pretty much tongue in cheek as the Lone Wolf seemed to be the only competent character amidst a jealous girl friend Ida Lupino bumbling henchmen inept detectives and an aspiring GMan er Woman daughter Virginia Weidler who likes to stick up the butler in repeated scenes. You even get Rita Hayworth as a femme fatale a pretty classy villainess I must say. It's too bad attempts at humor often fell flat like the Charlie Fenton gimmick at the surrealist party. Speaking of which you can see the folks behind this 'B' grade mystery didn't have a big budget to work with as party guests showed up with boxes or cellophane wrapped around their head making Lanyard's tree branch outfit look almost creative.Hey I did get a kick though out of that car chase around the coffee shop. By the third time around someone figured out there should be a police car in front of it so the cops could give pursuit!If you're a fan of the earlier mentioned mystery and detective flicks of the Thirties and Forties like I am you'll be able to have some fun with this one. They're interesting diversions and offer a glimpse of what audiences considered entertaining at the time. Just don't hold them under a magnifying glass.38.70 for lunch!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Warren William has stepped into the shoes previously worn by Melvyn Douglas and a rather miscast Francis Lederer in this saga of reformed jewel thief who has become the great American hero. He's framed for a jewel theft by an old foe Ralph Morgan and obviously there is something more going on than just revenge. He's caretaker to the preteen Virginia Weidler and keeps being stalked by flighty socialite Ida Lupino who just seems to be the cover model for the girl who can't say no. Morgan's involved with the gorgeous femme fatal Rita Hayworth who keeps involving William in her own part of the intrigue which gives several great bitchy scenes between her and Lupino. For her part Ida is certainly a devoted companion declaring I don't want to be safe! I'd rather be with you! when William becomes concerned about her safety.The highlight is a costume party where William steals the invitation sent to drunk Jack Norton wearing a clock around his neck and coming as midnight or in his case what it should be last call. A series of odd hats and other costumes makes this sequence deliciously funny with Lupino showing up having covered her face with a giant flower. Earlier she had declared her shock upon walking in on William in the shower telling his butler Jameson Last time he took a shower he wore his clothes! I wish he'd be more consistent! Since Melvyn Douglas wasn't going to continue with the series as he should have with the second one William is a perfect replacement and would lead the series with mixed results into the mid 1940's. Lupino and Hayworth went on to much bigger things but their interaction here is quite memorable. As a result Lone Wolf Spy Hunt ends up being perhaps the best in the series a very memorable programmer and certainly a definite curiosity for the presence of these two beauties.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that that is bent on making it into the long list of 'Terrible Dragon Movies' and it takes to its task with a dedication that's admirable. The actors are sometimes slightly bearable. The plot is ridiculous. There is absolutely no humor involved.The film starts off with a prologue of two Chinese guys we do not have the luxury of names in tacky costumes whacking at each other with weapons and saying grand helpful things for the sake of exposition such as 'Demon you are strong. But I still have the dragon spear!' followed by holding the spear up so we can see he is telling the truth and does indeed still have the dragon spear. One time during the fight the bad guy says 'After I kill you I will feast on your flesh' and the good guy says 'You have bad taste!' in a cocky selfconfident tone so the film's entire fanbase can cackle delightedly at how daring he is while apart from those two people everyone else can hold their heads and moan.The two warriors both die after the dragon spear gets lost and the good guy gives his blessing to a little baby he just left out in the desert nearby perhaps to watch the battle and cheer him on. Wooo! Go Daddy! Cut to 900 years later. Johnny Tao is a supposedly eighteen year old with the most annoying frizzy hair I have ever seen who lives in the sleepy town of Dry Springs manning the petrol station which is going out of business just like the rest of the town. Johnny has a friend named Eddie. Eddie is a UFO searcher. This occupation is not mentioned again for the rest of the film it is merely an excuse for Eddie to be using a metal detector so he can find the blade of the dragon spear.So Eddie digs it up and is immediately cursed by the spirit of the demon. Eddie's eyes turn flamered and he starts wearing a pair of black goggles. Why? Probably to cut costs. All that redeye stuff must be pretty expensive. Evil Eddie also enjoys pulling grotesque faces saying 'Feed me' every eight seconds in a deep synthesized voice and stomping around town turning the local people into zombie followers so they can eat food for him. That's right all the bad guy wants to do is eat. Feel the fear.This is where Mika comes in. She is a supposedly eighteenyearold Chinese girl. She rides into town and assesses the situation. She meets up with Johnny Lenny and Jenny ? to tell them what's going on and why they need to find the dragon spear. When Mika is giving vital exposition the film helpfully provides us with a spooky sound effect the whole way through so we can't actually hear what she's saying.This is the turning point for the film. This is where things gasp could it be...? yes they actually GET WORSE.Extras run around with digitally red eyes stealing food and making snarling noises. Actually I'm not sure that these people are even extras they're probably just random locals who wandered onto the set by mistake and were too polite to ask if they could leave. Somehow Johnny ends up in a gorilla suit wearing a pink graduation hat fighting the bad guys in the shop. Why? Because the movie thinks seeing a guy in a gorilla suit punching people is FUNNY. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HELP ME I'M DYING FROM LAUGHTER.Our film is then interrupted for a short documentary on lizards. Maybe the director thought that things were getting a little too violent and exciting so he decided to let us rest for a while by letting us look at a lizard on a tree.Lenny calls for backup and a girl police officer by the name of Angela arrives to help. She is easily the best character in the film. However the movie gets her recruited into the zombieclan within five minutes and then she disappears. I think it was at this point I lost all patience with the film.In between some scenes we cut to a shot of the moon perhaps to assure the viewers that there is no need to worry it is indeed still nighttime. Evil Eddie's gang then all go to the Wise Dragon fortune cookie warehouse to eat all the fortune cookies. Johnny arrives at the warehouse and fights one 1 zombie and wins because then Evil Eddie's voice can growl out of the shadows in an amused tone 'Your kungfu is impressive' so the viewers can quake with fear at how powerful Evil Eddie must be. Needless to say Johnny wins the day with his 'dragon flight' move in the Wise Dragon warehouse so he can reclaim the dragon spear and Eddie returns to normal. The whole town returns to normal and business thrives because of the publicity.Here's how the whole thing SHOULD'VE begun and endedDirector I have this really great idea for a film about a dragon spear and a guitar and lots of redeyed zombies Studio Executive Thankyou next.Or even betterDirector I Studio Executive Thankyou next.I can honestly say that the title is the most exciting part of the film. But I suppose when someone makes a film THIS bad all the studio can do is make up a really cool name for it and hope that somebody buys it by mistake. I mean obviously the director had a small budget i.e ten dollars but that does not excuse him from anything except special effects. You do not need a huge budget to write good dialogue or to think of a good original story.".

	schema:headline " The Rich Man's Roy Rogers!";
	schema:reviewBody "VIRGINIA CITY 1940 is not only a classic Warner western but is a classic Errol Flynn western as well! Flynn had great success with his playing in westerns which baffled and intrigued the actor no end and prompted him on occasion to refer to himself as the rich man's Roy Rogers.From a fine screenplay by Robert Buckner VIRGINIA CITY was solidly directed by Michael Curtiz and beautiful photographed by Sol Polito. The picture boasted a top notch cast! Besides Flynn it had stonefaced Randolph Scott on loan from Fox as Flynn's confederate adversary and sporting a dubious Mexican accent a prestardom Humphrey Bogart turns up as an unlikely Mexican bandit leader. The female lead is unfortunately taken by the awful Miriam Hopkins where oh where was Olivia? who plays a saloon singer come southern spy.The story has Flynn  fresh from the quarter deck of The Albatross in The Sea Hawk  playing a Union Intelligence officer in the closing days of the Civil War trying to prevent a shipment of gold bullion reaching the south so that the struggle of the confederacy could be prolonged. Not only do the opposing sides battle it out with each other over the gold but they must also contend with Murrell Bogart and his bandits who are trying to get their hands on the rich booty for themselves. And it all adds up to a very exciting movie especially when finally union and confederate join forces to thwart the onslaught of the Mexican outlaws.The excitement is heightened by the terrific score written for the picture by the legendary Max Steiner. Alongside They Died With Their Boots On 1942 and The Searchers 1956 Virginia City is arguably Steiner's best score for a western! The rich and evocative main theme first heard over the titles is a powerful statement for full orchestra. This theme used later in the film as the gold laden wagons inch their way across the plains heading south is Steiner at his most emphatic. Then there's a rollicking theme for the Stagecoach and a menacing motif  scored for horns  for the bandits. One of the composer's most arresting love themes is used in the film's more tender moments and the score and the movie comes to a close with a spine tingling version of 'Battle Hymn Of The Republic'.So VIRGINIA CITY is quite an enjoyable movie all round and is available in a Flynn western box set which also contains San Antonio Montana and the wonderful Rocky Mountain. But it is curious that on its original release in 1940 Virginia City was shown in Sepiatone. How come Warner Home Video didn't follow suit with the DVD? Would've been nice to see what it was like in that colour!".

	onyx:emotionText "VIRGINIA CITY 1940 is not only a classic Warner western but is a classic Errol Flynn western as well! Flynn had great success with his playing in westerns which baffled and intrigued the actor no end and prompted him on occasion to refer to himself as the rich man's Roy Rogers.From a fine screenplay by Robert Buckner VIRGINIA CITY was solidly directed by Michael Curtiz and beautiful photographed by Sol Polito. The picture boasted a top notch cast! Besides Flynn it had stonefaced Randolph Scott on loan from Fox as Flynn's confederate adversary and sporting a dubious Mexican accent a prestardom Humphrey Bogart turns up as an unlikely Mexican bandit leader.

	schema:reviewBody "Those who are not used to classic Hollywood productions will probably shun this picture if only because the plot is somewhat complex and there are some glaring mistakes. Nevertheless the simple fact that Errol Flynn is the lead role makes up for many of the shortcomings and makes this yet another solid production featuring Flynn and director Michael Curtiz.In a story somewhat reminiscent of Gone With the Wind and Flynn's previous film Dodge City Union captain Bradford Flynn escapes with his two sidekicks the same in Dodge City and travels to Virginia City to try and stop a group of Southerners from bringing 5 million in gold back from the mines of Nevada in order to fund the war which they are badly losing. This creates for some great tension scenes which I found very provocative between Flynn and Randolph Scott as the leader of the Southerners. Miriam Hopkins plays the role usually reserved for Olivia de Havilland and although she isn't as personable or warm as her Hopkins holds her own with both Scott and Flynn.As for Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican bandit he is highly miscast but still a solid part of this strong cast that all comes together in the end in a final shootout in the desert. Curtiz certainly knows how to stage action scenes and those here are some of his best. Of course like most others this film belongs to Flynn. He is one of the most charismatic and likable leading men ever and his talents are at their best here. He is one of the very few actors who can make a film better simply with his presence. This one is no exception.".

If the cinematography would be on the same level as Rocky Mountain the BW would be more acceptable. Contrary to some comments I did not find Humprey Bogart's performance bad it is just not what we expect of him considering the big star he became. Just forget that Murrell the bandit is Bogart and it is OK. Great music by Max Steiner. Randolph Scott has one of his best performances as Irby the officer from the South who is trying to take the gold of Virginia City in a caravan.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The only regret that I have is that I had never saw it up until 2 years ago. The movie does not take sides and gives you a neutral fly on the wall view of a story unfolding. Randolph Scott plays a Southern officer who is sent to Virginia City NV to obtain gold so that the South can finance the Civil War. They need to do this simply because this late in the war and with the South losing the Confederacy no longer has financial credit with foreign powers. Errol Flynn is a Northern officer sent to stop Scott from completing his mission. There is a back story concerning these two men which adds to the tension. I left out much of the details because I do not want to ruin it for anyone who checks it out. This movie proves that who is the bad guy depends on which side you are on as both the main characters and those associated with them are simply doing what they feel is right. Great action great building of the characters and you wind up not sure who to root for. Two great main actors great supporting cast and even Bogart is here showing that westerns should have been added to his studio lineup more often minus the whole halfMexican bandito thing. This movie should be given a chance and is just as good today as it was in 1940.".

	schema:headline " Too bad you and I had to be on opposite sides of the fence in this I think we might have been friends.";
	schema:reviewBody "By December 1864 the Confederate Army was on it's last legs literally and figuratively Virginia City explores a final attempt to finance the Southern cause via a bold plan by the Confederacy to smuggle five million dollars in gold from Virginia City Nevada back to Richmond Virginia. Captain Vance Irby Randolph Scott volunteers for the assignment and pits his military skill and acumen against a resourceful Union Captain Kerry Bradford Errol Flynn. The story opens with Irby foiling an escape attempt by Bradford and his men from Richmond's Libby Prison alternatively known by it's guests as the Devil's Warehouse. Bradford lives for the day he can repay Irby for the indignity of foiling his plan not to mention the months of tunneling in vain as Irby was aware of the dig for just about as long.Along the way an uncharacteristically miscast Humphrey Bogart makes his appearance as a Mexican bandit with the unMexican name of John Murrell. He looks as uncomfortable here as he did opposing Jimmy Cagney's character in The Oklahoma Kid Westerns were definitely not his forte. Though he did get a good line in on the stagecoach to Virginia City with a derringer trained on Bradford he states I do not particularly want to shoot you mister but I do not mind. I tried to imagine him saying We don't need no steenking badges.Miriam Hopkins portrays Julia Hayne the love interest for both lead antagonists with Southern sympathies but an eye for a spy that is Captain Bradford. She spends a good deal of time agonizing over loyalties while balancing her work life as a saloon singer in Virginia City. I must be pretty tone deaf as I found her singing to be entertaining enough unlike other posters for this film. On the other hand it was supposed to be a cover and a poll of drunken rowdy prospectors would score more for looks than voice anyway.I got a kick out of the ongoing banter between Bradford's pair of buddies Marblehead Guinn Big Boy Williams and Moose Alan Hale. Their constant understated bickering lends just the right touch of comic relief to the film. There's a funny scene in the saloon as the boys begin drinking when they look to a picture of a semi clad woman above the bar one exclaims I wonder what she'd do if we had another drink.I didn't realize it until the closing credits but young Cobby Gill was portrayed by Dickie Jones who grew up to be the Range Rider's sidekick in the early 1950's series of the same name. For my money Jones was the best stunt rider of them all some of his work in that series is incredible.I was intrigued by some of the shooting styles offered in the film. In a couple of shootouts Marblehead is shown throwing his gun in the direction of fire I can't see how that would be effective for accuracy. It was also the way Wild Bill Elliott used his six guns at least in his Red Ryder movies. During the attack by Murrell's gang on the gold train Bradford impresses Irby with his wing fan shooting. It was during this scene that a highly unusual if not unbelievable development took place. After taking a life threatening bullet Irby turns over his command to Bradford! I'd like to see the rule book on that one.For all his military discipline Bradford ultimately weighs in with his own conscience. Deliberately destroying the gold wagon to prevent it's capture by Murrell Bradford is arrested and found guilty of high treason sentenced to death by hanging on April 9 1865  on the day General Lee is to surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House. In a gallant and patriotic ending excellent camera work captures President Lincoln's silhouette as he pardons Bradford the anxious Miss Hayne having pleaded her case for the man she loves. It's as flag waving a moment as it gets as Lincoln declares the South as not having lost but having been found.".

	schema:reviewBody "Virginia City released in 1940 is a film that could have been rated as a western classic because of the cast members alone.  Against the backdrop of the American Civil War Errol Flynn Union Captain was up against Randolph Scott Confederate Colonel with Miriam Hopkins supplying the love interest between the two.  Flynn breaks out of a Confederate prison commanded by Scott during the latter days of 1864 a period that saw the South's dwindling resources virtually shrink to nothing.  There is a slim chance to smuggle a multimillion gold shipment from Virginia City Nevada to the South.  Scott is given the assignment and Flynn hearing of the plan is given the job by the Union to prevent the smuggled gold from reaching the Confederacy.  There's the overview.  The weakness comes in casting Humphrey Bogart as a MexicanAmerican bandit whose main interest in the gold is to steal it for himself.  Bogart's miscasting really distracts from the film even though it is no fault of his own.Besides the stars in the film there's good support cast members from Guinn Big Boy Williams Alan Hale Sr. John Litel and Moroni Olsen all veterans of the Western genre.  Add a stirring music score by Max Steiner plus sweeping vistas of the West and the struggles of the Confederate sympathizers in their efforts to succeed in their task and you have a film that could have been great but one that falls short.  It is worth watching however.  710".

	schema:reviewBody "At the end of Michael Curtiz's enormously successful Dodge City in 1939 Olivia DeHavilland decides she's married a professional lawman after all so Guinn Williams ends the film with a resounding 'Virginia City here we come' as Errol Flynn will now take the job offer of marshal.Too bad that they didn't make a sequel with those same characters. A year later when Virginia City was made it was a fanciful Civil War out west tale about a Confederate scheme at the last minute to smuggle several millions in gold bullion into the South for supplies to keep the war going. And what happens in the end strains credulity to say the least.Carried over from the cast of Dodge City are Errol Flynn Guinn Williams Alan Hale and Ward Bond. Olivia DeHavilland chose not to make the trip. At that point in her career she was fighting with Jack Warner to not keep playing crinolined heroines. So Miriam Hopkins was the leading lady here.Other reviewers have said how lousy Miriam Hopkins was as a singing saloon chanteuse. In fairness to Miriam I have to point out that she's a Confederate spy singing a Union song The Battle Cry of Freedom with about as much enthusiasm as she can muster. And she's also in that establishment the Sazerac saloon not being paid for her voice.Errol Flynn a former prisoner at the Confederacy's Libby Prison after an escape gets an assignment to check out rumors that Southern sympathizing mine owners are going to smuggle their find into the Confederacy. At the same time the former commandant of Libby Randolph Scott gets an assignment to bring the gold out.Of course when they meet at the Sazerac all pretense to undercover is out the window. But Scott's got an ace up his sleeve in Miriam Hopkins who Flynn is kind of sweet on. She leads Errol astray and into the Confederate hands. Talk about true life casting Errol being led astray by his hormones.There's a third player in this game and that's Humphrey Bogart who plays the Mexican bandit leader Murrell with an accent like the Frito Bandito's. Bogey was also fighting for some better roles and in fact he got one the same year in High Sierra that would turn his career around. What possessed Jack Warner to cast him in this role God only knows. Bogey's looks dumb in this part and he knows it. Why couldn't they just get someone like Gilbert Roland for the part?There's quite a shootout in the desert over the gold. What happens to it is rather unbelievable let's just say that Errol Flynn took a great deal upon himself and he was quite the lucky fellow to get the fate he got. Virginia City is entertaining enough in a B western sort of way. But if I had three film icons like Errol Flynn Randolph Scott and Humphrey Bogart in my film I'd sure have looked for a better property pardner.".

	schema:headline " Despite what you might think not a sequel to DODGE CITY and features the weirdest casting choice I've seen in some time!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good and watchable Warner Brothers Western that COULD have been a lot better if it had been a true sequel to the Flynn film DODGE CITY. You see just a year earlier Flynn and his two sidekicks Alan Hale and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams had starred in the marvelous film DODGE CITY. At the very end the trio plus Olivia DeHavilland who is strangely absent from this next film agree at the film's conclusion to leave Dodge City and move to Virginia City to bring the town law and order. Well here there are again but the plot and characters have been changed so much it really isn't a sequeleven though it was announced as one in the previous film. It really looks like the writers never even saw the other film or read the script as this time Errol and his buddies are not exConfederate soldiers but Union spies! However the mood and tempo of the two films are awfully similar. In fact they are so similar that it is very very easy to mix them up in your mind. As just one example both feature a cute little boy in a dead meat role. In other words they are nice kids who ultimately MUST be killed because that is part of the Hollywood formula. Apart from a small age difference the two boys look almost exactly the same. The films also feature lawless towns and the same fearless trio who arrive to clean it up and do good. And most of the rest of the actors are identical and play very very similar parts!So here is an easy way to distinguish themDODGE CITY is filmed in gorgeous Technicolor and VIRGINIA CITY features Humphrey Bogart as a swarthy Mexican bandit!!! Oh and by the way Bogart as a Mexican actually is a lot worse than it sounds!! When it comes to stupid casting decisions this SHOULD rank up there with John Wayne as Genghis Khan or Katherine Hepburn as a Chinese woman or Liberace as a handsome leading man torn between his music and his woman though oddly the dumbness of this casting has mostly been forgotten over the years. Despite the movie being excellent overall the few scenes where Bogart speaks are unintentionally hilarious.Now in addition to Bogart there is another weakness in the film and that was the casting of Miriam Hopkins as Flynn's love interest. After having seen the immensely beautiful Olivia DeHavilland in the previous film it really was odd that they would have chosen a woman who just looked old and not particularly attractive. I know this sounds cruel but I just couldn't see Flynn falling for her. Plus in DODGE CITY they fortunately never got DeHavilland to sing but passed that chore on to Ann Sheridana woman with a very competent voice. But Miss Hopkins sang her own songs as a bar room chanteuse and sounded pretty awful. So I assumed that the guys in the bar have been pretty drunk to enjoy having her as their host.Now despite all these many complaints I still gave the movie a score of 7. This is possible due to the always wonderful acting of Flynn in his prime as well as the rest of the cast. Bogart and Hopkins aside the cast was terrific McHugh Hale Williams and others and adding Randolph Scott to the mix was a very good thing. Good old fashioned Warner Brothers funnot to be missed by fans of the genre.".

	schema:headline " A lively western with an energetic Errol Flynn and the miscast but fascinating Miriam Hopkins";
	schema:reviewBody "Could any two less likely major stars be chosen to carry a Hollywood oater? There's Errol Flynn an Australian with an accent of sorts who made his name waving a sword at sea and shooting arrows in forests. There's Miriam Hopkins one of the most sophisticated and slyest actresses Hollywood has ever seen but whose career as a major star in major movies had declined since the late Thirties. Yet together with Randolph Scott and director Michael Curtiz they turn Virginia City into a rouser part fullblown action western and part patriotic soap opera. With the movie slightly more than two hours long Curtiz crams in more setups than probably he should have but even all those separate pieceparts look good. Kerry Bradford Flynn is a Union officer imprisoned in Libby Prison just outside of Richmond. Vance Irby Randolph Scott is a Confederate officer assigned to run the prison while he recuperates from war wounds. The war is not going well for the Confederates. Bradford and two pals break out just as Confederate spy Julia Hayne Miriam Hopkins based in Virginia City Nevada arrives for a meeting with old friend Irby. Confederate mine owners in Virginia City have accumulated enough gold for a major shipment to Richmond...5 million in bullion that could change the war. With Jefferson Davis' approval Irby is ordered to go to Virginia City and organize a wagon train to try to get the gold down to Texas and the Gulf coast then by ship back to Richmond. But Union spies know the gold is being readied. Bradford back in uniform convinces his superiors to send him to Virginia City locate the gold and stop the shipment. And who should be on the stagecoach taking Kerry and his two pals to Virginia City? Yes Julia Hayne. And not just her. There's a man with a hairline mustache a twitchy way a false smile and a strangely uncertain Mexican accent. It's Humphrey Bogart disguised as the renegade John Murrell the leader of Murrell's Marauders a group of hardriding robbers and killers. The stage is set for action...hairbreadth escapes runaway stage coaches tense standoffs rousing songs at the Sazerac Saloon where Julia is the headliner as a singer and dancer a desperate wagon train running out of water and attacked in the desert by Humphrey Bogart bullet extractions beautiful desert scenery a court martial and a cavalry charge to the rescue not in that order. We even get a dignified Jefferson Davis a jocular General George Meade and a merciful and wise Abraham Lincoln who recites parts of his second inaugural address to a tearyeyed Julia. Errol Flynn does a bangup job but Miriam Hopkins and Humphrey Bogart are game but miscast. Hopkins is as unlikely an earnest Southern spy as she is a saloon singer yet she's still highly watchable as both. She was born and raised in Georgia but the softness of a highbred Southern belle with something approximating a New England tease makes for an accent that's uniquely hers. Her lower choppers are charmingly irregular and she can handle a high kick with ease. Hopkins was so mischievous and sly an actress that it must have been hard to find the right movies for her. That she took Hollywood less than seriously probably didn't help. For her best work you'll need to watch Trouble in Paradise The Smiling Lieutenant and Design for Living. At 47 she was memorable as Aunt Livinia in The Heiress. As for Bogart after this movie he probably counted his blessings that in the following year he broke through with High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon. If Bogart hadn't scored these two it's just likely he would have been stuck for the rest of his life competing for character parts with J. Carroll Naish. Thank goodness we have Randolph Scott to provide the movie's steadfastness and old fashioned honor. He may be playing a reb he may be up against Errol Flynn as a hero and a suitor but Scott knows how to hold his own in these kinds of pictures. On balance Virginia City is easy to watch thanks to Scott and Flynn. Miriam Hopkins makes for a unique kind of heroine and even Humphrey Bogart's secondary villain is interesting in a ludicrous sort of way.".

	schema:reviewBody "VIRGINIA CITY the nonsequel to Errol Flynn's big 1939 hit DODGE CITY gives the impression that the Warner Brothers were suffering from a shortage of good Western scripts in 1940. The film 'borrows' much of Max Steiner's DODGE CITY musical score reunites Flynn with DODGE CITY costars and friends Alan Hale and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams playing virtually the same characters with different names and attempts the visual 'sweep' of DODGE CITY in black and white with a smaller budget. What is most memorable about the film however are two truly offbeat casting choices Humphrey Bogart as a halfbreed Mexican bandit and tonedeaf Miriam Hopkins as a saloon singer. Bogart did NOT want to do the film he felt himself miscast in westerns but faced suspension if he didn't 'show up' for work and his unconvincing Mexican accent and forced performance give clear evidence to his unhappiness with the role. Hopkins whose reputation had been established in preProduction Code sex comedies and dramas of the early thirties was at 38 already past her prime and unbelievable as a love interest for either Flynn or Randolph Scott. As a 'sexy' chanteuse her singing is so incredibly bad that it must be heard to be believed!The plot of an undercover Union captain Flynn attempting to wrest a shipment of southern gold from a wagon train headed by the Confederate colonel Scott who had run the prison camp he'd previously escaped from gets bogged down in subplots and in trying to appease viewers from both sides of the MasonDixon line makes everyone so noble that you wonder why there was a Civil War! Certainly in Randolph Scott's case the role wasn't much of a stretch and would be one he would repeat frequently with minor variations for the next twenty years. Tasmanian Flynn however appears more comfortable in the Western genre than he had in DODGE CITY and after the on and offscreen battling with Bette Davis in his previous film THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX it must have felt like a vacation even with hated director Michael Curtiz helming the project!VIRGINIA CITY is ultimately a 'B' movie with an 'A'list cast and crew and while the end result isn't terrible it isn't a film that either Flynn or Bogart would list as among their best efforts.".

Check out Objective Burma and you will see what I mean. It is also hard to find a Civil War movie that is sympathetic to the North back in the 40's and 50's.

The film has two main drawbacks the severe miscasting of Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican bandit named Morrell ?! and Miriam Hopkins as the FlynnScott love interest. Maybe she was being punished by Jack Warner for some transgression or maybe she wanted to try to try something different but Hopkins just isn't up to it. She plays her part of a saloon girlspy like a grand dame when the part calls for the sexy comedic touch of an Ann Sheridan. Bogart's miscasting should be selfevident you keep expecting to hear him turn to his gang of bandidos and say Alright you mugs . . . and Randolph Scott is somewhat stiff but still a better choice than Ronald Reagan who was reportedly offered the part first. Other than that though the film has the usual Warner Bros. panache. The action scenes are firstrate the castconsisting of what came to be known as The Warner Bros.

	schema:reviewBody "As if to signal that the plot of VIRGINIA CITY would be borrowing many elements from previous Warner westerns this one begins with stock footage from other studio westerns before settling down to tell a story that goes off in several different directions but remains in desperate need of a cohesive plot.The first plot involves the greed for gold that has a Mexican bandit HUMPHREY BOGART interfering with the plans of ERROL FLYNN and RANDOLPH SCOTT involving the shipment of gold from Virginia City to aid the losing Southern cause during the Civil War. The second is a lame romantic trio wherein Flynn and Scott are vying for the affections of a dance hall girl who is really a Southern spy MIRIAM HOPKINS. The third plot concerns subsidiary characters including a little boy DICKIE JONES who is aiding the rebels and meets an untimely deathjust like the little boy in DODGE CITY Flynn's bigger and better western.So many remarks here comment on Max Steiner's score but most of it includes snippets of Southern folk tunes for the Confededracy andor Northern tunes for the Union music and very little of the score is original background material. Only the main theme heard over the credits is the single original composition for the whole film. The score in other words has tough competition from the lusty music he wrote for DODGE CITY a far more complex and memorable score.But the film's main drawback aside from a very busy plot that takes two hours to unravel is the miscasting of Miss Hopkins as singer and dancer at a saloon wherein the stage looks suspiciously like the same one used for Ann Sheridan's saloon gal in DODGE CITY. Hopkins can barely carry a tune and is clearly a bit overaged for this kind of role. The other unfortunate miscasting is Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican bandit giving accented orders to his henchmen in an accent that barely conceals his Brooklynesque speech. Bogie looks extremely uncomfortable in the role.Flynn is fine managing to disguise the fact that there is absolutely no chemistry between him and Hopkins who eyes him with cold disdain for the climactic closeup of the two holding hands. What were they thinking? The usual Warner stable of contract players delivers their lines on cue with panache but it's really no use. It's all been done before and doesn't even have the benefit of Technicolor to make good use of those striking outdoor location sites.Only diehard fans of Flynn and Scott will worship this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the few films to dramatize the often overlooked importance of newly mined Western gold and silver in the financing of primarily the Union war machine during the Civil War. It also dramatizes the historic tunneling escape of 100 Union officers from the notorious Richmond Libby Prison. And who else to star in such a drama than Errol Flynn with true southerner Randy Scott as his chief Confederate nemesis. Throw in some Mexican bandidos implausibly led by Humphrey Bogart as the third element in the fight for the gold bullion Miriam Hopkins as a Southern spy dance hall girland romantic bait for Flynn and Scott and great Max Steiner background music and you have the basics for a complicated and exciting Civil War Western screen play.... A decade later in Hangman's Knot Scott would again play the leader of a small Confederate cavalry detachment intent on stealing gold out of Nevada to help prolong a nearly dead Confederacy. Again there was a 3 way battle for the gold and again the fate of the gold is diplomatically left unsettled.While the screen play provides for an interesting film this is not to say that is the most plausible screen play. Thus Flynn and Scott are initial antagonists in the Libby Prison. Later they are very coincidentally assigned as opponents in relation to a planned secret gold shipment from Virginia City to Texas. Given the dramatized difficulties of the overland transport of a large amount of gold over primitive roads through mud sand and occasional rivers the Confederacy would likely have been long dead even in the unlikely case that this gold eventually reached Richmond. Near the end of the film symbolism clearly overtakes plausibility as the driving force of the plot. Some reviewers find this incongruous turn of events a flaw but I see it as a device to get across the take home message behind the film. Thus Scott's death clearly symbolizes the impending death of the Confederacy. The implied union of Union intelligence agent Flynn and Mariam's southern spy character after Scott's death as well as the prior combined ConfederateUnion defense of the gold against Bogart's bandidos clearly symbolizes the impending reunion of the US against common enemiesthe Nazis being the relevant contemporary foe for audiences when this film was released. Flynn's eloquent speech at his treason court martial clearly symbolizes Lincoln's rhetoric of binding the nation's wounds. Also Flynn's Scottinfused changed attitude toward the disposition of the gold and Mariam's supposed quick journey to Washingtonby magic carpet? to plead with Lincoln to prevent Flynn's imminent execution are highly implausible heroic acts. Flynn's knuckleheaded sidekicks played by Alan Hale and Big Boy Williams were supposed to provide occasional comic relief as in the Flynnstarring Santa Fe Trail and Dodge City. However Bogart's forced acting with a phonysounding Mexican accent perhaps elicits as much humor in today's audiences. His character was clearly modeled on the preCivil War Californian Mexican bandit leader Juan Murietta. However strangely Bogie has the unMexican name of John Murrell with an obvious resemblance to the name of the former Mexican outlaw! Yes there was an infamous outlaw leader named John Murrell long dead before the Civil War who operated in the Mississippi river area robbing people traveling on the river and the Nachez Trace among various other criminal activities. His likeness was featured in the later Disney film Davy Crocket and the River Pirates.Now getting to the point of my title By coincidence there were actually 2 Virginia Cities in the western US that were important centers of gold or silver mining during the Civil War. The newly discovered Comstock lode next to emerging Virginia City NV produced mostly silver but also significant gold as did a few other NV sites. During the war abundant placer gold was discovered near the emerging boom town of Virginia City Montana Territory. It would play a central role renamed Mineral City in the classic Clark Gable western The Tall Men. Now it happens that the majority of people in this area were southern secessionistsbut draft dodgers. Hence the Lincoln administration was very concerned that much of this gold might end up in the Confederacy. Thus a vigilante group was organized to help prevent this. Also a program of subsidized immigration of northerners into this area was initiated. Hence this Virginia City would have been perhaps a more logical place to site a screen play such as in this film emphasizing gold rather than silver.As others have noted Miriam seems miscast in this role. She took the place of Flynn's most popular leading lady Olivia de Havilland. True like Scott she was southernbred However she comes across as much more detached and vulnerable than the smiling tomboyish Olivia. She was also approaching 40 to Olivia's 24 and Flynn's 31. Yes she was a bit old for Flynn's new squeeze...Flynn although usually portrayed as a fit swashbuckler had numerous chronic health problems and risks that kept him out of active service in WWII. Unfortunately he had a deep personality conflict with the wellregarded director Michael Curtiz who directed the majority of Flynn's best remembered films.".

The movie movies through several locations beginning with a Confederate prison camp where Kerry Errol Flynn and his usual film sidekicks Alan Hale and Guinn Williams are attempting to escape the prison where Lance Scott oversees. After an escape Kerry  his friends are sent to intercept a plot led by Vance Scott in Viriginia to smuggle millions of gold. Bitter Southern woman Miriam Hopkins is aiding Vance although Kerry is initially duped to think otherwise.Lance wiles the gold away with Kerry  cavalry hot on his heels. Another character tossed into the mix is in a very strange role almost laughable role with Humphry Bogart as Mexican bandit Murrel. What seals this movie into four stars is a oneliner delivered by Flynn in response to Scott's observations of his gun skills Funny because of our current relationship with a certain country in the Middle East today. Flynn replies In Afghanistan the kids do it shoot well. This made the film for me. Too ironic for description.Scott  Flynn are great in their roles as is Alan Hale but Miriam Hopkins as usual falls flat as Southern belle  saloon girl spy and love interest to both Flynn  Scott's characters. I just never have believed Hopkins is any special talent or beauty. Someone must have paid her way into Hollywood.Overall however the film is unique in its delivery storyline and fast paced localeevent changes. Solid stuff from Flynn  Scott. Hale the usual bumbling faithful pal. Hopkins.. well she's just sorta annoying there throughout the film.".

But in charge of the gold shipment is Confederate officer Randolph Scott the same man who was in charge of the prison Flynn escaped from. Complicating matters further is Scott's sister and Rebel spy Miriam Hopkins. She meets Flynn and well you know. Also muddying the waters is Mexican bandit Humphrey Bogart !!! who Scott enlists to help get the gold past Flynn without ever thinking what would happen when you wave a shipment of gold in front of an outlaw.Decent western with a Civil War backdrop directed by Michael Curtiz. It has a little bit of everything but not enough of anything of merit. It's a long movie for its time an early example of Hollywood's wrongheaded longer is better approach to filmmaking that we still deal with today it's even worse today. Flynn goes through the motions with his usual roguish charm. Miriam Hopkins has poor chemistry with him and honestly drags the movie down. But I'm not a fan of hers in general. Scott does fine in a sympathetic quasivillain role. One of the more interesting things about the movie is its reluctance to paint either the North or South in a completely bad light just some 75 years removed from the Civil War. The funniest part of the movie and probably what gets it any attention today is the miscasting of Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican complete with a laughable accent that comes  goes and a Cesar Romero mustache. Hilarious stuff. Curiously Bogart's character shares a name with reallife bandit John Murrell who died two decades before this movie takes place and to my knowledge was as white as Cool Whip.It's not a bad movie by any means. No picture can be bad with this director and these stars as well as a supporting cast that includes Alan Ladd Frank McHugh John Litel Douglas Dumbrille Charles Middleton and Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams. There are some nice actions scenes and some good dramatic ones. The ending is also a pip. It's just a bit overlong and feels like it was made just to mimic the success of previous CurtizFlynn classic Dodge City. But it's definitely worth a look for fans of the stars or director.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a child back in the 1950s Westerns were the big thing. But like the rest of America as I grew older I gave up watching Westerns...except for once in a while when a Western came along with big stars high production values and a story that was a little different. This film has all those qualities.Let's begin with the cast. Errol Flynn was in his prime years when he made this film and it's obvious why he was such a tremendous star. Miriam Hopkins who is either really good or really lousy in each of her films is very good here as a Southern belle working to save the Confederacy type casting? She was a native of Savannah Georgia. Randolph Scott is excellent as the Confederate who is attempting to ship gold back to Richmond to save the Confederacy. Humphrey Bogart unfortunately is terribly miscast as a stagecoach robber who gets mixed up in the Confederates versus Yankees but this was just one year before he hit it big with films such as The Maltese Falcon. Frank McHugh is here although one wonders why...but at least he is not as annoying as he sometimes was. Alan Hale is great as Flynn's sidekick...perhaps only second next to Gabby Hayes as sidekicks go. Even the minor players do well here.Then there's the history of what is really a mix of a Civil War story and a Western. The early part of the film at the prison in Richmond is fairly accurate although Richmond doesn't have moss hanging from the trees and the river that flows through the city doesn't look like that at all. But much of the info about he prison is pretty close to real history.Production values here are very high. The scenes in red rock country  what a shame they weren't filmed in color! And then there's the plot which is on the unique side! Randolph Scott and his cohorts trying to bring western gold to the Confederacy in Richmond versus Errol Flynn and his cohorts trying to stop them. And in the middle a woman naturally...Miriam Hopkins. Hopkins proves she couldn't sing but she had pretty nice legs...way up there! And interestingly the rebels are portrayed fairly  as people who are simply on the other side of the tragedy of the Civil War.This is a ripsnortin' Western well worth watching and having on your DVD shelf...particularly because of Errol Flynn in his prime.".

And in the middle a woman naturally...Miriam Hopkins. Hopkins proves she couldn't sing but she had pretty nice legs...way up there! And interestingly the rebels are portrayed fairly  as people who are simply on the other side of the tragedy of the Civil War.This is a ripsnortin' Western well worth watching and having on your DVD shelf...particularly because of Errol Flynn in his prime.";

Flynn's his usual dashing self plus fires off some great romantic lines but the omission of Olivia De Havilland in favor of Miriam Hopkins was a misfire.

Humphrey Bogart on the eve of stardom is more a curio with his awful accent but he's still fun to see.It was also rare to pair Flynn with another leading man this time Randolph Scott! Both handle their duties with aplomb. Flynn's on and offscreen drinking buddies Alan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams provide comedic relief. Michael Curtiz directs so plenty of heavyhitters make this Western better than most. It does drag on a little too long but on a rainy or sick day sit back and enjoy. Filmed in the Painted Desert and at Calabasas Ranch. Of note made famous in the film Stagecoach there's still a great runaway US Mail stagecoach scene with Flynn jumping from horse to horse plus Williams sliding along the bottom then climbing back up.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1940 film Virginia City Errol Flynn stars as a Yankee spy during the Civil War who befriends Miriam Hopkins and her Southern friends while trying to uncover the location of a huge shipment of Confederate gold. It's all done with the usual cast of characters from the Warner Brothers stock company of actors including Alan Hale Guinn Williams John Litel etc. and directed by the great Michael Curtiz. Unfortunately director Curtiz didn't put his usual effort into this film probably because the script and story were of little interest to him. That said it's still an aboveaverage movie that certainly has its moments. The climactic battle between the desperate Southerners and their wagon train against a horde of Mexican banditos led by Humphrey Bogart of all people is wellstaged. Before that happens the long dreary journey through the desert by the Southerners as they slowly run out of water is quite effective and will jerk a few tears from even the most hardened viewers. Virginia City is more than an adequate western by today's standards but it got somewhat lost in the shuffle back in 1940. As fine an actress as she was Miriam Hopkins didn't always light the screen on fire. She was bettersuited for playing the other woman than for being the love interest. Nevertheless she does fine work in this movie and brings plenty of intelligence to her role. Randolph Scott is Flynn's nemesis in the film but he certainly isn't the bad guy. That dubious honor falls to Humphrey Bogart. He's the leader of the Mexican bandits but even with his sleazy mustache still looks like he belongs in downtown Manhattan. Flynn as always does what he can with the material and elevates the film with his mere presence and natural abilities. Unlike the real Civil War it all ends happily in Virginia City thanks to good old Abe Lincoln. He pardons everyone before he heads to Ford's Theater.".

I think it may have been due to the marketing campaign  they tried to sell it as a cutesy gimmick movie where a precocious child divorces her parents.  But that isn't what this movie is about at all.  This movie is able to provide strong commentary about failed relationships especially when egos power and greed substitute for the things that should really matter in a person's life.  In addition it creates a viable love story that doesn't resort to typical Hollywood formulas when it creates the conflicts that may or may not separate these two people who we know belong with each other.  We the audience get to see them actually fall in love on the screen before our very eyes.  You would think this should be fairly standard but how many movies can you recall especially recently that you can say that about?  This is done through great acting writing and directing.  Notice how Shelley Long's voice changes over the years as she goes through the various changes in her life.  Watch Ryan O'Neal's eyes toward the end as you can actually see an inner peace that he never had earlier.These are just a few of the great things I loved about this great heartwarming and underappreciated film.  If you want a great love story with some very good comic and dramatic moments as well rent this movie! You won't regret it.".

So as a result she takes them to court and the three members of the family tell their story shown in flashback. Directed by Charles Shyer from a screenplay by Shyer and Nancy Meyers Irreconcilable Differences shows us what its like to be in the Hollywood film industry which is fascinatingly detailed here. One hilarious scene is the part when acclaimed film director O'Neal is shooting a movie which appears to be a musical remake of Gone With The Wind. A very young Sharon Stone stars as the actress playing the character modeled after Scarlett O'Hara. I was cracking up during that scene because it's naturally funny. But there are touching moments too especially the early scenes when the O'Neal and Long characters first meet. Plus the scenes after they have their daughter are sweet and tender. Irreconcilable Differences is an underrated movie that deserved more attention than it received when released in 1984. It's a wellacted wellwritten film. out of four".

An Andy Warhol style painting of Shelly Long as Marilyn in the background of one scene is just too funny an example of how understated the true humor can be in this otherwise broadlyplayed farce.Some points are disturbing though it's made a joke that Ryan is having an anxiety attack instead of a heart attack try having one or that his visitation rights are threatened if he doesn't make child support payments an interesting social comment.

	schema:reviewBody "Drew Barrymore is probably one of the youngest actresses to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in this film. This role came after her ET fame remember her as little Gertie. Pity the other stars in that Spielberg film never became the household name that surprisingly that Drew has accomplished. She has got quite a pedigree with the Barrymore legacy. Despite her personal problems Drew really is a solid actress with a lifetime behind her. Anyway I never saw this film until Sunday. I remember it being out but I have to say when I was 11 years old I wanted to be Drew Barrymore that was before I knew what happened to her. So I guess I didn't watch it out of envy. I like the casting of Shelley Long who is probably one of the greatest female comediennes of our time who never gets enough work in my opinion to let her talents shine. She can do both drama and comedy equally well. She combines them both in this role as a desperate housewife turned writer. I like the way the film is set up with blame on both father and mother. Sharon Stone debuts in this film too. Ryan O'Neal is worth mentioning because I don't think he was acting in this film. It just hit too close to home. SO you want a good comedy from the eighties this is pretty good. It's probably a classic compared to contemporary comedy that has become both vulgar and profane.".

First of all this may have worked at least a little better if the story was told in chronological order instead of starting near the end and continually using flashbacks to lame scenes of the past during the overly sweet testimony of Drew Barrymore.

By the way what's up with her left eye? It seems as if it's on delay and always takes a second to align with where her right eye is looking.At first I thought wow she's not even close to his league. How could they cast them as a couple. But after seeing their wake up after a reunited one night stand scene and seeing that apparently Ryan O'Neal had no nipples I realized maybe they are a good match. Defects in common.Finally how could anyone in the 80's find Shelley Long's hairstyle attractive. It looks like she cut it herself with dull scissors and her eyes closed.One of the worst films I've seen. Annoying flashback script bad casting sickening sweet kid and an unbearable haircut. But at least now the world knows Ryan O'Neal has no nipples.".

	schema:headline " Probably not as much red sauce as curious Giallo fans will be expecting but still well worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "Boasting a steady throttle of wellorchestrated suspense some solid jumpscares one whopper of a gore setpiece and a fantastic musical score this Lamberto Bava vehicle is an uneven but satisfying offering.The film is centered around a composer who moves into an opulent villa to record the soundtrack for a horror film. He quickly finds himself living one when a series of strange events plunges him into a macabre mystery centered around the house's previous tenant Linda. A series of female acquaintances of his predecessor begin showing up to provide him tantalizing clues but then disappear just as suddenly when they are targeted and slayed by a deranged killer with a fondness for sharp objects. As he delves deeper into the cryptic saga of Linda's secret he learns that the movie he's working on may hold the key to discovering the dark hidden truth.The classic Giallo whodunnit formula is firmly in place and Bava wisely provides enough suspects both male and female to keep things intriguing. We're left to puzzle over the potentiality of the lurking handyman who decorates his walls with pornographic pictures the slightly batty film director who we imagine may be crafting her own reallife slasher movie and the jealous girlfriend who bristles at the idea of other women setting foot anywhere near the house. This guessing game isn't stymied until the climax when our possibilities start getting offed one by one so the film maintains its mystique throughout.The opening scene in which two young boys dare their friend to descend into a creepy shadowstrewn cellar and a grisly artifact plunges out of the darkness to announce his fate gets the film off to a rousing start. From there Bava sets a leisurely but effective pace unfurling a piece at a time of the overarching enigma and punctuating each act with displays of the killer's prowess for carnage. Genre aficionados may find themselves disappointed by the meager body count leading into the finale but the engrossing storyline renders this a minor complaint and as the final act plays out Bava makes up for lost time by whittling away his remaining cast in quick fashion.The most gruesome and memorable scene in the film a deliriously bloodsoaked rendezvous in a bathroom is constructed with a meticulous Hitchcockian flair for tension and the end result is one of the most harrowing clips in the Giallo canon. Bava never quite reached the Grand Guignol via arthouse heights of his brilliant countryman Dario Argento but as evidenced by this particularly stunning segment of Blade it wasn't because he didn't try.Granted there's plenty of silliness on display here most of it a result of the dubbed dialogue which at times clearly demonstrates some glaringly awkward translation Is it possible you're such a vacant nerd? Your satisfaction is to sit like a frog in the sun?. Likewise the concluding summation of the murderer's motivation is so rushed and dicey that the film ends on a fairly humorous note.The final twist works well enough but Bava falters a bit there by trying to keep the audience guessing for too long at a point when the solution to the riddle is plainly obvious. By the time we find out who's been holding the titular Blade there are are only a couple of characters left so knowing who the killer ISN'T strips the reveal of its big aha moment.However despite its flaws A Blade In The Dark is an entertaining and cohesive thriller that delivers everything its premise promises. I'll let horror scholars debate whether this is Bava's best film or not as for myself I liked it a hell of a lot and that's more than good enough for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay Lamberto Bava isn't anywhere near as talented as his father Mario. Let's just accept that and move on. 'A Blade In The Dark' is a surprisingly entertaining giallo that is equal parts Argento and Hitchcock though obviously not as accomplished as either at their best. If I specify which Hitchcock it is heavily inspired by it'll give the whole game away so I won't but I'm sure most viewers will have guessed the twist long before it is revealed. It doesn't really matter it won't detract from your enjoyment. Andrea Occhipinti from Fulci's 'The New York Ripper' plays Bruno a young composer who rents a villa while working on a horror movie score. Pretty soon assorted lovelies start disappearing and he fears the worst. He also begins to think the movie he's working on holds the key to the mysterious events around him. The version I watched of this movie was very badly dubbed but it was still effective and stylishly directed with some gruesome touches. Occhipinti was more than adequate as a hero there were plenty of babes and Eurohorror buffs will get a kick out of seeing the kid from Fulci's 'The House By The Cemetery' in a bit part and Michele Soavi Argento pal and director of cult favourite 'Dellamorte Dellamore' in a supporting role. While I don't think 'A Blade In The Dark' is quite as good as Bava's first 'Demons' movie I enjoyed it a LOT more than I expected so if you like Argento and Fulci check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Composer Bruno is hired to complete the music for an up and coming horror film and to get the job done without much interruption. He decides to rent out a secluded villa but his work gets sidetrack when he believes that some ravishing young woman who have disappeared have been murdered within the villa. So naturally he looks into it and finds out there might actually be a connection there with the old tenant of the house and the movie he's composing.If there was a film I wanted to like Lamberto Bava's cruel perverse Giallo piece A Blade in the Dark is one. The concept behind the story showed promised and the build up to the inventive deaths and their eventual outcomes were sadistically effective. It's a maliciously crazy shocker and it sure does come off excruciatingly bloody. Lamberto execution showed flair atmosphere and bite with his swaying visuals. However I found the moments in between terribly slack and Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti's tedious script was just too sloppy and meandering. When the humid material delivers its revelation we've seen it before to really be surprised and satisfied. Even the performances felt forced and mainly stuffy.

	onyx:emotionText "Composer Bruno is hired to complete the music for an up and coming horror film and to get the job done without much interruption. He decides to rent out a secluded villa but his work gets sidetrack when he believes that some ravishing young woman who have disappeared have been murdered within the villa. So naturally he looks into it and finds out there might actually be a connection there with the old tenant of the house and the movie he's composing.If there was a film I wanted to like Lamberto Bava's cruel perverse Giallo piece A Blade in the Dark is one. The concept behind the story showed promised and the build up to the inventive deaths and their eventual outcomes were sadistically effective. It's a maliciously crazy shocker and it sure does come off excruciatingly bloody. Lamberto execution showed flair atmosphere and bite with his swaying visuals. However I found the moments in between terribly slack and Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti's tedious script was just too sloppy and meandering. When the humid material delivers its revelation we've seen it before to really be surprised and satisfied. Even the performances felt forced and mainly stuffy.

The film is very slow it's horribly dubbed badly acted and has far too many false alarms. However the film isn't all bad.  It's got very creative and disturbing death scenes and really picks up in the final 15 minutes or so with some nice touches of humor to go with the gore.  Considering the fact that the film was shot in just about 2 weeks and was originally intended as a tv episode it shows how creative Bava really was having such a limited time schedule and a relatively low budget.  The mystery of the film i.e. who's behind the killings isn't hard to figure out.  I would say that 9 out of 10 viewers those familiar with the giallo genre anyway would have the killer figured out half way through the film.  In my opinion Bava is quite interesting a director but he's no Argento.  5 out 10.".

The house is huge and he has a great time wandering around getting inspiration to compose new music. When his neighbor Katia Valeria Cavalli goes missing after seeing him one night he's concerned about the former tenant who disappeared as well. When his girlfriend Julia Lara Naszinsky shows up to spend time with him Bruno starts investigating her disappearance trying to solve it which upsets Julia. As more disappearances occur around the house Bruno tries harder to figure out the truth. When Anne Anny Papa arrives to pick up the finished work for the film they are all trapped inside with the killer.The Good News Even though this is a lateera entry in the world of giallos it's one of the better ones. It displays a lot of the stylish elements that made many of the early classics so memorable and compelling. We get a stylish killer where we only get a small series of clues to his identity along the way a great series of red herrings to play upon the viewer's deductive powers and off course superstylized shots. A shot that really impresses me was watching a woman wander into a pool and we scene the whole thing from below the water level looking up. Pretty creative as was the murder scenes which are typical of giallos. One in particular where the victim first encounters the killer outside the house and through a series of escapes and chases winds up being killed inside is pretty effective. Particularly effective was the fact that the killer's shadow was used predominately in the scene heightening the tension as it got closer and closer. The jump with the knife caps it off and the bloody carcass that remains is a great cap on the events. It also played out in another areas such as building suspense. The offscreen noises that we hear are masterfully delivered especially the breathing that is heard during the climactic chase. That is undoubtedly the highlight with a thrilling and suspense catandmouse chase through the house that uses a wide manner of tactics to make it a real highlight the lights strategicallytimed that go off the cutting off of escape routes and finally a slow carefully executed escape attempt through the interior. It's a really thrilling moment that culminates in a great jump that makes it particularly exciting. There is lots more to this as well.The Bad News There is only one real complaint I have against the film it's too overlong. At times it seemed to include scenes that unnecessarily stretch out it's running time. The detective angle is wellplayed but too many times it felt that it could've been trimmed and not harmed the movie or it's plot too much. This is the only real thing I have against it.The Final Verdict It has some sequences that probably didn't need to be in here this is a pretty great giallo. It features a lot of the techniques of the genre and a lot more for others. All giallo and Italian horror movie fans should look into this one and the more adventurous should as well.Rated UNR Graphic Violence Brief Nudity and the offscreen death of a child".

A series of murders begin to occur in the villa after his arrival sparking local interest.Directed by Mario Bava's son Lamberto Bava A Blade in the Dark is one of the later giallo films to come to fruition debuting in 1983. Haphazardly dubbed in English which as others have noted is some of the worst dubbing you're likely to ever see the narrative twists and turns in relatively predictable ways though there are a few nice surprises to be had and Bava toys with the moviewithinamovie trope by having the protagonist scoring a horror film.The film does succeed at achieving a relatively strong atmosphere and the hilltop Italian villa locations are breathtaking and eerie. There are some great murder sequences as well and the film strikes a nice balance between suspense and violence. The performances are decent although the aforementioned dubbing does distract a bit. The ending is clever and very much in line with the film's giallo dedications as absurd as it may be.Overall A Blade in the Dark is like many films of its type atmospherically and visually interesting but narratively convoluted. As an earlyeighties entry into the giallo subgenre it doesn't do much to distinguish itself and that is where its biggest problem lies. It is reasonably suspenseful however and warrants a view from genre fans. Just don't expect Lamberto to live up to his father's legacy. 610.".

The ending is clever and very much in line with the film's giallo dedications as absurd as it may be.Overall A Blade in the Dark is like many films of its type atmospherically and visually interesting but narratively convoluted. As an earlyeighties entry into the giallo subgenre it doesn't do much to distinguish itself and that is where its biggest problem lies. It is reasonably suspenseful however and warrants a view from genre fans. Just don't expect Lamberto to live up to his father's legacy. 610.";

Despite being made on a low budget Bava uses the limited locations well so the audience is not bothered by the lack of settings. There are some striking images and occasional eyecatching direction. But all this good stuff doesn't help much against the sad fact that the movie is incredibly slow. It doesn't take long to realize that not much is happening and the thin story is stretched out from the breaking point.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second of Lamberto Bava's impressive string of horror films in the 80's. It followed in the wake of the excellent Macabre and preceded the highly entertaining Demons. This one was firmly in the slashergiallo style of films. It's another polished effort from the director and is one of the best gialli of the 80's. Unlike the 70's prototype Bava's film doesn't really focus too much on the mystery side of the story although it is still definitely there. It's more a stalk and slash affair although one with some style and suspense.It stars amongst others future director Michele Soavi. And it is basically about a film composer who rents a remote villa to create the music for a new thriller. While there vicious murders begin to happen.The story line is nothing out of the ordinary and I would even say things pan out a little predictably. In fact it's a pretty pedestrian film when it isn't focusing on scenes involving tension or violence. The mystery itself is not especially well thought out and the film as a whole does not have a very good script. The dialogue isn't helped though by the particularly bad dubbing. But I can hear a lot of people asking so what hasn't it ever been thus in this subgenre of film? Well this is true but these aspects are made more damaging by the fact that the movie is definitely overlong for what it is and consequently there is too much padding. It could easily have been trimmed by twenty minutes without sacrificing anything important. If the editing had been tighter focussing more purely on the horror content at the expense of much of the melodramatics it would have been a considerably better film.But I have to say that where A Blade in the Dark really scores is in Bava's good handling of tension and horror. When the film does hone in on this it's often really effective. I would even go as far as to say that it can be genuinely frightening at times. No mean feat to be honest considering how most films of its type rarely are. The whole finale in the villa with the killer stalking around halfseen speaking with that creepy voice is really effective. While from a horror perspective there is a bathroom killing sequence that is particularly inventively nasty. The atmosphere throughout is helped by some good camerawork and a fairly decent if repetitive score. There are also some memorably stylish moments such as the scene in the pool with roaming underwater photography. The action rarely moves from the villa which probably hinders the story developing its mystery thread but it's a reasonably effective setting even if it is a house that is for some reason fitted out with a somewhat disproportionately impractical number of cupboards. The characters themselves act completely stupidly throughout however and at any given opportunity actively ignore events that appear incredibly suspicious. For example tape is ripped from a recording machine and pages in a diary are thrown in a fire indicating a houseinvading intruder but our protagonist merely treats these occurrences with mild concern. And when a mysterious girl emerges from a cupboard in his house he doesn't appear to consider this very strange. But I suppose he subsequently then mixes up a spider with a cockroach and later repeats this strange mistake so I suppose we are not dealing with a character with too much common sense in fairness.Overall seeing as this is an 80's giallo I have to cut A Blade in the Dark some slack. Its daftness is sort of endearing to at least a certain extent and it's hardly alone in this when you consider other similar films from the time. But at the same time it is successful as a horror film. There's good tension generated at times and it does have a nicely stylish presentation for the most part. It's not going to trouble your brain too much but it's pretty good value as an entertaining example of 80's Italian horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lamberto Bava's first film as a director 1980's Macabre was supposedly a bit too tame in the violence department to satisfy all the gorehounds out there so in his next picture 1983's A Blade in the Dark the son of the legendary Father of the Giallo Mario Bava created a bloodbath that might well have made papa proud. Filmed on the cheap in only three weeks at the country villa of producer Luciano Martino the film is yet surprisingly effective and looks just fine. The plot centers around a young composer named Bruno appealingly portrayed by Andrea Occhipinti and the four stunninglooking women in his life. Sandra a film director Anny Papa has just hired him to compose the score for her latest horror film and has ensconced him in a secluded country villa to get the job done. Bruno as the viewer soon learns in not untalented and the score that he comes up withand that crops up regularly throughout Bava's filmis quite an eerie one. His work however is constantly interrupted by the arrival of his actress girlfriend Julia Lara Lamberti and by his two hottie neighbors models Katia and Angela Valeria Cavalli and Fabiola Toledo. And when these last two mysteriously disappear apparently by homicide and other strange events begin to transpire in his lonely rental pad Bruno finds himself in a reallife horror situation that puts Sandra's fictional one to shame....A Blade in the Dark takes its time creating atmosphere and delivering shocks. Its deliberate pace has proved offputting for many viewers it seems but I found the picture to be consistently suspenseful and interesting. The film's shocks are well placed and the body count is fairly high although there are a bit too many false scares and red herrings for this viewer's taste cleverly integrated as they are. It is as I mentioned up top a fairly violent giallo and some of the slayings are quite gruesome to behold. In the worst if I may spoil things for youprepare you a bit the victim has her hand impaled by a kitchen knife her head wrapped in a plastic bag and battered to a bloody pulp and her neck pierced through with that same blade. Yikearoo! This killer sure does know how to do a thorough job! And I haven't even mentioned hisher weapon of choice a retractable box cutter that clicks open segment by excruciating segment. I find doing scenes in which women get stabbed to death repugnant Lamberto says in one of this Blue Underground DVD's extras but that surely did not prevent him from getting his picture made in an effective manner! The slaying just mentioned is one of the most difficult to watch that I have seen in any giallo and would fit right into papa Mario's gorefest Bay of Blood 1971. Lamberto's later giallo film Delirium 1987 was far less sanguinary by the way while his two Demons films of the mid'80s combined the gore with a goodly leavening of humor. Blade also features a clever script from the remarkably prolific Dardano Sacchetti although his psychological explanation for the killer's motive is a flimsy one at best. Indeed if everyone had a similar reaction to such a paltry stimulus 14 of all human beings would be homicidal maniacs! As for this Blue Underground DVD itself the print looks just fine but has been horribly translated and dubbed resulting in such lines as Is it possible you're such a vacant nerd? subtitles would have been infinitely preferable. Modernday interviews with Bava and Sacchetti make for nice extras however and in all the film is a mustsee for all gorehound and giallo completists. When it comes to Lamberto and Mario it would seem the apple did not fall far from the tree or perhaps it would be better to say that the blood did not fall far from the vein....".

The film's shocks are well placed and the body count is fairly high although there are a bit too many false scares and red herrings for this viewer's taste cleverly integrated as they are. It is as I mentioned up top a fairly violent giallo and some of the slayings are quite gruesome to behold. In the worst if I may spoil things for youprepare you a bit the victim has her hand impaled by a kitchen knife her head wrapped in a plastic bag and battered to a bloody pulp and her neck pierced through with that same blade. Yikearoo! This killer sure does know how to do a thorough job! And I haven't even mentioned hisher weapon of choice a retractable box cutter that clicks open segment by excruciating segment. I find doing scenes in which women get stabbed to death repugnant Lamberto says in one of this Blue Underground DVD's extras but that surely did not prevent him from getting his picture made in an effective manner! The slaying just mentioned is one of the most difficult to watch that I have seen in any giallo and would fit right into papa Mario's gorefest Bay of Blood 1971. Lamberto's later giallo film Delirium 1987 was far less sanguinary by the way while his two Demons films of the mid'80s combined the gore with a goodly leavening of humor. Blade also features a clever script from the remarkably prolific Dardano Sacchetti although his psychological explanation for the killer's motive is a flimsy one at best. Indeed if everyone had a similar reaction to such a paltry stimulus 14 of all human beings would be homicidal maniacs! As for this Blue Underground DVD itself the print looks just fine but has been horribly translated and dubbed resulting in such lines as Is it possible you're such a vacant nerd? subtitles would have been infinitely preferable. Modernday interviews with Bava and Sacchetti make for nice extras however and in all the film is a mustsee for all gorehound and giallo completists. When it comes to Lamberto and Mario it would seem the apple did not fall far from the tree or perhaps it would be better to say that the blood did not fall far from the vein....";

Evidence trickles in that the killer might be the previous tenant but nobody knows for sure and some people refuse to talk. And what is in the locked room in the basement? Lamberto Bava came out of his father's shadow to make Macabre one of the finest Italian horror films of its day. Often overlooked it is slick and original and well worth seeking out. He followed it up with A Blade in the Dark cowritten by the legendary writer Dardano Sacchetti which likely gave the film a boost. It too has superior picture and sound far surpassing Fulci's films of the same era.Bava protests that the film is not really a horror film and some have classified it as a mystery or thriller. This is warranted but the intense blood gore and chills make it firmly a horror story in my mind.Luca Palmerini calls the film morbid and misogynistic with claustrophobic overtones. I may agree on the last part but the misogyny is a stretch. The women here do take a back seat and the film does start out by calling Giovanni Frezza's character a female as an insult but compared to horror as a whole I think it comes across as normal.The English dubbing on the Anchor Bay DVD is a bit strange to me mostly because the characters say ciao while otherwise speaking English. Maybe it is just me. But overall I cannot complain  a lot of terror comes from a very small blade and this may be Michele Soavi's best work as an actor. Coupled with a haunting score the film is gripping though the music does tend to get a bit overplayed and old especially after the first kill.While the film is not as good as Macabre it deserves recognition. Bava threw it together rather quickly with a low budget and unknown actors with minimal equipment even the set was actually just the producer's house. Adapting it from a television script where the goal was to kill someone every thirty minutes he did pretty well with it. Clearly he was successful enough that he was able to keep directing and give us the nowclassic Demons.".

Although it centers on the relationship of the two sisters and their respective romantic relationships it also seems to be a salute to the period itself in its precise description of the English country society. It is truthful to Jane Austen's novel but Emma Thompson's script is fine in its own right with many omissions and additions to the novel. The acting is superb Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer sensibility is breathtaking try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers halfderanged 'Willoughby Willoughby Willoughby.' is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sistersense. Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semiByronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film for the story the wit the period and the imagery.".

The acting is superb Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer sensibility is breathtaking try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers halfderanged 'Willoughby Willoughby Willoughby.' is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sistersense. Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semiByronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film for the story the wit the period and the imagery.";

I wears you out not from action but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer 1 Emma Thompson and 2 incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensiblesweetwholesome and pretty andalways unfairly ignored woman than Thompson see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End. Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it. It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing too  a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England in which this story takes place.The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen on both the inside and outside scenes. It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score too.This kind of story is a bit too soap operalike for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories this must really be a special film. For the rest of us it's still very much worth seeing and adding to one's DVD collection. It''s great filmmaking.".

Yet each year when we do this film in class about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It's wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so talky when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life well even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students after the groans when I start it on the first day it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year I wouldn't have rented this or wanted to see it but now that I have I admit it was pretty good so I'm glad you showed it. This is why they are classics kiddies.".

I think Alan Rickman was just perfect for that role. I've seen him only as professor Snape in the first Harry Potter film so I can't compare very much but I would say he is a great actor. I love his voice especially when he says What can I do? Give me some occupation Miss Dashwood or I shall run mad. love his intonation and how he cares for Marianne so tenderly and patiently even though she turns her back on him.

The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay which was also her first. Kudos to her she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly if you don't you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It's very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors Allen Rickman Emma Thompson Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.1010".

One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the sense and sensibility of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores probably by use of a crowbar into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version fine.  But it would be at best only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel so why do an adaptation at all then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer the longsuffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings.

	schema:reviewBody "As with Pride and Prejudice I have owned a copy of this film for about eight years and I almost find it impossible to think that anyone could criticise it. A lot of people criticise the decision to cast Emma Thompson then thirtysix as nineteen year old Elinor but I feel that the fact that she is clearly older than her character should be adds to Elinor's role as the logical practical woman surrounded by a sister who wants to be a pirate a fullypaid up romantic Kate Winslet as Marianne and a mother who doesn't appreciate the starkness of their newlyimpoverished status quite as fully as she does. I always feel that  in this version at least  Elinor is forced to act older than she is to compensate for all this idealism. Another outstanding feature of the film is the quality of acting provided by the supporting cast. Imelda Staunton begins as an unbearably screechy woman and yet by the end of the film we see that she is more than capable of appreciating the gravity of a serious situation. Hugh Laurie as her husband Mr. Palmer is priceless watch out for a scene where he is reading a copy of the newspaper The Porcupine. Greg Wise as Willoughby is incredibly convincing as the embodiment of Marianne's romantic hero who turns out to have a less than spotless reputation. Alan Rickman who truly loves Marianne is quite restrained enough and it soon becomes clear why he is so brooding.Personally I don't have a problem with the fact that it might not be totally faithful to eighteenth century life in terms of hygiene and cleanliness because  to me  that isn't what Jane Austen is about. It is supposed to be genteel and this film is. She didn't write to depict realism she wrote to satirise and observe the society she lived in and this is something the film never fails to do. If the girls remained as rich as they had in the beginning I don't think we would have cared for them quite as much as we do. It is very much a handicap to their eligibility.On a final note one really strong point is the costumes. They all seem to embody the period so well and very accurately too. Mrs. Jennings being around sixty wears clothes from an earlier period and Mrs. Dashwood's clothes are not quite up to the minute which adds another touch of realism to this outstanding film.".

I find Emma Thompson's writing selfabsorbed and unfaithful to the original book she has reduced Marianne to a sidecharacter a second fiddle to her much too old much too severe Elinor  she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments' and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie those are the things always difficult to digest.As for the actors I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great a bit old perhaps but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs she is absolutely fantastic as always.".

Emma Thompson succeeds in conveying all of this in looks small hesitations subtle body language and never are we in disbelief. It all seems real and right and you can truly believe that people never saw her feelings although at the same time you can see that they are real and very deep. I compare it for an example with Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne Elliott in Persuasion I really had a hard time believing people did not see through her sad puppy eyes and sighs and nervous grabbing chairs and all these unsubtle ways she would play out Anne's inner torment. Anyway to come back to Emma Thompson and Elinor I know some people thought that her reaction at the end of the movie when she finally learns that Edward is not married and that he wants to ask for her hand is not really lady like and maybe even exaggerated. I could not agree less. This is the reaction of someone who has been loving and feeling and hurting for a long time holding it in so she would hurt people around her the least possible and on the moment of learning that finally happiness is within her reach that finally all this has not been for nothing she just bursts out in uncontrollable crying and sobbing. I just could not hold my own tears when I saw the movie the first time and believe me I am not one to cry over sappy love stories usually. I just identified so much with her selfsacrifice of every moment for so long which suddenly turned into too much happiness to hold inside. Wow! That in and of itself is one reason to see and cherish this version of Sense and Sensibility and then there is so much more but I'll leave it at that!".

And since I've seen several of them lately without seeing all that much difference between them all I didn't think that I would like it all that much. But when I read a review in a popular magazine saying that even when you aren't a fan of this kind of films you should give it a try because it's so much better than the average movie in the genre I must admit that I was quite curious about it. Also the fact that it was from the director Ang Lee made me hope for the best.When Mr. Dashwood dies almost all his belongings go to his son from his first marriage leaving his second wife and three daughters in a difficult situation. They haven't got much money and can't stay on the estate but are taken in by a kind cousin who gives them a small cottage to live in. Because they aren't wealthy it isn't very easy for the two oldest daughters the practical Elinor and the romantic Marianne to find a suitable partner. Both find a man who seems to be perfect at first but who aren't all that great after all. But after the rain always comes sunshine and one day the two women find a man to their taste who truly loves them...If there is one thing that you can't accuse him of than it must be that Ang Lee always sticks to one certain genre. After having seen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and the western Ride with the Devil this certainly is a completely different experience. And surprisingly enough I must say that it works. I never thought that a man born in Taiwan would be that good in recreating a world that has never been his. I don't think it must be easy for an Asian person to recreate Victorian England or the USA during the Civil War but it works and that's all that really matters. Next to the good directing I also couldn't help noticing the fine acting by all the leading actors. There wasn't one that stood out above the rest but there wasn't one that didn't fit in either. They all did a very good job and that's something that you don't always find in a movie.Even though I know that this was the way it all happened during that time period I must say that I sometimes had a lot of difficulties with the lack of emotions and the fact that they didn't always say what they thought. I sometimes really wanted to say to one of the characters 'come on finally tell them what you have got to say don't stay there quiet all the time you're working on my nerves with that behavior...' but this was a movie so I had to stay quiet myself. Still it really worked on my nerves sometimes and that did spoil my fun from time to time. However don't get me wrong this certainly doesn't mean that I didn't like the movie at all.Overall this is indeed a movie that is a lot better than the average in the genre. The acting is very good the story is interesting... and for once it all made me forget about everything that I hate about the genre. When you know that I normally give a movie of this kind a rating of 610 than you'll be quite surprised to see that I give this one a rating in between 710 and 7.510. To my own surprise I must admit that I really liked it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Austen's book Sense and Sensibility was always a favourite book of mine next to Pride and Prejudice. Emma Thompson's adaptation of Austen's first published novel is simply delightful not only does it completely capture the wit and spirit of Austen's novel it gives you an understanding of what true love really is. I simply loved the acting Emma Thompson's performance as Elinor was very good not only does she act according to the book's Elinor but she also gave Elinor a sense of humour which was a good idea in my opinion. I was impressed by Kate Winslet's Marianne the emotions shown by her is believable you really can't believe that she didn't win an Oscar for her performance if you liked Kate Winslet in Titanic you should try watching this movie you'll be surprised by how believable she is. Hugh Grant as the kind Edward Ferrars is truly worth watching. The scene where Edward meets Elinor in London while his fiance is in the same room is heartwretching. You can't help feeling sorry for him. Absolutely marvellous. Alan Rickman's melancholy Colonel Brandon is amazing it's a different role for him but he plays good characters just as nicely as villains. I liked the scene where Marianne finally pays some attention to him while he reads some poetry to her. Greg Wise's Willoughby was somewhat disappointing. His performance didn't really capture the book's Willoughby. He didn't show much emotion he's quite good but not good enough. Willoughby is certainly not worth dying for Colonel Brandon is more worth it.  This was Ang Lee's first Englishlanguage film I think he did a wonderful job the essence of the film is truly faithful to Emma Thompson's screenplay. It's a pity that Sense and Sensibility only won one OscarBest Screenplay it should have won more. This is definitely one of the best Jane Austen movie adaptations ever made I'm giving this 10 out of 10 which is what this movie deserves. If you enjoy this movie try watching BBCAE's version of Pride and Prejudice1995.".

Alan Rickman's melancholy Colonel Brandon is amazing it's a different role for him but he plays good characters just as nicely as villains. I liked the scene where Marianne finally pays some attention to him while he reads some poetry to her. Greg Wise's Willoughby was somewhat disappointing. His performance didn't really capture the book's Willoughby. He didn't show much emotion he's quite good but not good enough. Willoughby is certainly not worth dying for Colonel Brandon is more worth it.  This was Ang Lee's first Englishlanguage film I think he did a wonderful job the essence of the film is truly faithful to Emma Thompson's screenplay. It's a pity that Sense and Sensibility only won one OscarBest Screenplay it should have won more. This is definitely one of the best Jane Austen movie adaptations ever made I'm giving this 10 out of 10 which is what this movie deserves. If you enjoy this movie try watching BBCAE's version of Pride and Prejudice1995.";

I know when a movie is good when 10 or 20 minutes after the film is over you are are still crying or laughing or shocked. I was crying for 20 minutes after so I know this is an amazing film. I love everything about it. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet both acted their hearts out they deserve all the praise thats been giving them. Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant also put in top Notch performances.   The script is just great she certaintly deserved the oscar. I gave this movie a 10 because of the storyacting and just great scenery and intrigue to keep it interesting.".

	schema:headline " In the Name of Love Marriage and Conveniences...";
	schema:reviewBody "If it wasn't for Jane Austen's novels and their screenadaptation we wouldn't be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn't have a way to go through life without landing on the marriage square hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn't love. Marriage was the end but love was the means to achieve it while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.Now there is an interesting point of comparison between her two most celebrated novels Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Sense was Austen's first success written at a very young age yet it deals with characters evolving in the realm of adulthood while in Pride written by an older Austen the heroines are the Bennett Sisters who aren't older than twenty. It is just like Austen was a painter who had to go to the top of the mountain to have a clear view on a plain after having painted the mountain from the plain. With enough experience and wisdom she was able to make a brighter portrait of a young generation who get the man through their actions. In Sense the Dashwood sisters are fullydimensional characters Elinor Emma Thompson is reserved and introverted while Marianne Kate Winslet is romantic and flamboyant they're more mature than the Bennetts sisters but at the expense of their reactivity.In Pride luck and men's valiance were not elements to count on and many round trips allowed the heroine to confront her suitor. It is possible that Pride was a bit too modern while Sense was more obedient to the perception of women's role at the time rather static but the directing by Ang Lee and the screenplay worked in such a way that the quest for marriage isn't actually the most interesting part of the film. And while I don't think I give away the ending by saying that each one will find the true love it's obviously not the point of suspense the real question is how these people interact. And just like your typical Austen's stories there's a good deal of passions and deception or romantic studs popping up at the right moment and forcing the women to all align in the house to promptly welcome their host. Some are dark and brooding Alan Rickman other shy and amiable Hugh Grant and a few too perfect to be true Greg Wise but they all have one thing in common they're conveniently called to office in London whenever marriage seems too close a snobby bitch or karma playing the same game postponing the overdue rendezvous with destiny.But as predictable as these films are their quality is elsewhere starting with the acting. Literary movies have this quality that the abundance of words and plots can sometimes distract from simpler moments that actually elevate them more than any monologue or speech. This moment occurs when Edward Grant is ready to confess something to Elinor. They have spent enough time together to grow a deep feeling. He's about to say something about his you expect the word feeling he says education and you can see something click in the blink of an eye in Thompson's face 'devastation' as it would really show in a woman who learned to hide her feelings. There's no doubt that Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actress of her generation. On the other hand Marianne will also face abandon and the reaction will fit her passionate personality. While the plot in itself can be summed up by women waiting for the right men to come so God forbid they don't end up as bitter spinster there is more to enjoy the text and more importantly the subtext.And on that level Jane Austen's stories are exhilarating hymns for eloquence and literacy whether when the characters write intimate correspondences share their personal thoughts with their friends or relatives or try to convey a strong message by still respecting the conveniences I just can't resist by the way Shakespeare's language is being honored. You finish the film and you just want to express your feelings with the same economy of obviousness or flamed passion when called for and a similar urge generally invade me when I finish the Ivory and Merchant movies. There is something just irresistible in these British heritage films they make you realize how close we still are to these times by the scale of history but lightyears ahead as far as mediocrity and plainness is concerned.And it's a credit to Austen's writing and Thompsons's rewriting earning her an Oscar to have translated the story in a tone that wouldn't make feminists' neck hair stand up and wouldn't portray men as misogynistic pigs.The film says something important the strength of your character doesn't depend on what he or she accomplishes but how it can strongly affect your own feeling or how can they resist the cruelties of life without necessarily triumphing over them. All through the film I was totally rooting for Marianne Elinor their mother Gemma Jones and the way they endorsed or rebelled against conventions at crucial times where simpler things were complicatedly expressed. Indeed everything that happened is due to something said a promise or a misunderstanding. It's all in the way words are used misused or distorted and that's one of the many delights in this lavish movie.".

Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood the younger sister who represents sensibility. Their father has died and he must leave his fortune to the son of his first marriage.

They are then separated because of Edward's wealthy family. Marianne on the other hand is in love with John Willoughby Greg Wise. At the same time wealthy Colonel Brandon Alan Rickman has eyes for Marianne but she thinks Brandon is too old for her and prefers Willoughby instead.The film sometimes has a few heartwarming and humorous moments but overall I was quite bored of the film. The acting is pretty standard and the performances still deliver. Winslet's Marianne is who really shines in the cast. Director Ang Lee shows his versatility in her occupation perfectly  the guy can make a good Taiwanese film a British costume drama a film based on American suburbia a Chinese martial arts film an action film and even a gay cowboy movie. The film is simply told maybe being a little too long never read the book and might be great for fans but I actually got bored while watching the film.

None the less I was never bored never annoyed and did not feel slighted as the viewer.An impressive cast and tight direction keep the show moving efficiently and provide a dependable vehicle for the delivery of the intended results in a satisfying manner.What surprised me was the number of cinematic conventions incorporated into a project that reportedly meant to avoid them.  I claim no authority on the Dogma 95 movement but I understand they aspire to strip a movie of as many mainstream cliches as possible.  Standard story elements and cinematography are not what the filmmakers wish to present.One of the conventions they frown on is the artificial insertion of background music.  Yet this movie does use such incidental music in one scene in a very traditional format.  It's even an old familiar tune.  Like Rock Of Ages at a funeral or Take Me Out To The Ballgame when we see Yankee Stadium.  And for an approach expected to break with tradition there is an awful lot of happily ever after in the resolutions to the various conflicts.  The average looking actors and the less than beautiful scenery add greatly to the believability.  The fun they and in turn we have with it offsets any flaws in the production.  But it's going to take more than a hand held camera and a Scandinavian accent to overcome 100 years of accepted film technique.  But I enjoyed the show and if they keep trying I'll keep watching.".

The euthansiagirl Karen is especially well acted and believable throughout. And attractive in a very real sense with a blemished face and all. The happyeverafter fantasy of the last part of the film can be looked upon as a catharsis or just candy for the masses or the way lives can be pulled up from the depths.

He has inherited the crown of the late Patrick Dewaere who could be both charming and sinister able to seduce women with a smile and a wink then destroy them with a few wellchosen words or play Iago to somebody's Othello. Dewaere's relationship with Depardieu in Les valseuses was one of the great suppressed homosexual couplings in modern film. I thought too of Matt Damon's Mr. Ripley as I watched Kaalund skulking around the other characters sizing them up seeing how far he could go.".

He has inherited the crown of the late Patrick Dewaere who could be both charming and sinister able to seduce women with a smile and a wink then destroy them with a few wellchosen words or play Iago to somebody's Othello. Dewaere's relationship with Depardieu in Les valseuses was one of the great suppressed homosexual couplings in modern film. I thought too of Matt Damon's Mr. Ripley as I watched Kaalund skulking around the other characters sizing them up seeing how far he could go.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are some movies that no matter how good the translation are just impossible for a particular audience to get. This is why I think most of the American audience wasn't be able to get into WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. After directing the rather weak and disappointing dramathriller LAW OF DESIRE Spanish director Pedro Almodovar returned to screens in his full glory with this wonderful Academy Awardnominated screwball comedy.Pepa Almodovar regular Carmen Maura works as an actress for TV commercials and dubbing of foreign films. Her lover Ivan Fernando Guillen who shares the same job decides to leave her one day for unknown reasons leading Pepa to assume he left with his wife Lucia Julieta Serrano who was recently released from the mental hospital. But after a while Pepa realizes Lucia thinks the exact opposite and that Ivan left for an unknown third woman. While on her quest to find this third woman Pepa has to deal with her nervous friend Candela Maria Barranco who recently found out her boyfriend is a wanted terrorist and Carlos Antonio Banderas Ivan's son whose annoying fianc ends up getting accidentally knocked off by a rather lethal gazpacho.Going any further with this film's plot would be unfair since most of the humor is delivered from it's many twists and turns. Almodovar was able to write a script so sharp with so many colorful characters and situations that the entire thing goes down with pure laughter. But is everyone laughing?That brings me to the answer as to why many people didn't find this funny at all. If you don't speak or understand Spanish or some other language that comes from Latin you won't be able to get this film as much as others. There is a reason why so many American comedians are never able to make it overseas Humor is simply not international. The rumored but thankfully never completed American remake of this would have never worked. The performances for example To people who understand the language you can tell when the characters are being ironic sarcastic goofy or serious. I don't think you can do that very well when English is your first language. So the users that have been complaining about flat performances might be already explained.Almodovar has been accused of being a feminist and this movie might be the main reason. I don't quite agree with that because WOMEN doesn't really leave strong message. If it does I know few people who would actually care for it because this movie is hilarious. Every single character in these 90 minutes of absurdity gets wellbalanced and get enough amount of time to shine The MAMBO TAXI driver for example turns out to be one of the funniest elements. The scenes all by themselves are already OK but the frequency that they happen make them somehow even funnier. And the firstrate acting gets a big plus in my book. Everyone here is perfect including a very scary way Almodovar coaches a good performance out of Antonio Banderas with the true standout being Carmen Maura as overthetop neurotic Pepa. It is a shame this was Maura's last collaboration with Almodovar.But WOMAN's style is also not to be ignored Most of the movie is set inside Pepa's apartment which is put to good use. It is an amazing thenfuturisticlooking retro set that with it's sitcomlike camp and artificial looking painted backgrounds becomes almost a character itself. Cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine's camera is always up to interesting moves There is the tracking shot of Pepa's feet as she walks in circles waiting for her call or the reflection take from the answering machine. The work with colors is equally stunning with the main colors being yellow and blue and Pepa's red dress over coloring the environments around her for most of the time. You could freeze frame almost every interior shot of WOMEN... and stare at it for a while.I can't really recommend this movie enough as much as hard it is to review comedies. Reviewing a comedy is a tough call since it depends on weather you found the material funny or not. I have seen this over ten times and I always laugh at certain moments which I don't want to spoil. Let's just say the Jehovah's testimony and the TV commercial are the parts that always get me. I certainly did enjoy WOMEN... more than any other comedy I have ever seen.55".

However if you obtain the DVD version of this movie resist the temptation to use the Englishdubbed soundtrack. Sadly the English version is just not funny. The readings are flat and uninspired and the translation is not always accurate too literal in some cases just missing the point in others. It appears that the English dialog was written more for a close match with the lip movements than for precise translation. Instead use the Castilian Spanish audio track and savor the beautiful performances.

Instead use the Castilian Spanish audio track and savor the beautiful performances. If you don't understand the language read the English subtitles which are more appropriately translated and still enjoy the original.";

There really isn't a wasted moment nothing extraneous and that is what keeps the pace crackling and makes the movie watchable in every moment. It also has one of the GREAT ensembles ever. Carmen Maura as Pepa keeps herself on that verge for an hour and a half without ever really falling off the edge it is a beautifully modulated performance. Maria Barranco as Candela is another performance that teeters on the edge of falling off into an emotional rubble but somehow manages to keep it together. Those two are delightful in every moment they are on screen. We can't forget Julieta Serrano as Lucia the one truly crazy postbreakdown woman in the story who brings a quality of selfawareness to her role that makes it a bit heartbreaking. She knows she is nuts and can't do a damn thing about it. And then there is VERY strangely attractive Rossy de Palma as Marisa a virgin who needs nothing so much as she just needs to get laid to mellow her out. These women are all superlative but Guillermo Montesinos as the Taxi Driver nearly steals the movie out from everyone and gives certainly the best male performance in the film. You have to see him to believe him.".

Seeing Almodovar's comedic masterpiece is not enough it has to be savored like the fine wine it's become as it approaches its twentieth year from when it first exploded into theatres and rocked Spanish cinema to its core. Quite frankly this is the greatest screwball comedy ever filmed and for a genre created in the United States this one trumps even Preston Sturges in sheer craziness that just builds upon momentum until it veers out of control.As a matter of fact television audiences who follow the satirical Desperate Housewives should make an effort to see Almodovar's WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and appreciate the genius run amok during the approximate 90 minutes it takes to tell its frantic story. It's the only real way to appreciate what goes on ABC's hit show. From the moment our heroine Pepa Carmen Maura in a role that has defined her career awakens from her slumber and frantically runs to the phone to get that hungrily awaited phone call from Ivan Fernando Guillen who has abandoned her and faints in the middle of dubbing Joan Crawford as Vienna in JOHNNY GUITAR as she crosses paths with the scared Candela Maria Barranco the lunatic Lucia Julietta Serrano anal Marisa Rossy de Palma and feminist Paulina Kiti Manver during the course of two days we're in the same league as the five women of Housewives. They might even serve as parenthetical bookmarks due to the twin nature of women in the throes of despair pushed to the extreme. This is as a matter of fact what THE WOMEN would have looked like had it been filmed fifty years later. Less stagy than Cukor's film but no less effective even when it pokes good fun at artifice camp and itself WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN is smart witty ferociously funny and oddly touching  a tough thing to do in comedies. It marked the movie which brought Pedro Almodovar to international fame such that MATADOR was rereleased in order to bring its equally bizarre story to the public who had discovered a wunderkind in the avantgarde director. For years plans for an American remake floated about and actresses names were on a continuous shuffle. Thankfully the idea has not come through and audiences can enjoy this very Spanish very quirky movie in its original form and see why the term Almodovarian exists in cinema today. This is what started it all proper.".

This was a very fine substitute.The film contains all the elements of an absurdist play by the likes of Beckett Stoppard or Ionesco. From its bizarre and essentially alienating dialogue to its disjointed plot brought somewhat together by the end it is an absolute delight to see such films around today.All the characters are wonderfully developed and like in a play the narrative is light in plot but heavy in characters. It makes you think not about the story it is telling since the story itself is ludicrous and not about what is said for the same reason but just about the way the characters interact with each other and how this can be applied to everyday life. There are also some wonderful performances contained within. Each of the actors and actresses are so gutsy and alive inside this strange parauniverse that Almodovar has created. It really is a treat to watch with the persistently wry and often wildly ironic humour extracted to its full potential by the deadpan mock seriousness plastered across each character's face. It gives us a good laugh not just at the film itself but at ourselves and the elements of us we can see in it. Plus the mambo cab is a deadset winner.After seeing this film I am currently desperate to see another Almodovar. From this one piece I can see he is definitely a director worth celebrating and admiring and I will try to encourage many others to discover him for themselves. 12  ".

	schema:reviewBody "What does spiked gazpacho a suitcase and a crazy woman with a gun have in common? Not much at first glance unless you are in the head of director Pedro Almodovar. In his film Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios Pedro mixes apparently unconnected objects and events that make no sense until the film is over. His direction and distinct style combined with good actors makes a movie as unforgettable as it is foreign. The basic plot deals with one day in the life of Pepa Marcos played by Carmen Maura. During the day we meet her lover Ivan who has a son Carlos whose girlfriend is Marisa but like his father Carlos is not loyal to Marisa but would rather kiss whoever walk in front of him like Candela Pepa's friend. All of the opposing motives create and tense mood but besides everything is seems that Pepa knows what is going on and only worries about Ivan. The main subject is the destructive cycle of machismo and the women that are trapped by it. There are three girls and have fallen in love with one man that really doesn't love any of them but only as temporary lovers. The tragedy is that the women don't realize this except Pepa who ends her relationships with Ivan. Even though she doesn't love Ivan anymore we see with her conversation with Marisa that she has not given up her love for machismo but that she wants the telephone repairman. In my opinion what makes this film good is the direction by Almodovar. I have never seen a style so distinct and interesting like his. The settings are familiar but at the same time the colors create another world like the world of Oz. One scene that captures this is when Pepa talks with Lucia on the phone and we can only see their faces and bright backgrounds. This is just a small example but the attention to detail is the most important job to a director and Almodovar has done it well. I recommend the move to anyone that wants to try something new even though it was filmed in 1988. I think that anyone can relate to at least one role especially because of the great acting. The film could give us a new look on our concept of love while keeping an open mind.".

This film proves that seriousness have nothing to do with greatness. The only time he fails is when he makes his ode to Fellini too obvious in the beginning of the film  a man walking through the women of his life with winds silently blowing in the background in a bw image...

	schema:headline " Terrific earlier Almodvar";
	schema:reviewBody "The title 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' tells exactly what this movie is about. A couple of women who are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The film has the form of a soap opera although it combines many genres in the end it is just a terrific comedy.One of the women is Pepa Carmen Maura an actress. An actor Ivn Fernando Guilln was her lover but now he has left her. Before he leaves town she needs to speak to him and that is one of her goals the entire film. Another woman is Candela Mara Barranco. She is almost losing it because her boyfriend is an arrested terrorist. She fears her name will be mentioned and she will be arrested. We also meet Ivn's exwife Luca who is a little mad with Pepa since she was her exhusband's lover. Ivn's son Carlos a young Antonio Banderas visits Pepa's apartment together with his wife because they are interested in renting it. Other women including a lawyer called Paulina Morales Kiti Manver a couple of police officers and a cabdriver are also central characters.Somehow all these characters with their own story lines come together somewhere in the movie. In the beginning it is a little hard to keep track although director Pedro Almodvar keeps things pretty organized with his soap opera approach. The film is comedy all the time but it has dramatic moments thriller moments action moments including a chase crime moments and even a western moment in a sublime touch when two women are face to face both with a drink instead of guns in their hand.Director Pedro Almodvar who has made the critically acclaimed 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' 'All About My Mother' and 'Hable con Ella' 'Talk to Her' here already shows us how gifted he is as a writer and as a director. He knows that comedy can be found in all things including sad things like lost love and suicide. Instead of trying to create funny moments he just gives us a couple of characters in a room and trusts that their way of living is funny enough for an audience to like it. As with the two movies I mentioned earlier 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' is a terrific example.".

A knucklestotheface romp that has a big bite and a big heart Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown sets its sights on Pepa Carmen Maura a fashionable but depressed voiceover actress. Her career has been mostly successful but in just the past week her life has turned into a housewife's dream of a soap opera. Her lover has left her she's pregnant she faints at the slightest source of drama she nearly overdoses on sleeping pills and her friend Mara Barranco is dating a terrorist. If that doesn't sound like Almodvar then you must not associate Steven Spielberg with E.T. and allAmerican families thrown into otherworldly situations.Almodvar isn't in the mood to bump us around he'd rather charm us in the same way Doris Day vehicles did when soap commercials were still around. For Almodvar the '80s were a time to figure things out drape his colorful images and themes onto unusual projects and hope they'd stick. Usually they'd be so outrageous that they'd be inevitably smacked in the face with the dreaded NC17 rating. By Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown it seems as if he's bored with outright camp in the same way John Waters was in the days of CryBaby.As one of cinema's most confident directors Almodvar restrains his inner wildness and lets the zippiness of the film speak for itself. In return it becomes his calling card. Audiences don't want to be left in shock after all they want to have a good time. And I dare you to not be entertained by Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. There are only highly saturated colors faux poparty sets six emotions and women save for Antonio Banderas and Fernando Cuervo. There are no subtleties to be found in the film and it's all the better for it. It's a 1930s women picture on acid. It's such a madcap comedy that anything regarding realism would ruin its potent screwball scent. The conversations are so witty and so rapidfire that they only exist in a blinkandyou'll miss it ideology. When the dialogue is serious it has all the seriousness of a Lichtenstein painting. When the dialogue is funny it would prefer to derive its laughs from the melodramatic turmoil of the film's leading characters.Almodvar jumps all over the place defining comedy drama romance pulp and action in a single swipe. In any other case the film would be a lost cause in terms of identity never knowing what it wants to be. Yet Almodvar makes Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown singular. It's so broadly drawn in the first place that any case of camp seems to be begged for. Hell if an elephant decided to join in on the complicated situation in Pepa's nutty apartment it wouldn't come as a surprise. Yes the film is a comedy but it's so Almodvar it deserves its own unique genre off on some weird cartoonish planet. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com".

The way he's evolved as a director over the past three decades is fascinatingcompare for example Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown All About My Mother and his newest film Talk to Her.  He's been all over the map and the gorgeously slow camera movements along with the brutally honest script featured in Talk to Her seem to come from an entirely different source than the same director who made the hectic comedy Women on the Verge...  He's gone from hilarious frenetic slapstick to a certain gay simplicity in All About... to the stunning emotional array in Talk to Her.  Yet what's interesting is that his career hasn't progressed from bad to good or vice versa as so many others has his films have always been original and lovely yet when compared they all have startling differences in genre and pace.     Anyway I highly recommend this movie or anything Almodovar has ever made...he's one of the world's great directors and his movies shouldn't be missed.

Talk to Her is so lovely and deep I feel he has secretly infected my marrow with an already lucid version of myself.The actual movie of Breakdown is pretty trivial part screwball part what some call surreal but is really a goof on itself. Not a parody mind you. That's for dopes. So once you get into it its just a meal.But the entry into this is so wonderful so imaginative it will exhaust you.Our heroine is a voiceover actress who dubs Spanish dialog for nonSpanish films. Her lover is as well and they play lovers onscreen. Except it isn't them exactly. And it isn't love exactly. And they aren't playing exactly.She also does commercials and this is how she is seen by the public. One is shown. Now this IS a parody but it is presented as if it were not mixing parody in with the real confounding the screwball nature of the thing.The entry into this film plays on the not exactly natures to slowly and gently but with some viewer confusion slide us from a space where we are watching a movie to a space where we are in the midst of adding the meaning to an existing movie that isn't fully formed.This man deserves celebration attention.

	schema:headline " In the land of Almodvar's women";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think Pedro Almodvar used to make better films than the ones he makes now I believe he's always crafted very good movies. But maybe some elements or characteristics of his older pieces are not as present in his actual work Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios made me aware of this. For example the day that the women of this film experience is unlikely to occur in an Almodvar work today.Mostly I mean the level of craziness and the absurd. His last film Volver finds a lot of women living 'at the verge of a nervous breakdown' as the title of this movie translates in English and although they are about to loose their minds at times they don't find the same taxi driver three times when they stop a cab in different parts of a big city on a same day That's delirious!But what's even more delirious is that Almodvar's writing with a perfect eye for understanding the female conscience seems completely real but is cut off by situations like the one I've just mentioned and that's a beautiful contrast. It's like watching a middle shot of Pepa Carmen Maura talking on the phone that suddenly changes to a closeup of her fast walking red high heels it's like hearing things a woman in a difficult situation would think but listening to the woman saying them out loud. I don't know if Almodvar would want to explain what Mujeres is about maybe he'd prefer that you watch it without reading anything about it. I could just tell you it involves a woman Pepa having an affair with a man that left his sick wife and his nerdy son who's involved with an ugly desperate woman that goes with him to visit an apartment to buy and the apartment is Pepa's who at the moment is being visited by a girlfriend who's scared because her exboyfriend turned out to be a terroristDon't say that you would have preferred I hadn't told you anything.This is one of Almodvar's first works but don't forget this is the man who afterwards made semiautobiographical pictures with risky images and character dramas with ruthless and pathetic characters. As a director Almodvar makes all his films look practically the same the cinematography of the ever efficient Jose Luis Alcaine although here the score is from a thrilling Bernardo Bonezzi before Alberto Iglesias started collaborating with Pedro. Which takes us to the differentiating factor in an Almodvar film the screenplay in this movie as always highlighted by the classic credits screenplay and direction. Better than anything else we find Almodvar the writer capable of creating in this piece wonderful characters speaking all the same time in a small room where you can understand everything and you don't stop laughing.And therefore the performances shine here by means of a unique and impossible to replace Carmen Maura a beautifully over the top Julieta Serrano a hilarious Mara Barranco and an unrecognizable Antonio Banderas who shows here that he was probably something like an actor during a time of his life Almodvar allowed me to see that.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't think Pedro Almodvar used to make better films than the ones he makes now I believe he's always crafted very good movies. But maybe some elements or characteristics of his older pieces are not as present in his actual work Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios made me aware of this. For example the day that the women of this film experience is unlikely to occur in an Almodvar work today.Mostly I mean the level of craziness and the absurd. His last film Volver finds a lot of women living 'at the verge of a nervous breakdown' as the title of this movie translates in English and although they are about to loose their minds at times they don't find the same taxi driver three times when they stop a cab in different parts of a big city on a same day That's delirious!But what's even more delirious is that Almodvar's writing with a perfect eye for understanding the female conscience seems completely real but is cut off by situations like the one I've just mentioned and that's a beautiful contrast. It's like watching a middle shot of Pepa Carmen Maura talking on the phone that suddenly changes to a closeup of her fast walking red high heels it's like hearing things a woman in a difficult situation would think but listening to the woman saying them out loud.

	schema:reviewBody "Offbeat crazy comedy with hilarious results and turns out to be pretty funny . Almodvar comedy starred by Spanish star cast plenty of likable humour and disconcerting plots . A film dubber woman called Pepa Carmen Maura is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when his lover named Ivan Fernando Guillen leaves her and she tries to contact him to find out why he left her . In the opening scene Pepa Carmen Maura and Ivan Fernando Guillen Cuervo are dubbing to Spanish Johnny Guitar 1954. Pepa takes on Ivan's wife Julieta Serrano who is zealous because of his husband left her for her . Meanwhile  her clueless friend called Candela Mara Barranco  though Victoria Abril turned down the role appears in her flat . Candela who is as unsettling as she is afraid the police are looking for her because of her boyfriend seems to be a dangerous Islamic terrorist . There also meets Carlos Antonio Banderas  Ivan'son  and his girlfriend Rossy De Palma and amazing happenings take place . Pedro Almodvar brings us a very mixed bag of outlandish characters  rapid dialogs  and absurd situations on a luxury flat . As a pregnant woman becomes involved into loving triangles  terrorists  revenger wives and faces the greatest danger which we carry within ourselves . Enjoyable though silly film full of good taste  offbeat characters  embarrassing moodpieces  fun scenes  sympathetic humor and sense of style but not totally satisfactory  including conventional as well as undiluted pitfalls . The picture deals with troubled people  offthewall comedy  absurdities  terrorism  jealousy and many other things . The movie is pretty well and turns out to be a superior comedy to Almodovar's previous and subsequent entries . The result is an amusing but sometimes absurd comedy including profanities  colorful frames and a crazy strings of plots . There are many references to Pedro Almodvar's universe throughout the film . Pedro Almodvar and Carmen Maura's personal relationship was seriously damaged during the shooting which Maura even defined as a living hell. It took 18 years for them to work again . On Carmen Maura  Almodvar told  If you divide the stages of my career and labelled them with the names of the people I've worked with there's definitely a stage in my filmmaking that would be called The Carmen Maura Years and those films were all in the 80s  although I did work with her again on Volver 2006. At the time I felt she was absolutely the best vehicle I could find to tell my stories. She was the actress who had the best intuition to connect with what I wanted from her. She could be very funny and very dramatic at the same time so it was the perfect combination for me . Nice interpretations by all starstudded cast as Maria Barranco  Fernando Guillen  Rossy De Palma  Julieta Serrano and full of familiar faces as Chus Lampreave as a caretaker  Witness Jehov  and other delightfully played roles such as Kiti Mnver  Guillermo Montesinos as Cabman  Eduardo Calvo  Loles Len  Joaquin Climent  Lambordero  Ana Leza  among others . And a HollywoodSpain super star  Antonio Banderas . In fact  this movie marks Antonio Banderas's 3th collaboration with Pedro Almodvar  after Labyrinth of passions and Matador  subsequently they made  Atame  The skin I live in  I'm so excited  among others hits . As usual in most of Pedro Almodvar's movies there is a small role for Agustn Almodvar his brother and producer of the film who plays a building employee . Atmospheric musical score by early deceased Bernardo Bonezzi  Almodovar's ordinary  including known songs by Chavela Vargas . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine . The motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar  he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special comedy  including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film Pepi Luci Bom 1980 was made in 16 mm and blownup to 35 mm for public release . In 1987 he and his brother Agustn Almodvar established their own production company  El Deseo S.

The story is subpar three barnstormers stop at a small Kansas town to put on a show and get involved in a lessthanintriguing soap opera with the occupants of a house where they are staying.  What makes the movie work for me is the reoccurrence of so many memorable images from the town where I grew up but for outsiders the essence of smalltown Kansas life is captured so purely you'll be transported to the peacefulness of a world where the arrival of daredevil skydivers is a Big Event.Most interesting to note in this film are the backstories.  Scott Wilson was called in to replace an injured John Philip Law who was originally cast as the young daredevil.  Gene Hackman was still a fledgling relatively unknown and yet he managed to steal most of the scenes from the established Burt Lancaster. For the locals this film still lingers in the memory.  The Victorian home where the barnstormers stay still stands and the screened in porch on the house's north sidebuilt exclusively for this film by the visiting film crewis still referred to by locals as the MGM porch.'  The fight song that the marching band plays throughout this film is still the fight song of the Butler County Grizzlies the athletic team of the local community college.  And even today oldtimers wonder whether or not that was really Deborah Kerr in the buff  or if a body double was used.

	schema:headline " A personal experience with Deborah Kerr while making this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "When action scenes for Gypsy Moths were about to be shot mostly at the BentonKansas airfield I was 18 and living in Wichita. Due to my interest in acting mainly in High School productions I along with my five brothers and sisters and Mother who was a bit of a ham herself answered a cattle call for crowd scenes at Benton Airfield. Because I was Burt Lancaster's general height and build and was the same size 42 Long I was upgraded to Standin for him and ended up standing in for all the principle male characters except Gene Hackman who used his brother. There was a scene in a park in El Dorado KS where Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster sit on a merrygoround and talk. He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr. The director wanted to change the lighting on that particular shot to compensate for Mr. Lancaster's new position. He called for the Seconds to take the actors' places while they fine tuned the lighting. At that moment Deborah's standin was over by the swings in the process of losing the greasy chili which had been catered that night and couldn't answer the call. John Frankenheimer was upset by her failure to report and acted like he was about to fire her but always the gracious lady Ms. Kerr said she was fine just sitting there and would stand in for herself. The scene required that Burt Lancaster lean in to the point that their faces are mere inches apart.

My esteem for her grew many fold that night. Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her. I would remind her of what she said 36 years ago and ask when she would be able to take me to see her agent. At 85 years old I wouldn't be surprised if she said Give me a couple of minutes and we'll go over right now. Deborah Kerr I still love you and I always will.".

	onyx:emotionText "When action scenes for Gypsy Moths were about to be shot mostly at the BentonKansas airfield I was 18 and living in Wichita. Due to my interest in acting mainly in High School productions I along with my five brothers and sisters and Mother who was a bit of a ham herself answered a cattle call for crowd scenes at Benton Airfield. Because I was Burt Lancaster's general height and build and was the same size 42 Long I was upgraded to Standin for him and ended up standing in for all the principle male characters except Gene Hackman who used his brother. There was a scene in a park in El Dorado KS where Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster sit on a merrygoround and talk. He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr. The director wanted to change the lighting on that particular shot to compensate for Mr. Lancaster's new position. He called for the Seconds to take the actors' places while they fine tuned the lighting. At that moment Deborah's standin was over by the swings in the process of losing the greasy chili which had been catered that night and couldn't answer the call. John Frankenheimer was upset by her failure to report and acted like he was about to fire her but always the gracious lady Ms. Kerr said she was fine just sitting there and would stand in for herself. The scene required that Burt Lancaster lean in to the point that their faces are mere inches apart. There she was the consummate professional and I standing in for Mr. Lancaster was face to face with an actress I had loved ever since seeing her in such films as From Here to Eternity and The King and I. It's understating my uneasiness by saying I was sweating bullets and worrying about my breath.

A far cry from the many Nuns she has played in her career. Compare her in this with Heaven knows Mr Allison with Robert Mitchum.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an overlooked gem and deserved better than what it got. I remember it coming out in theatrical release in the late 1960s and it received very good reviews but for some reason it quietly died off or so it seems. The director in the commentary on the DVD tells why this occurred and that was basically due to a change of management at MGM shortly after this movie was released. Now it can be appreciated with the new DVD technology.The technology used to film this movie was very sophisticated for its time and gave results that would challenge the technology of today. Film cameras instead of video cameras were used by the skydivers nevertheless they obtained tremendous aerial shots that are thrilling even today. It is hard to believe that these scenes were filmed thirty six years ago.The documentary film on the DVD about the making of this movie is absolutely essential to fully enjoy and understand the skydiving associated with this movie including the Bat Wing stunt skydiving that forms a sort of particular drama with this movie. A better film documentary film about this movie which I doubt exists or will be shown would be about the making of the love scene between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. The had a love scene of sorts in the 1953 movie From Here to Eternity. That scene on the beach is quite well known. However due to the Code restrictions then not really that much could be shown.I believe that one unspoken reason this movie was made was to allow a reunion between Lancanster and Kerr. Also she was willing to be naked in a movie very rare for the late 1960s. Those would be the primary reasons why she was in the movie as she was actually somewhat miscast due to her accent a definite British accent in Kansas is somewhat incongruous nowhere in the movie are we told that she is say a war bride or a British girl who somehow otherwise married a Kansas man.Having said that I am actually very glad they cast her! Nowadays I look a lot like her and worry about whether or not I can find another husband divorced and looking. Debby showed that a girl could still get a gorgeous hunk like Burt even when she was 48! You guys just can't imagine what us middle aged gals feel when we see Debby and Burt finally doing the wild thing in that living room! It gives us hope that we can still get a man! Deborah Kerr still had a great body at 48 and that is why I think she did not mind doing the nude scene. I think she was not near as nervous showing off as Burt was and certainly not near as nervous as the director. Her performance was certainly a highlight of this movie.Puzzling was the performance of William Windom who portrayed her husband. His role is somewhat out of place and I don't understand why his fine acting skills weren't use more than they were. His role is disjointed at best and it is hard to understand how the character is supposed to fit within this movie. There are absolutely no husbandwife dynamics shown between him and Kerr. Even in the most disjointed of marriages such as the second of my two marriages there is generally some sort of attachment between the two even though they may both be in the divorce court! Interestingly enough when Lancaster was on this film he had just gone through a divorce. His wife was upset due to all the flings he had been through while married to her. Well it is easy for this gal to see why he was not totally loyal to his wife he had all those sexy women throwing themselves at him! And if I had been around that area when this film was being made I would have been one of them! He was a good looking fellow then! Debby you were a lucky gal!".

The trio of barnstorming skydivers are hosted at house ownership a dysfunctional and unhappy marriage Deborah Kerr  William Windom . The inhabitants of the small town feel both attracted and threatened to the skydivers . Meanwhile  they go to a topless club according to director the dancers in the gogo club were local Kansas girls not city girls because they looked authentic where meet a sexy woman Sheree North . At the end takes place a dangerous fall to death as when jumping is not only a way to live but a way to die too . This dramatic picture is packed with skydiving  romance  love story and the drama is maintained throughout. The picture relies heavily on the doomed romance that flares up between Elizabeth well played by Deborah Kerr and Rettig magnificently performed by Burt Lancaster until a surprising final when tension explodes with an impressive skydiving show . Interesting screenplay which manages to catch the growing ambivalent and disillusionment of travellers in search of money and the quiet desperation of a marriage  it was written by Willian Hanley  based on the novel by James Drought . There aren't special effects but stunts who make it astounding . Experienced but amateur skydivers most with several thousand jumps to their credit  were brought in from California to double for the actors . During the filming at the airfield in Benton Kansas the director  wanted to get a real horrified reaction from the extras playing the audience so he had a Mannequin dressed like a skydiver and tied it under a helicopter which ascended a couple of hundred feet then released the dummy . The skydiving equipment the Gypsy Moths use in the film was sport parachuting stateoftheart for the late 1960's . The picture collaborated to create the  skydiving genre film   thus many years later were shot various movies about this sport  Break Point Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves  Terminal velocity with Charlie Sheen and Natassja Kinski and Cutaway Tom Berenger and Stephen Baldwin . Appropriate cinematography by Philip Lathrop with good aerial scenes though is necessary a perfect remastering . Adequate musical score fitting to tension by the master Elmer Bernstein .The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Frankenheimer  though being slowpace and some moments boring . It is considered to be one of Frankenheimer's less satisfying works and failed at box office  however being one of John Frankenheimer's two favorites of the films he has directed . In the beginning he worked for TV and turned to the cinema industry with The Young Stranger 1957 . Disappointed his with first feature film experience he came back to his successful television career directing a total of 152 live television shows in the 50s. He took another opportunity to change to the big screen  collaborating with Burt Lancaster in The Young Savages 1961 and Birdman of Alcatraz62 ending up becoming a successful director wellknown by his skills with actors and expressing on movies his views on important social deeds and philosophical events and filmmaking some classics as The Manchurian candidate  Seven days of May and The Train. Rating  6  well worth seeing. The flick will appeal to Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "Whoa...this was not the sort of film I'd assumed it would be! While I knew that the film would be about skydiving I didn't think it would have some of the adult content that it did. While seeing Sheree North naked was a bit of a surprise she was playing a stripper. However when moments later I saw Deborah Kerr!! and Burt Lancaster naked I knew that this was NOT what I had expected! This was clearly the late 60s when it came to its sensibilities and in a way it was a shame as I am sure audiences of the time were a bit hesitant to see films like this or send Junior to see it! This was NOT the Deborah Kerr of Black Narcissus!! As for Lancaster with The Swimmer and some other adult roles to his credit already seeing his butt didn't surprise me very much...but Ms. Kerr?! The angelic and sweet Ms. Kerr?! As for the movie while it was not a great film or a mustsee there is a lot to admire. Most importantly the camera work is very very impressiveparticularly for 1969. Having a cameraman following the skydivers as they jumped wasn't easy. Because of this the 'making of' film The Sky Divers is a great addition to the DVD as it talked about and showed the many technical problems posed by such a demanding shoot.The plot is not particularly actionpacked despite all the skydiving but is more like a tale of three very tired men...men who go from city to city putting on jumping expositions to make a buck. It's obvious they aren't getting rich this way and perhaps they hate it in a way but it's their life. This turned out to be an interesting case studyalthough it was not particularly easy to connect with any of them. And at times it was easy to dislike or be confused by the characters. For example why did Kerr cheat on her husband? And for that matter why did the husband William Wyndom go through his role like he was a zombie? Overall an interesting film but one I don't strongly recommendespecially since although John Frankenheimer loved this film probably because he was proud of the technical aspects it's not among his best work.By the way near the beginning of the film you see some folks talking with the three leads about parking for the upcoming parachute jumping exhibition. Oddly one of the men in the scene is asleep and the magazine he's been reading is blanked outlike they do on MTV when videos show people with pot leaves on their clothes. Why did they do this AND why does this appear on the DVD? Was it this way originally in theatrical release? I was so curious that I tried listening to the commentary track but it said nothing. I assume the magazine was a Playboy or something but I still wonder why the DVD has it blanked out...especially since you DO see a high amount of nudity throughout the film for the time it was made.".

Mike Rettig Lancaster finds himself falling for Elizabeth Brandon Deborah Kerr who happens to be the aunt of Malcolm Webson Wilson.Fundamentally this is a good story scripted by William Hanley based on the novel by James Drought well told and it's punctuated by absolutely dazzling sky diving footage. Some viewers may wish there was more of this type of thing in the movie and less romance. The film flirts with melodrama such as a back story involving Elizabeth but Frankenheimer and the actors help keep it on an even keel.It's the cast that makes this worth watching. The majority of the performances are agreeably subtle with the exception of Hackman who's playing the extrovert of the group anyway. Lancaster and Kerr have a very alluring sex scene both actors look incredibly good. Hackman strikes up a relationship with a hottie waitress Sheree North while Wilson is attracted to the college student Bonnie Bedelia who's boarding with the Brandons. North absolutely sears the screen. William Windom is good as Kerrs' husband whose aloof nature is a factor in her being turned on by Lancaster.Frankenheimer gets great use out of the real Midwestern locations this was filmed in various parts of Kansas the movie is definitely a real slice of Americana. Overall it's endearing enough and exciting enough to make it an okay view it's ultimately rather predictable but it remains watchable throughout.Seven out of 10.".

If I remember Frankenheimer's Grand Prix was like that too. That was about racing but there was lots of soap opera.The prelude which lasts a while does lead to the skydiving sequences. Then there's a major tonal shift. It is then that the film actually works and works well. I really liked how the film came to its almost poetic conclusion. The thoughts behind the final part of the film should have been used in the introductory hour or so.John Frankenheimer was very disappointed that this film saw almost no distribution in the U.S. Frankenheimer said it was his favorite film of those he directed. The film was rated M which was the twoyear forerunner to the MPAA's GP and subsequent PG. Perhaps it was the mature content in those early days of the MPAA's modern rating system that threw audiences and exhibitors off.It is an interesting film and worth one viewing for those who followed Frankenheimer's career or those who are interested in skydiving. 6 Out of 10 Stars".

Did they drug her like they did with Julie Andrews's character in S.O.B.? Or is she really that dumb to be duped by a slimeball such as Frankenheimer that it's all for the good of the ART?

	schema:headline " Refreshing Content and Nice Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I will comment on this significant film with Greta Garbo and Nils Asther let me make a short biographical notion.Many biographers of Greta Garbo including Barry Paris and Karen Swenson note that she came to Hollywood with her mentor Mauritz Stiller in September 1925... Although she was already a trained actress having made two significant projects in Sweden and Germany what she found in MGM was very different from what she experienced in Europe. The roles she was given though being sometimes very successful roles including the ultra popular Felicitas in FLESH AND THE DEVIL were in majority the roles of vamps and temptresses. But Garbo...she disliked playing 'bad women.' When in her prolonged contract Garbo started to have a word in the roles she played and rejected some unattractive ones more sophisticated projects appeared... One of such refreshing projects was undeniably THE SINGLE STANDARD. One the one hand a movie appears to be ignored in many analysis of her film career it appears to be forgotten by some Garbo fans as well on the other hand the movie is strangely an 'oldie' that many modern viewers find entertaining and appealing.It seems that the reason why this film is at least known among the fans of silver screen productions is the pairing of Greta Garbo and Nils Asther. Indeed both give tremendously convincing performances that still after those decades maintain their desirable authenticity. Who can possibly skip their unforgettable moments on the islands of eternal sunshine? How can we ignore their memorable chemistry when experiencing the Philosophy of Love? Who can ignore the perfect tension when the hearts are there but duties elsewhere...? Yes Nils Asther appears to be one of the best costars Greta Garbo could ever play opposite.Another reason I think is Greta Garbo herself and her unforgettable moments throughout the film. Although the closeups are not that outstanding like in her top productions of the 1930s there are pretty pearls that should not be skipped at least by Garbo fans. For instance this is the moment of her walk in rain when she humorously states I want to walk alone... These are her unforgettable facial expressions when 'naughty men' come filled with wit having dated their delicious mistresses. This is generally the feeling she put in any kind of portrayal she did before the camera. But here let me concentrate more deeply on the role of Ms Stuart that Ms Garbo so beautifully portrays since there is one more rarity about the Swedish Sphynx the power of THE SINGLE STANDARD lies specifically in the refreshment of Garbo's masterful acting. Arden Stuart is a woman who on the other hand wants to be independent from men but on the other hand learns to understand what living for others means. Although she wants to walk alone she does not live her life all alone though she has some great time on All Alone ship. She does not accept any half measures and treats life seriously being very genuine in what she does. As a free woman Arden opens her heart to...love. However this love will make her stand before the most important decision of her life... Among many scenes that remain in one's memory including Arden's scenes with her child I would like to share one moment with you the moment that truly left a trace in my mind and in my heart. This is the moment when Arden has a trip with a chauffeur and she says that there is no difference whether it's a girl a man but both have right to... life. It is the viewpoint that very well fixed to Garbo to her powerful belief in personal freedom and happiness. Although some say that Garbo plays a normal woman in THE SINGLE STANDARD I would say more Garbo plays a sophisticated human being in THE SINGLE STANDARD a human with her fears her feelings her decisions and reflections her heart.Other aspects are perhaps not greatest merits of the movie with some exceptions. It is true that the cinematography is not of top quality. The same may be said about some supporting roles. But here two things may also work well for the film nowadays firstly it is the short length of THE SINGLE STANDARD which does not bore people secondly it is the tension  the viewers' attention is kept thanks to the wonderfully roused interest.At the end of my review I would like to add one thing from me personally. I would like to ask you not to treat my words as the ones said by a Garbo fan who tries to convince viewers to see yet another oldie with the greatest actress of all time. Although I consider myself a great Garbo admirer I say it with all my heart you do not have to be very knowledgeable about Greta Garbo and you may still see this film with great pleasure finding something for yourself. That is what I wish you from my heart. I rate the film 810".

Indeed both give tremendously convincing performances that still after those decades maintain their desirable authenticity. Who can possibly skip their unforgettable moments on the islands of eternal sunshine? How can we ignore their memorable chemistry when experiencing the Philosophy of Love? Who can ignore the perfect tension when the hearts are there but duties elsewhere...? Yes Nils Asther appears to be one of the best costars Greta Garbo could ever play opposite.Another reason I think is Greta Garbo herself and her unforgettable moments throughout the film. Although the closeups are not that outstanding like in her top productions of the 1930s there are pretty pearls that should not be skipped at least by Garbo fans. For instance this is the moment of her walk in rain when she humorously states I want to walk alone... These are her unforgettable facial expressions when 'naughty men' come filled with wit having dated their delicious mistresses. This is generally the feeling she put in any kind of portrayal she did before the camera. But here let me concentrate more deeply on the role of Ms Stuart that Ms Garbo so beautifully portrays since there is one more rarity about the Swedish Sphynx the power of THE SINGLE STANDARD lies specifically in the refreshment of Garbo's masterful acting. Arden Stuart is a woman who on the other hand wants to be independent from men but on the other hand learns to understand what living for others means. Although she wants to walk alone she does not live her life all alone though she has some great time on All Alone ship. She does not accept any half measures and treats life seriously being very genuine in what she does. As a free woman Arden opens her heart to...love. However this love will make her stand before the most important decision of her life... Among many scenes that remain in one's memory including Arden's scenes with her child I would like to share one moment with you the moment that truly left a trace in my mind and in my heart. This is the moment when Arden has a trip with a chauffeur and she says that there is no difference whether it's a girl a man but both have right to... life. It is the viewpoint that very well fixed to Garbo to her powerful belief in personal freedom and happiness. Although some say that Garbo plays a normal woman in THE SINGLE STANDARD I would say more Garbo plays a sophisticated human being in THE SINGLE STANDARD a human with her fears her feelings her decisions and reflections her heart.Other aspects are perhaps not greatest merits of the movie with some exceptions. It is true that the cinematography is not of top quality. The same may be said about some supporting roles. But here two things may also work well for the film nowadays firstly it is the short length of THE SINGLE STANDARD which does not bore people secondly it is the tension  the viewers' attention is kept thanks to the wonderfully roused interest.At the end of my review I would like to add one thing from me personally. I would like to ask you not to treat my words as the ones said by a Garbo fan who tries to convince viewers to see yet another oldie with the greatest actress of all time. Although I consider myself a great Garbo admirer I say it with all my heart you do not have to be very knowledgeable about Greta Garbo and you may still see this film with great pleasure finding something for yourself. That is what I wish you from my heart. I rate the film 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Now here is one of my favorite romantic pairings yet I had mixed feelings about this late silent with Greta Garbo and Nils Asther. This is mostly due to the fact that I don't think the characters or the background are developed enough to make the whole cohesive.A case in point is the suicide of the chauffeur in the beginning of the movie. He and Arden Garbo are having a love affair but for some reason when he's dismissed he inexplicably wrecks the car committing suicide. I was wondering  What in the world! because there wasn't enough background on this character to understand why he would make a decision like that.Arden believes in as she puts it  living life freely without restraints and we believe at the end of the movie that she is going to sacrifice her husband and adorable little son to do that but she makes the traditional choice and stays. I realize that was the best decision and I don't think the audience would've had much sympathy for her had she gone away with Packy Asther but I wonder if that's the choice her character would realistically have made given what we know about her before.This movie is beautifully photographed and lit and the secondary actors are enjoyable as well!  Johnny Mack Brown is a doll!The director John S. Robertson gets a sensitive restrained performance from Garbo. The love scenes are idyllic and tender.Watch this one for the Greta and Nils but the story doesn't completely gel for me! P.S. Packy's hair has oddly turned white in the front during a trip to China!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SINGLE STANDARD MetroGoldwynMayer 1929 directed by John S. Robertson stars the legendary Greta Garbo in another one of many love triangle melodramas most associated with her during her reign on the silver screen. Coming at the tail end of the silent film era for her third of four film 1929 releases a busy year for Garbo THE SINGLE STANDARD ranks one of her finer efforts with a familiar theme. Acquiring the support of John Mack Brown who later achieved fame as a western movie hero through the 1950s and Nils Asther as her leading men each having previously appeared opposite Joan Crawford in OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS MGM 1928 the winning combination for this production happens to be that of Garbo and Asther.The story opens quite amusingly with its introductory intertitle For a number of generations men have done as they pleased  and women have done as men pleased followed by an opening shot of a group of married men coming out of their cars bidding good night to their lady friends then returning to their prospective spouses as witnessed by dbutante Arden Stuart Greta Garbo one of the guests at the social function. Although Mercedes Stuart Dorothy Sebastian loves Tommy Hewlitt John Mack Brown his interest is on Arden a modern day woman not only believes in sexual equality for men and women. but prefers living her life honestly. That evening Arden goes on a moonlight drive with Anthony Kendall Robert Castle a family chauffeur. Upon their return Kendall is immediately dismissed by his employer regardless of Arden assuming the responsibility. In despair Kendall takes his own life by speeding out the car of the estate and crashing it into a nearby tree. Three months after the scandalous tragedy Arden coming out of the rain enters a museum where she encounters Packy Cannon Nils Asther a prizefighter turned artist during one of his exhibits in an art gallery. Their courtship and travels on his yacht becomes a romantic and happy one until Packy decides he cannot marry Arden until his work is completed. After sailing out on his venture to the Orient Arden encounters Tommy once more this time accepting his marriage proposal. During their three year union the Hewitt's are blessed with a child Wally Albright. All goes well until Packy returns to Arden's life leading jealous husband and former lover to come to terms fighting for her affection with coffee and pistols for two. Other members of the cast include Lane Chandler Ding Stuart Mahlon Hamilton John Glendenning Kathryn WIlliams Mrs. Glendenning and Zeffie Tilbury Mrs. Hindley. Those familiar with actor Joel McCrea will easily recognize him as one of the three suitors during the opening sequence.Regardless of THE SINGLE STANDARD being taken from the novel by Adela Rogers St. John the plot seems to borrow certain structures from Garbo's earlier works and recycling those taken from 1927s LOVE based on Anna Karenina where the Garbo character with a son she adores finds herself torn between husband and lover FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1926 where two men consider settling their differences for the woman they love by having a duel or her most recent WILD ORCHIDS 1929 also featuring Nils Asther where husband Lewis Stone schemes on a hunting trip with wife's lover hoping for a convenient accident for one of them. Unlike these selected titles Garbo's character is pitted between two men of equal age status here instead of middleaged husband versus young lover. With these mixtures involved THE SINGLE STANDARD survives on its own merits resulting to a satisfying story equipped with original music score. Had THE SINGLE STANDARD been produced as a talkie the locale being San Francisco might have been changed somewhere in Europe considering its leading players being of Swedish heritage with spoken accents. Their character names Arden and Packy unfitting for their personalities might have served better for American MGMtypes as Norma Shearer or Joan Crawford and John Gilbert or Conrad Nagel.It's interesting to note how the word Alone long associated with Garbo's image turns up here. Many credit the line I want to be alone from her 1932 classic GRAND HOTEL 1932 as her most famous quote. Yet in THE SINGLE STANDARD coming three years earlier includes an amusing sequence where she finds herself annoyed by a masher Wade Boteler while walking in the rain. She ends his persistence by telling him I'm walking alone because I like to walk alone. The name of the yacht where Arden and Packy venture alone together is revealed to be All Alone. The only thing missing is the Irving Berlin song All Alone as its underscore.Distributed to home video through MGMUA in the 1990s THE SINGLE STANDARD at 72 minutes turns up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greta Garbo in her second to last silent film beautifully plays a normal young American woman socialite who longs for excitement and love though she cannot quite figure out what love is. Her character Arden who seems to have no parents and who seems to exist effortlessly and rather detached among the high society set has a brief romantic fling with her chauffeur which causes scandal among the posh set when the driver fired takes his own life. Arden next finds love with rogue artist Packy Cannon played passionately but a little shallowly by handsome Nils Asther. Nils tempts her to join him spontaneously on a pleasure cruise and we do get a few hints as to what pleasure Packy is up to with Arden but really their passion is quite restrained considering what modern day films splash on the screen. After Packy has compromised Arden he callously decides he loves Arden too much to continue seeing her and orders the boat turned around. Arden is heartbroken deposited back onshore like an old and weathered boat rudder.She next finds love with an old admirer Tommy played sweetly and sensitively by anythingbutdull goodlooking Johnny Mack Brown. He proposes and on the rebound from Packy she accepts. Three years later they have a child together and a very happy marriage. It was nice to see Greta playing a normal woman who eventually puts her marriage first before her old flame just like most normal American women would do today. There is no compromise here Arden simply makes the wisest decision for all concerned which is ultimately based on true love for true love always endures perfect sacrifice.The print is rather deteriorating in spots and quite scratchy but really after you have seen as many silents in poor condition as I have this one is still above average. It just goes to show how the studios blatantly neglected their silent classics once sound came in letting them deteriorate or disappear into rust. A tragic and shortsighted waste.It was nice to see other silent film actors like Dorothy Sebastian Spite Marriage and Mahlon Hamilton Little Old New York in the cast albeit in small roles. The musical score was the old Vitaphone one but still rather elegant though I wouldn't say it was beautiful as the other reviewers here have stated.

	schema:reviewBody "Garbo is an absolute revelation in this outstanding silent film the video has a beautiful musical score.  Garbo plays Arden Stuart a beautiful young woman who rejects the sexual double standard and feels free to engage in affairs with any man she likes.  She takes up with famous artist Packy Cannon and travels 'round the world with him on his yacht.  After Packy dumps her she marries Tommy who had always adored her and has a child. Then Packy returns...The kinds of themes sounded in The Single Standard were completely blotted off the screen by the Production Code Hollywood's selfcensorship scheme which became fully operational around 1934.  The movie explores female liberation and sexuality.  It grapples with the issue of whether marriage is a loveless institution of mutual support or a vehicle for love and fulfillment.  This is a very adult film and a great one.  Films like this were not made again until the 1970'sand nobody ever surpassed Garbo in this kind of role.The Single Standard was adapted from a novel by Adela Rogers St. John. Rogers St. John was the daughter of the famous trial lawyer Earl Rogers who was the most famous criminal lawyer of the early years of the century and who died a hopeless alcoholic.  She never went to school and simply hung around her father's law office but later became a famous author and journalist.  The great film A Free Soul 1931 is based on  Rogers St.John's autobiography and chronicles her life along with her father's. Rogers St. John was in her own life very much like the heroine of A Single Standard and embodied the ideals of women's liberation in the 1920's.".

Rogers St. John was in her own life very much like the heroine of A Single Standard and embodied the ideals of women's liberation in the 1920's.";

	schema:reviewBody "Garbo would soon be talking but still in 1929 MGM was putting her in silent films as they searched for the right property for her. Still when Greta Garbo made The Single Standard her future in sound was still a subject for speculation.With her Swedish accent it wasn't sure how it would register in sound. But watching The Single Standard Nils Asther and Johnny Mack Brown also had accent issues. Asther was also from Sweden and he's probably best known in talkies for playing the title role of a Chinese general in The Bitter Tea Of General Yen. He slipped back into B pictures and less with sound.So to did Johnny Mack Brown. Brown was an All American from the Crimson Tide of Alabama and had an accent to match. He who was a leading man to Garbo and Mary Pickford among others quickly went into westerns and soon enough B westerns for his career. Silent films were a great leveler in casting. As long as you looked believable in the role no speech limitations could hinder you.It's why Garbo is playing an American socialite who is bored with her life and doesn't see why she shouldn't go out and sow wild oats like the men do. The Single Standard should apply to all.So she dumps good old reliable Brown to have a fling with first her chauffeur and then artistboxer Nils Asther. This was a character that had to have been borrowed from current middleweight champion Mickey Walker although Walker was fighting more than painting at this point of his career.Asther is one romantic dude for a prizefighter and even when she goes back to Brown and has a son by him he's still someone she can't shake.Sharp eyed viewers will note the presence of future stars Joel McCrea and Robert Montgomery in the cast as a couple of debonair men about town. The Single Standard is not the best of Garbo silents though she gets her moments in. Best for her are scenes with her young son a harbinger of what she does in Anna Karenina some years later.A must for Garbo fans yet all of her films are.".

In fact the only actor whose role rivals Asther's is Johnny Mack Brown. Mr. Brown is awful as usual but he doesn't come across too badly because Robertson artfully places him in Garbo's shadow thus diluting his excessive hamming to a point where he often but not always seems reasonably tolerable. All the other roles are small. Thirdbilled Dorothy Sebastian has such a miniscule part that most viewers would be unaware that she's in the picture at all. Aside from the three leads the only players who make any impression are Joel McCrea as leader of the opening partygoers Wade Boteler in an unusual role as an umbrella snatcher and Fred Solm as the hapless chauffeur. This time the alluring Garbo is photographed by Oliver T. Marsh. In both this films and Wild Orchids she is costumed by Adrian. And both films have delightfully atmospheric music scores composed and conducted by William Axt. Oddly Wild Orchids also has lots of sound effects but Single Standard though released later in 1929 has none at all. Not even a lion's roar!".

In the film Garbo plays Arden Hewlett a rich woman who believes that men and women should play by the same rules in terms of relationships. She doesn't have a problem with the boys running out on their wives and she expects the same. She eventually hooks up with a boxer Nils Asther but winds up with another man Johnny Mack Brown who she marries. Once married the boxer comes back into her life and wants her back. I'm sure this film was dated even by 1929 standards so it certainly doesn't play any better today. This isn't a horrible movie but at the same time everything in it is so bland that you can't help but be bored out of your mind. What's even worse is that the film lasts a short 73minutes yet even that seems way too long. The only thing that really works here is the beauty of Garbo. She does a nice job in the role and she's easily believable as the fun girl every guy would want to be with. I thought Asther was also pretty good and what lively moments the film does have are due to the boat trip between his character and Garbo's. Brown isn't too bad but his role is so predictable that it comes off rather boring. Director Robertson really seems to be asleep at the wheel because there's no energy or life anywhere in the film. I'm not sure if the studio just made this production a quickie until they could find out what to do with Garbo and sound movies but in the end the film just doesn't work.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about Traci Lords.Traci's abilities took her to Cannes France for Traci I Love You she arrived and got the attention of French photographers. Her body transformed from her illegal years. She's the favorite nude model of JeanPaul Gabriel Pontello. He's obsessed with her after the night in the Arena of Pleasure. Traci bones casting agent Mr. Alisair. Alban Ceray. She ends up as a topless dancer and JeanPaul secretly watches in the audience. He sends her a necklace and Traci remembers the night in the Arena of Pleasure being bathed by Diana and Leanna. She ends up in an audience with Monique Marilyn Jess. Monique calls a group of men who exchange pleasures with Traci. The audience now active because of Traci. Monique and Traci all over each other before other male strangers got involved. Traci remembers all this before meeting Jean Paul in his car. Viewers get a pantyless crotch shot.The infamous scandal brought Traci Lords mainstream fame when porn wasn't common. Traci Elizabeth Lords is an exporn star former porn queen or porn princess... exchild prostitute if she wants. Whatever it should be called her past is why most people care. Could be 20 movies 87 91 100 or however much she made. Highest paid or not she sold Traci I Love You to Caballero for a reported 100000. Contrary to what she believes she has benefited from porn. The enduring controversy of her porn life made her autobiography a bestseller. Jim Wynorski saw free publicity in giving her the lead in Not of this earth. John Waters felt compassion casting her in CryBaby and Serial Mom. Roseanne Barr felt the same inviting her on a few Roseanne episodes. Many of Traci's roles play on her sexpot image like those in Fast Food Married with Children and Melrose Place. Even the creators of SciFi's First Wave series knew the attention her presence on the show would generate. Most former porn performers don't attempt mainstream acting if they did they're going to get plenty of doors slammed in their faces by selfrighteous casting agents in Hollywood. Ginger Lynn also had an abusive parent and boyfriend. She had similar troubles getting nonporn roles that didn't require nudity. But Traci Lords has been the most successful. She remains uncommon. Lords was angered by Dateline for interviewing World Modeling Talent Agency founder Jim South Tim North in its story about her. It isn't lousy journalism to get the other viewpoint. Nobody rides for free. Traci claimed that South provided cocaine and champagne to loosen her up for a nude photo session. Christy Canyon disputes Traci's charge and defends Jim South. Something bigger has to happen for people to forget that part of my life she said. Porn made Traci Lords famous and literally gave her a name. Her real name is the stage name from THAT industry she loathes. Making it her legal name gave more ammunition to her critics even if she honestly meant to face her past.Traci reluctantly accepts fans and pretends to not care why they like her. What people think of me and what they put on me that's their stuff. And who am I to tell people what to think? Or But why people relate to me is really up to them. I appreciate the fans where they come from and what they like about me is their business. Traci Lords asks Was it impossible to change public opinion? Looks like she concluded yes. She made a new life putting down the porn industry and the pornographers who didn't know her real age. The ones who didn't know she was really angry in those movies a sexual terrorist acting out. Traci's ultimate roleKristie Elizabeth Nussman. Her squealing hiccuped moans weren't really pleasure as she claims but venting complete and total rage. Her famously vocal scenes whether as Jody John Leslie's Lolitawannabe student in Breaking It. Or tempting Jamie Gillis with her Catholic school girl ways in Alex Derenzy'sWild Things. Being the naively endearing mermaid in Talk Dirty to Me Part 3 with Leslie again. Even as Tom Byron's seductive sister Vicky Jennings in Sister Dearest. She was the dumb valley girltalking Debbie in Black Throat. She was undercover cop Michelle Leon in Beverly Hills Copulator. Out to take down a drug lord who's involved in the sexual exploitation of young women dramatic music including her sister Rachel. No Lorraine but there's Grace. Her partner Grace Fischer is played by Kristara Barrington Kim Morgan. Some claims that Morgan also started porn when underage.Traci believes the pornographers could have at least apologized about exploiting a young girl after finding out her true age. How comes no one presses them on that? Traci asked. This industry has hardly gotten free passes. With a closer look porn's bad parts can be seen. Tragic porn stories attract the Hard Copy and A Current Affair crowd. John Holmes dying of AIDS. He did drugs and stole to serve his habit. Don't forget Wonderland. Savannah shot and kills herself in 1994. Shauna Grant did the same thing a decade before. Nina Hartley was right. Traci came to them they didn't go to her. Lords said porn wasn't about sex but being part of a community. She was an angry young girl dressing a certain way using sex to act out and sex was a tool. She did reek of sex. So people who worked with her in porn are not just pushing an agenda when they described her as the wild cat she was. John Waters said she was good at being a porn star.Already a Fallen Angel before porn Traci Lords was exploited as much as anyone who gets hired for filmed sex. Like anyone who gets paid once and their scenes recycled. She demonstrated she was a capable business woman and performer. Traci Lords had Control.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the first pairing of Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell and it was successful enough so that the two worked together two years later in Side Street. I heard that this movie was sort of a early Bonnie and Clyde and it was but only to a degree.Granger and O'Donnell didn't really dominate the screen until after 40 minutes but after that it was mostly them. Frankly I enjoyed the first 40 minutes best when Howard da Silva and J.C. Flippen shared the screen time. They were great film noir characters in this movie and they did come back in the second half livening up the film again. I liked their names in here da Silva was Chicamaw. and Flippen was TDub. In most of the second half of this movie it went from a noir to a romance. but that's not surprising knowing the director was Nicholas Ray.This is the best I've ever seen O'Donnell who never impressed me much but she's impressive here with a fine performance and a nice '40s look to her. She had a strange character name too Keechie. Granger Arthur Bowers does a nice job too. For an uneducated thug he sure comes across as a really nice guy. It's kinda of weird. He reminded me of John Dall in Gun Crazy 1950. Some of the camerawork also reminded me of Gun Crazy.However one major detail should be noted unlike Gun Crazy and Bonnie  Clyde the two lovers in this movie did NOT rob banks together. O'Donnell's character never gets involved in any crime so comparing this film to those doesn't really fit. Most of Keechie's time is spent living in a remote cabin lodge and suggesting periodically to her husband that he go straight  a far cry from the women Peggy Cummins and Faye Dunaway played.Like a lot of good film noirs this also has some very good supporting actors who play weird people and say weird things. Some of the dialogue in this movie is fascinating because it's so odd. One example is the guy who marries the couple for 20. Another is Keechie's father.This is a odd little B noirmelodrama and definitely one that film noir fans should check out. Romantics will like it too. I'm glad it is now available on disc as part of the Film Noir Classics Collection Volume 4.".

	schema:headline " a classic Bnoir film with heart and style";
	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Ray's first film is a fascinating enveloping example of a filmmaker getting as much as he can out of so little. His film was made under the radar at RKO despite having John Houseman as a producer. While also having a cast of really unknowns he also uses it to his advantage to tell a small story very well. It's close to being one of the more 'textbook' examples in the story's core in the history of Bnoir filmnoir that didn't get the hype of The Big Sleep or Out of the Past star vehicles as much as unique thrillers. Bowie Farley Granger soon to be a Hitchcock stockplayer escapes from jail with the help of a couple of bank robbers who make him as they say an investment. He meets a girl Keechie Cathy O'Donnell daughter of a farmer they pass by and he becomes friends with her so to speak. She agrees to leave town with him and they also decide almost on a whim to get married for twenty bucks no less. But soon very soon fall in love however despite the checkered and now notorious past catching up to Bowie.Obviously if you're looking for stellar method acting look elsewhere in the main performances. But they do have enough of a pull in their chemistry on screen sometimes rough and spelling of their doomed relationship other times tragically tender to back up the best aspects to the film. The true pleasures in seeing They Live By Night are the details that Ray lays in the scenes bits of life probably taken from the book the movie's based on. Godard once proclaimed that Ray IS cinema. If this statement does hold validity to a degree it shows for certain even in Ray's debut in the scenes with the secondary platers.

	onyx:emotionText "Nicholas Ray's first film is a fascinating enveloping example of a filmmaker getting as much as he can out of so little. His film was made under the radar at RKO despite having John Houseman as a producer. While also having a cast of really unknowns he also uses it to his advantage to tell a small story very well. It's close to being one of the more 'textbook' examples in the story's core in the history of Bnoir filmnoir that didn't get the hype of The Big Sleep or Out of the Past star vehicles as much as unique thrillers. Bowie Farley Granger soon to be a Hitchcock stockplayer escapes from jail with the help of a couple of bank robbers who make him as they say an investment. He meets a girl Keechie Cathy O'Donnell daughter of a farmer they pass by and he becomes friends with her so to speak. She agrees to leave town with him and they also decide almost on a whim to get married for twenty bucks no less. But soon very soon fall in love however despite the checkered and now notorious past catching up to Bowie.Obviously if you're looking for stellar method acting look elsewhere in the main performances. But they do have enough of a pull in their chemistry on screen sometimes rough and spelling of their doomed relationship other times tragically tender to back up the best aspects to the film. The true pleasures in seeing They Live By Night are the details that Ray lays in the scenes bits of life probably taken from the book the movie's based on. Godard once proclaimed that Ray IS cinema. If this statement does hold validity to a degree it shows for certain even in Ray's debut in the scenes with the secondary platers. Such as the wedding scene or in general with the dialog in the script i.e. Between him and the chicken I'd bet on the chicken or I'm the black sheep the only thing black about you are your eyelashes or even with the strengths in Ray's camera as a simple storyteller. In a sense this cuts right to the chase with the theme of doomed youth years before Rebel Without a Cause yet with the given desperation of the noir films.

The movie revolves around the relationship between them and their efforts to get away from the life of crime that is always a few steps behind them and also to try living like normal people during the day instead of at night like their criminal associates. This was Nicholas Ray's first film as a director and it certainly was a worthy effort as it has fine performances throughout especially O'Donnels.

Peggy Cummins gave a fascinating performance in Gun Crazy as a flinty unbelievably callous femme fatale Cathy O'Donnell in They Live By Night will break your heart.Indeed the acting is probably this film's greatest asset and it enables what in all respects is a B movie to feel like an A one. Farley Granger and O'Donnell bring wonderful nuances to their roles and they have a naturalistic style of acting that feels ahead of its time when compared to other films from the same period. Howard da Silva is also tremendous in the supporting role of Chickamaw managing to create a grotesque character who nevertheless feels at home in the very human world created by Ray.

The domestic contentment that Granger and O'Donnell establish for themselves is a sham they know it and we know it. They're living on borrowed time and the things that the average American strived for in a booming postwar climateloving spouse children safe and secure homeexist in this film as taunting reminders of blessings this couple can never have.And the endingthat could have been so sentimental and is instead in Ray's hands so spare and sadjust may well take your breath away.Grade A".

The latter then had a great run of pictures during the early stages of his career  including leading roles for Alfred Hitchcock Anthony Mann and Luchino Visconti  but his career petered out after the mid50s still his brooding sensitive portrayal of a rebellious youngster here would soon prove very influential particularly on the likes of James Dean who of course would essay his most iconic role in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE 1955 for Nicholas Ray himself.However the supporting players are equally impressive Howard Da Silva as the boozing triggerhappy and oneeyed leader of the gang Jay C. Flippen as the more levelheaded of the two hardened bandits who make up the rest of Bowie's gang a characterization far removed from the happygolucky sidekick he often played in John Wayne movies Helen Craig as Flippen's twotiming sisterinlaw who is more concerned with springing her own hubby out of jail even if it means betraying Bowie to the authorities Will Wright as O'Donnell's alcoholic weakling of a father and especially reptilian Ian Wolfe as a 24hour service Justice of the Peace  who has all the right connections for the perfect wedding ceremony and honeymoon so long as the customers are able to pay for the comforts provided.While there is perhaps an excess of romanticism and verbosity in the script itself the expected action is largely downplayed and the unsuccessful second robbery is not even shown the tender portrayal of the two lovers on the run is what gives this film its heart and sets it apart from other noirs of the era  compare for example Joseph H. Lewis' slightly superior GUN CRAZY 1950 for a different i.e. more nihilistic approach to similar material. In this context therefore I found the use of hardboiled dialogue in THEY LIVE BY NIGHT a bit surprising. Incidentally the film was remade by none other than Robert Altman in 1974 as THIEVES LIKE US the name of Edward Anderson's original novel the latter is a pretty good effort in its own right but hardly one of the director's major works  and in retrospect a lesser achievement than Ray's version.".

	schema:reviewBody "A brief but memorable shot at the very beginning of Nicholas Ray's They Live By Night shows two young lovers in a few shared moments of contentment that seem incredibly intimate romantic and precious. It provides an arresting image primarily because of its skillful composition but also because of the way in which light and shadow are so cleverly used to create an atmosphere of warmth and tenderness. This shot is important not only because it emphasises that the young couple's love story is the main focus of the action that follows but also because it signifies that the firsttime director's approach to filmmaking is significantly more subjective and empathetic than the majority of his contemporaries who were making film noirs during the same period.Bowie Farley Granger is a young man who was unjustly found guilty of murder and imprisoned at the age of sixteen. After having served seven years of his sentence he takes the opportunity offered to him by two other inmates and together they escape from prison. When the car in which they're travelling develops a puncture Chicamaw OneEye Mobley Howard Da Silva and TDub Mansfield Jay C Flippen leave the injured Bowie behind and make their way on foot to Chicamaw's brother's cabin where they plan to hide out and they arrange for Chicamaw's teenage niece Keechie Cathy O'Donnell to use her father's vehicle to go and bring Bowie back to the cabin.The young couple are instantly attracted to each other but their relationship is initially awkward and tentative primarily because of their common naivet but also because of Keechie's hostility towards the criminals. Bowie takes part in a bank robbery with the other two escapees because he thinks that by doing so he can get enough money together to hire a lawyer who could prove that his original conviction was a miscarriage of justice.Following the robbery Chicamaw and Bowie are involved in a car accident in which Bowie is injured and shortly after Chicamaw shoots a police officer who arrives to check out what had happened. Chicamaw takes Bowie back to his brother's cabin where Keechie nurses him back to health and it's during this period that the couple fall deeply in love and decide to go on the run. Their dream of a normal life together is what drives them as they travel across country but their chances of success are constantly under threat.A striking feature of this movie is the way in which expressionistic cinematography tight framing and closeups are used to create an environment which looks closed in and oppressive. Everyone seems to be physically trapped by their surroundings and this is even true in the outdoor sequences as the use of aerial photography creates an impression that the people below are being watched and can't escape the scrutiny that they're under.Bowie and Keechie are both portrayed as being the products of their unfortunate backgrounds and people who are essentially good. Bowie never chose to follow a life of crime and his greatest ambition is to go straight. This being the case it's fitting that he should be represented on screen by an actor who doesn't look like a stereotypical criminal and Farley Granger certainly meets this requirement. He gives a very credible performance as the misfit bank robber and Cathy O'Donnell steals the show as Keechie. Her skill in displaying the various characteristics of a girl who goes from being sullen and mistrustful to being rather warmer and more good humoured is both subtle and convincing.The best of the supporting performances comes from Howard Da Silva who is very threatening as a vicious career criminal. The entire cast is also particularly good and certainly adds another level of enjoyment to the movie by the ways in which the eccentricities and corrupt natures of the colourful characters are portrayed.".

In a memorable scene where Bowie and Keechie are married it takes place at a cheap chapel and cost 20 for a wedding license.

	schema:reviewBody "In Nicholas Ray's seminal crime drama They Live by Night injured bank robber Bowie Farley Granger falls for the independent young rancher's daughter Keechie Cathy O'Donnell and the two use Bowie's illgotten gains to distance themselves from the authorities and the rest of Bowie's gang.Bowie is the gang's wheelman and when he's injured during a getaway it's his newfound companion Keechie who gets to nurse him back to health while the others  Chickamaw Howard da Silva and TDub Jay C. Flippen  make themselves scarce. Keechie doesn't think much of her patient and his lifestyle. And make no mistake Bowie feels little shame in his role which has included murder. No brighteyed neophyte he. But there's something about Keechie her deliberate movements her slinky smile that really appeals to Bowie and the two slowly fall for each other.The first shot by Ray in his directorial debut is an early helicopter angle as the bad boys speed down a rural road as they escape from jail. In fact it's the first helicopter action shot as previous uses of the vehicle were simply to shoot landscapes to set a scene. In any event a tire is blown and the gang heads toward a farmhouse where they meet farmer Mobley Will Wright and his daughter Keechie. There's chemistry just dripping between Granger and O'Donnell both seem more naive than they truly are and although each pretends to dislike the other it's not long before them old hormones come aknocking although not too much because this is 1948 after all and the movie's set some 15 years earlier. On the run they go! Ray's first feature is strikingly shot. Aside from that iconic opening helicopter shot there's also a great little scene of the gang pulling off a job  from Bowie's perspective as the driver. A bystander tries to engage Bowie in conversation just as TDub and Chickamaw run out of the building earning him a rough shove to the face. That's noir film for you. Watch your face! O'Donnell and Granger work very well together no surprise since the latter recommended the former for the role although I think most of the appeal comes from O'Donnell who turns in a graceful passionate and unique performance as the trusting Keechie. Granger appearing in only his third film with Rope on the horizon was never really that good of an actor and so many of his lines are delivered in an almost nonchalant monotone that you wonder if some lessons weren't in his immediate future. At least no one can accuse him of hamming it up.And do you know who produced this masterpiece? None other than the great John Houseman who most of us remember from his old SmithBarney commercials but who was also one of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre performers back in the day. The man knew talent and he picked Nicholas Ray to direct without input from the studio. It's to Houseman's credit that the movie's as good as it is  which is to say a true noir classic. There may not be a Bonnie and Clyde ending but we're not talking about a Disney finale either. Bonus cameo  the jeweler who sells Bowie a watch is played by none other than Will Lee. Yes the same Will Lee who would go on to play Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street.".

	schema:reviewBody "They Live By Night AKA The Twisted Road is directed by Nicholas Ray and written by Ray and Charles Schnee who adapt from Edward Anderson's novel Thieves Like Us. It stars Cathy O'Donnell Farley Granger Howard Da Silva  Jay C. Flippen. Produced by John Houseman out of RKO it's photographed by George E. Diskant and music is by Leigh Harline.Ray's debut feature it was actually wrapped in 1947 is a potent piece of film noir set during the Great Depression. Story follows Bowie Granger a naive young man who escapes from prison with two hardened criminals Chicamaw Da Silva  TDub Flippen and finds unexpected love in the form of the almost saintly Keechie O'Donnell. However he finds that no matter what his good intentions are crime just wont leave him be and with Keechie in tow goes on the run to hopefully find a better life.It's a pretty simple story all told one that has been well represented in film over the years with the likes of You Only Live Once High Sierra  Gun Crazy. But as simple as the tale is Ray's film is very much a leading light in the subgenre of lovers on the lam movies. First thing of note is that there's a movement away from the normal characters that had frequented the noir driven crime world up till now. The protagonists here are not gangsters or private investigators they are thieves and country folk too. This offers up a different viewing character wise. Admittedly the protagonists are shrouded in classic film noir hopelessness where the air of desperation hangs heavy throughout but the characterisation shift gives the simple story a lift.From the outset it's evident that this is an intriguing even curious picture. A shot of our loving couple sharing a kiss is accompanied with a title card telling us that they were never properly introduced to the world we live in. A blast of Harline's music startles them and we then cut to an aerial shot Ray leading the way for helicopter shots of the three escapee's in the getaway car. In those 30 seconds Ray has managed to convey that his film will be an energetic yet doom laden love story. Quite a feat for a fledgling director to be unique right from the off. It's interesting to note that Ray himself said that he wasn't trying to make a film noir movie he was merely telling a tragic love story. Just another point of reference as to why the film is so fascinating.Be that as it may They Live By Night pulses with noir blood. From its perpetual moody atmospherics to the romantic narrative being punctured by moments of violence it deserves its classic film noir status. 810".

Just another point of reference as to why the film is so fascinating.Be that as it may They Live By Night pulses with noir blood. From its perpetual moody atmospherics to the romantic narrative being punctured by moments of violence it deserves its classic film noir status. 810";

Is it noir or sappy romance? I felt like the director couldn't decide. The main actors seemed too babyfaced to carry off noir imho since the hardened characters in noir plots usually need to be a little bit more mature to have gained their worldly experiences. When compared with films like Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil They Live by Night just can't hold its own. Unless you're a total noir buff I'd skip this one.

So we seek diversion and spectacle most of which really dulls by the same degree that we were already dulled to seek the escape. But there are movies like moments in life that awaken some of that wondrous sense in which we are real people again alert and fully in our presence.I'm not waxing here it's what the movie is about. It is about people bank robbers on the run who want the escape. Like a mantra the characters repeat that they want to be 'real people' a transcendent drive. For the older two dulled by life the pursuit translates to one as simple practicality money to the other as the desire for thrills and diversion the making of headlines whereby 'real' is the better than ordinary. For the betraying woman it means getting her husband out of prison so she can be alive again instead of merely biding time.But for the young couple which is the fulcrum of the film it comes to mean real in each other's eyes realized by truth and commitment to love. Great. Oh we see that the boy's clinging to the notion that love should be expressed with things to buy and a good time is a false escape and that newspapers and in the end the cop continue to circulate a false imagethe boy as killer all to solidify the floating world. But I was amazed here by just the sincere spark between the lovers.The crime spree is merely the diversion here the newspaper wrap. What's so wonderful is the heartfelt ordinariness given the Hollywood trappings. Neither of the two protagonists is a seductive movie star they are green raw and overly eager in a larger world as are their characters. And I value a presence like this as much as the most submerged Method for me it steals into and reveals that presupposed life before any affected stance.The film captures only certain aspects of noir it is not shot in the style for one. The most revealing thing is that the girl is not 'in' the crime story not an accomplice like Bonnie to Clyde but a haven a conscience. But the main engine remains noirish an inexplicable black hole in life the killing of a man 7 years ago which can't be made right and devours the light. The karmic upsurge of previous life the similarly arbitrary killing of the father the breakup of home by parents who ran away with lovers which rises again in our couple.Overall it's not so much a noir as one of the great melodramatic love movies of the time. The trail goes from here to Gun Crazy to Breathless which brings a 'real' camera to stress the affected stance to the marvelous Zen of the Breathless remake with Gere and Kaprisky.Noir Meter 24".

Ray who was respected in America and idolized in France brought something almost unheard of during the American studio era a sympathetic heart to loners and at times violent characters who had been typecast as onedimensional villains. Maybe he was a stranger there himself. In his first movie he directs with a confidence and energy that is on par or better than another great directorial debut of the 40s Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE.Bowie Bowers Farley Granger has just escaped along with TDub and Chicamaw from a prison where he was wrongly accused of murder. Hiding out in a cabin of Chicamaw's brother an attraction blossoms between Bowie and Chicamaw's niece sweet tomboy Keechie. One successful bank robbery later Bowie and Keechie decide to run awayand eventually get marriedtogether hopeful of an uncertain future together. But the Depressionera South is a harsh territory for young love and after Chicamaw finds the young couple and tempts Bowie to pull off just one more heist that goes horribly wrong Bowie and Keechie are no longer running toward a hopeful future but running away from an unjust and unforgiving police hot on their trail.Like all Nicholas Ray movies it's impossible not to note the acting and Ray learned from the besthe was a good friend and protg of Elia Kazan. Farley Granger is best known for his nervous tense performances in Hitchcock's ROPE and STRANGERS ON A TRAIN but here he gives a very assured and accomplished performance it's no wonder he called both Hitchcock and Ray the best directors he ever worked with but their approaches are very different Hitch would let the actors find the characters themselves while Ray would quietly take them aside and guide them through in a fatherly way. It's this tenderness and empathy that made Ray such a gift to his actors. Cathy O'Donnell who resembles a young Sissy Spasek is luminous and brings such a radiant glow to her role quietly affecting and never once overacting there are few actresses who could allude to both glowing innocence and tough worldliness in the same frame. Together they are perfect two naive and sweet souls hardened by their pasts and parental problems though never made explicit it is implied that they have never dated anyone never really loved someone which makes their romance all the sweeter. They would later reteam for Anthony Mann's crime drama SIDE STREET which in some ways is a sequel seeing what would've happened if they had lived like normal people in New York City. Although the magic was still there it didn't shine as brightly as it does here.The supporting work is also topnotch especially Helen Craig playing a woman who is envious of Keechie and Bowie's love affair because her own husband is in prison and she has a great scene when she betrays the couple. While we pretty much hate her guts throughout the whole movie each line across her face shows so much pain and we feel her own regret anyone who's seen the movie knows how powerful her line is I don't think that's going to help me sleep nights. Howard Da Silva was unfairly blacklisted when Robert Taylor named him as a potential communist during the HUAC era. Sadly we'll never know what other great roles he could've played.While many firsttime directors today make amazing little indie movies during the studio era there was little room to be creative. Like Welles Ray used amazing cinematography that holds up incredibly well today along with unconventional editing and an acute sense of space. For example the opening helicopter shot this was one of the first if not the very first films to feature action being shot that way normally choppers were only used for pan shots of scenery. That was Ray's first day ever directing and what a way to begin a brilliant career. He would follow his promise with the underrated classics IN A LONELY PLACE ON DANGEROUS GROUND JOHNNY GUITAR BIGGER THAN LIFE BITTER VICTORY and of course REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. Unlike James Dean Nicholas Ray faded out but while he was on fire he gave us some of the most heartfelt movies to ever be placed through a film projector.".

Their romance is a little bit twee for too long and it is only in the latter stages of the film where the two sides of Bowie start to collide where it worked. The tough stuff works as well with some nice sequences as well as characters who are convincingly threatening without ever being big time or glamorous. It gradually goes where you know it will but it isn't any less involving for that.The cast are quite good. Granger is solid when not asked to be all sentimental and most of the time he is convincing as a young man with simple hopes but no chance. O'Donnell is the same  not quite convincing when she is making eyes but more so as she carried problems at the same time. Da Silva and Flippen are both good as his tough colleagues and produce a driver for the hopelessness of the story.

Is this therefore more subversive than Altman?  I don't think so  Altman's method is an attack on Hollywood linearity on conventional methods of 'connection' his characters exist is the same space but are emotionally etc. miles apart.  The characters in 'Short Cuts' like the city of L.A. itself are a mass without a centre.  Figgis for all the supposed diffusion of his visual strands actually reunites glues together Altman's ruptures. In this way it might seem a more optimistic kind of film.  It isn't.'timecode' is being touted as a revolution in cinema a new way of watching films.  Instead of watching one screen and being led by a director we are given four and asked to make our choices. I was surprised at how panicked I was at this in the first 20 minutes darting between scenes wondering which one I should follow.  This forced me out of the film much more disturbingly than anything by Fassbinder or Godard.  But this alienation is deceptive. Firstly we are not really bombarded by four narratives  put 'pierrot le fou' 'diary of a country priest' 'vampyr' and 'branded to kill' on four screens then you'd be confused.  Figgis leads you all the way gives you an illusion of choice but rarely fulfils it.  The focus is on one screen at a time  either the soundtrack is turned up loudest the plot is more interesting whatever.  For long periods of time you can safely ignore other scenes because there is nothing going on  for about 20 minutes for example Lauren sits in a limousine listening to a bug planted on Rose this leaves us free to watch another screen and see what she's listening to. Other scenes are merely tedious  eg Emma droning to her shrink a nod to Godard's 'week end' that famous end of cinema?  so that you gladly look elsewhere. It is possible to listen to one scene and flit around at the others to catch up on what's going on.  What I'm saying is 'timecode' is not a difficult experience  after the initial adjustment you watch the film as you would any other especially as all the stories converge and are really only one story.  Even at the beginning the feeling is less one of Brechtian alienation than akin to being a security guard faced with a grid of screens  you rarely think about the physical processes of film or performance as you would in a Dogme or Godard film.So if 'timecode' is less revolutionary than it seems that doesn't mean it isn't a brilliant film a real purse in a pig's ear of a year or whatever the expression is.  One reason for this is the fourscreen structure I would have to watch it a few more times but I was very conscious of the orchestration of the screens the way compositions or camera movements or closeups etc. in one screen were echoed reflected distorted in the others  a true understanding of this miraculous formal apparatus would I think give us the heart of the film and bely the improvised nature of the content.  Figgis is also a musician  he cocomposed the score  and the movement here its fugues and variations are truly virtuosic almost worthy of my earlier Altman comparison.But the content is great fun too.  At first I was disappointed at the selfabsorbed drabness of the material the idea that we shouldn't be made to work too hard because we've enough to deal with the four screens.  And it is true that the stories rarely transcend cliche.  But such is the enthusiasm of the performers people like Salma Hayek  obviously relishing slightly more useful roles than the bilge they're usually stuck in the precision of the structure the mixture of comedy and pathos and the way the style facilitates both that you're convinced you're watching a masterpiece.  Quentin's massaging and Ana's pitch are two of the funniest things I've seen in ages while Stellan Skarsgard's rich performance stands out all the more for its brittle surroundings.".

This is a totally improvised piece of cinema shot on a handheld camera for 90 minutes straightnot a single cutand shot in realtime.  Every word of dialogue is improvised the only thing written is the story also by Mike Figgis.  The way it turned out is quite impressive.  Of course the process gets tiresome and repetitive at times but overall it's a pretty fascinating work that will probably be better appreciated by the more openminded moviegoeras opposed to mainstream viewers who will probably view this as just plain weird.I was really impressed by the talented cast filled with great actors who simply went through the WHOLE ENTIRE process without once messing up.  If you watch all these behindthescenes specials with actors stumbling lineafterline doing takeaftertake until they finally get it right the 100th timeit's astounding to see that the whole cast was able to pull this off without a scratch.  Even with such talented actors like Stellan Sarsgard Holly Hunter Salma Hayek Jeanne Tripplehorn etc. I have to commend them especially for taking part in this risky project.  This movie not only showcases their knacks for acting but also their potential to try something new innovative and quite difficultafter all taking risks is one of the main elements in becoming a good actor.This type of format doesat pointsfeel like a theatrical version of a Big Brother episode but Figgis wrote a story with as much intriguing elements as he can possibly fit into a film of this scope.  After all this is supposed a dayinthelife type of story and you don't want to be too farfetched.  So he tries to generate as much suspense and intrigue involving the many smutty attributes of the stereotypical whitecollar LA resident as he possibly could.  There are subplots involving drug abuse alcohol abuse homosexuality philandering jealousy and of course the biggest theme of all...Sex!  Naturally my interest did sometimes drift but the material compelled me enough to be interested for the majority of the running time.  I've never been a fan of those corny reality shows.  Quite frankly I think the kind of reality displayed on those programs is very dull.  Timecode transcends the dullness of the reality shows and in a way the Blair Witch Project which is another realitybased film shot entirely on a handheld camera but executed very poorly.  The material is engaging to a degree the actors perform it very well and everything is downtoearth to preserve its sense of realism.  My only criticisms lie in the earthquake effects.  Those looked totally cheesy created entirely by camera tricks and actors pretending to be shaken up.  In one of the closing scenes Jeanne Tripplehorn is clinging on to a nearby bannister while you can see cars in the background moving along smoothly.  He could've done without that pretentious trick.I'm not saying this a great film but it is one I'll remember for its unique sense of style and I will always remember Mike Figgis for coming up with this innovative method.  If you're tired of mainstream cinema and feel anxious to see something new and excitingthis is a film I would recommend.My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a rule in science that for an experiment to be meaningful all the variables must be controlled but one. That rule could be applied to experimental cinema too at least it should have been applied to this film.Time Code combines two experiments one that has promise and one that is doomed. The promising experiment involves multiple screens following different parts of the story in real time. The doomed experiment  involves requiring actors to script and direct themselves. In addition this movie was shot in four simultaneous uninterrupted takes. Maybe this was an experiment too but it is comparable to live theater which is not exactly a novelty. It is neither a good thing nor a bad thing  and should be a matter of complete indifference to the audience as long it works. Instead of cutting from scene to scene our attention shifts from screen to screen. The fourscreen experiment did work reasonably well here especially on DVD where one can instantly back up to catch bits one missed. The multiview device might even have been truly excellent in this film had it not been for the other experiment  the Absentee Director. A feature movie is not an improv sketch. There is a reason that an army has one general and that a movie has one director. Although each of these endeavors requires the effort and cooperation of many talented people both a military campaign and a feature film must be focused on one person's vision and goals. Time Code has the same fatal flaw as Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Each actor was instructed to invent his own character and then to direct himself. In Time Code each performer was evidently told to make of his character a recognizable Hollywood stereotype. The result eight variations on cokesnorting pretentious but sycophantic loser who all walk stiffly through their parts like zombies trying to perform soap opera. I cannot imagine how desperate a viewer would have to be in order to care about any of them. I suppose this should not reflect badly on the performers although it cannot have helped their careers. I have seen most of them in other films and they are all capable actors. It does reflect dismally on the director. Where was he hiding while the four cameras were running? Maybe he was busy watching four tumble dryers at the laundromat up the street.Time Code might be worth a peek on dollarday at the video store  which is how I found it. Otherwise forget it. 310.".

That rule could be applied to experimental cinema too at least it should have been applied to this film.Time Code combines two experiments one that has promise and one that is doomed. The promising experiment involves multiple screens following different parts of the story in real time. The doomed experiment  involves requiring actors to script and direct themselves. In addition this movie was shot in four simultaneous uninterrupted takes. Maybe this was an experiment too but it is comparable to live theater which is not exactly a novelty. It is neither a good thing nor a bad thing  and should be a matter of complete indifference to the audience as long it works. Instead of cutting from scene to scene our attention shifts from screen to screen. The fourscreen experiment did work reasonably well here especially on DVD where one can instantly back up to catch bits one missed. The multiview device might even have been truly excellent in this film had it not been for the other experiment  the Absentee Director. A feature movie is not an improv sketch. There is a reason that an army has one general and that a movie has one director. Although each of these endeavors requires the effort and cooperation of many talented people both a military campaign and a feature film must be focused on one person's vision and goals. Time Code has the same fatal flaw as Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Each actor was instructed to invent his own character and then to direct himself. In Time Code each performer was evidently told to make of his character a recognizable Hollywood stereotype. The result eight variations on cokesnorting pretentious but sycophantic loser who all walk stiffly through their parts like zombies trying to perform soap opera. I cannot imagine how desperate a viewer would have to be in order to care about any of them. I suppose this should not reflect badly on the performers although it cannot have helped their careers. I have seen most of them in other films and they are all capable actors. It does reflect dismally on the director. Where was he hiding while the four cameras were running? Maybe he was busy watching four tumble dryers at the laundromat up the street.Time Code might be worth a peek on dollarday at the video store  which is how I found it. Otherwise forget it. 310.";

I'd been waiting over an hour for some payoff some tiny sign of confluence between Figgis's fourframe device and the cough story he was trying to tell with it and THIS is the best he could do?  To add insult to injury the movie our young director was pitching wasn't QUITE Timecode.  It was better.  It had music by Hans Eisler for one thing.  Apart from the melody sung during this pitch the music in Timecode is banal and it's used with a hamfisted incompetence that has to be heard to be believed.  Also our young director had a neat idea.  She wanted to adapt a Borges story in which an old man and a young man meet chat and gradually discover that they're the very same person at different stages of his life.  Each of the four main characters continues our young director will be the same person at a different stage of life.  At this point our eyes scan the four frames to see if this is true of Timecode at least metaphorically.  No it isn't. Not even metaphorically.  I felt like beating my head against the chair in front of me.  Why was I watching Figgis's wretched movie?  I wanted to watch HER movie!As the young director points out this kind of thing is the offspring of digital technology.  Well not quite.  Alfred Hitchcock came up with the idea of a film without cuts in the 1940s and more or less put it into practise with Rope.  It goes without saying that Rope is far superior. The irony is that it's also far truer to Figgis's avowed ideal of perfect continuity.  In Timecode a vertical slash and a horizontal slash divide the screen into four.  EVERY FRAME is cut into pieces  Hitchcock merely had a discreet and to the best of his ability invisible cut every ten minutes or so.  He also had a story but I should stop harping on that.  Talk about a bad bargain.  And it gets worse.  The digital technology that makes Figgis's inferior vision possible also makes every frame look ugly.  Add the fact that nothing worth looking at is going on in any of them and what do we get?  Instead of one good thing a choice between four worthless things.It may not have escaped your attention that the last few years have produced a pretty poor crop of films.  1999 was the worst year in living memory  unless you were exceptionally old in 1999 and could remember the transition to sound  and 2000 turned out contrary to all reasonable expectation to be worse.  Even regression to the mean gives us little reason to hope that 2001 will be any better.  Yet every so often a film comes along that makes the future seem even bleaker.

Apparently the actors improvised their dialogue which solves the mystery of why a good screenwriter is worth her or his weight in gold.  I'm with Norman Jewison on this one a good or great movie is all about the story and this one is boring.  The characters are uninteresting louts and frankly I didn't care if they all got buried alive in the earthquake that threatens them throughout the movie.";

Having the four storylines often intersecting on screen throughout the entire movie is a gimmick plain and simple. It was distracting and made it difficult to follow the plot as it developed. The first half hour or so of the movie was a muddle to me as I struggled to figure out how everything was relating. Once it all finally came together we were treated to a relatively dull and unimaginative storyline that revolved around the shady morality of Hollywood. In an attempt to make this more interesting some erotic although nonsexual scenes of lesbianism were included. Again  dull dull dull. And the ending of the movie was telegraphed almost all the way.

I had to watch this for a class so I didn't really have a choice. I wanted to turn it off so badly. I want my 97 minutes of life back! At least I didn't have to pay a dime for this mess. But then again time is money... I should be reimbursed 100 for seeing this movie. The gimmick movie never gets any better. Trust me.Sure the idea sounds interesting take four cameras and shoot simultaneously without cuts and it was an ambitious attempt I'll give that but honestly the end result is sooooooooooooooooo HORRIBLE. It's like a really bad student film.This experiment just shows why movies need cuts directing actors even the big stars were horrible in most of the scenes a real script with a real story and most importantly using a freaking boom mic obviously they didn't use one because it would get in the shots. It is extremely boring and horribly shot.You can tell which scene the director wants you to focus on by the audio level the audio gain becomes louder for the one that should be focused on by the audience and the rest become less. The director cheats because while one scene that is being focused the rest is just obviously dragging time doing absolutely nothing. For example Jeanne Tripplehorn Water World Sliding Doors I think she was supposed to be Hayak's lesbian agent or something... all she basically does is sit in her Limo 95 of the filmsometimes she gets out of it wearing headphones to spy on Hayak. Wow. What a great part for her! I guess she accepted the role so she could make out with Salma Hayek.That reminds me... what is up with the random lesbian scenes? Everyone seems to be lesbians and making out constantly like a porno flick. It's a pathetic device to keep the simple minded audience to keep watching. That's probably the only reason some people voted high. And of course they just have to have drugs in a movie... LAME.And they also randomly throw in THREE pointless huge earthquakes within a few minutes from each other in this movie just because they want to show off that the scenes are all connected we'd probably forget they're all supposed to be connected if it wasn't for that gimmick effect. But so what? Obviously someone in the crew is just queuing all the cameraman with a countdown probably with an earpiece and then they all just shake the camera.This movie literally is like a cheap student film. I'm not kidding.Blair Witch Project cost less to make and was also experimental but it actually was wellmade and intriguing they even had better acting! and that's why it succeeded even to the mass market as well as the style repeated years later like Cloverfield.The climax for the Blair Witch was worth it and was actually the best part of movie. For this movie the ending is just as bad as the entire movie especially the acting. It really falls apart. It actually turned into more of a comedy the security guard doesn't do anything and neither does the front desk lady or whoever it was saying You can't go in there but they don't do a damn thing! Worst security ever. I mean come on. There was absolutely nothing close to being real about this movie. People are so oblivious and obviously only acting on 'que' than anything close to being natural. Oh and did I mention it turns into a porno flick every so often.The gunshot just sounds horribly cheap. Hayak's reaction and everyone else to the gunshot is laughable. And out of nowhere what is up with the girl who was giving the pitch all of a sudden just filming the dead body?  And the lady in complete white that was sitting outside with the security guard why was he just chilling outside?! seems like she was some sick person from an institute just joins the scene as if she's some medical assistant but does absolutely nothing to help the guy. This movie was just so annoying laughable and a complete mess.I'd bet the cast weren't that impressed with the final result than they first heard about the idea and getting onboard. That Stellan guy probably accepted the role because he could do Salma Hayek and 'improvise' whatever sexual moves he could think of and get away with it.If you pay close attention the four cameras aren't really even synced exactly. For example in one shot you see Hayak enter the conference room earlier than the other camera angle for a couple seconds off. That may be picky but that's bad editing if you ask me especially when the whole point of this experiment is to show that's actually totally synced.110. 1 just for trying something new. 9 for the end results.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films that are discovered through serendipity seem to be the most fun to experience.  I still fondly remember the fateful evening when I went to the Oriental Theater to see Malcolm X and arriving late so I picked the other film that they were showing simply because I was there and it was starting in ten minutes.  That film being Reservoir Dogs.  So when I saw that Time Code was playing on the Independent Film Channel I thought that this was a film that a friend overseas recommended to me so I watched it. Unfortunately this was not the film that he had suggested I see but it turns out that it was a film that was enjoyable because of its presentation. The plot lines involved in Time Code are fairly simple  We have a husband and wife who are going through tough times a lesbian couple who are less than trusting of one another and a day in the life' of a film production company.  The stories intertwine which is nothing new the interesting feature is the cinematography.  The screen is divided into four boxes with one story being told in each  sometimes entering into the other's space' but always connected in some way.  It is essentially like sitting in a security guard's station and watching four monitors at once. While this is innovative it is also quite maddening at times because you may be getting into a particular story in one segment of the screen but you are missing the activity in the other three.  The director circumvents this problem at times by raising the volume in one of the segments during certain moments but in reality it is pretty much the perfect film for someone with ADD not someone who wants to sink their teeth into a story because this film truly does not have a strong enough plot to merit watching it four times in order to get the complete impact of all of the story lines involved. On a positive note this film had an excellent cast made up of character actors such as Xander Berkeley Holly Hunter and Steven Weber.  However this is a novel film to watch once to see an interesting experiment but beyond that it left me more frustrated than anything.".

Unfortunately this was not the film that he had suggested I see but it turns out that it was a film that was enjoyable because of its presentation. The plot lines involved in Time Code are fairly simple  We have a husband and wife who are going through tough times a lesbian couple who are less than trusting of one another and a day in the life' of a film production company.  The stories intertwine which is nothing new the interesting feature is the cinematography.  The screen is divided into four boxes with one story being told in each  sometimes entering into the other's space' but always connected in some way.  It is essentially like sitting in a security guard's station and watching four monitors at once. While this is innovative it is also quite maddening at times because you may be getting into a particular story in one segment of the screen but you are missing the activity in the other three.  The director circumvents this problem at times by raising the volume in one of the segments during certain moments but in reality it is pretty much the perfect film for someone with ADD not someone who wants to sink their teeth into a story because this film truly does not have a strong enough plot to merit watching it four times in order to get the complete impact of all of the story lines involved. On a positive note this film had an excellent cast made up of character actors such as Xander Berkeley Holly Hunter and Steven Weber.  However this is a novel film to watch once to see an interesting experiment but beyond that it left me more frustrated than anything.";

	schema:reviewBody "Time Code' is the first film to use the method of splitscreen quadrants where four stories done in real time unfold onto the screen. And an audacious refined experience it is. This technique was going to be hitandmiss. With four stories you can only watch one at a time and by focusing on one you may miss some key elements in another story. All are loosely intertwined some more interesting than others. There is no digital grading authentication done to the images so the film looks perfectly realistic.The sound is emphasised on one of the screens at a time though sometimes it is hard to differentiate which one. While the stories are perfectly watchable they aren't invigorating or compelling and are only worthy of a passive attention. The narrative is strong and continued in a series of earthquakes that would rank about a 4 on the Richter scale. This is the first occasion in which I can honestly say that characters get plenty of screentime in fact they are in every scene but barely develop.Case in point is Saffron Burrows whose character is barely ever emphasised upon and we are offered pretty much no guidance as to what's going on in her story. Jeanne Tripplehorn's part is pretty much wasted as 95 of her screentime is wasted on her simply sitting in her limo barely even talking. She shows her true colours in the end but these revelations are made too late in the game to be indispensable. In the third quadrant there are many big names such as Holly Hunter Salma Hayek Julian Sands Leaving Las Vegas' Naked Lunch Stellan Skargaard The Glass House' and Kyle McLachlan. There are solid subtle performances all round from the ensemble but the characters themselves are poorly written.Still though Mike Figgis' avantgarde risque direction is suitably original and proves to be a talent to look out for in the future. While it is an accurate portrayal of highclass Los Angeles there is an overemphasis on drug use and lesbianism that compromises the originality of it all. Time Code' must have been a step away from impossible' to film. As there were no edits and stories took place in real time as they interwove there's no telling how many takes they had to execute.If one actor were to forget their line after about 90 minutes everything would have to start all over again from the top. It's a surprise that the film even finished shooting but they pulled it off and that deserves admiration.  The movie ends on a sourly climactic moment that may leave a bad taste but seems perfectly in keeping with Figgis' bravura tone. If you haven't yet seen Time Code' it's best you know the gist of the plot and subplots before watching it or you'll be absolutely lost from start to finish.One of the most groundbreaking though not spectacular movies in recent year Time Code' proves to be an intelligent admirable effort. While this experiment is unlikely to be attempted again this is the first and undoubtedly the best of its kind. It definitely should have received attention on Oscar night. Curiously enough the sound effects editing is the film's strongest point. My IMDb rating 7.410.".

	schema:headline " Loach and Allen do it again.";
	schema:reviewBody "Land and Freedom is Ken Loach and Jim Allen's tribute to the ordinary volunteers that risked their lives for a better world in the fight against fascism.  Unfortunately as Allen argues instead of building socialism those volunteers were betrayed by the Stalinists who preferred instead the fascist regime of Francisco Franco.  The Spanish Civil War was a subject Allen had long wanted to pursue.  The fight against fascism volunteers from many lands a people's army collectives and workers' cooperatives in fact socialism in action.  These were his abiding passions according to Loach who wrote Allen's obituary for the Guardian in June 1999.  All these sentiments drive the story of the film.The movie pins the defeat of idealism represented in the Civil War on Stalin's perfidy.  That was the selling out the POUM in the hope of gaining recognition from the respectable' world. This simplistic argument ignores the deeper problems that beset the Republic and Stalin from the beginning. It is fair to point to Stalinist inspired deceit and to an extent the debate on securing the support of the West against Fascism was a salient factor uppermost in Stalin's mind in the late 1930s. But has history vindicated his actions?  Without such tactics might the Soviet Union have faced the Nazi onslaught earlier and in an isolated position risked military defeat?  Maybe so and the discussions on the issue goes on. But the film has attracted criticism because of its restricted view of events too. Veterans like Bill Alexander a British commander in the Communist International Brigades complained that the focus on the participants in the POUM undermined the role of those that fought in those Brigades.  In other words the film suggests that it was merely the POUM that was betrayed and other volunteers were not equally as idealistic nor courageous in their defence of the Republic.Of equal significance in any appraisal of the demise of the RepublicIdealism must be the reaction of the respectable' Western Powers to the war. The treachery and cowardice for example of the British French and American governments' provide a wider and clearer picture of the situation.  While claiming to be officially neutral all the Western Powers ultimately aided Franco.  By exploiting their majority on the absurdly named Non Intervention Committee established to police the International crises Britain and France rendered the body a mere Fascist poodle by meekly kowtowing to German and Italian demands.  Shallow British Conservative Party commitments to democracy were matched by the fragility of the French in their support of the Republic. Covert British Naval support underpinned by the Higher Ranks fear of Red' insurgency was another negative factor. Moreover Roosevelt's willingness to sell the Franco regime oil was also invaluable to a mechanised army.After that brief explanation of the International situation now to the film. The basic structure Land and Freedom  is as follows.  A leftwing young Scouse communist goes to Spain joins the Marxist POUM militia and experiences at first hand serious political differences with the Communists and their competing militia. The story is based on the story of Eric Blair George Orwell described in his book Homage to Catalonia.  There are also elements of Walter Gregory's book Shallow Grave in the tale too.  While in the POUM this young man becomes further convinced of the right of their cause by the courage ingenuity generosity and radical nature of the armed struggle.There is also a neat combination of different nationalities in the POUM ranks.  Recruits come from America Ireland ex IRA inevitably Italy Germany France Scotland and of course Spain.  These accurately although not perfectly reveal the Internationalist composition of the forces arrayed against Franco.  However it is also worth bearing in mind that the Fascist enemy had an international flavour too.  As well as Spaniards there were Moroccan Riffs in the Army of Africa along with Italians Germans Portuguese and British.  Franco also received political assistance in America from IrishAmerican lobby groups concerned at the flagrant disregard of the Catholic Church in Republican areas.  These were assisted by Joseph P Kennedy the father of JFK an enthusiastic AmericanIrish catholic and also a nazi sympathiser.The movie stays faithful to this rather anticlerical nature and to the situation in the country during the 1930s.  A summary execution of a village priest symbolises the hatred felt by the working class toward such a conservative institution.  Many peasants and industrial workers were deeply disillusioned with the Catholic Church's message of selfsacrifice for the masses while the Church continued to amass power and wealth for itself. These deepseated feelings of anger go some way to explain why only 20 of the population in Spain attended mass.  A figure inflated to an extent by the higher attendance of those at the top end of the social ladder.  But it was not merely Republicans that killed priests.  Nationalists murdered priests in the Basque country because they backed local autonomy from Madrid.Feminist independence is also addressed as during the first half of the film women serve equally with men at the front in the POUM. They are just as brave as the men and in an early scene it is a woman who refuses to drill during training regarding it unnecessary.  But once the Stalinist counterrevolution is successful the women are once again reduced to a subordinate position in the ranks.  Their new duties become more traditional such as driving cooking and nursing the wounded.  Consequently the real social revolution is lost and the forces of reaction have indeed won the day.  Later when the Stalinist forces wearing orthodox uniforms and driven in military trucks attempt to disarm and disband the POUM it is the killing of the woman that indicates the death of idealism.To address the fundamental political idealism that initially attracted volunteers to the colours and to highlight the essential potential conflicts between them.  Loach attempts definitively to define what he means by his emotive linking of two basic concepts of Land and Freedom.  At about the half way point in the movie a debate amongst villagers peasants and POUM militia is meticulously presented that seeks to find an agreed policy for the newly captured territory.  One villager wants the transfer of land ownership to pass into individual hands while a woman argues alternatively for collectivisation.  A classic Bakuninist position.  The American militia member later to defect to the CommunistStalinist forces argues for a more moderate accommodation that allows individuals to own landproperty.  He points out that only modest land reform can benefit the antiFascist Front because by radically altering property rights it will only alienate countries whose assistance the Republic needed to be successful.  This takes the Stalinist line of reconciliation with the West rather than the Trotskist argument of International revolutionsocialism.  Other militia members offer variations of Marxism which fits neatly into their reasons for participation in the war while after a vote is taken symbolising peasant democracy the radical collectivisation policy is endorsed.  Naturally when the Stalinists force the POUM into the Internationalist Brigades and the moderate America is with them it can be assumed that such radical ideas are to be consigned to the dustbin.Having said all that the film is still very good.  Movies about the very important war in Spain are a rarity especially since the 1940s.  Thus a plus point immediately. On a moral level the tale of betrayal and lost hope is excellent even if the issues are rather shallow. As for the antiStalinist line it is irrefutable that Stalin wanted to appease the Nazi's in the period.

	onyx:emotionText "Land and Freedom is Ken Loach and Jim Allen's tribute to the ordinary volunteers that risked their lives for a better world in the fight against fascism.  Unfortunately as Allen argues instead of building socialism those volunteers were betrayed by the Stalinists who preferred instead the fascist regime of Francisco Franco.  The Spanish Civil War was a subject Allen had long wanted to pursue.  The fight against fascism volunteers from many lands a people's army collectives and workers' cooperatives in fact socialism in action.  These were his abiding passions according to Loach who wrote Allen's obituary for the Guardian in June 1999.  All these sentiments drive the story of the film.The movie pins the defeat of idealism represented in the Civil War on Stalin's perfidy.  That was the selling out the POUM in the hope of gaining recognition from the respectable' world. This simplistic argument ignores the deeper problems that beset the Republic and Stalin from the beginning. It is fair to point to Stalinist inspired deceit and to an extent the debate on securing the support of the West against Fascism was a salient factor uppermost in Stalin's mind in the late 1930s. But has history vindicated his actions?  Without such tactics might the Soviet Union have faced the Nazi onslaught earlier and in an isolated position risked military defeat?  Maybe so and the discussions on the issue goes on. But the film has attracted criticism because of its restricted view of events too. Veterans like Bill Alexander a British commander in the Communist International Brigades complained that the focus on the participants in the POUM undermined the role of those that fought in those Brigades.  In other words the film suggests that it was merely the POUM that was betrayed and other volunteers were not equally as idealistic nor courageous in their defence of the Republic.Of equal significance in any appraisal of the demise of the RepublicIdealism must be the reaction of the respectable' Western Powers to the war. The treachery and cowardice for example of the British French and American governments' provide a wider and clearer picture of the situation.  While claiming to be officially neutral all the Western Powers ultimately aided Franco.  By exploiting their majority on the absurdly named Non Intervention Committee established to police the International crises Britain and France rendered the body a mere Fascist poodle by meekly kowtowing to German and Italian demands.  Shallow British Conservative Party commitments to democracy were matched by the fragility of the French in their support of the Republic. Covert British Naval support underpinned by the Higher Ranks fear of Red' insurgency was another negative factor. Moreover Roosevelt's willingness to sell the Franco regime oil was also invaluable to a mechanised army.After that brief explanation of the International situation now to the film. The basic structure Land and Freedom  is as follows.  A leftwing young Scouse communist goes to Spain joins the Marxist POUM militia and experiences at first hand serious political differences with the Communists and their competing militia. The story is based on the story of Eric Blair George Orwell described in his book Homage to Catalonia.  There are also elements of Walter Gregory's book Shallow Grave in the tale too.  While in the POUM this young man becomes further convinced of the right of their cause by the courage ingenuity generosity and radical nature of the armed struggle.There is also a neat combination of different nationalities in the POUM ranks.  Recruits come from America Ireland ex IRA inevitably Italy Germany France Scotland and of course Spain.  These accurately although not perfectly reveal the Internationalist composition of the forces arrayed against Franco.  However it is also worth bearing in mind that the Fascist enemy had an international flavour too.  As well as Spaniards there were Moroccan Riffs in the Army of Africa along with Italians Germans Portuguese and British.  Franco also received political assistance in America from IrishAmerican lobby groups concerned at the flagrant disregard of the Catholic Church in Republican areas.  These were assisted by Joseph P Kennedy the father of JFK an enthusiastic AmericanIrish catholic and also a nazi sympathiser.The movie stays faithful to this rather anticlerical nature and to the situation in the country during the 1930s.  A summary execution of a village priest symbolises the hatred felt by the working class toward such a conservative institution.  Many peasants and industrial workers were deeply disillusioned with the Catholic Church's message of selfsacrifice for the masses while the Church continued to amass power and wealth for itself. These deepseated feelings of anger go some way to explain why only 20 of the population in Spain attended mass.  A figure inflated to an extent by the higher attendance of those at the top end of the social ladder.  But it was not merely Republicans that killed priests.  Nationalists murdered priests in the Basque country because they backed local autonomy from Madrid.Feminist independence is also addressed as during the first half of the film women serve equally with men at the front in the POUM. They are just as brave as the men and in an early scene it is a woman who refuses to drill during training regarding it unnecessary.  But once the Stalinist counterrevolution is successful the women are once again reduced to a subordinate position in the ranks.  Their new duties become more traditional such as driving cooking and nursing the wounded.  Consequently the real social revolution is lost and the forces of reaction have indeed won the day.  Later when the Stalinist forces wearing orthodox uniforms and driven in military trucks attempt to disarm and disband the POUM it is the killing of the woman that indicates the death of idealism.To address the fundamental political idealism that initially attracted volunteers to the colours and to highlight the essential potential conflicts between them.  Loach attempts definitively to define what he means by his emotive linking of two basic concepts of Land and Freedom.  At about the half way point in the movie a debate amongst villagers peasants and POUM militia is meticulously presented that seeks to find an agreed policy for the newly captured territory.  One villager wants the transfer of land ownership to pass into individual hands while a woman argues alternatively for collectivisation.  A classic Bakuninist position.  The American militia member later to defect to the CommunistStalinist forces argues for a more moderate accommodation that allows individuals to own landproperty.  He points out that only modest land reform can benefit the antiFascist Front because by radically altering property rights it will only alienate countries whose assistance the Republic needed to be successful.  This takes the Stalinist line of reconciliation with the West rather than the Trotskist argument of International revolutionsocialism.  Other militia members offer variations of Marxism which fits neatly into their reasons for participation in the war while after a vote is taken symbolising peasant democracy the radical collectivisation policy is endorsed.  Naturally when the Stalinists force the POUM into the Internationalist Brigades and the moderate America is with them it can be assumed that such radical ideas are to be consigned to the dustbin.Having said all that the film is still very good.  Movies about the very important war in Spain are a rarity especially since the 1940s.  Thus a plus point immediately. On a moral level the tale of betrayal and lost hope is excellent even if the issues are rather shallow. As for the antiStalinist line it is irrefutable that Stalin wanted to appease the Nazi's in the period.  Stalin was also concerned with the attitude of other Western Governments' and keen to appear respectable' to them.  For the same basic reason that is a fear of Fascist militarism and what the consequences were for the identified Nazi enemy the Soviet Union.  This better explains the line taken in Spain by the communists than simply a desire to destroy the revolution as the movie implies.  As for the implication of stolen idealism and treachery forced only onto restricted units that fought Franco.  Loach in making a film cannot be expected to include all the different kinds of military elements that made up the antiFascist alliance.  By concentrating on a single entity the unit that Orwell fought and was wounded in the film stays loyal to its principle source and concentrates focus not constrains it.

	schema:reviewBody "I also love this film.It's a wonderful intense realistic and insightful look at the Spanish Civil War with the highly naturalistic cinematography and committed performances characteristic of Loach.The reviews and debate concentrate on the action in Spain which for me is only half the story that Loach is telling. I grew up in Liverpool in the 50's and 60's and knew quite a few David Carrs. Men then in their own fifties and sixties often alone keeping themselves to themselves in quiet corners of pubs and working men's clubs. They never told their own stories never wanted credit never wanted to relive their experiences in the Battle of the Atlantic on the Baltic convoys in North Africa. Someone who knew them would sometimes say he was torpedoed four times or he was two years in Spain fighting Franco and that would be that.So I am delighted that David Carr played by the incomparable Ian Hart and this movie is such a fabulous testament to all of them. I love the way his life expands onto the screen from the small remainder in a Liverpool council flat from the letters uncovered by his death into the light and air of Spain enabling us to share in his buried idealism its betrayal then to witness the love of his life and the loss of it. Incredibly beautiful and truly heartbreaking. Unsuspected by all but his best mates and his newly enlightened granddaughter David is surely off to Valhalla to be reunited with Blanca and his warrior friends of the past. I cannot think of anything in film so unsentimental yet so poignantly moving as her last salute.This isn't Don Quixote though. Nor is it Orwell who is magnificent in an entirely different way nor is it Hemingway's brash heroism or Saving Private Ryan's gungho bulletforbullet style of historical verisimilitude. It doesn't matter at all whether the events are being portrayed with strict accuracy or not. This is the authentic texture of twentieth century history in perfect context portrayed through the lens of one man's experience.And there is hardly anything else like it on film.A true masterpiece of the art which deserves a much bigger reputation and a place in the British Movie Pantheon alongside the very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Applause for Mr. Loach. As a person who is majorly into history Spanish and Irish in particular I loved seeing this film for the first time and that was hundreds of times ago. This movie is about a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain played brilliantly by Ian Hart who is also in Michael Collins another favorite of mine who goes to Spain in 1936 to fight in the Spanish Civil War. He is persuaded to join the Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista or POUM. This was a militia dedicated to world revolution not to socialism in one country. The film very accurately portrays the beginning of the war when it was clear cut who was on which side. And it keeps with its accuracy in showing how Joseph Stalin manipulated the country of Spain for his own needs eventually using his influence there to end the life of Leon Trotsky. Land and Freedom also shows the May days in Barcelona when 500 people were killed in a mini civil war within the forces of the antifascist Republic. This film is amazing both in its ability to show how personal the conflict was for many people and how it was not a clear cut good guy bad guy war after 1936. I would like to say that although when discussing the Spanish Civil War one will always find their bias Mr. Loach certainly shows his. Very little mention of the mass murder of priests and nuns is included except in one scene where a priest is shot for informing on the militia. This was not always the case. The militias would go into a town and simply kill clergy because religion to them was fascism. I'm not trying to defend Franco. I am trying to give some wider perspective on what happened. This film is a very good film but as I said with regards to Michael Collins another film Ian Hart is in one would be better seeing this film then reading extensively on the subject of the Spanish Civil War to get the full picture.".

	schema:headline " What this film is really about Stalinism";
	schema:reviewBody "Though set in Spain during the time of the civil war of 193639 Loach's film belongs more to the genre of antiStalinist cinema than it does to films about Spain. The main theme of the film is the young man's discovery about the reality of the political movement to which he has devoted his life. And the climactic moment in the film is when he rips up his Communist Party membership card.The crimes of the Stalinists are portrayed throughout the film  they deny decent modern weapons to those sections of the front which they do not control they actively engage in repression against the POUM and the anarchists in Barcelona in the pages of the British Daily Worker which we briefly see on the screen we are shown the daily barrage of lies they spread such as Trotsky's 'support' for Franco fascism.Anyone who sees this film as simply a blackandwhite good vs evil portrayal of heroic young people aiding the brave Spaniards in their battle for freedom is missing what is I believe its main point. It is not primarily about Spain.Seeing a film like this I cannot forget the more typical Hollywood portrayals at least in the last generation of Communists. A film like The Way We Were shows the American Communist Party only during those moments when its positions would today be considered palatable supporting the Spanish republic backing Roosevelt and the US war effort in World War II and later calling for nuclear disarmament.It doesn't show the time of the Moscow Trials nor the real role played by the Soviet Union and its agents in Spain nor the Communist Party's opposition to fighting Hitler and the Nazis in 193941 nor the postwar period when the Party did what it could to encourage nuclear proliferation by passing on atomic secrets to Stalin.Land and Freedom does try to show one of the Comintern's uglier moments to its credit.A film like this was made possible by the fact that Loach comes out of the British far left and the British far left has long been dominated not by Stalinists but by their Marxist opponents  primarily the Trotskyists of the Socialist Workers Party SWP. Whatever disagreements I or others may have with the SWP and they are many at least they rejected Stalinism.What we need are more films like this showing the real role played by Communist Parties all during the history of the Soviet regime. For example a film set in any European country during the period between September 1939 and June 1941 the time of the HitlerStalin pact which honestly portrays Communist parties as allies of the Nazis even in occupied countries like Norway and France would be welcome.".

The people in both countries felt the burden of traditional oppressive hypocritical Catholicism just like the kind we had here in the Province of Quebec before the Quiet Revolution of the 1960's. At the other end of the political scale the poor treatment of priests in Spain was a motivating force for Fascists in France to join the Charlemagne division of the Waffen SS to defend the cause of Christianity or so The Sorrow and the Pity attests.The Spanish war was about liberation from autocracy amidst a blizzard of competing doctrinaire left political philosophies. That was a really exciting time to be politically active and there is a great scene of grassroots socialism in action at a town meeting.The film has a roughhewn halffinished look characteristic of Ken Loach but don't let that put you off. Anyone who can get worked up about the sometimes microscopic casuistical differences between the Grits and the Tories or the Democrats and the GOP or New Labour and those other Tories or Labor and National or the SDP and the CDU etc. should really love a movie and a conflict where the political spectrum is so broad for a change.

The film shows essentially military amateurism and political strife on the front since there was a real front with Franco and professional armed forces on the other side as well as in Barcelona. Three trends are shown though not always clearly identified the communists often called Stalinists the anarchists identified as the CNT and the POUM who is some kind of Trotskyite organization both anticommunist and antianarchist and at the same time for total revolution as fast as possible with the full collectivization of land and a high level of independence autonomy even the refusal of hierarchy and authority. It led to a catastrophe of course with Franco helped by Mussolini and Hitler and the communists only helped by other communist parties with the International Brigades and by Stalin provided the Stalinist model was followed. That clearly led to defeat. But an explanation is not given in the film. It is too short to just say discord prevailed. Why did it prevail? There we cannot give one answer only. There are several and even many. At first the weight of the international situation that made Spain a stake of the near future between all the western European countries Italy and Germany included and thus a divided West that let Hitler and Mussolini do what they wanted without any restraint on one side and on the other side the Communist International and the USSR who were trying to impose a clear model collectivization of land and nationalization of industry along with a strong state organization with a professional military force. No sense of compromise no desire to reach any kind of compromise. Add to that the role of the church and the deep anticlerical feelings of some sections of this Spanish left. Don't forget the sexist bigotry of a deeply catholic country and people the equality of women could not last very long. That led to a civil war within the civil war and the defeat was guaranteed. But do not believe this film does not speak to us today in the time of Obama in a globalized world in the midst of a financial crisis. The left is totally unable to find a complete unity on a realistic project and they have been systematically sidetracked in the recent or not so recent years in France or Italy or Greece. Spain is an exception but probably not for long. The question that emerges from the film is Was the social revolution advocated by these various revolutionary factions a realistic objective? Was it the real way History was going to take? I must admit the picture that comes out of this film makes me doubt it very much especially twenty years after the fall of the last European communist experimentation. It feels as if that project was doomed to fail because of its unrealistic final objective as well as the short term and middle term stages of that program. But there is a strong fragrance of absurdity in the depicted situation. They try to force history accelerate it in a way rape it and history goes against that violation that can only work with a strong unity of the people behind that strong line and with a strong political and military power in the hands of the unified  or purified  leadership of the transformation and yet for how long before a serious reform or final defeat? Sad but still true those who try to violate history and its own pace be they on the right or on the left are totally blind to the fact that history does not follow a strict agenda and does not move along a straight line.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines CEGID".

But Loach fleshes the story out with some wonderful characters and a rare truly moving wartime love story.The film is shot in a cinemaverite style that really emphasizes the grit the horror and heroism of the characters' resistance to fascism. The leads Ian Hart and Rosana Pastor give wonderful performances. Pastor's portrayal of a woman motivated by idealism economic need and more than a bit of worldweariness is incandescent. Yes she often spout slogans but that's how people often speak in those situations.Marc Martinez and Eoin McCarthy are excellent as the militia section commander and the experienced Irish volunteer respectively.My one real quibble is that perhaps by necessity Loach compressed the really complex issues surrounding the May Days and the suppression of the POUM. The Communist Party were the bad guys but things were much more complicated than that at the national level in Spain. Nationally with the organization of the International Brigades and Soviet support for the republic they were the good guys.From David Carr's and Blanca's perspective however the national level was not important so there really is a great deal of honesty in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting little film starring Ian Hart as an Englishman David Carr from Liverpool who goes to Spain to fight on the socialistcommunist side during the Spanish Civil War.You know it's a Ken Loach film right from the start when you see the typical bleak urban landscapes of modern Britain  council tower blocks ugly roads and traffic  as David Carr dies in the ambulance on the way to the hospital leaving behind a vast collection of letters photographs newspaper cuttings and mementoes from his time in the conflict fifty years before.Every seemingly old boring person may have led a fascinating and remarkable life his granddaughter trawls through this personal timecapsule and the generation gap is no more.The depiction of the civil war itself is beautifully and painstakingly recreated with authentic uniforms or lack of rustic farmhouses serving as HQs and plenty of banditpartisanstyle shootouts presumably the essential nature of the conflict in its early stages before the International Brigades took over. In some ways it is like a prelude to the 1960s with free love communal living and an easygoing lifestyle prevailing.Rosana Pastor is beautiful as Blanca a young idealistic yet romantic firebrand serving as the love interest for David Carr. It's not really necessary for the plot and a bit unKen Loach. Nevertheless she is worth it! There are also some fine scenes of grassroots democracy in action with the revolutionaries debating and voting on a number of issues such as collectivisation of farming and whether or not to throw their lot in with the regular Popular Army. They discuss the impact of Hitler and Stalin on the conflict and the nature of capitalism and the international workers' struggle. The participants comprise Spanish English Americans and a few others and they all worry about their struggle becoming corrupted.Ian Hart puts in a thorough impressive performance even suppressing that awful Liverpool accent to display quite some skill in the Spanish language. However all of the swearing is ludicrous probably anachronistic and completely unnecessary did people really exchange insults in 1936 involving 'ass'? Does it improve the film? I would like to see Land and Freedom based on the life of George Orwell and perhaps a greater less idealistic political exploration of the circumstances and events of the Spanish Civil War. Orwell is the man.".

The participants comprise Spanish English Americans and a few others and they all worry about their struggle becoming corrupted.Ian Hart puts in a thorough impressive performance even suppressing that awful Liverpool accent to display quite some skill in the Spanish language. However all of the swearing is ludicrous probably anachronistic and completely unnecessary did people really exchange insults in 1936 involving 'ass'? Does it improve the film? I would like to see Land and Freedom based on the life of George Orwell and perhaps a greater less idealistic political exploration of the circumstances and events of the Spanish Civil War. Orwell is the man.";

One soon realizes that the main battle is between the rich conservative fascistsand those they seek to exploit. The rich own the levers of power and the land. Religion and conservatism are about maintaining control.This movie is based on Orwells Homage to Catalonia and his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. Read this book if u want an indepth view of what went on. The movie simplifies this reality. The anti fascist side was fragmented into many groups and were ultimately betrayed by Stalins agenda. An international group fought fascism but they were defeated. This is a movie about heroic commitment to an ideal. Of course we now know that Stalins Communism as a system failed. It was just a cloak for centralised totalitarian control. It was at the time seen as an alternative to capitalism and exploitive extremism.This movie fits in with the movie Grapes of Wrath. Both were during a period of chaos and depression. The speech at the end Of GOF shows a similar commitment to fight fascist police company thugs robber banks  exploitation and etc. I really enjoyed the story and I think KL told the story well.Its a little known episode just predating the main event of WW2. As a theory Communism is closer to pure democracy than capitalism is I think.This movie is hard to get in the US. Probably because it shows alternative ideas  Communism Anarchists Socialists union groups.".

POUM whose tale is told in this film were a small force on a front that barely moved throughout the war.That a Communist Party member should accidentally join POUM is no more likely than a Free Presbyterian accidentally taking Catholic communion. Besides the Communist Party had a wellorganized network taking members and sympathizers to the International Brigades. POUM had a smaller network which in Britain was linked to a body called the Independent Labour Party which is how George Orwell got there. The hero's adventures in Spain somewhat shadow Orwell's but have been reinvented to make him more likable I suppose.The telephone exchange was taken over because the Anarchists were tapping everyone's phone. This was done with the authorization of the legal elected government of Catalonia a government trying desperately to rally military power against the Fascists who were methodically conquering one Republican enclave after another. The bombing of Guernica and the fall of the Basque Republic occurred at much the same time. A bloody stupid time for leftists to get into a fight with an antiFascist government I'd have thought.".

He is one of those rare people who can analyze all of the issues from many directions and underline the most important parts of what each side needs and what each side can't have.Loach also has a technique of making initial moments of militarism or violence seem rather childlike like boys with toy guns running through hillsides and enjoying each other's company. These moments always precede direct damage to members of the group and in Land and Freedom seeing the militia slowly fall apart is very disturbing. Loach also cleverly illustrates the difficulties of revolution from the perspective of the volunteers as they start fighting for one cause and then find themselves on the opposite end of the barrel against their friends and neighbors.I've only recently begun watching the movies of Ken Loach but I really admire the way he writes and directs his movies.

His and Ken Loach's Marxist Trotskyist and antiStalinist orientations are evidently present in the film although it is arguably the theme of Stalinist repression of antifranquist communist and anarchist militias in Spain during the Civil War to be mainly portrayed. In the end given the several disputes and scuffles between the various antiFranco factions we wonder with the director What is the point to all this? The story develops through flashbacks and it recounts of a David Carr a British unemployed member of the Communist Party from Liverpool who decides to go and fight the cause of the antifranquist movement in the Spanish Civil War. The narration takes place through some letters Carr wrote newspaper clippings and other documents he collected found and read by his granddaughter right after his death. The film rides the wave of the leftoid sociopolitical movement of the 90's as already mentioned in this blog with regards to La Haine and similarly to the French film this sociopolitical situation contributes greatly to its success especially amongst certain circles.Other themes present in the film are the antiClericalism revealed with the summary execution of the priest culpable of exposing the militians to the Franquist rudimentary feminism given the fact that in the POUM men and women fight together and finally the socialist matrix also appears especially in the village assembly scene where the peasants vote for the collectivization of the land. This scene is arguably one of the best of the entire movie Loach's pursue of realism reaches its apex here. The camera loses its perspective and plunges the viewer right into the live situation and the dialogues are apt and poignant also considering that most of the actors participating to this scene were nonprofessionals.".

Among the Russian soldiers are Count Nicholas Rostov and Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Count Pierre Bezukhov a friend of Andrei's and selfstyled intellectual who is not interested in fighting. Pierre's life changes when his father dies leaving him a vast inheritance. He is attracted to Natasha Rostov Nicholas's sister but she is too young so he gives in to baser desires and marries the shallow manipulative Princess Helene. The marriage ends when Pierre discovers his wife's true nature. Andrei is captured and later released by the French and returns home only to watch his wife die in childbirth. Months later Pierre and Andrei meet again. Andrei sees Natasha and falls in love but his father will only permit the marriage if they postpone it for one year until Natasha turns 17.

	schema:reviewBody "Given that trimming Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE down to the length of one feature film even at threeandahalf hours is probably a fool's errand to begin with this 1956 version deserves more respect than it's generally gotten  though the comments here indicate that the film may actually be gaining the respect that critics and film historians have so long denied it.The movie does suffer from two undeniable shortcomings. First is the atrocious sound recording that has blighted virtually every Italian movie ever made. As some of the comments have noted movies shot at Rome's Cinecitta had their sound postdubbed rather than recorded on the set. But actually this practice was then and remains very common. The sound in Italian movies stands out simply because they were so bad at it. The brutal truth is even the greatest masterpieces of Fellini De Sica Rosselini etc. are less than they might have been because Italian sound technology was so slipshod. And so it is with WAR AND PEACE it's hard to suspend disbelief when soldiers struggling across a river sound like someone dropping quarters into a toilet.The other shortcoming is the appalling miscasting of Henry Fonda as Pierre Bezhukov. It's the worst performance of his career and he looks and sounds about as Russian as a slice of pumpkin pie. One commenter here said Alec Guinness should have played Pierre. It's an intriguing suggestion and of course Sir Alec was always good. Even better I think would have been Peter Ustinov. In 1956 he was Pierre to the very life.But the rest of the casting is genuinely inspired. Oskar Homolka as Gen. Kutuzov Barry Jones as Count Rostov Jeremy Brett as Nikolai Herbert Lom as Napoleon  all could hardly be improved upon. And Audrey Hepburn was simply born to play Natasha. And Mel Ferrer as Prince Andrei ... well he did have his faults as an actor to say the least! but at least he looked the part.Beyond that the movie has lavish production values impressive battle scenes and one truly great and powerful sequence the French Army's disastrous retreat from Russia that takes up much of the last hour.There's no substitute of course for reading the novel I've read it three times myself. But this 1956 movie makes a worthy introduction and even helps to keep Tolstoy's complex plot straight when you do get around to reading it.".

It's got an Italian producer was filmed in Italy an American director and a large cast from all over the place leading in some cases to some very unconvincing dubbing. But it's also largely intelligent well enough acted particularly by Audrey Hepburn who is an enchanting Natasha and visually splendid. No less than eight writers worked on the script which fails conspicuously to translate Tolstoy's 'grand ideas' into anything other than ReadersDigest form but then even Bondarchuk's even longer Russian version didn't quite manage the leap from page to screen. You may be forgiven then for thinking you are watching nothing more than a grandiose soapopera even if it's a cut above runofthemill historical 'soapoperas'. But in an age when threehourplus epics were tenapenny it didn't catch on and come Oscar time it was largely overlooked. The even bigger but vastly inferior Around the World in 80 Days took Best Picture while War and Peace failed to snag a nomination in that category. But it is worth seeing if only for Hepburn's underrated performance and for Henry Fonda too old and miscast as Pierre but bringing his liberal gravitas to the part all the same.".

But before they can marry Andrei goes to fight the invading French and the pacifistic Pierre goes along as an observer The motion picture deals with war and its effect on people... It contains many marvelous pictorial moments as the colorfully uniformed regiments marching through the excellent streets of Moscow snowy landscapes a magnificent Ballroom sequence and most of all Napoleon's forces at the epic battle of Borodino the march on Moscow and the tragic retreat of Napoleon's army through the Russian winter... Most of the military side of the story takes place in the second half and it seems slow to arrive but the battle of Borodino is fairly well handled... It is focused through Pierre's eyes with long shots of the invading and retreating French troops...Audrey Hepburn whose boyish figure provided a refreshing antidote to the film is lovely as Natasha... Her flaming innocence and blossoming sensuality set her sweet heart ablaze... This charming spirit with so much enthusiasm and romanticism is full of life and true love... Hepburn matures from an impulsive kindhearted teenager to an understanding woman who uses her courage and impetuousness to love to care and to serve...Henry Fonda is pure brave and noble... He projects with sincerity the confusion of an honest man caught up in an angry twist of history... He witnesses the horrific events of war experiencing days of misery as a prisoner of war... His remarkable adventures lead him to understand at least part of the mysteries of life humanity love and loyalty... Pierre is strikingly different from others with a deep love and esteem for his country and his sweetheart...Mel Ferrer is the sensitive prince who doesn't come around until he meets the sweet Natasha...

Napoleon had a tough decision to make... Oskar Homolka is General Kutuzov who forms a reasoned judgment against an enemy who has a larger more efficient force... It is unclear whether he did this out of weakness or whether it was part of a brilliant strategy with the purpose of drawing Napoleon's army way beyond their means of supply for the winter which Bonaparte had not prepared for...Anita Ekberg is Helene the charming and reckless libertine who goes to a world of cheats and insults her husband's ego making his life depressed and miserable... Helmut Dantine is Dolokhov the officer challenged for a duel who puts on view the better side of his character much later...

	schema:headline " WAR AND PEACE On DVD At Last!";
	schema:reviewBody "King Vidor's version of Leo Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE has finally been released in the U.S. by Paramount and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I have been tempted many times to purchase a Hong Kong pressing of this title  but I'm glad that I refrained. While this DVD does not contain much in the way of Extras it does contain a nice wide screen transfer that captures to look of its original release. Paramount rather then following in the footsteps of the other major studios did not use the CinemaScope widescreen process developed by 20th CenturyFox and introduced in 1953 with their Lloyd C. Douglas adaptation of THE ROBE. Rather Paramount developed their own wide screen process and called it VistaVision. The VistaVision system moved 35mm film through the camera sideways resulting in a picture negative that was close to 70mm in size. The film was then reduced to a widescreen image usally around 1.851 instead of CinemaScope's 2.651 ratio. Coupled with genuine Technicolor before it became teamed with Eastman Color photography VistaVision was capable of stunning images. WAR AND PEACE was photographed by JACK CARDIFF one of finest cinematographers ever to grace film THE RED SHOES is one of his works resulting in one of the most beautifully photographed films of alltime! Alas stereophonic sound was not generally employed by Paramount and so WAR AND PEACE has only a mono track  nice but not as nice a stereophonic track would have been. As to the film itself I can only express that I have loved it from the first seeing in 1956  and continue to find it a great and involving film experience. The film is truly spectactular even when compared to the 6hour Russian version of 1968 but it works for me because of the human story. AUDREY HEPBURN as Natasha is perfection itself.

	onyx:emotionText "King Vidor's version of Leo Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE has finally been released in the U.S. by Paramount and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection. I have been tempted many times to purchase a Hong Kong pressing of this title  but I'm glad that I refrained. While this DVD does not contain much in the way of Extras it does contain a nice wide screen transfer that captures to look of its original release. Paramount rather then following in the footsteps of the other major studios did not use the CinemaScope widescreen process developed by 20th CenturyFox and introduced in 1953 with their Lloyd C. Douglas adaptation of THE ROBE. Rather Paramount developed their own wide screen process and called it VistaVision. The VistaVision system moved 35mm film through the camera sideways resulting in a picture negative that was close to 70mm in size. The film was then reduced to a widescreen image usally around 1.851 instead of CinemaScope's 2.651 ratio. Coupled with genuine Technicolor before it became teamed with Eastman Color photography VistaVision was capable of stunning images. WAR AND PEACE was photographed by JACK CARDIFF one of finest cinematographers ever to grace film THE RED SHOES is one of his works resulting in one of the most beautifully photographed films of alltime! Alas stereophonic sound was not generally employed by Paramount and so WAR AND PEACE has only a mono track  nice but not as nice a stereophonic track would have been. As to the film itself I can only express that I have loved it from the first seeing in 1956  and continue to find it a great and involving film experience. The film is truly spectactular even when compared to the 6hour Russian version of 1968 but it works for me because of the human story. AUDREY HEPBURN as Natasha is perfection itself. She grows from the delightful innocence of childhood to the wisdom and beauty of adulthood. HENRY FONDA often criticized as being wrong for the role of Pierre is very effective as a man searching for and finding the true meaning of life and events.

	schema:reviewBody "This epic has the reputation for being a limp lifeless mechanical thing a vulgar simplification of Tolstoy.  The latter accusation is partly correct and thank goodness for it.  War and Peace the novel has many great things but also many excrescences it goes on way too long padded out with tediously detailed philosophies and theories of war it also studiously refuses loose ends.There are flaws.  The script though a model of clarity unlike most literary adaptations which concentrate on all the big setpieces creating narrative confusion but short on inspiration.  There is a dispiriting unimaginative reliance on voiceover and unnecessary soliloquys.  The whole thing also goes on way too long.Mel Ferrer is without doubt the worst actor in the world he plays the dashing tragic Prince Andrei with all the vigour of a mouldy plank.  His part is pivotal narratively thematically and symbolically so he features in a lot of scenes where his monotonous lack of expression makes the film stop dead.  Henry Fonda in many ways ideal as the Tolstoy altarego Pierre who must move morally from observer to actor is frequently defeated by the terrible dialogue making this wonderful actor seem clumsy and amateurish. Herbert Lom however manages to suggest great humanity behind the hammy pomp of Napolean.I only mention these faults to show that the film's critics have their point.  I also suggest that WAR AND PEACE is nearly a masterpiece for two reasons.  King Vidor whose work I'm largely and shamefully unfamiliar with directs this film with awesome authoritive lightness of touch.  He pays respectful lip service to the big Tolstoyan themes focusing particularly on families the relations between parents and children old traditional reactionary Russia and the tentative youthful impulse towards freedom.I say lipservice because his main interest in the film lies elsewhere. It lies in the expression of the emotional life of his characters.  For although the film is a massive historical epic it works best as a domestic melodrama.  Characters who can't express themselves in this hierarchical society are allowed a voice through the film's direction which forsakes literal realism to tell us what is going on in their heads and  hearts. Exaggerated colour and carefully contrived composition offer us a second more subtle and personal story to the main surface narrative.  This might make WAR AND PEACE a more rightwing work ignoring the processes of history and the plight of the serfs in favour of sympathising with a caste of slaveowners but Hollywood was never very good at socioeconomic analyses.Vidor's other great theme seems to be nature and man's relation to it. He has little interest in invoking a real nineteenth century Russia his Moscow is as exquisitely artificial as Sternberg's THE SCARLET EMPRESS and his use of architecture and space to both show the distances between people and the the fathomless emptiness of the soul is positively Antonionian.  With the natural world however there is a real feeling beyond mere backdrop scenery that is unthinkable in any contemporary Hollywood film. Primarily a movie about people and history it is eternal nature that watches on the battles deaths retreats.  Indeed it is nature that saves the Russian people in the face of massive military odds and it is nature that frames the melancholy yet hopeful resolution.  It's also interesting to ask why at the heighth of the Cold War Hollywood should decide to make a great Russian epic?  To tastelessly evoke a 'glorious' preSoviet past?  Or to enjoy the razing of Moscow to the ground?The second reason to love this film is of course the incomparable beautiful Audrey Hepburn.  She is so right as Natasha when I read the book as a kid I pictured Audrey all the way through without even knowing she had played her on film the saviour of the book as well as the  film. It is one of the great performances  its modernity and truth blows away the dusty period conventions indeed at her first ball she is as moving as a 50s teenager at her prom.  Her intelligence insight passion and she is a lot more erotic in this film than her supporters ever give her credit for and grace are perfectly in tune with Vidor's conception and her scenes have an extraordinary emotional force.  She is the life of the  film and its moral centre in the absence of a convincing Pierre.  The film plods to a slow death without her.  The film essays three moral developments  Natasha's Pierre's and Andrei's but hers is the most moving and tragic. The change to sadness and understanding of the once gay and vivacious Natasha seems a terrible loss.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film came out on DVD yesterday and I rushed to buy it. This version is the first to render all the detail and perfection of Jack Cardiff's amazing compositions and brilliant varied photography. As a collection of memorable images this film is better than any comparable historical epic of the period and even gives GWTW a run for its money. King Vidor's direction is a series of 'tableaux vivants' where the characters are not posing but acting in a very natural periodspecific way. I have never had a problem with this adaptation of Tolstoy's novel. I think it is a wonderful introduction to the period and the novel and that it is a very poetic very original work in its own right. Henry Fonda's characterization is especially moving including great memorable interactions withreations to Mel Ferrer Audrey Hepburn Helmut Dantine and John Mills but all members of the cast are actually perfect. The harrowing last 45 minutes of the film manage to convey a sense of history a sense of grandeur as well as to communicate very clearly Tolstoy's ideas about the meaning of life by relying mostly on the power of memorable images. The most conspicuous handicap of this movie in my opinion is its soundtrack in glorious mono. The barely hifi recording of dialogues and music sounds pinched hollow and tinny and it always has in very version I have ever seen in the theatres on TV and on video. Even the soundtrack album is an atrocity. In some scenes before the necessary adjustments of bass and treble Audrey Hepburn's and Mel Ferrer's voices actually hurt your ear. Nino Rota's very Russiansounding score is serviceable and melodic although rather sparse in its orchestration and in the number of players. One can only wonder what 'War and Peace' could have sounded like with a cohort of Hollywood arrangers decent recording facilities and lavish varied orchestrations in true high fidelity and stereophonic sound. According to Lukas Kendall of 'Film Score Monthly' the original recording elements of the soundtrack have long ago disappeared which is the common lot of international independent coproductions of the era. Someone somewhere is certainly guilty of skimping on quality or embezzlement for this 1956 movie to sound so much worse than a 1939 prehifi epic like GWTW. Like all VistaVision films this one was meant to be shown in Perspecta Stereophonic Sound where the mono dialog track was meant to be channelled to three different directions making it directional while the separate mono music  sound effects track was generally directed to all three speakers at the same time. The results fooled the viewers into thinking everything was in true stereo and the reproduction of the music was usually in very high fidelity. Maybe the soundtrack used on the DVD is a mono reduction of those two separate tracks that has squandered that fidelity and maybe the DVD can be issued again with better results in some kind of 4.0 presentation. When they do very little electronic restoration work will be needed to make the image absolutely perfect.But let's concentrate on the positive This film is a summit of visual splendour and its sets costumes colour photography composition and lighting achieve in every single scene wonders of artistry creativity and delicacy that will probably never be equalled. Suffice it to say that it has among many other treasures a sunrise duel scene in the snow that still has viewers wondering whether it was shot outdoors or in a studio and that will have them wondering forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to bring such an vast sweeping yet intensely human novel such as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace to the screen with both its breadth and depth intact you can do either one of two of things. You can film it pageforpage and make an eighthour behemoth as Sergei Bondarchuk did with the 1960s Russian production. Or you can prune it down to something more manageable excising whole characters and subplots but recreating certain sections of Tolstoy's work more or less verbatim to preserve what is vital about his work. This latter is the approach taken for Dino de Laurentiis's 1956 ItalianAmerican coproduction.The narrative here focuses mainly on just three of Tolstoy's characters  Pierre Natasha and Alexei  portrayed by Henry Fonda Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer respectively. Fonda is really too old to play the youthful Pierre but he is not as severely miscast as some have said pulling off the early scenes of Pierre as the gangly drunken student with a fair degree of believability. Hepburn brilliantly handles the aging of her character transforming the nave teenager into a mature and confident woman while still maintaining the same core persona. If only something as complementary could be said of Mel Ferrer who takes to acting the same way anvils take to floating. His appallingness is matched only by the woman who plays his wife Milly Vitale. There are some decent supporting players though. Herbert Lom gives a surprisingly heartfelt performance as Napoleon. Oskar Homolka brilliantly plays the archetypal scruffy old general who's too highranking and experienced to bother with all that decorum business his gestures forceful but with a halfhearted brevity to them. And John Mills is bizarrely like someone out of a Monty Python film.Director King Vidor was a veteran of old Hollywood and just the sort of director to handle the mix of big canvas and intimacy. He shows what must have been extraordinary patience in setting up hordes of extras carts and cannons for authentic looking crowd scenes but then makes them a briefly glimpsed backdrop never really dwelling on the massive scope or showing it off for its own sake. This seemingly contradictory tack gives us a sense of the story happening in a real place but never allows it to detract from the main players and their stories. Vidor is constantly implying things with the simplest of cinematic tricks and this helps to make up for the gaps in plot that the adaptation necessitates. For example when Hepburn and Vittorio Gassman kiss at the opera the angle gradually changes to reveal the reflection of a door in a mirror. This subtle move plants the idea in our heads that someone may walk in on them and it gives the moment a sense of unease and wrongness. Vidor's canny ability to suggest mood and temperament particularly evident in his framing of the inner monologues during the dance scene also helps to cover any deficit in the acting.At threeandahalf hours this is still quite a long old movie. And yet thanks to some compelling imagery and strong narrative it moves faster than many a 90minuter. Shorn of much of Tolstoy's original material as it is it is still long enough to give us that feeling of the passage of time and development of character to make Fonda's transition from a foppish lad in Western European attire to a bearded man in Russian garb feel like more than just a change of clothes. This version of War and Peace certainly has a fair few things wrong with it yet still manages to be a lucid and passionate  if not entirely faithful  adaptation of a great work of literature.".

In addition recording facilities in Italy were primitive this was only 11 years after the catastrophe of WWII resulting in the canned quality of most of the dialogue. One of the reasons Antonioni's films were such a breakthrough in the following decade was his use of live sound recording and location shooting.Anyway War and Peace is a most worthwhile film experience for Vidor and Cardiff's Technicolor Vistavision visuals for the screenplay which is often quite beautifully written and for many fine performances from some exceedingly charismatic film actors especially the astonishing Audrey Hepburn.

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Fonda once made a telling comment about War And Peace. When asked about his thoughts on the film he said when I first agreed to do it the screenplay by Irwin Shaw was fine but what happened? King Vidor used to go home nights with his wife and rewrite it. All the genius of Tolstoy went out of the window. Fonda's assessment is harsh but in many respects accurate. The genius of Tolstoy IS evidently lacking from this elephantine epic the screenplay credited to six separate scripters  with no mention at all of Irwin Shaw IS a sprawling mess. Perhaps Fonda ought to have taken some comfort in the fact that the film still emerges with commendable points in its favour. For example brilliant battle scenes some powerful performances and rousing music by Nino Rota.18051812  the ambitious Napoleon Herbert Lom is sweeping across Europe winning battle after battle reshaping maps and boundaries. In Moscow people think they are too far from Napoleon's forces to be troubled by him even though they dimly acknowledge that one day his army may arrive at their city gates. Young aristocratic lady Natasha Rostov Audrey Hepburn watches in naive excitement as Russian soldiers  including her brother Nicholas Jeremy Brett  march off to war unable to comprehend the wider implications of what they are embarking upon. The older Pierre Bezukhov Henry Fonda heir to a great fortune and a selfcentred intellectual has a more realistic grasp of the situation but expresses little interest in the fighting or the cause. His friend Prince Andrei Bolkonsky Mel Ferrer proudly heads off to Austria to fight against Napoleon but witnesses much death destruction and suffering. Worse is to follow when he gets home to witness his wife's death in childbirth. Andrei seeks comfort in the arms of Natasha and plans to marry her but while he is away fighting again she is swayed into a relationship with a cruel scoundrel named Anatole Kuragin Vittorio Gassmann. Fortunately Pierre is on hand to make Natasha see the error of her judgement. The war eventually arrives on Russian soil where Pierre finally is forced to drop his disinterested faade and acknowledge the immense cost of war and conquest.Even at 208 minutes this version of War And Peace feels undernourished. It is too grand a story so complex and intricately interwoven that it cannot be filmed satisfactorily at a sensible length. The 1968 Sergei Bondarchuk version is far superior though its 500 minute plus running time makes it strictly one for the purists! However in patches this 1956 version is better than its reputation suggests. Fonda is too old for the role of Pierre but plays it fairly well Gassmann is totally believable as the libertine Kuragin Lom's portrayal of Napoleon is excellent. The battle sequences are very good with plenty of the thenastronomical 6000000 budget up there on the screen all of it effectively captured by ace cinematographer Jack Cardiff. The key weakness is that when the film moves away from its moments of spectacle and tries to concentrate on the human side of the story it feels curiously lifeless. Still this can be chalked down as a decent attempt to film an impossibly long and complex book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has read as I read the entire book War and Peace has a clear idea of the enormous work that must have done to make this film. Its probably one of the most complex war dramas ever written and the largest dramatic book I have ever read. It's not my bedside book but it's certainly one of my favorites when it comes to Russian literature. Directed by King Vidor who transformed this film into his greatest masterpiece he has Audrey Hepburn in the role of Natasha Henry Fonda as Pierre and Mel Ferrer as Prince Andrei.The script is very faithful to the book and seeks to make a legitimate adaptation. However its very slow giving too much emphasis and spending too much time on certain scenes without need and it lacks emotions and strength being unable to thrill or grab our attention. Perhaps the complexity of the original material has caused so many difficulties for the writing team that they have not been able to handle it in the best way. As for the actors I liked Audrey Hepburn she knew how to give life and joy to her character but I expected more from Mel Ferrer he did not understand his character. I hated Henry Fonda... he had one of the most psychologically rich characters in the novel and simply was unable to deal with it. It was a clear casting error.The film has excellent war scenes and portrays very well the armies but always without emotion or danger in a very warm manner. The costumes and scenarios fill my expectations and have taken great attention with detail and realism which is quite pleasant. Cinematography is quite pleasant although it exaggerates in brightness sometimes. Nino Rota is responsible for the soundtrack and did a good job. Anyway as this movie has the worst sound effects I've heard in movies I will not criticize the soundtrack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those critics who accused King Vidor's War and Peace of being a gross  simplification of Tolstoy's novel must never have actually read War  and Peace.  The movie was a perfect adaptation of Tolstoy's epic which I have read  twice. I was surprised that King Vidor could translate a 1000 plus  page novel into a three and a half hour movie. Like the book the film  War and Peace is about the eternal battle between belief and unbelief  good and evil ambition and altruism between war and peace. The three  main characters Pierre Natasha and Andrey are played perfectly by  the three leads and Audrey Hepburn lights up every scene she is in.  Natasha is symbolic of the allencompassing love which we all need to  survive in a world in which selfishness and death exist. By deciding to  leave Moscow instead of facing the advancing Napoleonled French army  the Russians are practicing Ghandi's teaching of passive resistance  Tolstoy was a great admirer of Ghandi. Another great scene is when  Andrey finally realizes on his death bed that death is just an  awakening and that just one moment of love can redeem a life filled  with hate.  The film also did a good job of contrasting the characters of Napoleon  Pierre and Andrey. In a way Napoleon was the monster which both  Pierre and Andrey could have turned into and which at certain points  in the movie Pierre and Andrey do turn into such as the scene where  Pierre throws a table at his wife. However the person who holds them  back from turning into Napoleonic beasts is Natasha whose love is  transcendent.  It was also interesting how the Russian general continually insisted on  retreating instead of attacking the French army. By meeting destruction  with peace in the end the Russians turn out to be victorious.  There were a few sections of the book which would have been interesting  to include in the film such as Pierre's surreal dream sequence about  death knocking on his door or Pierre's involvement with the  freemasons.  Perhaps one scene summarizes up what the film and the book were  ultimately about. When Pierre is about to witness a battle he is  holding a flower in his hand. Just as the battle turns deadly the  flower falls from his hand.  Can one act of love redeem a lifetime of death and destruction?".

But this epic of the Napoleonic wars has in it much satisfying and dramatic material and I suppose this is what attracted the great director King Vidor to the idea of making an epic movie of the long novel a byword among readers for its immense length. Some of the casting decisions made for the film seem questionable using Anita Ekberg who was dubbed into English for her looks did not work too badly since she has few lines. Fine actor Henry Fonda here seems somewhat too old thin and undertrained in accent as well as emotionally lacking in voltage to play the young Hercules Pierre. But his intelligence carries him through. Stellar in an outstanding cast are Audrey Hepburn Oscar Homolka Herbert Lom as Napoleon Vittorio Gassman John Mills and many others apart from Maj Britt. The sets are extraordinary as are the costumes. The music by Nino Rota is only serviceable but the real stars are the director and his art director whose exquisite achievements are available to enchanted viewers for nearly three hours. The other triumph I suggest is the creation of the lifeloving very unRussian Rostov clan whom the author calls in the person of Prince Andre played decently by Mel Ferrer like a separate race. The battle scenes are superbly done and are still muchcommented upon Spartacus owes its scenes to their model for instance as does The Three Hundred Spartans. The film's one error comes when Natasha played by Hepburn flees from the responsibility of wedding the dignified Andre to run off with a handsome plausible cad. But apart from this hardtoswallow lack of judgment there is little in the film but memorable cinematic achievements. To Vidor I suggest belongs the main credit for bringing this lovely difficulttomake and crowning directorial achievement to glowing life for the ages.".

Director King Vidor. Screenplay By Bridget Boland Robert Westerby Mario Camerini Ennio De Concini Gian Gaspare Napolitano Mario Soldati.Released in theaters across the US in 1956 this was the long awaited first film adaptation of Count Leo Tolstoy's 19th century thousandplus epic masterpiece of Russian literature War And Peace considered the longest novel ever written and the greatest. The success of this Paramount Picture release spurred the making of various other versionsincluding subsequent films with authentic Russian actors as well as later TV miniseries. A new TV version will air in 2007. Director King Vidor was no stranger to bigbudget films So Red The Rose 1935the Kansas scenes in Fleming's Wizard of Oz Duel In The Sun 1946 The Fountainhead 1949 and Solomon and Sheba in 1959. The principal actors were big names that drew audiences namely Henry Fonda and Audrey Hepburn. Mel Ferrer who was married to Audrey Hepburn her first of two husbands was actually a fine Englishtrained actor but largely underrated and unknown to most Americans. The film is about 3 hours and 30 minutes long too long for some viewers and can get awfully dull and talky proving this is possibly the ultimate costume drama. But the labor of love that is this Italianmade production Di Lorentiis was behind the production is well worth watching it in its entirety. Two long years were spent in the making of the film and a decade in actual research and preparation. The bigbudget film was a supremely lavish treatment of the novel and enticed a literatureloving adult crowd. Certain scenes are possibly too graphic in the battle scenes and there a great number of deaths but it is nothing offensive. It is a film about war after all. Take for instance the riveting scenes such as Pierre's attempt to assassinate Napoleon and the long march through the snow in the dead of winter in which dozens of people die or the constant shooting of weakened soldiers. Plot Set between 1805 and 1812 the oncoming Napoleonic army disturbs the leisurely and peaceful life of several prominent Russian families in Moscow and St. Petersbeurg. Pierre our eyes and ears journeys from newly rich heir to a man who experiences the horrors of war. Natasha the main heroine journeys from innocent young girl to mature adult woman. Napoleon faces defeat and retreats but Russia is an entirely different country. Elegant and graceful Audrey Hepburn shines as Natasha Rostov torn between three different men including the meek idealist Pierre Bezukhov who is the illegitimate son of a Count Prince Andrei Mel Ferrer who is the epitome of a Russian royal and the passionate Anatole Vittorio Gassman with whom Natasha engages in a torrid love affair with. As Emperor Napoleon spreads his conquest across Europe at the beginning of the 19th century he fails to conquer England so he sets his eyes on Russia coordinating an attack of Moscow. The ablebodied youth of Russia must go into battle. The war affects the the noble families in this film later suffer not only the loss of loved ones in the war but of property due to financial problems. The film like Gone With The Wind 1939 before it is nothing more than a condensed version of the novel. We do not get everything the novel gives us. It would be too much to put into a film since the Tolstoy novel is too complex. But while it is ultimately too Hollywood in its excess it is a worthy adaptation and the one that set the bar high. Audrey Hepburn is charming but her role at least in the novel ought to be too dark and complicated for her. She commits adultery with a man she is clearly not in love with  something audiences back then couldn't see Audrey doing. The same thing can be said about all the characters who are each complex individuals. Henry Fonda is wonderful as Pierre but is too American in his portrayal and Pierre should come off as a European intellectual. He is however the strongest in the cast. His scenes in battle are quite engaging as his transformation from a kind of idealist naivete changes to experience. Anita Ekberg whose foreign voice was dubbed portrays the beautiful Helene who marries Pierre but is not in love with him and is unfaithful to him. Relationships are complicated in War and Peace just as the war itself is complicated. Herbert Lom portrays Napoleon Bonaparte and is only cast because of his physical resemblance to the historic figure but overacts the part. Cinematography is by Jack Cardiff and is lush epic and a feast for the eyes. Authentic period costumes by Maria De Matteis and Giulio Ferrari. Italian composer Nino Rota Romeo and Juliet 1968 composed the score which gives the film a classical and very Russian flavor. The only problem is the music is often either too soft or too loud due to the Mono sound. This is a great movie filled with drama and the few battle scenes filmed in Vista Vision are terrific. While it may not be as great as later versions of War And Peace it is certainly a winner in its own light.".

As for the leads AllAmerican Fonda doesn't embarrass himself but that's the best that can be said. Natasha was a bit beyond Hepburn's range but she shines anyway.

Story Suffice to say that the legendary scene where Napoleon saves Prince Andrei one of fiction's greatest characters played by one of cinema's lamest actors on the battlefield is reduced to a meaningless incident in the plot.5. Music. Don't get me wrong I appreciate Nino Rota. But if ever a film demanded Russian choral music it's this one.6.

Try to find the international version which is uncut and offers over a dozen dubbingsubtitle options. It is a full 8 hours and ships on 5 DVDs.

But what really is missing is the sense of tragic implications each character carries with them how life's unexpected changes rolls over every single character over some harder than others. There is nothing of Tolstoy's vision of morality. There are no happy endings really some better than other resolutions and Pierre in the book was nothing like Henry Fonda. ONLY Audrey Hepburn captures a good deal of Natasha's spirit but the slow awful decline of the Rostovs is not dealt with or Natasha's own mortification at being tricked by Anatole Kuragin. Prince Andrei was a trapped character in the book beautifully drawn out done whereas as the outset he is set up almost as the 'hero' at first only for Tolstoy to tear him up and down. None of this is in the film  it really needs an 8 hourslong film. For Tolstoy Pierre is closest to a moral centre of the book but as a kind bumbling easilyled ineffectual but wellmeaning character often mostly terribly deceived and while he ends up with Natasha only as she becomes his blowsy hausfrau. The film is good just to see how most directors can't deal with good literature.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anybody who even as much attempts to adapt Leo Tolstoy's magnum opus War and Peace deserves at least a pat on the back for trying regardless of how successful it is in doing so or not. The novel is one of the greatest there is but because of the enormous length one of the longest novels I've ever read and it was admittedly not the easiest to immediately get gripped very rich story and dialogues and complex characterisations and themes it is also one of the most difficult to adapt.While this 1956 film adaptation of War and Peace may not quite work one of the most problematic War and Peace adaptations it is a valiant effort and still has a lot of merits. The costumes and settings while not as evocative of Russia as it could have been are incredibly lavish the colours are bold and opulent and the cinematography is very handsome spectaclewise War and Peace is hugely impressive. Also incredible is Nino Rota's music score it's gorgeously lush in an unmistakably Nino Rota sort of way and it really stirs the emotions not one of my favourite scores of his seeing as he wrote so many great ones but hearing how effectively it works in the film and how well it works as a work on its own it is clear why Rota and his music are so highly regarded. King Vidor directs very thoughtfully with an eye for spectacle and addresses as many of Tolstoy's themes as possible.The war scenes are powerful and moving with the French army's retreat from Russia resonating especially strongly. The performances are mostly odd though reasonably odd on paper for some. Audrey Hepburn was simply born for Natasha she portrays her with a real charm and touching dignity and the camera simply adores her in some todiefor shots. John Mills is similarly excellent giving the film some telling optimism without taking one out of the situation. Napoleon could easily have been written and performed as a hammy buffoon but not only is Herbert Lom delightfully pompous and imposingly tyrannical but he also brings some truly affecting humanity to the role. Anita Ekberg is luminous and emotive and Okskar Homolka is ideal casting as well.However the sound quality is agreed very poorly done here while the voices sounded echoey the surrounding sound is artificial this is including the war scenes and like it was recorded on nearsilent and the dialogue sounded canned. The script is thoughtprovoking and literate but while the themes and events are present the impact and the substance they should have aren't so much a lot of it too onthesurface. With the story the simplification didn't bother me seeing as it was only a nearly threeandahalfhour length whereas a 1012 part miniseries is much more likely to do this massive story complete justice but the rather sluggish pacing onthesurface writing and that some of the drama scenes were needlessly stretched to the point of neartedium did. Two performances didn't come over so well either. Mel Ferrer is very wooden and stiff with his performance often lacking in expression. More problematic is a badly miscast Henry Fonda in a rare 'bad' performance didn't have the 'he was physically wrong' problem like a lot did but it was more to do with that he made little if any attempt to look and sound Russian it was more Henry Fonda playing himself while looking and sounding bored but he just looked so disengaged and clumsy. Ferrer at least looked the part so whatever the large shortcomings there were in his performance he did acquit himself a little better than Fonda.Overall doesn't quite work but is a valiant effort adapting a classic but very difficult book. 610 Bethany Cox".

The ugly side of fascism is a rising phenomenon in Italy. Soon the whole country will be in the midst of that infamous regime that brought nothing but suffering to the population at large.Umberto is the maker of fine suits while his next door neighbor Leone offers a cheaper merchandise. Umberto's business caters to a more refined clientele while Leone has more affordable garments for budget minded customers. When Umberto devises a campaign for summer Leone answers with his own kind of fashions for the vacation minded Romans. Their rivalry is the talk of the neighborhood. These two individuals are destined to get on each other's nerves.Unknown to the two business enemies their young sons are best friends who share a passion for building things together playing and drawing. The same goes for Umberto's son who is desperately in love with Leone's daughter. One thing that makes them different is their religious beliefs Umberto is catholic while Leone is Jewish. Soon the ruling regime dictates laws that will make it more difficult for Jews to survive in the hostile environment.When Leone's window is broken by a stone Umberto cannot help but feeling sorry for his rival. After all Umberto is a decent man. Leone sees his days are numbered so the best thing is to get out of the business he and his father have built. Umberto finally comes around when Leone gets sick showing that in spite of their different styles he can be friends with a man that never caused him any harm.A well felt film by director Etore Scola. It is not one of his best productions but he manages to tell the story in simple terms. The political aspects of the film are subtly played. Leone and his family feel what is coming to the country but they find they cannot do anything to stop the madness that soon will sweep Italy and the rest of Europe. Umberto a decent man cannot bring himself to accuse his competition of being a Jew even though he could profit from doing so.Sergio Castellitto and Diego Abatantuono are seen in the main roles of Leone and Umberto. These two fine actors are a pleasure to have in any movie. Both actors make a great contribution to the success of the film. The supporting cast is wonderful. Gerard Depardieu makes an appearance in a surprising role that does not add anything to the story. His character could have been played by any Italian actor.".

Her only real friend is the young Inuit boy Isaiah who dies suddenly under suspicious circumstances and Smilla determines to uncover the reasons for his death. For the first two reels this film is a terrific mystery story with good pacing fine acting and evocative cinematography. Characters with uncertain motives come and go as the story unfolds most played by a fine stable of talented actors. But then in the third reel the film collapses. I'm not talking about a slow descent into mediocrity here I'm talking about a precipitous nosedive. Out of the blue the story suddenly switches to an actionthriller format that is poorly written directed and edited. New undeveloped characters are suddenly thrown into the mix each a deus ex machina as the increasingly unrealistic plot requires. The film's denouement in which the underlying mystery is revealed is so scientifically ridiculous both in terms of biology and especially in physics that I felt thoroughly cheated. It's as if the entire enterprise were rushed to completion due to a looming shortage of time money and interest. What a pity. Even so the first two thirds of the film stand up well on their own and my rating is based on that. Rating 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "n a cold December day in Copenhagen a young boy named Isaiah falls to his death from the roof of the block of flats where he lives. The official police view is that he slipped and fell while playing on the roof. Smilla Jaspersen a neighbour of Isaiah and his mother does not accept that his death was an accident. Isaiah had a fear of heights so was unlikely to have been playing on the roof moreover the footprints in the snow do not support the police version. Smilla therefore decides to start her own investigation to find out what really happened. Isaiah and his mother belonged to Denmark's Greenlandic minority and Smilla herself grew up in Greenland the daughter of a Danish father and Greenlandic mother. She is in her late thirties and works as a freelance mathematician and expert on the physics of ice and snow although she has no formal academic qualifications. She discovers however that Isaiah's father was an employee of a Danish mining corporation and that he died in mysterious circumstances during an expedition to Greenland organised by this corporation. She begins to suspect that Isaiah's death was also in some way linked to the company and learns that they are organising another voyage to Gela Alta a small island off the coast of Greenland although she does not know what the object of this voyage is. Nevertheless she believes that the key to the mystery lies on this remote island and joins the crew of the ship as a stewardess just ahead of the police who resent her interference in the case and are trying to arrest her. This was one of those films that I enjoyed more than the original novel. Peter Hoeg's book was itself in some ways reminiscent of a film. The first half with its urban setting its tough gritty investigator and its suggestion of a web of corruption and wrongdoing in high places reminded me of a Humphrey Bogart style film noir and the second part set on the ship as it makes its way through the Arctic ice of one of those filmed versions of Alistair MacLean thrillers that were so popular in the sixties and seventies. I found however that it suffered from an overcomplex plot and was too slow moving to work as a thriller. Bille August's version removes some of the complexity of the plot and moves along at a faster pace. The revelation about exactly what lies below the ice comes earlier in the film than it does in the book possibly August realized that the book's ending more science fiction than science fact was one of its weak points and wanted to get this detail out of the way to allow the closing scenes of the film to concentrate more on the battle between Smilla and the villains. The film keeps however the book's atmospheric sense of place there were some wonderful shots of Copenhagen in winter and of the Arctic ice.Julia Ormond seemed to be the cinema's Big New Thing of the midnineties. Her role in 'Smilla's Sense of Snow' followed starring roles in three big Hollywood films 'Legends of the Fall' 'First Knight' and 'Sabrina'. Since then she seems to have disappeared from the radar altogether and I have often wondered what has happened to her.. Her performance in 'Smilla' however is a good one and she makes an appealing heroine. Rather more appealing in fact than Hoeg's original character who combines a strong sense of justice with a gift for rudeness and sarcasm. Of the other actors the best was Richard Harris as the chief villain although he was probably considerably older than the character envisaged by Hoeg.Although it is very different in its visual style this atmospheric thriller is perhaps the nearest that the modern cinema comes to oldfashioned film noir. Despite its weaknesses it remained watchable throughout. It confirmed my view based on 'Pelle the Conqueror' and 'The House of the Spirits' that Bille August is a highly talented director. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought the trailer looked great and the acting talent involved really is quite impressive Julia Ormond Richard Harris Tom Wilkinson and Gabriel Byrne. Not to mention that the story looked interesting. And the cinematography is just amazingvery beautiful very cold. So what went wrong? Sadly the film is crippled by the script. It's the kind of story where the protagonist knows exactly the right bits of obscure information and knows exactly the right people who can give her exactly the information she needs to unravel the mystery. Not only that she can rappel off the side of a ship like nobody's business. In his review of this film Ebert said it was a triumph of style over substance. The style is definitely there but just before it triumphs something completely illogical is said or done that breaks the suspension of disbelief the film tries so hard to build up. As for the actors I got the feeling that they just didn't know what to do with their characters none of which were very wellrounded. Even Smilla a unique female protagonist in that she is very intelligent and independent is not given enough of a personality or a background to inspire the viewer's compassion. And anyway it's not her intelligence that gets her to the end of the story it's the fact that she's got more guts than any hero I've ever seen in a movie male or female. The only truly likable and memorable character is Isaiah if only because he's just an impossibly cute little kid. In the end while the movie is aesthetically pleasing not enough attention was paid to developing a plausible story welldrawn characters or a satisfying ending.P.S.I almost forgot to mention that Vanessa Redgrave does a very nice job but has to say the line There is no Mr Lubing. I am the bride of Jesus which just cracked me up even though I think it was supposed to be a serious moment.P.P.S.The absolute highlight of the movie is a little speech Smilla gives about numbers. It's actually very unique and insightful and fortunately it's in the Memorable Quotes section.".

This is one of the rare exceptions.The makers succeeded well in capturing the complexity of the book's characters. Julia Ormond does remarkably well as the moody unpredictable Smilla Jaspersen. So does Gabriel Byrne in the role of the rather secretive Mechanic. The brilliant Richard Harris is in here too one of the many movies he probably said that it would be his last. The rest of the cast fits in well. Nice to see that they didn't try to get all big names but rather actors who can fill a role appropriately.Of course the movie isn't perfect but in order to give that book full credit they would have had to make a 4 hour film. Especially the second part with all the events on the ship and in Greenland is rather condensed. Those scenes could have used a bit more air to breathe less pace.Nevertheless I really like this movie I have been watching it several times already. And now I think I am going to read the book again... 810".

Yes I know the plot was a little twisted and the ending was very confusing and somewhat unbelievable at times but this was a great movie.  Julia Ormond's portrayal of the ice princess is absolutely fantastic.  This has got to be her best role ever. With SSOS she proves that she is not just a movie star but that she is also a damn good actress.  The supporting cast is superb.  All first class actors Vannasa Redgrave Richard Harris and Gabriel Byrne.  I love Byrne's portrayal of the mysterious mechanic.  Yes he could have done a better job but that didn't hurt the movie.  I have heard so much criticism from others regarding this film but the bottom line is you either love it or hate it. I happen to love it.  This is a great thrillermysteryscifidrama.  Did I mention Gabriel Byrne as good looking as ever?  910".

It is part murder mystery part paranoid thriller with faceless villains like the Conversation part James Bond with a drop of science fiction and like none of those all that much.The victim of a possible murder is a 6 year old boy whom you gradually get to know and care for deeply via flash backs of his tragic life.One of the themes is trust. Smilla never knows whom she can trust. We in the audience weave back and forth trying to decide who is truly trying to help her and who to kill her or at least deflect her from her quest of finding out why and how someone would harm that little boy.The movie is a maddening puzzle with clues coming thick and fast but nothing making much sense. All you know is some very powerful people are involved and are ruthless in keeping silence. Smilla takes huge risks to gather information she has no particular reason to believe may be relevant other than others seem to be hiding it. Like a standard mystery novel all is finally explained.One interesting twist is you in the audience even begin to distrust the caustic Smilla with her onepointed push for vengeance.Usually in a movie with a great many characters I often find it hard to keep from confusing them. In this movie the characters are all distinctly drawn partly with a rich mixture of accents so I had no such problem.Some of the casting choices seemed a bit off in particular Smilla's father's new teenage wife Benja who was obviously much older than a teenager which made some of Smilla's cracks about her age not ring true.".

But in Smilla's Sense of Snow Ormond is beautiful tough intelligent and gives a powerhouse performance as Smilla a Greenlandborn woman who has lived her life in selfisolation. She is bitter angry often times cold and detached and she avoids all human connection by pushing people away including her own her father Robert Loggia until she befriends a little boy named Isaiah an Inuit who lives next door. Smilla and Isaiah bond and become close until one day Isaiah is found dead with what the police rule as an accidental suicide while playing on the roof of their apartment building. But Smilla knows better when she looks at the scene of the crime and notices that little boy's foot tracks on the snow go running straight to the edge of the building. Smilla begins to investigate the young boy's death and along the way she is acquainted with another neighbor and friend of Isaiah Gabriel Byrne with whom Smilla begins a relationship that she resists. I liked this movie with the exception of the XFileslike ending but this film is worth watching for Julia Ormond who should've been given an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance...flawed script but an intriguing character played beautifully by the classically lovely Julia Ormond.".

This meteorite crashed into that cold ice capped sea some 150 years ago that carried on in a colony of prehistoric worms. These alien worm came to life when the meteorite hit the waters and some 150 years later infected and killed four men from the expedition including the boys father.

Taking a personal interest in the boys death Smilla checks out clues that leads her to the Greenland Mining Company which employed Isaiah's father in that expedition. Smilla soon learns that Isaiah was being monitored by the company monthly to see if he was infected by the worms that killed his father and his three fellow workers. That's because Isaiah also went into the melt water himself to try to save his father but nothing seemed to have happened to him. The movie starts to get confused and falls apart when Smilla begins to overcome odds on top of odds with bodies falling all around her as she gets to the meteorite crash site with the chief villain Tork Richard Harris. With him not having a clue to who Smilla was and what she was up to until the very end. Smilla wasn't exactly that secretive about her intentions with every one the police the Greenland Mining Company as well as the hospital staff that attended the boy knowing about her intentions.

It started out really well but after a point it just spiralled out of control into crapdom.The movie on the other hand  is crap all the way. The storyline was thin anyway to start with but the acting just layers it with more junk. The dialogue is plain stupid and cliched. For example before kissing the mechanic Smilla says Have you heard the phrase that I did not know what I was doing after getting drunk or something like that...and this scene along with almost the entire movie has been acted with such boredom by all the actors What was Richard Harris doing in a movie like this?that I literally went to sleep.

It started out really well but after a point it just spiralled out of control into crapdom.The movie on the other hand  is crap all the way. The storyline was thin anyway to start with but the acting just layers it with more junk. The dialogue is plain stupid and cliched. For example before kissing the mechanic Smilla says Have you heard the phrase that I did not know what I was doing after getting drunk or something like that...and this scene along with almost the entire movie has been acted with such boredom by all the actors What was Richard Harris doing in a movie like this?that I literally went to sleep.

Instead of waiting for the actual film they are going to be making a mockbuster of to come out they have decided to cash in on the buzz surrounding it and beat them to the punchto an extent. Completely scooping Pixar and Disney yeah right The Asylum moved forward and made the first movie adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's John Carter of Mars. Instead of actually having the audacity to tread on thin ice by calling the film John Carter of Mars they opted for Princess of Mars. As an average uneducated scifi Bmovie watcher you'd never know the film was based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs's story or creation as they give him credit nowhere in the main titles. I don't know what that's all about. You'd think they would want to use everything at their disposal to promote and exploit this thing. It's their very nature to do so.Once again this feels like it was done on the fly which is what gives these movies their charm. The film editing and direction suits it just fine and operates to keep the lowest amount of special effects shot possible to still make it remotely entertaining. You know the drill by now. Shoot all the action sequences very close as to not have to spend too much time on wide shots or digital scene editing. Show the actors lurch up to jump cut to a far away shot of them flying through the air and then cut back to them landing in a crouch. Its genius and The Asylum team does it best! I've got to tell you that the special effects are nowhere near as bad as you would think they'd be. The Princess of Mars' transport ship does look dangerously like the model crew broke into Skywalker Ranch and stole Jabba's Land Barge from Return of the Jedi. They even have these speeder bike looking things they ride. Coincidence or someone on the Asylum special effects crew having a weird fixation on Lucas' Ewoktainted third film in the original Star Wars trilogy? You decide.The actors. Ah the actors. We've got Antonio Sabato Jr hamming it up halfnaked as John Carter with some of the worst badly placed tattoos I've ever seen. What male has a lower back tattoo? It feels like they actually paid him to be onset more than a couple of days. Then there's the cream of the crop  Traci Lords  using her same brand of acting she's come to be known for in flicks and TV shows like The Tommyknockers and Hercules. Strangely enough for a Bmovie nerd extravaganza she has more clothes on throughout the movie than Sabato Jr. She suits the part of the Princess of Mars well though. You can't help but feel a little stab of nostalgia for 80's movies like Red Sonja Conan The Destroyer and Beastmaster. It does almost feel like they only paid her enough to be onset one day however.The Asylum should do great with this release. All the John Carter of Mars fans that have been eagerly awaiting some kind of movie adaptation of the source material will no doubt rent or buy it. SyFy Channel is guaranteed to get good ratings when it's aired in the token Saturday prime time slot they show these types of films in. Now I'm not saying Carter fans won't be disappointed but they'll see it nonetheless and it really isn't THAT bad.".

I've seen if you can call it that one or two Asylum movies before and some of them are physically painful to watch. 2012 Supernova? Arrrgh!! AVH Alien vs. Hunter? I nearly gnawed off a limb in an effort to dull the excruciating experience.

The acting was hammy and the production values were unimpressive but at least they were there it looked like what it was a thoroughly derivative lowbudget Cmovie bordering on the farcical. But that can be entertaining too! As the movie went on I was thinking that hey this was in the same league as Bloodrayne and stuff like that and I might actually end up rating this a 4 out of 10! A good rating for a craptacular excuse for a real movie appreciating that it might be trash but at least it's funny and entertaining trash.Unfortunately the ending was so stupid and pointless that I have to cut that rating in half and end up with a 2 out of 10 mark. Properly the movie doesn't really deserve more than 1 but for maintaining a certain watchability almost all the way to the end and for being funny despite its ROTJ derivation I retain one more star.All in all still a massive disappointment that can in no way be recommended.".

Lords does bring some decent name recognition to the cast. Taken on its own merits this movie is entertaining and pretty surreal in some ways. Visually it consistently makes good eye candy. Asylum sank a bit more money into this one I suspect. I actually enjoy Asylum movies they are simply fun and this is one of their better ones IMO. It reminded me somewhat of the old serials from the thirties like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. However there are lots of other influences. I felt it came up a bit short in the action department but I may be a bit spoiled by big budget films where something is blown up wrecked or shot every few seconds. The male lead was pretty good and the Tarks looked cool. Overall the sets were very nice for a medium budget flick. There is something oddly surreal about a lot of Asylum movies and that actually adds to their appeal. Im a fan of the old pulp fiction stuff so I gravitate to media like this. I wouldn't mind reading a novel based on this movie actually. Give it a shot its pretty entertaining in a low key kind of way. No its not Star Wars but it is pretty unique in lots of ways. Watch it for something different than the formulaic stuff Hollywood generally puts out there.".

If pressed I'd give that honour to Tim Burton's 'Planet of the Apes' a work which cost more than the previous Apes franchise of five movies and two TV series all put together but which was appallingly stupid  unbelievable talent and money went into making a painfully awful movie.On the other side of the coin here we have an action adventure movie made for very little money with little in the way of resources. Yet it's amazing how they managed to actually make an enjoyable watchable film.I'm not necessarily a fan of Asylum films. A lot of them suffer from the worst sin of filmmaking tedium.But Princess of Mars is anything but tedious. There are no shortage of rocky moments including awkward scenes with Kantos Kan and there's definitely stuff to dislike. Shortcuts or shots where there was no time or money to do more than get something in the can.But flaws aside it's a relatively faithful telling of the novel. The biggest changes are the reduction of the role and backstory of Tars Tarkas and the elimination of the Zodangan war as well as the cosmetic stuff  short stubby two armed Tharks riding giant birds instead of eight legged horses.A lot of the true heart of the novel and the characters remain. John Carter is light hearted and heroic Dejah Thoris is regal and idealistic Tars Tarkas is noble. The relationships develop naturally between them the acting is usually decent and sometimes quite good. The location shooting in the Vazques rocks is a highlight the place looks genuinely weird and alien. The script apart from the occasional clunky line moves quickly and efficiently there are witty lines.Frankly my advice is to go look at the trailer. A lot of times the trailers are better than the actual film. Or the trailers contain all the good parts of the film and the actual film tends to be mostly filler. In this case the trailer is actually a good showcase for the film. If you liked the tailer you'll enjoy the film.In the meantime I'm pretty happy with it.".

The special effects are sometimes crude and the fight scenes are closer to what you might see two neighborhood kids perform with wooden swords. I even saw John Carter duck one time right before his opponent swung his sword. Most of the time they just seem content with hitting each other's sword not really trying to inflict pain.But don't take my opening comments as totally negative because this is part of the charm of the film. As a 'B' movie it works it is appropriately entertaining. The cheesy dialog the stilted acting especially former porn star Lords. Sometimes it can be refreshing to take a break from the mega blockbusters of today many of which are not nearly as entertaining as this one. On to the plot. Antonio Sabato Jr. is military man John Carter who is gravely wounded during some fighting and is given a special experimental treatment to save his life. With no explanation he awakes healed on another planet called Mars. But this is not the Mars we know it is a planet in a different faraway star system. It is quite a coincidence that they call their atmosphere air just like the Earthlings do. And the gravity seems to be a lot less because Carter can jump far and high with ease giving him a type of superpower.Most of the inhabitants of this Mars are grotesquelooking creatures but there are some who look like humans. Traci Lords is Dejah Thoris who we find is called the Princess of Mars. We are never told why she has the title of Princess. But her people run the royal pumping station which contains the device which filters and keeps the air 'day by day and night by night clean and bright' as they are fond of saying. But the other inhabitants have come to believe all that is a lie no such station is required. And that raised the specter of a giant conflict led by Matt Lasky as Tars Tarkas. Also a nemesis is fellow human Chacko Vadaketh as Sab Than who gets transported along with John. Worth a watch just for the novelty. No it is not a good movie but it is a decent 'B' movie. Sometimes you have to watch movies like this to really appreciate the good ones.SPOILERS Sab Than manages to destroy or disable the purification mechanism soon all creatures start to have trouble breathing. But in a protracted fight Carter manages to get the upper hand while Than is carried off by a giant flying insect. Carter and the Princess make their way to the backup purification unit appering to be filmed in an idled chemical plant and she starts it. Soon everyone starts to feel better and she smiles for the first time in the movie. But then Carter finds himself back on Earth and became healed and returned to action. He did not tell of his transport to the strange planet fearing humans would then take the opportunity to go there and overrun it. So the movie ends with him looking forward to the day he can return there presumably after getting badly wounded again to see the Princess he has fallen in love with.".

I am eagerly awaiting the big budget version but whoever is responsible for allowing this film should be taken by Edgar Rice Burroughs surviving family taken outside and summarily executed by them for doing something so dreadful to a very much beloved series of novels and a group of equally beloved characters. This film was so low budget they couldn't afford to give Tars Tarkas his other set of arms or his other 9 feet of height. It actually makes Plan 9 from outer space look like Avatar by comparison.".

	schema:headline " This desperately needs a Phantom Edit";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie stumbles badly right away. There's no real need to update it it works better if it isn't updated. But that's not the real failing. The scene where he is in the hospital being told by some mad scientists that he is being sent to Mars as some sort of science experiment was one of the most absurd that I have ever seen. It was unintentionally comic. Why in the world did they need to declare that Barsoom isn't Mars but a planet in another solar system? Yes we know that the real Mars isn't like the Mars that Burroughs imagined that doesn't interfere with the story.There is a scene were he asks for something to drink and he is given a rag full of sweat. Another scene where he asks for food and he is given the excretion of some larva. Neither of these are in the book they eat something that seems like cheese or tofu and to drink they drink the liquid of a cactuslike plant. Why they chose to make this change is beyond me. It seemed to be an attempt to disgust the audience and didn't make the movie any better.A good Phantom Edit would cut out entirely the portion before he gets to Mars. A minute of two of narration at the beginning could replace the entire first part of the movie. It would also be necessary to snip out the part where you learn the bad guy is from Earth. You don't have to eliminate him entirely just the nonsense of him being from Earth.I'd also delete the scenes where he is given sweat and larval excretions to drink.Other parts are more minor. Traci Lords is a bit too old too clothed and too blonde to be a plausible Deja Thoris. She seems more a cranky sitcom mom than a princess of Helium. The tattoos on John Carter seem unlikely a tramp stamp on a man? But these are minor the major flaws of this movie are overwhelming but if they were cut out this would be well not a great movie but not too bad.If you watch the movie you see that throughout the movie one of Tars Tarkas' tusks wobbles. A fairly minor thing but it shows how quickly they made this movie was made.".

H.G Wells Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar Rice Burroughs won't turn into literary Zombies and march on your offices. Although that would be more interesting that most asylum films come to think of it. 3 Get some washed up actors. People that you might have heard of but aren't getting good roles these days.4 Cheap Special Effects Get some of those kookie YouTube kids to make your monsters...badly edited them into the film. 5 Pad out 10 minutes of plot with an hour of fight scenes and wandering through the desert scenes.Okay Really I'm going to say some nice things about this film. It's actually better than your average Asylum film but that's like saying it's the least trampy Jerry Springer guest.They've actually remained somewhat faithful to the Burroughs story updating it a bit. Carter is still from Virginia but now he's an exGreen Beret instead of an exConfederate officer. Honestly the weakest part of the film was Traci Lords. She's never been a good actress and you can tell she's in her forties every time they did a close up. Honestly the girl who played the lizard chick was more attractive. Or at least firm in the places a woman should be firm.Hey I noticed something else. Ever notice in an asylum film they have a lot of gunplay but the muzzles of the weapons are almost always out of frame when they are being fired? I guess someone didn't budget for blank ammunition but sound effects are always cheap. And Martians have 50 cals and Kalishnikovs just like we do on earth.".

But still the movie was enjoyable for what it was. A word of warning though if you have seen the John Carter movie that was out earlier in 2009 then chances are that you might want to stay clear of this version. Imagine a weird hybrid of the 1980's Flash Gordon movie mixed with Disney's John Carter movie and you have the end result coming out as Princess of Mars.One thing that did puzzle me though with the technology and resources available to the humanlike race on this red planet why would their princess be clad so scantily like a common... Well you get my meaning. It just didn't make sense. Or did it? Well you have Traci Lords in the role as the princess so of course why wouldn't the director be having her running around half naked?The creature effects were adequate to look at except for those bipedal reptiles that they used for mounts. They were just horrible to look at. Awfully animated CGI and they walked like they all had bad indigestion.I will say that The Asylum did put out a fairly enjoyable SciFi movie here but in the wake of Disney's John Carter then the movie pales in comparison.".

The rest of the cast were green martians played by wearing cheesy looking masks which makes any sort of acting pretty much impossible. The original Burrough's plot was heavily modified and not for the better. Dramatic scenes from the book such as John Carter slaying a green martian for hitting Dejah Thoris riding double as they flee captivity standing off the hordes of Warhoon with a radium rifle and 200 rounds are omitted. John Carter doesn't woo and win Dejah Thoris the beautiful and gutsy martian princess which was the strongest part of the book. The low budget showed up in clunky looking weapons and props mediocre costumes and special effects that made the old Dr Who seem sophisticated.

I am looking forward to the big budget version now being filmed but until then this cheap version is all we have. Understanding that this is a very cheap version made to cash on a major version in production is key to whether you rate this as terrible or barely acceptable. I can accept the Tharks losing a set of arms and the Thoats being reduced from 8 legs to two because of the cost involved but they could of at least hired someone who knew something about fencing. If you are going to make a movie about the Greatest Swordsman of two worlds you need to make it decent.The original has influenced a number of science fiction efforts especially the Flash Gordon comic strips. The opening sequence of RETURN OF THE JEDI has a very Burroughs feel to it as does the arena part of ATTACK OF THE CLONES.Making John Carter a modern Marine is acceptable the 1953 comic did the same but I did not care for the tattoos. I guess that is a generational thing.Casting Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris has got to be the worst case of miscasting since John Wayne tried to swash buckle in THE CONQUEROR. She could only be hired because of the name recognition factor. She was too old wrong complexion and hair and wore too many clothes especially for a former porno queen. Remember the Martians walk around naked except for a leather harness to carry their swords I don't expect the big budget version to be any better than this.But the worst of all was that incredibly lame sword fight at the conclusion. That has to be the worst ever put on film. I had an 8mm camera when I was a kid and we staged sword fights in the back yard with sticks and cardboard cut out swords that were superior to this piece of crap.I bought a copy of this out of curiosity. I watched it once and I don't expect to watch it again.".

It's not that it's badin fact it's OK as far as super lowbudget fantasy flicks go I love the old Amicus Burroghs flicks with Doug McClure. They only used a few of the original story elements but I guess putting six arms on Tars Tarkus or red body paint on all the humans would have been cost prohibitive. But what's up with casting Traci Lords as Deja Thoris the princess? Even if you're kind in your estimation Lords is well over 40. Not bad looking for a woman her age but certainly not a good enough actress to make you forget that she's WAY too old for the part. I just couldn't go on with the film once she became a big part of it because I couldn't' stop thinking how virtually ANY young Hollywood actress would have been more watchable. In fact just about any woman who works at a Hooters would have been more watchable! I don't want to sound ageist but if a female actress of marginal acting ability is going to be running about in a skimpy outfit for over an hour on screen she'd better be superexceptionally hot for her age or young enough for it not to matter. I mean reallydid anyone rent this because they saw the name Traci Lords? And I want to reiteratethis is not a personal attack on Ms. Lords. I just don't think she's doing herself or us justice by still trying to be the hot young chick. And Deja Thoris should be a hot young chick.".

The problem lies in the atrocious script. It is as dull as an old knife. A Burroughs flick can be a lot of things but boring should not be one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie made me nostalgic for a couple of things at once. The first is the series of Edgar Rice Burroughs movie adaptations that came out in the late 1970's such as At the Earth's Core and The Land That Time Forgot. Both movies starred Doug McClure which was okay but which was sort of like casting Joe Don Baker as Tarzan. This movie goes with a much better lead the lean muscular gritty Sabato Jr. The other blast of nostalgia was for the 1930's Flash Gordon serials. I could close my eyes and just about hear Buster Crabbe when Sabato Jr. was trying to speak believable dialogue in ridiculous circumstances. Another thing that made the film reminiscent of Flash Gordon was the filming location  Bronson Canyon.I really have to congratulate the filmmakers for not going the teen heartthrob route with John Carter. They could easily cast a cool 22 year old with a wild mane of hair and a snotty attitude. I'm so glad that they didn't.The green Martians quite naturally suffered from the budget. I mean there was no way that even a reasonably budgeted flick could pull off two hours' worth of decently animated four armed giant desert savages. As a result the green Martians are more like the Tuskan Raiders in Star Wars and that's okay.The weakest link other than the goofy plot device that sends Carter to Mars in the first place was the Princess of Mars herself portrayed by Traci Lords. Someone with the looks and bearing of a Penelope Cruz or a young Caroline Munro McClure's leading lady in the 70's would have been better fit for the role. Lords was more like a queen mother than a princess but she pushed the film along with stern determination.It's unfortunate that Edgar Rice Burroughs' name isn't attached to the piece but I have to remember that this is an unauthorized adaptation of a 1911 magazine story book publication 1917 that has been in the public domain for quite awhile.The film also struck me as a slightly proIsraeli political allegory but maybe that's just my own overactive imagination. Just watch it for yourself.".

That's Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris and she's every bit as embarrassing to watch as your friend's mom would be. Moreover she doesn't seem to be enjoying the party much. She goes through the film with an illtempered pout welded to her face looking as if she's perpetually on the edge of saying 'Screw this' and storming off. Unfortunately for us she decided to stick around growling out her lines like someone being forced to read the telephone book at gunpoint.So much for the most beautiful woman in two worlds. The fighting Virginian Captain John Carter isn't much better. He's a swordandsandal beefcake who looks to be about half her age with spiky hair and the kind of 'tramp stamp' back tattoo more commonly seen on oversexed teenage girls. He spends most of the movie smirking to himself.Rounding out the cast are a few sinister swarthy figures and a small  very small  army of undersized tharks humanoid Martian monsters. The tharks also mostly sound as if they're having their lines read to them over the telephone but their faces are mercifully hidden behind tusked plastic masks so there's no way to tell whether they're pouting or smirking. In some scenes the tharks appear to tower over John Carter as if the filmmakers had remembered that they're supposed to be fifteen feet tall. In the next shot they've suddenly shrunk to human size again. My guess would be that the makers originally planned to fake the size differences using clever camera angles but found that it was too much work. For financial reasons they were apparently unwilling to reshoot the scenes they'd already filmed so they just stuck them in and hoped for the best.There are also some sinister swarthy figures a collection of computeranimated monsters plodding morosely across a desert landscape and some giant antspider things some of which fly and all of which explode in a splash of vivid green ichor when shot with the flimsy art deco rifles carried by the tharks. It looks rather as if the spiders  which do not appear in the original novel  somehow used up the limb budget for the whole film forcing drastic cutbacks elsewhere the tharks have only two arms while the eightlegged thoats have become bipeds. The scenery is similarly reduced. It looks like what it is  not the fabled deserts of Barsoom but a few rocks in a sandy patch of waste ground somewhere outside L.A.I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie all the way through. There didn't seem to be any point. It's fairly clear that the filmmakers probably felt the same way but they at least stuck it out and dragged it to some kind of plodding conclusion. Or so I assume.It would be nice to imagine that the movie was intended as a kind of postmodern satire on Burroughs' overblown heroic fantasy. In this cynical vision everything is deceptive and disappointing a cruel metaphor for the human condition  the deserts of Barsoom are nothing but a sandy backlot the peerless princess is a middleaged former porn star the ultimate champion just an overmuscled gym rat. Scholars would applaud the daring irony the bold inversion of the escapist epic. But I'm afraid that the cynicism was of a different kind and that the makers were simply trying to make a quick buck as cheaply and crudely as possible.Even 'completists' who want to see everything inspired by Burroughs' work should give this one a miss. It's just depressingly bad on every level.".

His grandmother tells him that his mother was unfaithful to his father. Regardless Valentn still misses her. His womanizing father Vincente is on the most part absent as a traveling salesman he who seems more concerned about his own fortunes than sending money home to take care of his mother and son. Valentn has dreams like most young boys his primary one being to become an astronaut. He believes the work that he does building rocket models and space suits will assist the NASA space program and he does whatever he can such as walk around in heavy shoes to simulate zero gravity and hold his breath underwater in his pursuit of becoming an astronaut despite being slightly crosseyed and nearsighted which he believes will not hinder his chances.

He is raised by his poor widow grandmother Abuela Carmen Maura and is totally abandoned by his parents.

The smart but needy kid missed his mother and when his father introduces his new girlfriend Leticia Julieta Cardinali Valentin has a strong connection with her.

Valentine is a sweet cute and delightful tale of a young negotiator that wanted to be an astronaut. I am not sure whether Rodrigo Noya is a great actor or not but in this particular and peculiar role he is simply amazing. Carmen Maura is fantastic as usual and the unknown Julieta Cardinali has a very beautiful participation. The story makes the viewer laugh and certainly will bring tears so touching and sensitive it is. This movie was one of the greatest good surprises for me and I really loved it. The scene of Valentin negotiating with the doctor in the hospital to see his grandmother in the market is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in cinema. Unfortunately life is not as beautiful as pictured in this remarkable scene. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Valentin".

	schema:reviewBody "If you ever watched The Wonder Years and enjoyed the combination of youth and wisdom you will enjoy this movie set in 1969. The child actor is fabulous and endears himself and his character immediately. Combining child p.o.v. with the hindsight of adult understanding and narration in a child's voice the film achieves great realness. Based on the reallife story of the directorwriter it's wonderfully nostalgic and yet powerfully cathartic. If you never cry or laugh during this film please see a doctor as your heart may be already stopped. But it isn't oversentimentalized or trivialized at all. Quite the opposite it's the story of agonizing loss borne with true emotional strength. Filmed in Argentina it takes you on a trip to another time and place all the while telling the timeless tale of a child's unending capacity to love. Moving important and true. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Through the Eyes of a Precocious Little Boy";
	schema:reviewBody "The world as seen from the very adult eyes and precocious mind of Valentin an 8year old boy living with grandmother Carmen Maura while his father goes from girlfriend to girlfriend can be a somewhat alienating place. Especially when the grandmother constantly talks to herself and complains about everything around her and his father is barely there. He's aware that his grandmother despite her abrasive temper loves him but she's not a real mother to him. His mother as Valentin has been told ran off with someone else and will not see him. And her mere suggestion will tick off his father's ugly violent streak.However what seems to be the basis of a story that might have overtones of James Baldwin's style becomes something totally different almost lyrical. Valentin despite being surrounded by negative energy is quite resilient in the way not many children may be. His conversations with his Uncle Chiche in regards to women's beauty because he longs to see his own father settle down as well as his growing friendship with Rufo a musician are steps to his own acceptance in his world. However it's with his meeting with Leticia Julieta Cardinali that he discovers a kindred spirit even a temporary surrogate mother.Their encounter is literally bursting in a bubble of enormous poignancy that threatens to overwhelm the camera lens capturing its story. It's as if Agresti wanted to really focus in on this particular moment in time when everything seemed perfect... and in his own interview he states that this was the event that led to the making of his story. With exquisite period pop music they meet and go to the movies where they bond and in a gesture of nearinfinite compassion Leticia smiles down at Valentin as he enjoys the movie. Later on he confides a truth about his father that brings tears to her eyes... and in a quiet moment in the park they promise never to speak of this to anyone  not even Valentin's father.Of course Leticia does tell his father  even when in a heartbreaking scene she denies this to Valentin even though her body language suggests otherwise. It's here when Valentin has his only burst of rage he's a child caught in the middle being called derogatory names and he's tired of it. All he wants is the love of a mother.VALENTIN boasts the presence of Carmen Maura an Almodovar veteran. Her presence is that of a woman who clearly loves her grandson but has become so bitter with life due to the destinies of her two sons and the death of her husband that her health and possibly her sanity is failing. She is not a onenote crusty old lady one scene tells pages of who she is who she was and how deeply she misses the man of her life. Agresti himself is fearsome as the father. He is a man who no one wants to mess with because his temper is out the window and later revelations from Leticia and a crucial character Valentin meets near the end of the film point at his abusive possibly even psychotic nature.The young actor playing Valentin however is an inspired choice. More so in a time when child actors tend to read their lines instead of actually feeling them Rodrigo Noya virtually a standin for Agresti himself may not know the realities of acting at a technical level but he plays his part with maturity and his reactions never border on cute. His rendition of Valentin is that of a boy who knows what he wants to be when he grows up one who wants to solve people's problems and make things better even when this may bring his into trouble but one who isn't quite aware of people's prejudices as with the AntiSemitism that pervades throughout some of the story's characters.It's a good move for Agresti to not move into explaining certain details of the plot's resolution. In this respect it pays to know Spanish and read between the lines. Valentin's quest for a mother ends more than satisfying and even when his destiny seems to be unclear his omniscient narration leads the audience to understand that things will be better for him. After all... is not an astronaut he can very well become a writer and that writer is Agresti himself. And that has to account for something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Valentn is a young boy living in the city of Buenos Aires Argentina with his grandmother in a very simple home. Throughout the movie we follow Valentn's life and go through all the struggles he goes through whilst being in the middle of a broken family whom he wishes could reunite and treat him right. The story is one of rich Argentine tradition and tremendous personality. What I mean to say is that the different aspects of life in Argentina during the 60s when the story took place are quite accurate and very well displayed. Moreover being that Agresti was telling a story about his childhood he was able to create a very personable story which speaks a large sum to the audience about a boy's day to day life back then. The character of Valentn that he created is an incredibly enjoyable one who uses verbiage which is normally used by adults and who thinks about things which no child should be thinking about. At the same time however the child is wrapped up in the idea of being an astronaut which shows he is very much still a child at heart. This wonderful story is told through a very simple plot and has no need for extravagant Hollywood techniques as its simplicity makes it so much more personable clever and enjoyable.".

	onyx:emotionText "Valentn is a young boy living in the city of Buenos Aires Argentina with his grandmother in a very simple home. Throughout the movie we follow Valentn's life and go through all the struggles he goes through whilst being in the middle of a broken family whom he wishes could reunite and treat him right. The story is one of rich Argentine tradition and tremendous personality. What I mean to say is that the different aspects of life in Argentina during the 60s when the story took place are quite accurate and very well displayed. Moreover being that Agresti was telling a story about his childhood he was able to create a very personable story which speaks a large sum to the audience about a boy's day to day life back then. The character of Valentn that he created is an incredibly enjoyable one who uses verbiage which is normally used by adults and who thinks about things which no child should be thinking about. At the same time however the child is wrapped up in the idea of being an astronaut which shows he is very much still a child at heart.

And like Eddie Valentin has a colorful mother figure a grandmother played by Carmen Maura. The American Eddie had Mrs. Livingston a Japanese American housekeeper to look after him. And while Valentin is given plenty of comic routines to perform  Laugh as Valentin explodes a television set! Grin as Valentin dresses up as an astronaut!  as we watch him try to cement his Dad's engagement to Leticia a new girlfriend played by the gorgeous Julieta Cardinali this movie isn't the heartwarming comedy the trailer promises. So be prepared for some dark moments as you watch Valentin fulfill his promise as a matchmaker.Nonetheless this movie has its appeal especially I imagine for Argentines who were children in 1969 Buenos Aires where the story is set. In fact the city often looks well just plain cute as spotless vintage cars glide in and out of the background while actors dressed in the styles of the period go about their jobs.Watching the charming and nostalgic Valentin it's no wonder that director Agresti says in an interview on the movie's DVD that many Argentines of a certain age  especially given the troubled times that befell the country in the 1970s and 1980s  consider 1969 the country's last good year. 710".

All the characters are well developed and realized and the actors portray them very well. The movie is an original and clever take on the usual romantic comedy. Due to Evan's vocation it is quite dark. I think 'black romantic comedy' defines its genre well.

The film stars Wes Bentley ironically Haley shot the famous videotape of the plastic bag that Bentley shows to Thora Birch in American Beauty as Evan who is a professional author of suicide notes. He meets with his clients gets a sense of what they want then asks them to keep a journal of their thoughts for a few weeks after which Evan produces a poetic clientcustomized suicide note for the soontobedeparted. He has become so prolific that one of his clients won a national poetry prize for Evan's note the evermordant Evan is quick to add that the prize was of course awarded posthumously.Evan estimates that 30 of his clients actually kill themselves one who does is a young man named Matt Morris. When Evan attends Matt's funeralhe often attends the graveside service to evaluate the effect of his note on those in attendance Matt's sister Charlotte Winona Ryder follows him out of the service and asks him if he was a friend of her brother's. Evan lies that he went to Cornell with Matt and soon he and Charlotte are dating. Trouble ensues when Evan eats dinner at Charlotte's house with the whole surviving family firing questions at him.Meanwhile we meet Evan's newest client Abel an excellent Ray Romano an acerbic misanthrope with a death wish. They develop an unlikely bond and there are some extremely touching and hilarious exchanges between the two as they work on Abel's farewell in one such conversation Abel encouraging Evan to pursue Charlotte tells him to buy her a puppy Girls love puppies. They're like heroin with fur!.Things get complicated between Evan and Charlotte as he has must go to increasingly absurd lengths to conceal his true occupation and the real reason that he knew her brother. I won't reveal any more of the plot because this is a ride truly to be enjoyed by the moviegoer.Bentley fulfills the promise he showed in American Beauty. He manages to imbue his characteristic monotone and piercing gaze with enough hints of emotion to reveal the depths of grief churning below his icy surface. Romano shows surprising dramatic range while retaining his trademark wit it will be interesting to see if he continues to try to stretch his acting range. On a side note he admitted in the postfilm QA that his psychiatrist reads the script before Romano will commit to any project. Ryder is the only weak link here. She does a competent job her doe eyes signaling the hurt over her brother's death that is only worsened by Evan's seeming callousness but her acting doesn't rise to the level of her co stars. Thankfully it is really Bentley and Romano's film and they make the most of it.This is an astounding first feature from Haley who wrote the screenplay in his trailer during breaks while lensing the final season of Six Feet Under. Although he hasn't yet struck a distribution deal potential buyers in yesterday's audience could not ignore the thunderous ovation that met the closing credits. Go see this one when it comes out in a theater near you which it will. You won't be disappointed.".

Although he hasn't yet struck a distribution deal potential buyers in yesterday's audience could not ignore the thunderous ovation that met the closing credits. Go see this one when it comes out in a theater near you which it will. You won't be disappointed.";

It was casted well as for I believe it was well acted. I cant really complain about much in this one.Romano lends himself to a great comedic supporting role to liven up the dark portrayal of the lead character equating to a great balance in the movie.The ending was definitely fitting and made the movie end on a rather positive note considering the movie takes you on a darker walk through out it was nice to see things summed up the way they were.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Last Word'2008 starring my mate Winnie and one Wes Bentley of 'American Beauty' fame I read the description on IMDb.com it went a little something actually exactly like thisA man Bentley who makes his living composing other people's suicide notes enters into a romance with the sister Ryder of a recent client. Hmmmm I thought!I added it to my favourites so that I could go back and watch should the mood take me anyway it did I've just watched it and now I'm writing this.Bentley plays Evan I must say that this was the first thing i've enjoyed seeing Wes Bentley in since 'American Beauty'. Probably because his character in this movie is pretty much an older Ricky Fitz! Evan is a loner poetically deep interesting and intriguing Had an abusive father Yaddayaddayadda.Evan writes suicide notes hence the title 'The Last Word' for clients who've contacted him through his website. One of Evan's current clients is a guy called Abel played by 'Everyone Love's Raymond's Ray Romano. I've never seen Ray Romano play any other character before and I really enjoyed his performance in this film. Abel's friendship with Evan grows during Evan's developing relationship with Ryder's character Charlotte.I never knew this movie existed before this weekend and everything in it is subtle and yet achieves maximum impact.'The Last Word' is unpredictable funny honest and sad. Well it's not very sad per say considering it's main theme is death! But for a piece which walks hand in hand with suicide it is actually quite light yet not at all offensive or disrespectful. It follows Evan's story and it has a happy ending. It's the type of film that I don't plan to watch again but probably will do and probably more than once.In my opinion this movie is a wee gem. It's strangely beautiful a bit like that carrier bag blowing in the wind! I recommend it.I even feel a need to make a shout out to the guy who wrote and directed this movie his name is Geoffrey Haley. He has two writing credits to his name one short film and this one being his only feature film. His greatest plethora of work takes place within the camera and electrical department if you check out his film credentials on IMDb he has over 80 for camera and electrical steadicam operations being his apparent forte. You will no doubt recognise a lot of the films Haley has worked on one of which was 'American Beauty'Swings and roundabouts folks. Swings and roundabouts.".

	schema:headline " Winona Ryder is good but she's smothered by a writerdirector who appears to be morally retarded";
	schema:reviewBody "This film takes one good character one good performance and some vaguely amusing banter and buries it under an avalanche of moral obtuseness male wish fulfillment and bizarrely incompetent writing. Writerdirector Geoffrey Haley somehow came up with an outlandish premise that was rich in potential for dark comedy and satire but demonstrates in the making of this movie that he didn't have the emotional or intellectual depth to do a damn thing with it.Evan Wes Bentley is a young writer in Los Angeles who makes a living writing for a particular sort of special occasion. He composes suicide notes for other people. People contact Evan through his website he learns about their lives and then composes beautifully poetic final messages for them. Only about 30 of Evan's clients actually off themselves but that's besides the point. This is a morally reprehensible thing to do. It's inviting people at the lowest point in their lives to come to you and then treating them with something worse than indifference. It's not just standing on the shore and watching someone else drown. It's standing on the shore watching someone else drown and yelling out as they go under for the third time Is there anything you want me to tell your mom after you're gone?It's a horrible act and Evan is completely oblivious to how horrible it is which makes him an even more horrible personbut that's okay. A person with such a stunted and disconnected nature could be a very interesting character. The problem is that the story is oblivious to the awfulness of Evan's actions. There's not a moment in this film where there's any sense given that there's anything wrong with what Evan is doing except that other people might disapprove. Not only is that offensive but such profound moral ignorance is boring.The stuff that happens to Evan starts when he attends the funeral of one of his clients to hear if the suicide note is read aloud so Evan can critique his own work. His dead client's sister Charlotte Winona Ryder notices him and here's where the male wish fulfillment comes in. Evan is dull as dishwater lacking in any social graces and seems not just disinterested but annoyed at Charlotte's attention. Yet this lovely sexy smart and vulnerable woman continues to throw herself at Evan until he deigns to have sex with her and become her boyfriend. It's every lonely nerd's ultimate fantasy. A hot chick falls in love with him and he doesn't even have to alter his pathetic personality.What's especially frustrating is that Charlotte is a very well written character and Winona Ryder does a fine acting job. There's a dramatic and emotional integrity to Charlotte. She's not just a pawn that gets moved around the plot to service Evan's story. She has reasons for what she does she's aware of those reasons but she's not controlled by them. There are several points in the movie where Charlotte does the exact opposite of what you usually see from the girlfriend role and it's a little thrilling when it happens. For her part Ryder is more than up to the demands of this role. She really captures the uneasy swirl of strength and weakness confidence and desperation selfawareness and selfdeception a woman would have to have to be attracted to a guy like Evan. It also helps a lot that Ryder's physical attractiveness here as a grown woman equals all of the sublime cuteness of her youth.There's also a few laughs to be hand from the interaction of Evan and Abel Ray Romano a misanthropic client who insists on hanging out and talking with Evan like they were friends. Abel's not much more than a collection of funny lines of dialog and again there's no lesson or real point to their relationship because the story persists in denying the appalling essence of what Evan is doing for Abel.You can probably guess that Charlotte eventually learns that Evan wrote her brother's suicide note imperiling their relationship and that easytopredict point is where the film implodes from the pressure of fundamentally flawed writing. After Charlotte finds out what he did and is rightfully repulsed Evan tries to redeem himself to her and the audience by explaining that her brother had advanced cancer was in serious pain and only wanted to be at peace. That's supposed to at least partly ennoble Evan in the eyes of Charlotte and the viewer. It doesn't do that at all for two very simple reasons.1. Evan spends their entire relationship lying to Charlotte. So when he says Charlotte's brother had cancer the first reaction from both Charlotte and the audience should be that it's just another lie. That very logical and reasonable response clearly never occurred to writerdirector Geoffrey Haley. Not only does Charlotte never question it but Haley never offers up any evidence to her or the audience that Evan is telling the truth. 2. If Evan is telling the truth it only magnifies what a disgusting person he is. In the story Charlotte is really torn up over her brother's death. Yet even though Evan is confronted with the human trauma enabled by his passive acquiescence to suicide he still doesn't realize the horror that he's part of. Evan and obviously Haley thinks that because Charlotte's brother killed himself for a supposedly good reason it somehow justifies what Evan does.I don't know what to make of this film. One aspect of it is very good but the rest of it is so bad that I can't really believe that one filmmaker is responsible for it all. It's like trying to comprehend how George Lucas could create both Darth Vader and Jar Jar Binks. Tragically The Last Word is mostly Jar Jarand does anyone need to be told not to watch more Jar Jar?".

Charlotte is comparatively unsophisticated and like Winona she thinks a good date is one that doesn't try to steal my credit card. One of my several LOL moments. In one early scene at a diner she has on no makeup or jewelry then in the next scene she is driving Evan home from said diner and has on her painted face as well as wearing pearls...something she wears later on in the film...Geoffrey Haleyanother Ed Wood academy graduate. Here's your card.While Evan is trying to keep things a secret he is aiding other clients which raises Charlotte's curiosity level. You wait for the climax scene when he confesses everything to her.

	schema:reviewBody "Caution spoilers ahead. This is a spoilered review so be warned.The film starts out as original even bold. The character of Evan is very well fleshed and sympathetic at least from my standpoint. The premise is quite believable with a certain slightly decadentslightly postmodern charm and definite intelligence.However once the drama begins to unfold the movie's charm slips away while the gaping maw of Hollywood threadbare romantic morality looms into view. And promptly eats the main character.As it turns out writing beautiful poetry or prose for someone's grand exit out of life is a shameful sin. Only depressed people with the obligatory abused childhood may contemplate doing this for a living. And that these people must be punished and corrected in their ways.Charlotte Winona Ryder was deeply estranged from her brother they haven't seen each other or talked for a long time and she wasn't there for him when he chose to commit suicide. On his funeral she spots Evan the professional death note writer accomplished too  as we're told one of his notes won a writing award and chases him relentlessly ignoring his uncertainty and basically throwing herself at him. When Evan finally submits to her charms after having been cornered on a roof no less the situation changes dramatically. Evan eventually becomes truly enamored with Charlotta while she begins to demand total knowledge of his life. Out of completely misplaced chivalry the usual plothole of Hollywood romances and a definite hint at the travesties to come Evan chooses to hide his occupation in pointless hopes of avoiding the very questionable risk of causing psychological discomfort to his lover.Needless to say Charlotte finds out and of course like in all those Bgrade lowbrow romances she immediately throws her love towards Evan overboard under the double pretext of deceiving her and being a soulless jerk who dares to ornament people's deaths in beautiful poetry. At this point one might wonder why the work of the common undertaker or grave monument sculptor is not being so stigmatised but someone writing death notes should be perceived as a deviant. Moreover history knows plenty of brilliant poets that were obsessed with death to a certain degree Poe Baudelaire and Rimbaud to name but a few and no one dares to label them soulless or uncaring.The crushed Evan is not allowed such blasphemous thoughts however. After a pathetic encounter with a mugger where Evan's emasculation is finalised he cries like a child and says his sorry for hitting the mugger back after the bastard pistolwhipped him he dutifully abandons writing leaves town and engages in a pointless stupid Ludditelike business of letting raging morons throw electronic equipment that baffles their tiny minds off a cliff while filming this ordeal. This final scene may very well be seen as a metacomment on the movie itself which abandons an intelligent and promising premise in favor of filming the pointless rage of a moronic woman and the damage it caused to a sophisticated piece of equipment that was the protagonist.All in all while amusing from an academic standpoint it was really sad to watch. It sends a deeply flawed message. This movie and others like it have a lot in common with older male chauvinist taming of the shrew scenarios only with the roles reversed. It's quite shocking in this day and age to see such primal degenerate values at work. I feel particularly sad for Winona's participation as in the past she played characters similar to Evan but from a female perspective and usually managed to maintain the integrity of these characters. Too bad she didn't recognise this movie for what it really is  a lowgrade romance replete with false morals masquerading as something thoughtful and stylish.However once you realise all this you can appreciate the movie from a different angle  that of Fatum in the hands of moralising authors against the protagonist struggling to maintain his integrity. Like any Greek tragedy this one ends tragically. I gave this movie an 8 due to the following 1 good premise 2 Wes Bentley is very good as Evan 3 the movie may be appreciated on a different philosophical level once you come to grips with its skewed morality 4 babyscaring therapy was hilarious 5 I adore Winona Ryder. If you have any comments on this review feel free to check out the message board where I've posted a more erratic  angry version for discussion.".

If you are one of those usual moviegoers that like to see the same boring subject regurgitated repeatedly by Hollywood don't watch this you are too boring to get it. The screenplay is brilliant. Wes Bentley's performance . . . WhaT?!!! Who is this guy? I could feel his isolated closed down personality and how uncomfortable he was in his own skin with himself and others. Haley wrote and directed this! What a performance he got out of Winona and Romano. Yes of course acting has a lot to do with that but the script is . . . WoW!The ending just blew me away. Now I am on my way to seek other works of Haley and Bentley. When watching this movie I was actually thinking That would be a great business to start. Yeah I know I am a little more twisted than the average moviegoer. I have recommended this movie to my family and friends because they are interesting and so am I.Was this nominated for a Spirit Award? If it wasn't they suck.It's now July 26 2013 . . . wow I've been away a long time. I just found this movie for sale at Blockbuster new and inexpensive since Blockbuster will soon be out of business. I don't think I like all of the movie stores Hollywood Video Blockbuster closing down.".

If you are one of those usual moviegoers that like to see the same boring subject regurgitated repeatedly by Hollywood don't watch this you are too boring to get it. The screenplay is brilliant. Wes Bentley's performance . . . WhaT?!!! Who is this guy? I could feel his isolated closed down personality and how uncomfortable he was in his own skin with himself and others. Haley wrote and directed this! What a performance he got out of Winona and Romano. Yes of course acting has a lot to do with that but the script is . . . WoW!The ending just blew me away. Now I am on my way to seek other works of Haley and Bentley. When watching this movie I was actually thinking That would be a great business to start. Yeah I know I am a little more twisted than the average moviegoer. I have recommended this movie to my family and friends because they are interesting and so am I.Was this nominated for a Spirit Award? If it wasn't they suck.It's now July 26 2013 . . . wow I've been away a long time. I just found this movie for sale at Blockbuster new and inexpensive since Blockbuster will soon be out of business. I don't think I like all of the movie stores Hollywood Video Blockbuster closing down.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wes Bentley is Evan. When he meets people and they ask him what he does he tells them he writes for special occasions. Mainly those special occasions are the suicide notes his clients plan to leave behind. These are not just small notes they are elegant poems composed especially for the client and to reflect his or her life and the reasons for ending it. In one funny comment Evan notes that one particular client received an award for his poem ... posthumously.Winona Ryder is Charlotte the sister of one of Evan's clients. During the weeks leading up to the suicide when Evan met with him to develop the thrust of the final poem he gave Evan a photo of him and his sister. Evan thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and does at the funeral service.So far so good but what happens next kind of lost me because it didn't seem reasonable. Evan's personality is flat and uncommunicative but for some reason Charlotte pursues him. Then she takes him to a LA area lounge for drinking and dancing something he absolutely found no fun it. But she keeps pursuing him until they become a number.The third key character is Ray Romano as Abel who composes music for backgrounds like when you are on hold on a phone call and you hear music in the background.Anyway this is a quirky and often funny movie but funny in a subtle way. I like Wes Bently going back to his Ricky character in 'American Beauty.' Ryder I can take her or leave her. When I see her I think of the messed up shoplifter of a few years ago.The movie would have no value if that's all there was but through their interactions the three main characters all learn new things about themselves and grow.".

It just might be that a movie simply comes along at the right point in our lives and interlocks with events in it. I certainly have a number of movies among my favorites that fit into this category and I have a feeling that Jeff Who lives at Home might have been admitted to it.Although it is billed as a comedy and there are certainly comic elements to it there is a more serious component that underlies it and gives it some depth. Jason Segel plays a slacker who at the age of 30 has few prospects and living at home at 30 seems to be the modern stereotype of a loser. Jeff clings to the idea that some 'sign' will appear to show him the way. In fact he is viewed as nothing but a loser by his mother brother and just about everyone else. When someone mistakenly calls his number asking for Kevin Jeff seeing this as the sign he's been waiting for begins his search for his role in the universe brushing aside all ridicule in the process.I like movies that show how small apparently insignificant choices can lead to life changing events. I also like movies in which a character is redeemed by adhering to principles that everyone else thinks are insane. In its own subtle way the movie questions many of the basic premises that underlie modern society. Yeah I know maybe I'm reading too much into this but I suppose that's why we all like certain movies that others don't.You're not going to get a better guy to play a slackerloser than Segel. The other actors hold up their roles well. I admit that I expected little of this movie but I found it engaging right from the opening scene.

What starts as a simple trip to a hardware store begins to evolve and change the lives of everyone Jeff comes into contact with including his brother Pat Helms.

While this did have some funny parts in it I found this movie to be more sweet and heartfelt then I expected. Some of the aspects of the movie are very serious but they are done in a way that tone it down. Segel is just about the perfect choice for this role because there is just something about him that you find disarming and comfortable no matter what he is doing. If you are looking for a typical Segel comedy this is not it. This one has more substance and heart and is very much worth watching. Overall if you liked Everything Must Go then this movie is for you. I recommend this but this is again not your average comedy. I give it a B.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeff Who Lives at Home starts out by referencing a film from 10 years ago. The main character Jeff speaks about his love for the movie Signs. That movie was all about signs being sent to us and that we must use those signs as guides for living our lives. This becomes Jeff's mantra for how he lives his life. These signs haven't been getting him anywhere as of yet though. He's a grownup slacker who still lives at home with his mother as the title of the film says. It's this bohemian freespirited attitude that has led him to where he is. He seems at peace with things yet something is missing from his life. His brother Pat is the opposite. He's married has a job and even just bought a new Porsche he doesn't believe in slacking off like Jeff. That doesn't mean everything is going well for him though. He really didn't have the money to comfortably afford the Porsche and you can tell that his wife isn't happy about it. But Pat lives in the moment. While showing off the Porsche to Jeff they see his wife with another man and start to suspect she's having an affair. Even though these two brothers don't generally get along and seem to despise each other a little Jeff agrees to help Pat out and find out what's going on. Along the way they begin to learn about each other and their different ways of approaching things. Pat always thought he had his life together and looked down on Jeff. Now's he realizing that maybe Jeff had a better way of looking at things. Jason Segel and Ed Helms play the 2 brothers and make the best of their roles. There's also an interesting subplot about what's going on with their mother Susan Sarandon at her job. The movie is part of a recent genre of film called mumblecore which generally have low budgets and focus more on the dialogue  sort of like a Quentin Tarantino film without the action. Luckily the dialogue here is very good and holds your interest throughout. At less than an hour and half which is very rare nowadays it doesn't meander at all. It focuses on how we spend our days and seems to have a message of living more carefree. But there are plenty of laughs throughout the film which make it very enjoyable.".

And the cast and chemistry is well shown as Jeff Who Lives at Home features veteran Susan Sarandon and up and coming stars Ed Helms and Jason Segel and the work of all blend well into a good picture.Set in Louisiana it follows the life one day of Jeff a 30 year old live at home slacker stoner who doesn't have a job and beat it all he lives like the crypt keeper as he stays in the basement! The only thing keeping him going is his stash and TV watching and thinking about the world in the strangest ways only this slightly changes some when he meets up with his cocky and business type older brother PatEd Helmsand Pat now suspects that wife LindaJudy Greeris having an affair.

	schema:reviewBody "I pretty much knew I was going to dig JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME right from the first scene where Jeff sits on the toilet and waxes poetically into a taperecorder about his undying love for the movie SIGNS. I tend to like the Duplass Brothers who wrote and directed so I guess this wasn't a hard sell.At first glance JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME seems like a bit of a minor film with it running a scant eightyminutes and taking course over a single day. Heck for ninetypercent of the movie it was a minor work and while I liked it it still felt like a bit of a disappointment on the heels of CYRUS which was one of my favorite films from last year. The film works mostly due to Jason Segel who's affecting as the eternally optimistic Jeff. In another actor's hands Jeff could have been insufferable but Segel brings a sweetness to the part that meshes well with the Duplass Brother's bighearted humanist philosophy.Like CYRUS this owes a lot to the Duplass Bros. mumblecore origins with it seemingly shot on lowergrade digital possibly handheld cameras just like CYRUS. Some of the dialogue also seems to be improvised with the exchanges between Segel and Ed Helms who seems to be playing Andy Bernard with a goatee here no complaints having a natural unscripted feel. The film also has a very nice score by Michael Andrews heavily reminiscent of his excellent soundtrack for Miranda July's ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW the release of which remains the last time I bought a physical CD.In terms of laughs yeah JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME is funny but in a genteel sort of way. You'll never double over in laughter but the whole thing feels pleasant and at eighty minutes goes down pretty smooth. Now I said that for ninetypercent of the running time this felt minor. The last twenty minutes or so throw the audience a bit of a curveball with Jeff's idea of destiny having a surprisingly dramatic payoff that pushed the film into territory I wasn't expecting. However this switch isn't jarring and works to the film's advantage give it a uniqueness I wasn't anticipating.There's also an interesting subplot involving Jeff and Pat's mom played by Susan Sarandon as she interacts with an office coworker Rae Dawn Chong of COMMANDO!!! and deals with a secret admirer which pays off in a fun heartwarming way that again makes the film a little different but in a good way.All told JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME isn't quite as good as CYRUS but it's a unique pleasant comedy that once again proves that the Duplass Brothers. might be on to something with the way their films seem to simultaneously aim at the heart AND the funny bone.".

And it just so happens to be the one day in the life of Jeff in Paramount Pictures Jeff Who Lives at Home who reconnects with his family on a human level on the same day.Jeff is a character whom his family consisting of his mother Sharon Susan Sarandon and brother Pat passes off as an underachiever to the extreme. Jeff lives in his mother's basement where the majority of his days are spent eating smoking weed and watching infomercials like the incredible vitamin and consistently searching for a sign to something greater to his seemingly detached existence. Jeff becomes obsessed for his signs of something greater after watching the alien invasion film Signs starring Mel Gibson Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.When Jeff gets an arbitrary sign through a phone call it puts his world into an unexplainable focus to reaching his destiny while fightingoff the negative reactions from his brother and mother. The end result is a new view of Jeff as someone who is fearless and open to seeing the world as it really is and not just as a spectator passing through it.The signs may hold coincidence in Jeff's life but for many they are always there. Just few are able to see them. Jeff Who Lives at Home is a meaningful story about what happens when you open yourself up to the unexpected and what you might gain by putting yourself in a vulnerable position. All too much is needlessly lost due to fear of consequences and what others might think. This life is your own and it IS what you make of it is the underlying message of the film.Jeff Who Lives at Home is written and directed by brothers Jay and Mark Duplass. Their past films include shorts and a documentary called Kevin. During a press conference the duo talked about their unique way of making this film. They said that they fully lit each scene before the actors stepped onto the set. After that the actors were free to improvise and playout the scenes with each other. Mark stated that there were no rehearsals on the film. We don't believe in the rehearsal process in this instance because you might lose something that you don't get on film. Mark also said that once the camera is rolling they don't like to stop because you lose the moment.The movie was filmed in New Orleans but the story takes place in Baton Rouge. Jeff's bravery rubs off on Sharon and Pat. Directors said that Jeff is a character that really sacrificed a lot by not getting a regular 9 to 5 job and getting married. He is holding out for that grander that he knows he is meant for said Duplass. This is something that is admirable and most people secretly wish that they could do according to film makers.Jeff Who Lives at Home opens in limited theaters on Friday March 16 2012.www.HollywoodJunket.com".

One day while she is at work Sharon asks Jeff to go to the shop to pick up some wood glue. Convinced that the name Kevin is some sort of sign he ill advisedly follows various Kevins' around the city bumping into his brother along the way.To me the film was like a cross between a Wes Anderson film and The Office. It has the odd quirky indie charm of an Anderson picture but the awkward humour and filming style of The Office. Unfortunately it was neither as good as any Wes Anderson film I've seen nor The Office. At times it was quite funny but these moments were usually fleeting and there weren't many of them. The story was reasonably interesting and the film had a sweet ending but it just didn't mesh together. The whole 'the Universe will show me the way' nonsense was really annoying and although the ending was very sweet it was obvious and annoyed me.The film is reminiscent of the Duplass brother's last film Cyrus which I really liked. You get the feeling that both films inhabit the same world. That film was quirky funny and sad and these are all things which this film sets out to be. In the end it slightly misses the target on each occasion. The acting is really great but the characters were pretty forgettable. I'll still keep an eye out for the director's future work but this film didn't move me in the way it was meant to. Also we all live at home! www.attheback.blogspot.com".

The Duplass mumblecore beginnings often used familial relationships to find those moments of discomfort and comedy. Their latest movie brings all of that together as they examine multiple relationships within a family and the possible role of destiny.Jeff Jason Segel is an unemployed 30 year old childlike pothead who lives in his mother's Susan Sarandon basement and watches the M Night Shyamalan movie Signs so often that he is convinced there are no wrong numbers in life ... everything is a sign leading us to our destiny. After the latest sign phone call for an unknown Kevin Jeff heads out to complete a simple task for his disenchanted mother. He gets sidetracked on his quest for Kevin and stumbles into his brother Pat Ed Helms.By this time we have seen Pat interact over breakfast with his wife Linda Judy Greer. Note to guys serving breakfast to your wife will not neutralize your surprise purchase of a Porsche. These two people have clearly lost whatever bond they once shared. One thing leads to another and we are soon watching Jeff and Pat stalk Linda and her male lunch friend ... or is he more? While this amateur detective work is playing out Sharon their mother discovers she has a secret admirer at work. Her spirits are immediately lifted as she has pretty much given up on a personal life since the death of her husband years ago. Her friend Carol Rae Dawn Chong helps her be receptive to the idea and this story line provides a nice Duplass twist.Despite the fact that none of the characters are extremely likable Jeff is borderline goofy Pat is kind of an ass Sharon just seems frustrated ... the story moves along so that each of them grows a bit and their relationships evolve. The ending is a perfect cap and provides meaning though initially quite a shock to the system after first threequarters.The Duplass directing style utilizes microbursts of quick zoom in many scenes giving this a quasi homemovie feel at times. As for the acting I can't imagine another actor than Jason Segel could have pulled off the role of Jeff. In lesser hands he would have come off as mentally unstable or just a total loser. Segel's sweetness pays off. It's always great to see Rae Dawn Chong back on screen and I didn't even hate Susan Sarandon! Judy Greer's scene in the hotel room is so well played it's a reminder of what a terrific and underutilized actress she is. Don't expect a laugh outloud comedy as this is more drama than comedy though the smiles and chuckles occur in the moment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some people have a theory that there is no such thing as coincidence that everything that happens in life happens for one reason or another. Maintaining that state of mind I would imagine requires constant frustrating vigilance. You're always on the lookout for what connects one thing to another.Jeff Jason Segal the protagonist of Jeff Who Lives at Home thinks that way. He has plenty of time. He is just past 30 unemployed lives in his mother's basement smokes pot and hasn't had a girlfriend since high school. He watches the 2002 thriller Signs over and over again to reiterate his theory that nothing just happens not even when he gets a phone call from a guy asking for someone named Kevin. Out on an errand for his mother Jeff spots a guy with the name Kevin on the back of his jersey and follows him. It doesn't go well.Jeff has a brother Pat who is even more clueless. He is floating through a marriage to Linda Judy Greer that is going nowhere in particular. She wants to save money for a house but he spends it on expensive things like the Porsche he just bought because it was such a great deal. He makes her breakfast to break the news of his purchase and her response is to dump her breakfast on the hood.After Jeff's unfortunate runin with Kevin he runs into Pat though not by coincidence and the two spot Linda getting into a car with another man. Thus sets off a day of freewheeling misadventures as they try to uncover the mystery of whether or not she is cheating on him. Pat is angry and wants to know who the mystery man is while Jeff's eye is constantly following the signs to find out the meaning of Kevin. No points for guessing that this will eventually lead to something.Meanwhile Pat and Jeff's widowed mother Sharon Susan Sarandon works in an office cubicle and begins receiving instant messages from a secret admirer. The messages are sweet and clever and she becomes intrigued. Discovering the identity of the mystery person isn't that difficult. All you have to do is to follow the economy of characters in that office and you'll figure it out long before it is revealed.These three elements Jeff's search for Kevin Pat and Linda's marriage and Sharon's secret admirer lead up to a scene that brings them all together at the same place at the same time. Cosmically there is a reason to this so that all the characters can have closure to their individual problems. Although the revelation doesn't have as much meaning as we might hope. It is interesting how the movie gets the characters to that spot but that's about it.There are two scenes in the movie that work perfectly first is the scene when Pat finally confronts Linda about the other man. They have an argument that is full of truth and really seems to come out of reality. The other is the discovery of Sharon's secret admirer. What comes of it is briefly touching but the movie moves past it so quickly that it feels like a loose end.Jeff Who Lives at Home is a nice sweet movie of no real significance. It is appropriately funny when it needs to be dramatic when it needs to be and moving when the need arises. The disappointment is that it doesn't really go over the top with any of those things. I like it when a movie really reaches for something but this movie climbs to the peak and reveals nothing surprising on the other side. I enjoyed the movie while I was watching it but it isn't one that I am going to carry with me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with the Duplass brothers' 2012 movie can be summed up in one word boring. It is just so unapologetically boring. Combine that with the fact that I just didn't care about any of the characters and this movie doesn't come close to being as enjoyable as their movie CYRUS. That film was quirky and fun this one tries to be but falls way short. I can't blame it on the cast because I can see they tried. I just couldn't force myself to care about the story it just wanders on and expects us to believe in coincidence so much that we don't care that the whole movie is just these two characters bumbling their way from set piece to set piece. The Jeff from the movie's title is played by Jason Segal a thirtyyearold stoner who continues to live in his mother's basement watching the movie SIGNS over and over again. He is a firm believer that M. Night Shyamalan was on to something and that everything happens for a reason. In fact he believes it so strongly that he can't even make basic decisions without some random event influencing his decision. His brother Pat Ed Helms is in a deteriorating marriage and his mother Sharon Susan Sarandon suffers a menial office job while pressing her stonedout son to find the motivation to move on with his life. A wrong number phone call spurs Jeff into action sending him on a journey to find the supposed meaning.I guess the characters in the movie were somewhat relatable. They just weren't very likable. Jeff is an idiot. I know we're supposed to be charmed by his naivety and neverending faith in the universe's ability to lead him in the right direction but he came off to me as just a grown manchild who's smoked a little too much and can't take responsibility for his own life. Pat is a selfish wannabe hotshot awkward with his employees and neglectful of his own wife. And then there's Sharon Jeff's disillusion mother and her soulcrushing job. I understand how she can be so disappointed in her son and I expect that we'll see him change her mind in one way or another over the course of the movie but I don't understand why she needed her own entire subplot about how disappointed she is with her life and how an anonymous office admirer is spicing it up. I was having a hard enough time caring about anything going on in the JeffPat plot without constantly cutting away to see Sharon flirting via instant message in an unrelated love story. Honestly though the lamest aspect of the whole film is the concept as a whole a stoner obsessed with a flawed Shyamalan movie wanders from place to place miraculously finding himself at the right place at the right time. It's all about Kevin. Got to find Kevin. Wait now it's time to help Pat save his crumbling marriage.I'll give the cast credit. They're all very talented people and they're all trying to do something here. I guess they saw how well CYRUS came out and they wanted to be a part of a quirky indie film too. Jason Segal is great and Ed Helms appears genuinely clueless about how he's damaging his marriage. Susan Sarandon does an excellent job even if her character was more prevalent that she needed to be. Each of them are great actors in their own right but the material is just lame. The whole thing is just too quirky. It felt as if they were shooting to make the most stereotypical indie film they could loaded with kitsch and snap zooms. It was a bizarre combination of forced and meaningless. For whatever reason the handheld shakycam technique and constant zooms weren't so blatant in CYRUS but JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME shoves your face into the nonaction. I'm not ready to give up on the Duplass brothers yet. I haven't seen their earlier films but right now they seem hit or miss and I'm sure they'll have some more quality work in the future. This movie isn't beyond salvage but it's boring. And for a medium meant to entertain it can be just as bad.".

	schema:headline " Pleasant Character Study with Fine Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Jeff Who Lives at Home 2011  out of 4 Pleasant comedydrama about slacker Jeff Jason Segel a thirtyyearold who still lives in his mother's basement because he keeps thinking signs will show him his destiny. One day he believes he's following one of those signs and he ends up spending time with his brother Ed Helms who believes his wife Judy Greer is cheating on him. JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME isn't the flatout comedy that the trailers want you to believe and at times I was a little surprised to see how serious it was getting. With that said the screenplay really doesn't go for either laughs or drama as its main goal and instead it really just seems like a slice of life tale centered on a few hours in these brother's lives. I think what the film does the best is offer up some very good performances from the leads. Segel is completely believable in his role as the pothead trying to figure out his meaning in life. I thought the actor played the stoner bit extremely well but even more impressive was the way he was able to play the dramatic moments because this is where you feel for the character. Helms plays the same type of role that he often does and that's the jerk who needs to realize who he really is. Segel and Helms really do come across like real brothers and this certainly helps the film. Greer easily steals the movie as the wife and Susan Sarandon does a very good job in the role of the mother. Even Rae Dawn Chong does a good job in her bit. The one thing that really bothered me about the movie was its look and especially some annoying small zoom shots. These little zooms happen throughout the film and I'm really not sure why but they got quite annoying after a while. Still the performances are what make the film and they're good enough to where the film just comes off very pleasant and entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "And the truth is that this is a good film.  It's a very atypical film as were all of Elvis' last few scripted movies in one way or another. Actually it's a somewhat weird film and probably the most unusual that Elvis did in terms of being 'out there' a way.  It wasn't even released in the UK  if so it's a pity because people who'd finally grown tired of the '60s musicals might have found redeeming value in this one. Here we have Elvis playing an adult for one of the few times in his career complete with more coarse language than he'd been given before a lot more innuendo and even a bedsharing with his female costar.  It's an interesting piece and one that was largely missed by many as Elvis' '60s film formula began to lose its successful appeal around the time of Easy Come Easy Go Clambake and Speedway.  Elvis himself was probably more interested by this point in projects more dear to him  the legendary 1968 television special  announced a couple of months before shooting began on this movie was shot three months after this film.  He'd also recently returned to the studio with new vigor to produce some excellent nonsoundtrack songs .  Still he does a great job in his role as a news and fashion photographer and manages to squeeze in a great knockdown dragout fight with a couple of men played by bodyguards Red and Sonny West twothirds of the 'insiders' who contributed to a 1977 tellall book that broke the dying king's heart...nice to see them belted around actually. He even decks Dick Sargent the 'second Darrin' from Bewitched.  It was probably a toss up whether Elvis enjoyed the fight scene or his wild driving more.The movie's pacing leaves something to be desired especially during the second half and it could definitely have been much better  kind of a recurring refrain for almost all of Elvis' post1967 movies.  It's not the most exciting story but Elvis is great  he looks supercool he runs through a fair few emotions quite convincingly and he's generally one groovy cat.  Michele Carey is supremely sexy but her character is tremendously annoying.  I don't know what kind of mental problems she's supposed to have  she's portrayed as functionally if not actually a multiplepersonality type  but I suppose that some of her ephemeral nature and faroutness reflects the pop culture of the times.  As Elvis said Nuts.  Absolutely nuts.  She even feeds Elvis a pill that keeps him asleep for days.  Speaking of drug references whoever designed the Edge Of Reality dream sequence must have been on some interesting substances at the time.  Far out man.  Anyway Ms Carey's bodacious Bernice or whatever she wants to call herself gets on my nerves as it does on Elvis' Greg Nolan and as I suspect it would on just about anybody.  The problem is that it's to an extent that's detrimental to the film.  Maybe they could have toned her back a bit  she is good at the role though and also provides some comic relief albeit sometimes exasperating.  The chemistry between her and Elvis is spoton too.It's fun to see familiar Los Angeles landmarks even though I first came to that city almost 20 years after this film was shot.  Elvis spent a lot of time in L A and there's just something fundamentally weird for me about seeing him driving around the city that a couple of decades or so later I'd be tooling around.  Maybe coming to the US from another country helps emphasize that weirdness.  By the way Elvis' father is seen sitting at a table at the LA Music Center.  Speaking of family Albert the Great Dane is played by Elvis' dog Brutus Elvis had two Great Danes at the time  the other was Snoopy.  I must say that I find this amateur dog's acting very impressive.Among the human supporting cast are Don Porter as a Hugh Hefner type and Rudy Vallee.  Both are perfect in their roles and it's cool to see Elvis with Rudy Vallee the singing idol of an earlier generation.  Also of note is the girl who played the mermaid model Susan Henning who also showed up on the 1968 TV Special as an 'intimate' of Elvis' Guitar Man and who had a torrid reallife romance with him.  I think that one or two of the other models in this film showed up on Elvis' TV special too.All of Elvis' last few movies after Speedway filmed during the summer of 1967 featured fewer songs than most of those that had come before.  This film has only four songs  the happy Wonderful World somewhat ironic for the time just after the Tet Offensive and just before Martin Luther King's assassination the dramatic and overlooked Edge Of Reality the funky A Little Less Conversation and the loungesingerish Almost In Love. The impetus for me revisiting this film was that a remixed version of A Little Less Conversation has just  yesterday  topped the US pop charts 25 years after Elvis' death.  As I write Elvis has been 1 in the UK for a phenomenal three consecutive weeks maybe four by the time this is posted has spent three weeks on top of the Irish charts and spent at least a week or two so far at 1 in each of Japan Hong Kong Denmark Norway The Netherlands Australia Canada and Mexico.  He's currently Top5 Top10 Top20 and Top40 in a bunch of other countries around the world.  With the success of this single Elvis broke the tie that had him and the Beatles matched for British 1 hits  now he has 18 to his credit to their 17. Pretty amazing and particularly ironic that a fairly obscure '60s movie song was the one that did the trick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without the musical numbers of which no Elvis Presley film could be without Live A Little Love A Little plays more like one of those big screen Ross Hunter comedies that might have starred Rock Hudson. In fact the characters that Elvis and leading lady Michele Carey play bear no small resemblance to the ones played by Hudson and Paula Prentiss in one of my favorite of Hudson's comedies Man's Favorite Sport.A chance encounter at the beach with a very kookie girl played by Carey leaves Elvis's life in total chaos. He finds himself working two full time jobs as a photographer at the same time just to keep up with his new mode of upscale living. Of course in the end she tones it down a bit when she finds true love with the King.Of course since this is a Presley vehicle Live A Little Love A Little has to have a score. It has four numbers the best of which is the song sung right at the beginning called Wonderful World. It's a philosophical type number the kind Bing Crosby used to have a specialty of in his films. Sad to say that the King's time as film star was drawing to a close. Had this been done in the Fifties these songs might have yielded a Presley hit or two.As usual Colonel Tom Parker made sure that Elvis was given good support by some veteran familiar players. Next to Walt Disney Elvis Presley and his manager were the great employers of veteran movie faces who were finding it harder and harder to get work. Such folks as Dick Sargent Joan Shawlee Sterling Holloway are in the cast.Two more who play Elvis's rival employers who work in the same building are Don Porter and Rudy Vallee. Porter plays a Hugh Hefner type hedonist publisher of skin magazines and displays a certain avuncular charm.And Live A Little Love A Little gives fans a treat to see singing idols of two generation sharing the screen. It would have been great to see Rudy Vallee and the King do a number together but I suspect that the lack was by mutual consent. Vallee plays another variation on his conservative ad agency president from How To Succeed in Busines Without Really Trying.Though Elvis's vehicles were not up to what he was putting out earlier in his career Live A Little Love A Little is a nice bit of entertainment and the King's fans will love it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Without the musical numbers of which no Elvis Presley film could be without Live A Little Love A Little plays more like one of those big screen Ross Hunter comedies that might have starred Rock Hudson. In fact the characters that Elvis and leading lady Michele Carey play bear no small resemblance to the ones played by Hudson and Paula Prentiss in one of my favorite of Hudson's comedies Man's Favorite Sport.A chance encounter at the beach with a very kookie girl played by Carey leaves Elvis's life in total chaos. He finds himself working two full time jobs as a photographer at the same time just to keep up with his new mode of upscale living. Of course in the end she tones it down a bit when she finds true love with the King.Of course since this is a Presley vehicle Live A Little Love A Little has to have a score. It has four numbers the best of which is the song sung right at the beginning called Wonderful World. It's a philosophical type number the kind Bing Crosby used to have a specialty of in his films.

We need you back! and has an intriguing soundtrack which doesn't sound remotely like anything else Elvis ever recordedit even has a freakout sequence with the King singing a psychedelic song! I'm guessing that the creators of this film wanted to make a swinging sixties version of a screwball comedy and they almost succeeded. For the first half I thought I'd discovered a lost classic...or at least a lost camp classic! However about midway through the breakneck pace slows down the weirdness goes away and the rest of the film stumbles along like a mediocre sitcom. Still no one could accuse this oddity of being a formula film at least the first half. And this Elvis fan would much rather watch this or the equally quirky THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS than watch GI BLUES or BLUE HAWAII. TCM showed this letterboxed the way it should be seen so you might want to wait a year or two until a DVD comes out...or at least until TCM has another Elvis festival and shows the letterboxed version at 3 a.m...rather than watch it panned and scanned. I think that anyone with the least interest in Elvis would enjoy watching this film if only for the freakout sequence with the song Edge of Reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been an Elvis fan for 10 years now and I've seen most of his 60's movies. For some reason I didn't rent this one till recently I think it's because I had it confused with The Trouble With Girls which I have no desire to see. Anyway we rented this because we saw it had A Little Less Conversation in it and liked it so much we ended up buying it.Elvis plays Greg Nolan a photographer who..ok there's not much of a plot to describe here. The storyline consists of a girl he meets who keeps changing her name BerniceBettySuzieAlice and personality spending most of the movie alternately screwing with Elvis' mind and coming on to him. Meanwhile Elvis gets two jobs for girlietype magazines in the same building one of them is called Classic Cat Magazine or maybe it's Classy Cat being a photographer and pretends at both that he only works for that magazine while he literally runs back and forth between the two jobs changing clothes and trying not to have one boss find out about the other.  Red West makes his usual cameo as a guy in a fight scene whose ass Elvis ends up kicking always fun to watch.This is a pretty fun Elvis movie and since it was filmed in '68 right around the time Elvis did the comeback special the King was in great shape looking pretty sharp with his sideburns and tan. He also looks like he's having fun and doesn't feel too stupid. Spinout is entertaining but half the time Elvis looks pretty unhappy.  One of my Elvis triviatype books said this movie has the distinction of being the only one he ever has sex in offscreen of course but I think the only way you could tell this is by him waking up in a girl's bed. His costar who looks like a cross between Sharon Tate and  how Liz Taylor looked in the 60's was kind of annoying though not as bad as some of the actresses he's worked with and at least she has a great wardrobe. It was mainly the fact that she had this kind of whispery voice like Taylor. The clothes and hair are all really cool. There are only 4 songs in the movie but two of them are especially good. I loved The Edge of RealityElvis has this trippy dream because BerniceBettySuzieAlice has been messing with his mind so much. The song is great and Elvis wears this tailored set of pajamas that look more like a blue sharkskin suit. I think whoever designed and choreographed the dream sequence might have paid a little visit to Dr. Nick's if you know what I mean but it's pretty cool. The highlight of the movie for me was definitely A Little Less Conversation which Elvis sings to a hot babe at a swinging cocktail party as he's getting her to leave with him. Watch for the male redhaired gogo dancer that they pass who dances so furiously and wildly that his gyrations actually make him upstage Elvis for a few seconds which is no small feat.  As he and the chick are leaving they pass other gogo dancers saunter out the door of the cool 60's pad and hop in Elvis' Cadillac that the valets just happened to have pulled up in front at that second while Elvis smoothly never misses a beat and manages to make the whole thing look like he does it every night. Now that's how you leave a party! One of Elvis' better flicks from the 60's and definitely my favorite movie of his to watch from the late 60's.".

Elvis looks great physically and his wardrobe too has got to be admired  check out the scene were he is wearing those shades...so cool! The film boasts only four songs but they appear to be of a higher standard than most of his mid60's vehicles. The two standout numbers are the No. 1 smash hit A Little Less Conversation and the dramatic dream sequence of Edge of Reality.The tag line of the movie is Watch Elvis click with these chicks! and that he most certainly does especially in the form of leading lady Michelle Carey and CoStar Celeste Yarnall 'Miss Little Less Conversation'. Elvis' pet Great Dane 'Brutus' also gets a costarring role and almost steals the show  his character is called 'Albert'! A fine male cast helps the proceedings too in the form of Dick Sargent Don Porter and veteran singing 'heartthrob' Rudy Vallee. So Live A Little Love A Little is entertainingly weird and wonderful and along with Charro The Trouble With Girls and Change of Habit was the slight departure from his typical sixties musical that Elvis needed at this point in his career.Finally if you're only viewing this as just a curiosity piece then be curious enough to check out that amazing fight scene in the Newspaper printing warehouse  this has got to be the best fight scene in an Elvis movie ever staged!".

His sideburns were back his body was slender and more muscular looking better than he had looked in a movie since Blue Hawaii. Michelle Carey is his costar a buxom slightly kooky girl full of energy. There are only about three songs in the movie but all are first rate beginning with Edge of Reality which came out on a single as the flip side of If I Can Dream the single that came from Elvis' 68 comeback TV special. Edge is a very good off beat song that to many fans was better than Dream and helped make the record a double sided hit. The next is A Little Less Conversation an up tempo number that as you all know by now was remixed and rereleased a couple of years back and became Elvis' 31st number one hit. Then there is Almost in Love a great quirky love ballad that is one of his better songs ever. This is a highly enjoyable movie and better than many of his others. See it.".

Unfortunately there is a long vicious fight sequence in a newspaper plant when Elvis gets a pink slip. Elvis' huge dog Brutus receives star treatment. The opening credits has Elvis sans helmet tooling around the California surf. Fans of Elvis will admire the cordial way he treats the bizarre Carey whenever she goes on one of her crazy rants. Always the gentleman he even places a board between the amorous Carey and himself when they are forced to sleep together. Nice fellow huh? The plot revolves around Elvis' need to find and keep two jobs as a photographer in the magazine world one is with the conservative Rudy Valee the other is with the swinging Don Porter Gidget's dad.

Relationships in movies were less about playing the games of the fifties and more about being direct. So you are more likely to see a woman be the aggressor in the later sixties. The female lead in this movie chases Elvis until he catches her. The dream sequence is less like a Dali painting than those in the fifties and more psychedelic in lighting. Some seem to equate kooky with the sixties perhaps due to the influence of drugs and that carries through in this plot and the characterization of the female lead. One might call this film a sex farce set midst the California lifestyle.I enjoyed this film. Though the story was silly the energy of the film was upbeat and fun. The women were beautiful the music was consequential and Elvis actually seemed to be enjoying himself at times did you ever notice how he seldom smiles in some of his films?. Yes there are plenty of cinema clichs and some throwaway scenes but I enjoyed the kooky chemistry between Elvis and Bernice. Injecting the obligatory Elvis fistfight does not help the story or the pacing but Elvis manages to move the story along with his personality. See Viva Las Vegas for a film with real magnetism between the stars.".

Elvis gets a little wacky from mere contact with her. He apparently wants nothing to do with her but gleefully moves in with her and socks Dick Sargeant for kissing her.I think I am trying to apply some logic to this plot and that in itself is very silly. The dog by the way takes top acting honors.The funniest thing about this entire film is the bedroom scene. Here is the King Stud of his generation lying next to a beautiful nymphet who wants him badly and there is a board between them. The Puritan's in New England live! Who would actually believe this? In real life that mattress would be screaming for mercy.Having said all of this I do find this movie enjoyable. I really liked the attempt to bring Elvis into the Woodstock generation with some colored lights and a guy dressed as a GreatDane.Of course Elvis winds up with this whackjob at the end.

I also liked the fact that the film offers nice supporting parts to two Hollywood veterans  Rudy Vallee who was a crooner himself and a Preston Sterges regular back in the day and Don Porter who is perhaps bestremembered for playing the male lead in the infamous SHEWOLF OF London 1946.While this one may be more engaging than most other Elvis vehicles of its time nowadays the film is perhaps most notable for introducing the unlikeliest of Elvis hits A Little Less Conversation a remixed version of which became a worldwide charttopper in 2002..after a very disappointing showing in the charts when originally released! Surprisingly enough Presley only has three songs throughout the film Edge of Reality is another good one which might disappoint his more hardened fans and indeed have them clamor for a little less conversation a little more action please!

	schema:reviewBody "This late entry in Elvis's film career is an uneasy combination of the total fluff he had done before and an attempt to be more hip adult and nonmusical. Aside from the tune sung over the opening credits he only sings three songs. So many capsule reviews of this film describe the plot as Presley juggling two jobs but that aspect doesn't even come about until far into the film and though it is a plot point the real story lies elsewhere. Presley zooms his dune buggy to the beach and begins to take some photos. Immediately the bizarre Carey tries to seduce him. When it doesn't work she has her huge dog chase him into the ocean until he is willing to come into her beach house. Then she drugs him and keeps him in her spare room for days! It should be noted that this is a comedy! Knowing that Presley was a massive pillpopper who in fact died from it! it is unsettling to watch him in a film that takes this sort of thing so lightly but the '60's offered a different idea of drug use. Presley soon finds out that Carey is a bit of a head case adopting different names throughout the day based on how she feels and entertaining a variety of men. Carey looking and sounding like a very poor man's Elizabeth Taylor though she is undeniably beautiful could not possibly be more aggravating grating infuriating or ludicrous. She even gets to write on a mirror with lipstick ala Taylor in Butterfield 8! The actress's considerable charms are tested to the breaking point. As for Presley and his two jobs...This is strictly bad TV sitcom level plotting and contrivance. Aside from the chance to see Presley looking well the film would be completely without value save two things. One is a totally bizarre dream ballet which no doubt had Agnes de Mille rolling in her grave complete with a man in a Great Dane outfit Elvis in shiny pajamas and a bunch of balletic if that's the word to use standin's for the other characters in the film. The song Edge of Reality is actually quite good but this sequence is a campy uproariously idiotic mess. It's so bad that it's impossible to look away. The other highlight is the recently remixed A Little Less Conversation. The credits list a choreographer for this number but there is almost no dancing which is disappointing. A few lame gogoers lean from side to side in the background. Instead it's a long shot of Elvis singing to Yarnall as he sweeps her out of a party and into his car. The song is way too brief and interrupted at the very beginning by an annoying sound effect but what there is is wonderful to hear and there is a galaxy of funky wacky '60's outfits on display. Yarnall is on hand basically to have her coat placed on her shoulders THREE TIMES in her scant screen time. The film serves as a neat time capsule of late '60's clothes and hair and makeup and has a few great sets. The story is awful and told very choppily. Attempts at adult sexuality are pitiful. Apparently Elvis had an aversion to love scenes. One year before Midnight Cowboy and here he is with a board between him and Carey in bed! Though there are occasional homoerotic moments like Elvis doing dishes with Sargentwho also wields a phallic champagne bottle steamrooming with Porter dropping trou with Vallee and having the dog come to life as a man and taking him to a dream ballet!".

	onyx:emotionText "This late entry in Elvis's film career is an uneasy combination of the total fluff he had done before and an attempt to be more hip adult and nonmusical. Aside from the tune sung over the opening credits he only sings three songs. So many capsule reviews of this film describe the plot as Presley juggling two jobs but that aspect doesn't even come about until far into the film and though it is a plot point the real story lies elsewhere. Presley zooms his dune buggy to the beach and begins to take some photos. Immediately the bizarre Carey tries to seduce him. When it doesn't work she has her huge dog chase him into the ocean until he is willing to come into her beach house. Then she drugs him and keeps him in her spare room for days! It should be noted that this is a comedy! Knowing that Presley was a massive pillpopper who in fact died from it! it is unsettling to watch him in a film that takes this sort of thing so lightly but the '60's offered a different idea of drug use. Presley soon finds out that Carey is a bit of a head case adopting different names throughout the day based on how she feels and entertaining a variety of men. Carey looking and sounding like a very poor man's Elizabeth Taylor though she is undeniably beautiful could not possibly be more aggravating grating infuriating or ludicrous. She even gets to write on a mirror with lipstick ala Taylor in Butterfield 8! The actress's considerable charms are tested to the breaking point. As for Presley and his two jobs...This is strictly bad TV sitcom level plotting and contrivance. Aside from the chance to see Presley looking well the film would be completely without value save two things. One is a totally bizarre dream ballet which no doubt had Agnes de Mille rolling in her grave complete with a man in a Great Dane outfit Elvis in shiny pajamas and a bunch of balletic if that's the word to use standin's for the other characters in the film. The song Edge of Reality is actually quite good but this sequence is a campy uproariously idiotic mess. It's so bad that it's impossible to look away.

This is certainly a departure from some of the other films Elvis was doing around this time.

The best performance of the film comes from the girl's Great Dane who steals the film each time he shows up. His early scenes with Elvis on the beach actually get a good performance out of the singer and manages to be very funny. The early scenes between Elvis and Carey are also very funny and there are a few more laughs throughout. Elvis is decent here but again I wouldn't say he gives a good performance. Carey is the real star though as she makes her character really stand out and memorable. The music also is a lot different than we'd heard before but it works.".

	schema:headline " How hope can elevate the hopeless";
	schema:reviewBody "I must confess that this is my favorite movie of all time and the  music plays a large part of why I enjoy it so much. Don't expect  stellar acting in this movie unless you want to be let downthough  make no mistake the acting is certainly adequate. The key players in  this movie were not chosen for their acting abilities but rather for  their musical talent. The people you see on stage in the movie are the  same people who play the music you hear. If you appreciate soul music  do not pass up the chance to purchase The Commitments Vol. I and Vol.  II. And what a talented assembly of musicians they brought together  for this movie. Most astonishing is the lead vocals of prodigy Andrew  Strong playing lead singer Deco Cuffe whom at 16 years old at the  time of filming possesses a voice that Bob Geldof would starve for.  More than anything this film is about hope. It is about the hopes and  dreams of a handful of poor north side Dubliners striving to beat the  odds and make something of themselves. The film follows the nearrise  and eventual fall of a band that on the verge of a record deal could  not bear to watch success interfere with their destiny to remain  destitute.  But was destitution their destiny after all? Success of the band was  irrelevant the main protagonist and band manager is told moments  after the band breaks up.

	onyx:emotionText "I must confess that this is my favorite movie of all time and the  music plays a large part of why I enjoy it so much. Don't expect  stellar acting in this movie unless you want to be let downthough  make no mistake the acting is certainly adequate. The key players in  this movie were not chosen for their acting abilities but rather for  their musical talent. The people you see on stage in the movie are the  same people who play the music you hear. If you appreciate soul music  do not pass up the chance to purchase The Commitments Vol. I and Vol.  II. And what a talented assembly of musicians they brought together  for this movie. Most astonishing is the lead vocals of prodigy Andrew  Strong playing lead singer Deco Cuffe whom at 16 years old at the  time of filming possesses a voice that Bob Geldof would starve for.  More than anything this film is about hope. It is about the hopes and  dreams of a handful of poor north side Dubliners striving to beat the  odds and make something of themselves. The film follows the nearrise  and eventual fall of a band that on the verge of a record deal could  not bear to watch success interfere with their destiny to remain  destitute.  But was destitution their destiny after all? Success of the band was  irrelevant the main protagonist and band manager is told moments  after the band breaks up. You raised their expectations of lifeyou  lifted their horizons! And indeed the epilogue reveals that even  though the band itself was a failure virtually every band member had  achieved a greater level of personal achievement than they had hoped  for before they had joined the band.  This is a movie about the raw appeal of soul music it is a movie about  Dubliners it is a movie about the economic conditions in general that  grip Ireland it is a movie about poor folks who endlessly toil in the  vain hope that they can make ends meet.

When they perform Try a Little Tenderness I've never managed to watch that scene without tears in my eyes it's such a fantastic version of the song and the energy Andrew Strong brings to it is just incredible especially as he was only 16 at the time.Anyone who loves music has to see this film even you're not familiar with soul music  I promise you'll be hooked after seeing The Commitments!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bring a bunch of destitute Dubliners together to form a soul band. Crazy? No brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed who isn't? but that's OK because he has the idea the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the downandout youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band The Commitments is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because despite all the odds stacked against them it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful unique rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.The movie follows the band's rise with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group a trumpetplaying philosopher who's played with all the greats. Here is a man who appreciates the journey. He also appreciates the opportunity to bed the band's three lovely female backup singers. The band in this movie goes on a magical ride. And lucky us we get to go along. This movie is a rollicking good time. Dublin soul rocks.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bring a bunch of destitute Dubliners together to form a soul band. Crazy? No brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed who isn't? but that's OK because he has the idea the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the downandout youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band The Commitments is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because despite all the odds stacked against them it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful unique rockin' Dublin soul.It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man.

I highly recommend this to everyone who's ever watched the movie and I'll guarantee you'll be amazed at what you missed in dialog. As many times as I've watched the movie I always picked up a little more dialogwise than the previous time. Now I know the whole story  all the background dialog. It's almost like a Director's Cut or the Uncut version. Don't knock it till you try it! Still my 1 favorite movie.On a side note I'm sure most of you know Glen Hansard who played Outspan in the movie won an Academy Award for Best Original Song this year from the movie Once. I bought the movie used at Blockbuster for 5just on the strength of the box's liner notes. I loved the movie but had no clue the male lead was Outspan. But the more I looked at his facial expressions especially his eyes I kept saying to myselfGod I know this guy! Picked up my Commitments DVD but no actors names were on the box so I got my Commitments CD Soundtrack out and sure enough Glen Hansard's name was listed. If you haven't seen the movieOncegive it a try. It's got some great songs in it almost all original written by Glen and his costar Marketa Irglova Well that's enough for me. I'll write some more in another four years. Marty".

The biggest cinema in Dublin The Savoy showed the picture around the clock on it's opening weekend and it played to pretty much full houses at all shows.

Suffice to say it was a monster hit in Ireland at the time. I was working in the cinema business at the time managing UCI and I was lucky enough to be at the premiere. When the cast were introduced one by one the roof lifted. I attended the party where The Commitments all of them played in a tiny club on the docks called The Waterfront and to say that was pretty special is an understatement. To this day I'm still friend with Dick Massey Billy Mooney and and from to time to time he will remissness about his time with the film.

If only they'd managed to hold it together  but then it wouldn't have been poetry...I can't be anymore blunt and truthful than to say that I adore this film. Right from its visually plain credits the restless Irish soul music performed entirely by the youthful cast should get your feet tapping. Then Alan Parker takes us to an urban landscape that might be gray but by God it's bustling. We can relate to Jimmy Rabitte immediately the youthful entrepreneur who has innate confidence in his own salesmanship and in his prefame existence grants imaginary interviews from the comfort of his bathtub. He's approached to provide guidance for some friends who are struggling to make their mark as musicians. Soon they have a direction and are banding together by applying for more members. A call is sent out far and wide that the Irish brothers are in need of some soul...Almost every member of the group is memorable and has their own particular idiosyncrasies. There's a palpable sense of adventure as they start out and their potential rapidly expands because when they're on stage together they click. All of this success is undercut in a typically understated and deadpan example of Irish wit from Jimmy Rabitte Sr. He himself fancies the perks of stardom but isn't brave enough to pursue them so instead is limited to crooning into a sauce bottle at home. In a very funny film its one of several memorable roles but this time with a recognisable face playing it Colm Meaney of Star Trek and Con Air fame. He isn't the only 'hidden talent' in the family either  look out for Andrea Corr as Jimmy Jr's younger sister! Natural performances and earthy humour combined with raw talent make this a winner from start to finish. Please don't miss this otherwise you'll kick yourself. I'm very tempted to give a good shake to anybody who hasn't seen it yet myself. It's an absolutely fantastic film!".

He puts an ad in the papers and it's a parade of wrong music. His Elvis loving dad Colm Meaney doesn't get it. Sax playing Dean Fay Flim Gormley is the first brought into the band. Billy Mooney Dick Massey is the drummer. Jimmy gets Natalie Murphy Maria Doyle Kennedy Imelda Quirke Angeline Ball and Bernie McGloughlin Bronagh Gallagher as the backup singers. After watching a drunken Deco Cuffe Andrew Strong sing at the wedding he gets him as the lead singer. Joey The Lips Fagan Johnny Murphy is the womanizing experienced trumpet player who comes up with their name The Commitments. He hires the volatile Mickah Wallace Dave Finnegan as their security.This is fun. It's great music. The cast is mostly musicians trying their hands at acting. Some of them would become quite interesting. It's based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle's lower class Barrytown trilogy. It's heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life. The movie could have ended with something predictable but this way it's poetry.".

He puts an ad in the papers and it's a parade of wrong music. His Elvis loving dad Colm Meaney doesn't get it. Sax playing Dean Fay Flim Gormley is the first brought into the band. Billy Mooney Dick Massey is the drummer. Jimmy gets Natalie Murphy Maria Doyle Kennedy Imelda Quirke Angeline Ball and Bernie McGloughlin Bronagh Gallagher as the backup singers. After watching a drunken Deco Cuffe Andrew Strong sing at the wedding he gets him as the lead singer. Joey The Lips Fagan Johnny Murphy is the womanizing experienced trumpet player who comes up with their name The Commitments. He hires the volatile Mickah Wallace Dave Finnegan as their security.This is fun. It's great music. The cast is mostly musicians trying their hands at acting. Some of them would become quite interesting. It's based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle's lower class Barrytown trilogy. It's heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life. The movie could have ended with something predictable but this way it's poetry.";

He has a great soul voice. The story is interesting and there is some good humor in her too.The bad news is that it portrays the Irish as extremely profane people who do nothing but scream at each other and tell each other to foff. That wears thin after awhile. Everyone says this young and old. One hopes this isn't representative of the entire country.The movie also has as one of the characters an older trumpet player who is portrayed as a religious man who wears crosses and says the Lord told him to do this and do that.

The fact that the actors were real musicians made the personal dynamics seem more realistic. The movie also gives a very accurate portrayal of the lives of the young working class of Dublin before the boom of the 90's. Anyone who has ever thought of being in a band should see this movie. And everyone whose been in a band can relate wholeheartedly to the characters events and melodrama. Overall this is a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack. A must see.

I grew up being told by my brother that I just had to see this film and being told by my parents that I was too young strong language etc. Then one Christmas I finally saw it and years later it's still in my top five.As a Dubliner I was really pleased to see an accurate depiction of life here. Of course certain things have changed in the last decade but this film is more honest than much of the Hollywood fuelled Oirish stuff you see in the cinema. There have been debates on whether or not we are really like this like this telling each other to fk of at every opportunity. As I said the film gives an accurate description of real life Ireland Dublin in particular although we're not necessarily ALL as angry as the band members. They were stressed. Just thought I'd clear that up.Robert Arkins plays Jimmy an unemployed Dub with a vision  to put together the hardest working band in the world. A soul band called the Commitments. He gets together a bunch of unknown amateur musicians including an ass of a lead singer  played brilliantly by Andrew Strong who was amazingly only 17 at the time. His singing voice is just fantastic! who all crave fame. The band move from woeful rehearsals to pathetic community hall gigs to being just inches from success but rivalries within the band and the pride of certain members jeopardises everything.The music is simply fantastic  the soundtrack is an absolute musthave. Their renditions of 'Try a little tenderness' 'Chain of Fools' and others are great. It's a shame that we never actually see Arkins singing in the film as he does two songs on the soundtrack. His voice like Andrew Strong is superb. For whatever reason if you are having trouble understanding what people are saying hell I found it hard sometimes! I urge you to endure. You won't regret it especially when the music starts up. Mustang Sally brothers and sisters!In all if you're sick of Irish films that are only about the Troubles the priests or the green pastures then the Commitments is for you. And if you still think that 'Far and Away' and 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' are films about the real Ireland. And if you like really great music and great comedic oneliners.Also if you are not yet convinced that admittedly excellent Hollywood actors like Kevin Spacey Julia Roberts Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt cannot hold an Irish accent to save their lives then watch this film.Or if you just want to see the Corrs with bad post80s hair then watch this.

Most modern romantic comedies are either drowning in their syrupy sentimentality Serendipityor in crude hatred of one andor both sexes Tomcats Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood. The film stars Barbra Streisand as Doris a parttime hookeractress who doesn't go anywhere without her TV. George Segal plays Felix Sherman a wouldbe writer whose life consists of writer's block and rejection slips. One fateful evening Felix complains to the landlord about the constant noise coming from Doris' apartment. He goes to bed and is awakened by a loud knock. It's Doris who was evicted from her apartment and has several bones to pick with Felix. It's the beginning of a battle that lasts for most of the film's 97 minute running time.What makes The Owl and the Pussycat such a standout film is the care that went into the production. Buck Henry has successfully transplanted Bill Manhoff's play from L.A. to New York and the film is better for it. New York is a much livelier town than L.A. and the city itself becomes a character that the others bounce off from. Herbert Ross proves he can handle comedy as well as he can handle musicals and choreography. His direction doesn't overwhelm the script and acting but compliments it in a way most people write off.On paper I suppose the Barbra StreisandGeorge Segal pairing doesn't look promising. But when you see the film you will not think of more perfect casting. Streisand and Segal have good chemistry together and it makes some of the later events of the film more believable. Streisand has a gift for delivering brisk snappy dialogue. Segal has a gift for being able to make his characters instantly likable. The score is by Blood Sweat and Tears. Made in between their second and third albums the score doesn't feel like a timefiller throwaway. Dick Halligan's music fits the film like a well worn glove. I cannot imagine the movie without the music. It does like all good scores do enhance the movie without giving it away. There is a mixup in regards to the lyrics credited to BST but David ClaytonThomas has said they were given to BST before the music was composed but still as sung by DCT the songs have a wonderful quality to them.All people who even want to attempt a romantic comedy should watch The Owl and the Pussycat. It shows how to make a movie like this without resorting to misogyny chauvinism or drippy sentiment. out of 4 stars".

	schema:headline " A hoot of a comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Owl And The Pussycat is a fine example of great comic pairing. Barbra and George Segal work very well together. Very well indeed. It is a loud comedy though not a slapstick one. So if you're looking for slapstick watch What's UpDoc? or For Pete's Sake. If you are looking for a comedy that is a more heartfelt with more depth to the charatcers and emotion then The Owl And The Pussycat is for you. I say it is a loud comedy mostly because of Barbra's character Doris. Doris can be pretty loud. But what's funny about it is that half the time she doesn't even mean to be it's just her nature. This nature took George Segal's character Felix quite by surpriseand it is very amusing to see him try to adjust to it. What's so interesting to watch is that although Doris shows herself in the beginning to be loud selfassertive and bold she later shows herself to be vulnerable and sweet. Where as George Segal's character Felix showing himself to have a nose up in the air I'm too intellectual for you attitude in the beginning later shows that although he wants success in his life not at the expense of pretense. With himself or what he genuinely wants. I say pretense because Felix's thinking was that he would marry an intellectual such as he thought himself to be and live this proper life. Doris although loud and believes she is a legend in her own mind is genuine and real. Felix is very much attracted to her for this reason. It's a quality that she has that he sees that he wants to be more like himself. But what is so amusing is that Doris feels that after meeting and getting to know Felix that she needs to become more like him! More intellectual. What's truly so charming about this movie is how it shows the facades that we can portray and the masks that we can wear are truly just that facades and masks. How no matter how confident we can look on the outside how smart we may appear that it can be a totally different story once you start actually getting to know someone. What's most charming of allactually wonderfulis that by the film's end they both decide to drop these facades take off the masks and start fresh. But...all along from the beginning of this movie til it's end until they get to this level it can be quite hysterical. A great comedy with heart. Enjoy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Owl And The Pussycat is a fine example of great comic pairing. Barbra and George Segal work very well together. Very well indeed. It is a loud comedy though not a slapstick one. So if you're looking for slapstick watch What's UpDoc? or For Pete's Sake. If you are looking for a comedy that is a more heartfelt with more depth to the charatcers and emotion then The Owl And The Pussycat is for you. I say it is a loud comedy mostly because of Barbra's character Doris. Doris can be pretty loud. But what's funny about it is that half the time she doesn't even mean to be it's just her nature. This nature took George Segal's character Felix quite by surpriseand it is very amusing to see him try to adjust to it. What's so interesting to watch is that although Doris shows herself in the beginning to be loud selfassertive and bold she later shows herself to be vulnerable and sweet. Where as George Segal's character Felix showing himself to have a nose up in the air I'm too intellectual for you attitude in the beginning later shows that although he wants success in his life not at the expense of pretense. With himself or what he genuinely wants. I say pretense because Felix's thinking was that he would marry an intellectual such as he thought himself to be and live this proper life. Doris although loud and believes she is a legend in her own mind is genuine and real. Felix is very much attracted to her for this reason. It's a quality that she has that he sees that he wants to be more like himself. But what is so amusing is that Doris feels that after meeting and getting to know Felix that she needs to become more like him! More intellectual. What's truly so charming about this movie is how it shows the facades that we can portray and the masks that we can wear are truly just that facades and masks. How no matter how confident we can look on the outside how smart we may appear that it can be a totally different story once you start actually getting to know someone.

	schema:headline " This film has enough laughs for 10 motion pictures combined";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most hilarious films ever made THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT has more laughs than ten of today's socalled comedies combined. Even though a few set changes and a couple of new supporting characters are added to open up the storyline director Herbert Ross and writer Buck Henry manage to keep the same spirit of the original oneact twocharacter play intact. There's a lot of verbal warfare in Henry's screenplay and he seems to have a gift for penning wickedly funny dialogue. Some viewers could argue that THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is little more than two characters insulting each other for 95 minutes but  when those insults are so rigorously funny  who cares? In the female lead Barbra Streisand gives a refreshingly unsentimental performance as Doris the semiilliterate hooker who for once does not have a heart of gold. George Segal was primarily known as a dramatic actor before he was cast as Felix the snotty book clerkwriterwannabe. His performance is so convincing that he has been known as an expert comic ever since. The chemistry between Streisand and Segal ignites from the beginning and it stays aflame throughout their relationship's many ups and downs. Robert Klien has a funny supporting role  and plays it expertly  but THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT remains a showcase for the chemistry between Streisand and Segal. I think wellrespected film critic Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote Were Tracy and Hepburn ever this good. . . maybe but they were never better. High praise indeed!".

Even though a few set changes and a couple of new supporting characters are added to open up the storyline director Herbert Ross and writer Buck Henry manage to keep the same spirit of the original oneact twocharacter play intact. There's a lot of verbal warfare in Henry's screenplay and he seems to have a gift for penning wickedly funny dialogue.

He ekes out a living as a clerk in Doubleday's Book Store in New York. When he espies neighbor Barbra Streisand making love and accepting some cash in exchange he calls the building superintendent. The super throws Streisand out and she invades  that's the word  invades Segal's shabby digs. She's a vulgar wouldbe actress model and occasional girl for hire.She raises such a fuss in Segal's apartment that the super throws both of them out. Segal takes her to the apartment of a friend Robert Klein but their loud arguments and queer garb don't ask arouse and disturb Klein and he leaves the apartment. Segal winds up in the lethal embrace of the raptorous Streisand.They separate unamicably for a few weeks but the encounter has taught each of them something and they have another date at the apartment of Segal's rich fiance a pianist. She and her family happen to be in Boston where the fiance is giving a performance with the Boston Symphony. In the sybaritic apartment Streisand produces some marijuana which the bookish Segal smokes on a dare and they end up in the bath tub together. The apartment doesn't remain empty of others for long.It's really a familiar story of two nutty idiosyncratic mismatched New Yorkers each of whom teaches the other to overcome pretensions. But it's so slickly done adapted by Buck Henry from somebody's play that it succeeds in a wild and uneven fashion.I think it might help a viewer to be at least a little familiar with the geographic and chronological milieu. I mean  this is New York City in the late 1960s. Times Square is filled with porno shops and sleazy clothing outlets and beggars. And there is the conflict of subcultures  the bourgeois on the one hand Segal and the iconoclastic on the other Streisand. The use of grass was a daring enterprise for the middle class.But you don't really need to have been there to enjoy the gags. They come thick and fast both verbal and physical. I'll give an example. During their separation Segal is passing a dirty movie theater in Times Square this was prevideo tape and notices that the movie playing  the pornographic Cycle Sluts  stars Streisand. Writhing with disgust and curiosity Segal buys a ticket and as he's passing through the lobby an attendant asks Raincoat? Segal I don't have a raincoat. Attendant You want to RENT one? I don't particularly like Barbra Streisand's personality. She has an ego the size of Greenland. But she's phenomenal in this comic role and looks utterly pinchable too despite that prominent proboscis. Segal is even better as the putupon author who's work has been turned down by every publisher in New York. His role is the more difficult because he's basically the straight man but he does wonders with it. Watch his expression when he's stoned and naked in the tub with Streisand and they hear the doors open and close as his fiance and her family arrive unexpectedly. His face turns crimson. You're about to meet Miss Weyderhaus he says with a mischievous smile as if they were two kids about to be discovered playing hookey from the third grade.The movie collapses on itself in the last ten minutes or so trying to turn serious but only managing to achieve offputting. They may wind up married but I wouldn't bet on its lasting.".

It's considered something of a censorship milestone with the treatment of taboo subjects such as prostitution homosexuality and pornography  not to mention the proliferation of bad language throughout unfortunately the DVD is said to contain the slightly edited PGrated version which cuts some brief nudity involving female lead Barbra Streisand and her use of the fword in one scene! With this in mind one has to consider the development which the comedy genre underwent during this time from the mildly risqu sophisticated antics of the Doris DayRock Hudson films of the early 1960s to the cynical anxietyridden variety that started emanating towards the tailend of the decade  with which the likes of Jack Lemmon George Segal the male lead of this film and in particular Woody Allen since he was his own writer and mostly directed himself as well are forever associated.THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation  Barbra Streisand  her first nonmusical role in fact it led to other wacky comedy vehicles foremost among them WHAT'S UP DOC? 1972 Peter Bogdanovich's updating of the Howard Hawks classic BRINGING UP BABY 1938 and FOR PETE'S SAKE 1974 whose trailer included on the Columbia R2 DVD of the film under review makes it seem like a good deal of fun. Thanks largely to his role in the film Segal went on to do his fair share of sex comedies up till the early 1980s  with the most successful among them being A TOUCH OF CLASS 1973 which I should be acquiring shortly.Anyway to get to the main item the film can be seen as a modern variation on the perennial Pygmalion theme  with Segal as intellectual but at the same time neurotic and Streisand the uncouth yet liberated woman. There's no plot to speak of  instead we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of locationhopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal who drives them out because of their constant bickering then going their separate ways till they meet again after he has learned about her movie experience  a hilarious scene  and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace and go out together where they're harassed by a band of thrillseekers after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiance a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another beginning with their real names.In this respect the film emerges to be overly talky betraying its stage origins but there is a reasonable amount of invention and wit in the undeniable comedy highlights Segal dressing up as Death to scare the hiccupping Streisand Segal using an aquarium as a TV set  with him delivering an impromptu news flash  to humor the insomniac Streisand her addiction to TV is illustrated by a surprising reference to the Lionel AtwillLon Chaney Jr. horror pic MAN MADE MONSTER 1941 the couple's argument over the sun spat morning line in the opening paragraph of a book by aspiring novelist Segal Streisand's account of the sordid activities her clients invariably came up with prompting Segal to describe her as a sexual Disneyland etc. The film's soundtrack is highlighted by several songs from jazzrock band Blood Sweat  Tears.".

She succeeds in spades in this often hilarious 1970 comedy adapted by Buck Henry from a hit Bill Manhoff play and directed by Herbert Ross. Streisand plays Doris a loudmouthed fetish hooker who claims to be a model and an actress. She gets thrown out of her apartment when her neighbor a nebbish bookstore clerk and aspiring writer named Felix Sherman reports her clandestine activities to the landlord. This causes a confrontation in which she is convinced he's gay and seduces him. Another fight ensues causing them to get kicked out of his apartment.

George Segal makes Felix a lovably insecure schlub and provides great chemistry with Streisand in her first nonsinging role. They have a great scene in the bathtub where both are completely stoned as his fiance and her parents walk in and he has a funny scene where he pretends to be the TV to help Doris get to sleep. For Streisand's part she wears a hysterically tacky negligee dances in a gogo cage appears in a softporn flick called Cycle Sluts we only hear the riotous audio  Where are you putting THAT? and says the F word unfortunately cut out of the DVD version though it's obvious when she says it. It's not her best screen performance but it's one of her funniest. Henry's sharp dialogue and Ross' quick pacing help considerably in making this an enjoyably vulgar romantic comedy.

There are a couple of great laughs and general good fun. It's essentially a two person play but this is able to incorporate some NYC street life. There are some good interplay and then there is the climax. It gets a little dark and then a little poignant and then lets you leave with a smile.";

He may have had a fatal heart attack had he been around to watch Barbra Streisand go from leading lady in three big screen movie musicals to playing an obvious hooker in a foul mouthed romantic comedy he would have burnt before offering to Joan Crawford. Of course Streisand affectionately known as Babs had seen the writing on the box office receipts of other recent musicals preferring to save her singing voice for the recording studio rather than the movies. Instead of breaking into song on some moving vehicle in every film she won box office approval by playing wacky independent women with more intelligence than the leading male character believed her to have.The grand dame of modern gay icons. Babs is a bit shocking as she makes the assumption that her nebbish neighbor George Segal is gay something she throws in his face with great relish and venom. Of course it's only a matter of time before she learns the truth parading around in lacy and racy pajamas certainly not meant to sleep in. It seems out of character for her very flamboyant character to be so verbally hateful towards gay men especially one she has no proof to back her claim. For most of the movie Streisand is a bit of a harpy but manages to instill a level of humor that makes her at least somewhat tolerable. She's particularly funny in a scene where you only hear her voice acting out a porno.The lack of major supporting players makes it a bit tough on Streisand and Segal to hold all the attention. Their chemistry is iffy at best although the final confrontation between the two on Central Park locations brings out a lot more vulnerability in each of the characters. Still the obvious stage origins of the set up detract from the wide screen and makes it truly feel dated.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is everything a prehistoric adventure should be. Forget the fact that dinosaurs and man did not coexist...this is just as much a fantasy as Jason and the Argonauts or Star Wars.The world of One Million Years B.C. is insanely brutal where man is the weakest creature in a harsh landscape of volcanoes and giant monsters. The Rock People have lives that are nasty brutish and short where only the strongest survive. They are dominated by the rugged chief Akoba whose two sons Tumak and Sakana are in a constant battle to see who will gain his favor. Sakana gains the upper hand and Tumak is banished into the wastelands. After dodging monsters he finally arrives at the seaside domain of the Shell People who are more cultured and civilized. He captures the eye of the beautiful Loana and the two have a nonstop series of adventures.The narrative is direct and primitive befitting the primeval setting. John Richardson is quite good as Tumak...he is decent but still has a lot of barbarism in him. As for young Raquel Welch not even the special effects of Ray Harryhausen could outshine her incredible beauty in this film. Even in our own time gorgeous babes like these are rare...they would be totally impossible in the prehistoric world. The stunning Raquel is pure eye candy and succeeds better in this regard than any other actress in film history. Especially noteworthy is her catfight with sultry Martine Beswick no slouch in the looks department herself.Ray Harryhausen outdoes himself again with brilliant stop motion dinosaurs. Look at the realistic movements of these creatures which have not been surpassed by CGI. The ravenous Allosaurus who duels with Tumak is a particular standout but the battling Triceratops and Ceratosaur are also pretty cool. The movie also features the more standard giant lizard dressed up and made huge but even this scene is better than most of its ilk. An eerie scene featuring apemen and some colossal earthquake and erupting volcanoes round out an exciting picture.Don't look for anything really deep in this one. Just expect primitive action with plenty of monsters battling cavemen and the awesome Raquel Welch. This movie does everything it sets out to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came out in 1967 a year before 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY . . . but they've always been related in my mind. Maybe it was just the time maybe you had to be there . . . but back in the late 60's there weren't many big science fiction productions . . . or in this case sweeping epics about the past or the future.One thing the two films share is a lack of dialog . . . in both cases the director's sit back and the actions tell the story. As well both films are happy to display their special effects moments as set pieces . . . hey we spent a lot of money on this?!Don Chaffey's long cuts and static landscape shots at the beginning of the film are very much like Kubrick's shots of Africa at the start of 2001 . . . and both films are literal and allegorical treatments of evolution as a theme.Of course that went with the times. The late 60's were a point where the evolution of society was a focal point of culture in general . . . both the Star Child and Miss Welch in her iconic bearskin bikini became the late 60's poster children for mankind's evolution.Interestingly though Ray Harryhausen did the special effects for ONE MILLION YEARS BC the film isn't at all like a Harryhausen film nor is it much like the films of it's production company Hammer Films except perhaps for the two sequels WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH and CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT.Hammer  with Harryhausen's involvement  had been interested in remaking KING KONG but in the late 1960's RKO's rights to the Kong character were shared among Universal and Toho KING KONG VS GODZILLA and Rankin Bass the cartoon Kong which served as a basis for the Toho film KING KONG ESCAPES. In fact right at the time that Hammer would have been inquiring Toho would have been working on preproduction of a film in which King Kong met Mothra and battled a giant shrimp Ebirah in the South Seas. That film mutated Godzilla replaced KING KONG and it became GODZILLA VS EBIRAH aka GODZILLA VS THE SEA MONSTER.So Hammer moved on to a remake of the Hal Roach 1no YEARS MILLION BC.With it's lingering shots of vast landscapes and the very Italian score by Mario Nascembewith the percussion and use of a chorus it could almost be Ennio Morricone . . . the film is pretty much unique in Hammer's oeuvre . . . and with it's focus on sex well possession at least and violence in a harsh landscape of sharp desert light or fire lit darkness it's pretty unique as a Harryhausen picture too.Opinions about the film really depend on the pointofview you adopt again like 2001. Those who like their acting to be dialog driven complain about the acting but actually everyone puts in a good performance here and I have no doubt that beautiful Napondi Martine Beswicke wouldn't think twice about impaling Luana Raquel Welch with that antelope horn she wields.It's been speculated that the schedule was tough for Harryhausen resulting in a scene with a photooptically enlarged Iguana and Tarantula . . . although Harryhausen says the producers wanted those sequences added. If you look closely you'll see a giant cricket in the scene with the Tarantula probably the first giant cricket until 2005's KING KONG with it's herd of killer wetas and doubtlessly in their to excite the Tarantual into a performance. The fact that publicity photos show a battle between cavemen and a brontosaurus that never happens in the film probably backs up the story that the schedule was too short for Harryhausen.Nevertheless the stop motion on view is excellent . . . except for the Brontosaurus who looks about the size of Godzilla. The pacing and animation in the battle with the giant turtle Archelon is excellent and most people just accept the turtle as real. The Allosaurus attack . . .possibly one of Harryhausen's most exciting sequences ever . . . is terrific. In many ways it holds up even today as a model of the integration of live action and special effects The classic Triceratops battle is interesting for utilizing a Ceratosaurus instead of Tyrannosaurus . . . but with our two heroes in the classic trapped in a cave position it's a bit static. However the Pterodactyl scenes and the big volcano and earthquake finish are pretty riveting.All in all ONE MILLION YEARS BC is still a lot of fun if your in the right mood. Again like 2001 the message seems to be that we can evolve and get better . . . but ultimately just as the monolith transforming Dave makes the standoff between Russians and Americans on the moon a nonissue the battle between the Rock and the Sand tribe becomes . . . well . . . pretty irrelevant when the forces of nature  Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  make mankind's aspirations tiny in comparison. The film has been restored twice in the last decade and the recent 20th Century Fox DVD has comparisons of the work done the original negative was lost. The European version clocks in at 100 minutes . . . and most people say that it is an improvement with more character scenes and a different order of sequences at the beginning of the film. The Fox version is the North American release version that is 91 minutes long. Spanish and English trailers on the DVD seem to be identical with the narrator simply translated into Spanish.Ultimately any dinosaur or monster fan fan of Ray Harryhausen's work or fan of Hammer glamor is going to want to own this film.".

Watch as Tumak of the Rock People and Loana of the Shell People forge a shaky relationship and possibly bring their two tribes of people together.

	schema:reviewBody "Those looking for films that deal realistically with prehistory need to look elsewhere. One Million Years BC is a fantasy movie. The creators of this film borrowed creatures and cultural elements willynilly from any epoch in earth's history that served their purpose made up a few of their own elements tossed them into a cooking pot stirred simmered and added seasoning. The final result is an impressive dish. In my opinion it is the best caveman film ever made.The stark hostile landscape the sweeping and lonely vistas the haunting music punctuated with tribal rattle sounds combine to create an amazing prehistoric setting. This is a dark and violent setting. Mankind is portrayed as struggling to survive in a world of bloody fangs and destructive elemental powers. You feel this savage primeval world come alive as you watch the movie. Can humanity emerge from such a savage and hostile world? Two cultures are presented a cave dwelling darkhaired violent and bloodthirsty Rock Tribe and the more settled blondhaired and sophisticated Shell Tribe. Both cultures are flawed and seem to be slowly dying out. Two characters Tumac from the Rock Tribe and Luana from the Shell Tribe come together in a romance so powerful it will catalyze the transformation of both cultures. A simple series of grunts and monosyllabic sounds are the only dialog in the movie. Both of the tribes are well presented and offer interesting contrasts in terms of how they solve problems and how they live in the world.The dinosaurs are fabulous. Not only in how they look but in what they do. Several scenes stand out as exceptional uses of monsters in storytelling. The attack on Shell village by the young allosaurus is vivid terrifying and powerful. Tumac fights the allosaurus and affirms his humanity by saving a young child. The pteronodon swooping down on the lakeshore and carrying off Luana seemingly to feed her to its young is a cruel and haunting scene. The battle between ceratosaurus and triceratops is a brilliantly choreographed dinosaur fight...I could go on and on.The movie is unrelenting in presenting us with a brutal and uncompromising primordial world. The warthog hunt the goat hunt the catfight the menapes Tumac learning to laugh  these scenes show us plenty of raw untamed emotions and they serve to deepen and embellish both character and setting. And what savage characters! Rachel Welch is a movie poster icon because of this movie. Sure she looks great but along the way she convincingly portrays a strong and courageous cavewoman. And John Richardson is excellent as Tumac  brutal smart adaptable and a true hero because he fights for what is human even as he discovers what being human is all about. The secondary characters are all excellent and convincing.From start to finish this movie delivers. A movie like One Million Years BC may not appeal to everyone. But it is the pinnacle of fabulous Stone Age drama. It rocks!".

	onyx:emotionText "Those looking for films that deal realistically with prehistory need to look elsewhere. One Million Years BC is a fantasy movie. The creators of this film borrowed creatures and cultural elements willynilly from any epoch in earth's history that served their purpose made up a few of their own elements tossed them into a cooking pot stirred simmered and added seasoning. The final result is an impressive dish. In my opinion it is the best caveman film ever made.The stark hostile landscape the sweeping and lonely vistas the haunting music punctuated with tribal rattle sounds combine to create an amazing prehistoric setting. This is a dark and violent setting. Mankind is portrayed as struggling to survive in a world of bloody fangs and destructive elemental powers. You feel this savage primeval world come alive as you watch the movie. Can humanity emerge from such a savage and hostile world? Two cultures are presented a cave dwelling darkhaired violent and bloodthirsty Rock Tribe and the more settled blondhaired and sophisticated Shell Tribe. Both cultures are flawed and seem to be slowly dying out. Two characters Tumac from the Rock Tribe and Luana from the Shell Tribe come together in a romance so powerful it will catalyze the transformation of both cultures. A simple series of grunts and monosyllabic sounds are the only dialog in the movie. Both of the tribes are well presented and offer interesting contrasts in terms of how they solve problems and how they live in the world.The dinosaurs are fabulous. Not only in how they look but in what they do. Several scenes stand out as exceptional uses of monsters in storytelling. The attack on Shell village by the young allosaurus is vivid terrifying and powerful. Tumac fights the allosaurus and affirms his humanity by saving a young child. The pteronodon swooping down on the lakeshore and carrying off Luana seemingly to feed her to its young is a cruel and haunting scene. The battle between ceratosaurus and triceratops is a brilliantly choreographed dinosaur fight...I could go on and on.The movie is unrelenting in presenting us with a brutal and uncompromising primordial world. The warthog hunt the goat hunt the catfight the menapes Tumac learning to laugh  these scenes show us plenty of raw untamed emotions and they serve to deepen and embellish both character and setting.

	schema:reviewBody "One million years b.c. It really is probably the best movie I have seen in which all of the dialogue is undecipherablehope I spelled that word right. It starts off with a tribe of cavemen known as the rock tribe. They are pretty brutal and ruthless. During a fight over food one of the clan Tumak is kicked out of the tribe. Tumak goes off on a stretch walk and eventually passes out on the beach. He is rescued by another tribe known as the shell tribe. The shell tribe I like a lot better because they are more civilized and peaceful not to mention many of their women are really hot. Tumak makes friends with the hottest female of the group Luanna. He then proves his worth by saving the tribe from an Allosaurus. But Tumak gets in a scuffle with another member of the tribe and kills him accidentally. Tumak is forced to leave and luckily for him Luanna goes with him. Soon Tumak runs into his old tribe again.The story really is not hard to follow. It is your basic guy looking for belonging after being kicked out of one caveman tribe joins another tribe and then must leave again. SOmetimes you can tell what the characters in this film are trying to say to each other but it is caveman talk.Ray Harryhausen is at his best in this film. THe dinosaurs and other creatures he puts in look amazing. True the first creature to show up is a giant iguana that is just a normal iguana made to look bigger. I think they did this to pay respect to the original 1000000 years b.c. But later you get to see a giant turtle pteranadon brontosaurus and an epic battle between a ceratosaurus and a triceratops. My favorite dinosaur was always the Allosaurus so I loved the scene where the Allosaurus attacked the shell tribe. That is easily the best part of the entire film. Harryhausen was a great special effects artist. There are very few who were as good at the trade as he was.Other things I enjoyed watching belonged to Raquel Welch. She is stunningly beautiful and a major reason that this film has endured and the picture of her in the fur bikini is so famous.So this is a very good film better than its sequel When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth. THe dinosaurs women and story are great. The caveman language makes it hard at times to understand what is going on but I give the director credit for being creative. Go and see this movie it is entertaining in many ways.".

	schema:headline " Hammer's depiction of life in prehistory";
	schema:reviewBody "One Million Years B.C. is actually a serious 1966 attempt to depict life in prehistory for cavemen and women. Many reviewers complain that human beings and dinosaurs NEVER occupied the same period in prehistory but this is merely our best presentday educated guess. Who knows? Twenty years from now we may discover evidence that people existed at the same time as dinosaurs. The fact is that we DON'T KNOW precisely what it was like for people in prehistory and never truly will all we can do is guess based on the evidence at hand. This movie is simply a serious attempt to show what it may have been like for people IF they lived at the same time as dinosaurs. Capeesh?I said this was a serious depiction but there are admittedly some humorous aspects. For instance the mulletheaded blond men of the Shell Tribe and the indoor cave sets straight out of the original Star Trek TV series.Other than that I can't think of anything bad to say. The location photography from the Canary Islands is aweinspiring and Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur animation is excellent holding up very well even to this day take for instance the way the allosaur and later trex are shown breathing in their dying moments. Needless to say great attention to detail. The movie even throws in a couple of superimposed iguanas and a tarantula.Oh yeah most guys understandably rave about Raquel Welch as Loana and her infamous cavegirl bikini and she is indeed stunning but  believe it or not  there are a few other female castmembers that are more beautiful due to better womanly curves like Lisa Thomas as the blonde Sura essentially Loana's sidekick in the Shell Tribe and Yvonne Horner as the darkhaired Ullah of the Rock Tribe. The statuesque Martine Beswick is also on hand as Nupondi of the Rock Tribe. I must not forget to mention the outstanding musical score it's very fitting very primal.Lastly there's no talking as we understand it only grunting and primitive lingo. Bottom line One Million Years B.C. is enjoyable and highly recommended unless of course you have pompous hangups about supposed historical chronology.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE A".

For a movie without real dialog the actors do a good job portraying their characters. However the best part of the movie including Miss Welch are the creatures. Other than a few real life things blown up in size they are brilliant. Harryhausen just knows how to make creatures. They react to things they are more than just rampaging beasts. Also his creations always have great sounds. The all time greatest is when the baby Allosaurus is impaled. It's death scream is the most memorable noise I've ever heard from a movie monster.

Harryhausen's dinosaurs look fabulous it puts Jurassic Park and all those other GCI beasts to shame! This is how I want my monsters to be in films animated via stopmotion. Imagine what LOTR would've looked like if Peter Jackson had used a stopmotion puppet instead of CGI for the Cave Troll! PJ is a big Harryhausen fan too...Alas for me this isn't the greatest work Harryhausen has done that has to go to 'Jason and the Argonaughts' but it's still canny viewing. The plot is at times very slow so unless you actually care about the war between the shellrock people you'll probably get bored quickly...aaaawwgghhh  but that CGI pherodyctal flying dinobird looked fab!

	onyx:emotionText "Although the concept of this movie may be interesting if it wasn't for Raquel Welch's curvy figure in a fluffy bikini and Ray Harryhausen's AWESOME special effects then most people probably wouldn't see much appealing about this movie. Harryhausen's dinosaurs look fabulous it puts Jurassic Park and all those other GCI beasts to shame! This is how I want my monsters to be in films animated via stopmotion. Imagine what LOTR would've looked like if Peter Jackson had used a stopmotion puppet instead of CGI for the Cave Troll! PJ is a big Harryhausen fan too...Alas for me this isn't the greatest work Harryhausen has done that has to go to 'Jason and the Argonaughts' but it's still canny viewing. The plot is at times very slow so unless you actually care about the war between the shellrock people you'll probably get bored quickly...aaaawwgghhh  but that CGI pherodyctal flying dinobird looked fab! PJ should've used that in LOTR for the Fell Beasts!!Well it's still great viewing rent the DVD get some popcorn...and enjoy the view!";

This isn't intentional humor the movie was meant to be taken seriously. Leave your brain at the door doesn't quite cover it. I'll add a bit more on that at the end of this review.So apart from that gross mistake how is the movie? The two sentence version is It's a lot of fun. Rent it. On its own terms it really isn't that bad. That's partly because of the unrealistic but spectacular sight of Raquel Welch in her primitive swimsuit but even apart from that. The story comes down to the interaction between two very different groups of primitive humans. The rock people of caveman Tumak are viciously competitive within their own tribe showing little consideration for each other willing to kill each other at the least excuse. Tumak is driven out of the tribe by his father during one such squabble.Tumak wanders until he is taken in by a seacoast tribe. The first of this tribe to find him are a bevy of spearfishing maidens led by Loana Raquel Welch. Her people are much less savage. Where the Rock Tribe squabble among themselves in their filthy cave these seacoast people sit around quietly doing useful tasks and share among each other without any fuss.Of course we know that Tumak will have to settle his issues with his own tribe and we know that Loana and her people will get drawn in somehow. To say any more would turn into a spoiler. It's not really that ridiculous a story though. What makes it seem so are the grossly inaccurate elements that I mentioned at the beginning.And I really have to wonder about that. Of course Hollywood doesn't have the greatest track record for getting its facts straight but still. It's one thing not to be able to distinguish say between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods for dinosaurs or to be hazy on when modern humans evolved. It's quite another to show either dinosaurs or Homo Sapiens around at this period. Were the movie makers really this ignorant about prehistory? Did they know better but play to the general public's perceived ignorance? Yes by all means keep a sense of humor about it but it would still be interesting to know what was going through their minds.The production values are really quite good by the way. There's some impressive scenery and the special effects are well enough done for the time.".

Director Don Chaffey's 'screw the facts' approach might not win him any awards for historical accuracy but it does allow him to deliver loads of spectacular action set pieces in which hot women in skimpy togs are frequently in mortal danger from a variety of impressive stopmotion creatures courtesy of FX legend Ray Harryhausen who also worked with Chaffey on Jason and the Argonauts. And dinosaurs plus babes equals loads of fun in my book!John Richardson plays Tumak a member of the savage Rock tribe who is forced to leave the safety of his cave when he has a runin with his father chief Akhoba. After wandering through miles of barren volcanic wasteland a weary Tumak stumbles into the coastal domain of the peaceful Shell tribe where he is found by a fishing group comprising of several extremely fit bigbreasted blondes led by stunner Loana Racquel Welch sporting her iconic fur bikini.Tumak is taken to the Shell tribe's cave spacious dry with colourful murals and a sea view and is nursed back to health. He also learns the art of using a spear which comes in handy when a hungry Allosaurus decides to dine at Chez Shell Tribe Tumak saves the day slaying the beast but not until a couple of men have been snacked upon.Having proved himself a hero Tumak tries to help himself to a spear belonging to one of the of the Shell people who isn't too keen on letting his prize possession go.

Together the comely cavecouple head back to Rock tribe country dodging headhunting troglodytes and sparring dinos on the way where trouble awaits for them in the form of a jealous exgirlfriend brunette Hammer hottie Martine Beswick a hungry Pteranodon and a volcano that is about to erupt.With its continuously breathtaking shots of vast inhospitable landscapes which were actually filmed in Tenerife and Lanzarote a marvellous sweeping orchestral score by Mario Nascimbene and stunning effects from Harryhausen One Million Years B.C. is wonderful entertainment for all fans of prehistoric monster mayhem. Despite that all of the dialogue is indecipherable 'cavespeak' the film is gripping stuff and never bores on the contrary it whips along at a fair pace with a giant creature of some sort always attacking at regular intervals. In fact only the rather abrupt ending spoils an otherwise faultless slice of outrageously hokey entertainment.Highlight of the film apart from Welch and Beswick rolling around on the floor together like wildcats is the brilliant Allosaurus attack which still looks very impressive 40 years on.If you haven't already seen One Million Years B.C. pull up a rock in front of the TV and treat yourself to a true classic of fantastic film!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Brave One was beautifully crafted in 1957 by blacklisted author Robert Rich and immediately established itself as a superb classic. The tale is of a small Mexican boy and his enduring love for his courageous pet bull. Set in Mexico a boy discovers a cow has been killed after delivering and orphaning a male offspring. Naming the calf Gitano The boy become it's friend and caretaker. Realizing the boy's loneliness the parents encourage the bond but fail to emphasis the eventual fate of the animal. Throughout the Calf's life the boy's love inexorably growing unaware of his parent's financial responsibility to the bull's true owner. By the time the animal has grown to market size and becomes a cash commodity the boy's parents are torn between their son's love and their duty to the Patrone. Using subterfuge the parents separate the two. Returning from a fool's errand the boy discovers his best friend and lifetime companion has been sold for the purpose of bull fighting and its eventual destruction. Despite the frantic warnings of his parents that it's too late to save the animal the small boy adroitly played by Michel Rey sets off to save his courageous friend from certain death. The boy visits everyone from the Patrone to the Governnor of Mexico in a vain attempt to alter the fate of his pet. The film culminates with the boy's magnificent bravery before an arena filled with spectators. True love for any animal has never had a more poignant test of love and courage. For any viewer with a human heart this tearwrenching film will leave you joyfully weeping. ".

	schema:headline " The film I loved when I was a kid.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw THE BRAVE ONE in 1957 during its second run at the Johnston Theatre in Rhode Island when I was fifteen years old. It was for me a captivating story about a Mexican boy who has a pet bull Gitano. He falls so in love with it that the bullfarm owner grants it to him as a personal pet. We have had many boylovesdog films. Why not a boylovesbull movie? Everything goes blissfully well for the preadolescent taurophile until the owner's death when the farm changes hands and there is no record of of the special privilege. The bull is sent off to a Mexico City bull ring and our young hero Leonardo pursues his beloved in an attempt to save it from possible death. He even has the good fortune to have an audience with the president of Mexico who grants the pet a special favor. Too late unfortunately for the beast is released into the ring.  But this brave one resists his picadores and torero Fermin Rivera so strenuously that the spectators demand an indulto or reprieve from death and he is granted one in the exciting final scene. Bull and boy exit the ring together in bliss. This is actually  great family entertainment. The film has a lot going for it a simple but captivating story luscious CinemaScope Technicolor photography by brilliant British cinematographer Jack Cardiff a wonderful and winning musical score by Victor Young I once went all over creation looking for an LP copy of the sound track. I still have it and it is a collector's item. The young hero Leonardo was played by gifted British child actor Michel Ray who was so effective in other films as well like THE DIVIDED HEART FLOOD TIDE THE TIN STAR and even in a stint as Peter O'Toole's young Arab lover in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. I have his autographed photo. Does anyone know what became of Michel Ray as an adult? I would like to know. This film when I was an adolescent was one of my guilty pleasures and I pursued it all over creation as Leonardo pursued Gitano. I do not have quite the same feelings for it now but I certainly remember it with tender fondness.".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent picture The Brave One has come down in history as an example of the incredible stupidity and hypocrisy of the blacklist. With Dalton Trumbo's struggle now a subject of a major motion picture a new and hopefully more enlightened audience can appreciate this wonderful film.I'll leave it to the professional communist hunters to sniff out any left wing Marxist propaganda in The Brave One. All I saw is a touching film from RKO set in Mexico with no major or even minor American stars in it about a young boy who wants to save his beloved pet a bull named Gitano who is raised as a fighting bull which means he gets one appearance only in the arena to die at the hands of a matador. Young Michel Ray is the boy Miguel and his father is Mexican film star Rodolfo Hoyos who did a few film appearances north of the Mexican border.Young Ray is so determined to save his bull from slaughter he goes to none other than the President of Mexico to gain pardon for his bull. After that it's a tense race against time played against the background of Gitano giving his best against one of Mexico's best matadors. The bullfight scenes are outstanding and outstandingly photographed.But a lot of this film is carried on the performance of Michel Ray who comes over so much like a real kid not just another kid actor. One of the best performances by a juvenile ever in the history of motion pictures and sad he did not receive any recognition for same.I found it ironical that it was RKO on its last legs as a studio that produced this film. Just a couple of years earlier it was owned by Howard Hughes who got tired of it and gave it up to die a lingering death. Had Hughes still been in charge no way would The Brave One been done at his studio even with a pseudonym for a blacklisted writer.That's how most people know The Brave One today when a later embarrassed Academy gave an Oscar to Robert Rich for Best Original Screenplay. It was Dalton Trumbo one of the infamous Hollywood 10 who wrote it but it was after the award was given that that fact was discovered. That kind of hypocrisy exposed could have also had a large part in giving the blacklist an ignominious death. Maybe as much as Trumbo being hired openly to write the screenplay for Spartacus.Shame on the studio bosses who while they supported getting these subversives out of Hollywood they also did not want to lose their talents either.With Trumbo's own life now a motion picture maybe his work will get more critical review and The Brave One should be a standout there.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a young Mexican peasant boy who comes across a cow that is dying beneath a fallen tree branch and saves the calf she is birthing a strong bond is established between the boy and the calf a bond that persists as the calf turns into an aggressive bull that is being groomed for the the bullring. This bellicose beast is referred to as being brave in this film.Ownership of the bull is a subject of debate throughout the film and at one point the boy gains an audience with the Mexican President to try to resolve the issue. Outside of the story being utterly preposterous I had no problem with it.This was filmed in Mexico in CinemaScope using highly saturated colors. There are some beautiful scenes of rural Mexico as well as a tour of Mexico City. The sweeping score by Victor Young invites grand emotion but it stuck me as too exuberant in the style of many scores of 1950s movies. The acting is uniformly wooden.The highlights of the film are the captivating and extended bull fighting scenes. No matter what your opinion is of this controversial sport it will be hard for you not to recognize its appeal based on these scenes. When an American visitor to Mexico expresses her dismay about the sport her Mexican host notes that boxing and fox hunting are accepted so why not bullfighting? He goes on to say that Mexicans know that death is never very far away but that Americans are outraged by pain and as for death they may pass a law against it at any time.What attracted me to this movie was seeing that it is based on an Oscarwinning story by Dalton Trumbo. The movie credits the story to one Robert Rich who was a front for Trumbo during the period of his being blacklisted during the McCarthy era when Trumbo appeared before a Congressional committee and was threatened with a Contempt of Congress citation for not answering questions he told the committee that that would be appropriate since he had nothing but contempt for them. After having seen other movies with strong themes based on Trumbo screenplays such as Lonely are the Brave Papillon and Spartacus I was looking forward to this film but it does not live up to the quality of those. I was puzzled as to how Trumbo could have lapsed into such sentimentality but then it occurred to me that he must have identified with the bull who defied attempts to be constrained and ultimately prevailed just as Trumbo himself.".

But Qiu Ju may well be Yimou's most thought provoking film leaving you pondering the messages a long time after the film has ended.Qiu Ju's husband has been kicked where it counts by the village chief. The only bit of justice Qiu Ju wants is an apology. It seems to be a simple enough request but her search for the apology proves to be elusive as she encounters a legal system more interested in its own red tape than in the needs of ordinary people.But this is not Erin Brockovich where the sides of good and bad are easily defined. The people in the legal system Qiu Ju encounters are genuinely decent folks. They are also unfortunately a bit clueless. And Qiu Ju is not beyond reproach herself. At the conclusion of the film even she is realizing that she has pushed the matter too far.Just how far should one go to seek justice in this world? Even if you are totally in the right does there come a time when you must let the matter rest for your own sake as well as everybody else's? There are no easy answers.This is another great performance by Gong Li in the title role. She may be one of the most beautiful women in the world but here she is not above playing dowdy. And as usual Zhang Yimou is nearly flawless in his direction. He gives a wonderful tip of the hat to the late French director Francois Truffaut in the end echoing that famous final shot of Truffaut's The 400 Blows.But this is a film that will stick with you well past that last shot.".

	schema:headline " Life Lessons in an Asian Village";
	schema:reviewBody "After earning film festival awards and critical acclaim worldwide for his powerful tragedies Director Zhang Yimou explores new themes in 'The Story of Qiu Ju.'Once again he examines social injustice but this time avoids dark visions. The tone is ironic but not angry or tragic and the story often flashes with humor and wit. Some critics describe this film as a protest by Zhang Yimou against the Chinese government. Yet the tale could be placed in any village in East Asia or indeed in any time and place one finds misunderstanding wounded pride conflict and resolution.Gong Li so beautiful in other films reveals her acting versatility by portraying Qiu Ju roughly pronounced as 'show chew' as a hugely pregnant peasant. Gong Li had prepared for this role by living for months in a village of Northeast China to learn the local dialect and to get a feeling for this rural culture.The story begins when Qiu Ju demands an apology from her village chief who had injured her husband during a quarrel with a blow to the groin. She goes to higher and higher levels of government in her appeals for this apology even after her husband and others urge her to settle for money. At the end after some surprises she and the chief have both learned some life lessons. In the opening scene Zhang Yimou draws us steadily into the rhythms and mood of the story when his camera gradually brings us past strolling pedestrians to introduce us to Qiu Ju and another peasant woman helping to push her disabled husband in a cart. We can see in this shot and in other scenes that bystanders were not aware what was going on.Some even give puzzled looks at the camera adding to the film's gentle humor.Many other episodes gradually take us further into the culture and its story. For example when Qiu Ju comes to the local government office to start her appeals we first wait and watch while two teenagers register their marriage. The district administrator has some fun by asking the shy youngsters if they will still love each other after their wedding night. After hearing Qiu Ju's story this district administrator urges her to settle for cash from the village chief. Yet she pushes onward patiently assisted in this by her woman companion in appeals for an apology to higher and higher levels of government. One of the film's best portraits is of this little peasant woman quietly standing by Qiu Ju's side.She never questions nor complains we all hope for friends like that.The film's quiet tone and slow pace also give us time to appreciate some underlying social criticisms. Qiu Ju hires a lawyer to write and deliver a petition to the court. He tells her he will make sure that justice is served. She seems impressed. 'So!! You get money to make sure the right thing is done. Being a lawyer is good!!'Yet it doesn't turn out so well for her. The highest court in Xian the provincial capital has an impressive courtroom and set of procedures. Its jury of several judges collects testimony and ponders at length but once again the verdict is upheld..money but no apology. This seems to be the end of the tale. Some big surprises turn the story in a new direction. She and the chief next learn to respect each other butSee for yourself how it all turns out. You won't forget the vision of Qiu Ju at the end bewildered and regretful getting a verdict in her favor but that she did not want.Those who have lived in any East Asian village will understand why Qiu Ju was urged to take money but not force the chief to lose face. As one Chinese woman explained to me '.we and our families for generations lived too close to each other. We just had to get along. This was not always easy..' She added that 'The Story of Qiu Ju' is the most understanding and affectionate portrait she had ever seen of the rural culture she knew as a child. Some Thai friends told me that the film also evoked childhood memories of their village life where a Buddhist monk would arbitrate personal disputes and act to restore calm.PS This film was made in 1992 after the ending of the Chinese cultural revolution enabled Zhang Yimou to enroll in the new Beijing Film Academy. Since then he's made many films with worldwide renown including 'Raise the Red Lantern' and 'Red Sorghum' with Gong Li and more recently 'Not One Less' and 'Hero'. You should be able to find 'Story of Qiu Ju' at any good video shop. It's already a classic.".

She takes her quest for the apology up the chain of officialdom.I couldn't get enough of the scenery  houses city carts clothes painted paper banners dried peppers and corn  and the faces of people.

The nearby village is somewhat familiar to her but her trip to the city may have been her first.  Watching her trying to find her way around haggling for fair rates and help from a produce buyer a bikecart driver a letter writer a hotelier and a lawyer was a lot of fun.  Her trips seemed like a great introduction to the culture.One of the things I loved was how the families and neighbors kept having complex interactions with each other throughout the ordeal.  And the social roles in this were interesting Farmvillage chief to farmer sister to sister daughterinlaw to her inlaws Party officials to their hierarchy and to citizens country to city women's role in general as in what sex babies are preferred and the strong stance of a specific woman like Qiu Ju who seemed to be empowered as much as frustrated by the system and by her family and neighbors.I read reviews of this as a negative comment on bureaucracy.  If so it showed a remarkably humane one. Flaws were on display but the overall tone was of acceptance.The sudden ending left me feeling for the main characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Most Chinese movies are about victims of the culture or political system or how beautiful you men and women are kept apart or forced together by forces outside their control.  This movie is completely different. It is a simple story about the ordinary Chinese people you can meet on the street and in their homes today and their ordinary lives.  It is an amazingly accurate portrayal unlike anything I have seen before.  I only spent 3 weeks in China but this movie brought back the feel of China its people and organizations.Qxi Ju wants an apology from the Chief of the commune for kicking her husband in the groin.  This is a story about her travels from the commune to the big city to try to get action from various bureaucracies. Although she is treated kindly and with much respect by the bureaucrats she never gets exactly what she wants.  It is fun to watch naive country girl Qxi Ju quickly learn about master doing things in the big city.For me the plot in this movie is secondary.  It is each of the simple scenes that make this movie wonderful The doctor's office is heated by a wood stove and the doctor chops the wood and feeds the fire.  Qxi Ju's sister gives here a ride to town on the back of her bicycle on a snow covered unpaved road.  They use dried chili peppers to trade for money to get a ride to the next town.  Qxi Ju negotiates for the price of each thing she buys.  The scenes all seem so realistic and beautifully photographed.Yimou Zhang also made Raise the Red Lantern which gets higher praise but that movie is about a world that is harder for me to relate to.  This movie is like real life and real people and China today.".

	schema:headline " A parable of modern China";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a story about saving face and winning face and what can happen if you carry things too far. Gong Li stars as Qiu Ju a peasant woman with child whose husband is kicked in the groin by the local chief. She wants an apology. The chief of course will not apologize since he would then lose face. Both are stubborn and obstinate. Proud and determined Qiu Ju steers her way through the bureaucracy from the village to the district to the city but the thing she desires an apology from the chief eludes her. He cannot apologize because he has only sired daughters. He has license he believes in his heart because he was insulted by her husband who said he raised only hens. The Chinese locales from village roads to big city avenues are presented with stunning clarity so that the color and the sense of life is vivid and compelling. Director Zhang Yimou. forces us to see. From the opening shot of the mass of people in the city walking toward us out of which emerges Qiu Ju to the feast celebrating the child's first month of life near the end we feel the humanity of the great mass of the Chinese people.In a sense this is a gentle satire of the bureaucratic state that modern China has become. But Zhang Yimou emphasizes the bounty of China and not its poverty. There is a sense of abundance with the corn drying in the eaves the sheets of dough being cut into noodles the fat cows on the roads and the bright red chili drying in the sun. There is snow on the ground and the roads are unpaved but there is an idyllic feeling of warmth emanating from the people. One gets the idea that fairness and tolerance will prevail.In another sense this is a parable about the price of things and how that differs from what is really of value. So often is price mentioned in the movie that I can tell you that a yuan at the time of the movie was worth about a dollar in its buying power. Four and a half yuan for a pound of chili five yuan as a fair price for a short cab ride twenty yuan for a legal letter. Getting justice in the strict sense is what Qiu Ju demands. Her affable husband would settle for a lot less. He is the wiser of the two. Notice how Qiu Ju is acutely sensitive to price. She bargains well and avoids most of the rip offs of the big city. But what is the value of being a member of the community? This is a lesson she needs to learn and as the movie ends she does.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

The bureaucratic nightmare she endures making repeated trips to the city to seek justice exposes her to a system she didn't know existed a completely convoluted and impregnable one that operates solely by standards and practices totally devoid of compassion or an understanding of the people it governs.This is a small film an earlier work by master Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou To Live Ju Dou but what really makes it work is Gong as Qiu Ju. Every effect of this effectless society registers on her face mostly in the form of surprise at the promises unkept and disappointment at the lack of concern by officials who are supposed to be responsible to the people. She makes us care deeply about Qiu Ju even though we may not be able to identify directly with her circumstances but even beyond this she makes these provincial circumstances universal by being the everywoman someone who just wants the people in charge to do what's right without it necessarily having any adverse impact on themselves. Gong's ability to inject political situations with sincere human emotion has made her an ideal representative of the message running through all of Zhang's films she has appeared in several of them but beyond this she simply is a great actress who should eventually become as world renowned as Joan Chen once was.What makes this film even more prescient is how well many Americans may identify with the nightmares presented by a government hierarchy overstuffed with I just work here bureaucrats. And the ending is infused with a poignant irony that will hit home with anyone who has in their own lives found that time heals all wounds.".

	schema:headline " The Reason for Qiu Ju's Determination";
	schema:reviewBody "When her husband insults a neighbor and is nearly 'emasculated' a peasant woman goes to great lengths to secure justice. Many people in the West may not understand why this woman is so determined to right such a 'minor' wrong. In Chinese culture an assault on another man's honor is not viewed as a 'minor' thing having children is very important and carries a greater social significance than it does in the West. It is expected of every man and having a son especially to work in the fields for the good of the family and carry on the family name has been worshipped as a Confucian ethic for centuries. China is still very much a paternalistic society despite Communist reformand the 'one child' policy has only reinforced the old Chinese adage that if you bear a girlbear a beautiful one if you bear a son bear an intelligent one. So understandablyfrom the viewpoint of Qiu Junot only does her husband suffer but her entire family name and honor suffers too when the man is attacked in a 'sacred place' his gonads. The village chief the fellow who delivered the disabling kickhas also been dishonored by the husband's insult about having hens and not boys. By kicking the offending man in the balls the village chief wanted to save his face hence the stalemate. But for Qiu Ju and certainly in Chinese eyes the greater wrong is the assault on her husband's reproductive organs. A delightful movie so well acted with quite a few funny moments surrounding a serious issue. Zhang Yimou is one fine director.".

Many people in the West may not understand why this woman is so determined to right such a 'minor' wrong. In Chinese culture an assault on another man's honor is not viewed as a 'minor' thing having children is very important and carries a greater social significance than it does in the West. It is expected of every man and having a son especially to work in the fields for the good of the family and carry on the family name has been worshipped as a Confucian ethic for centuries.

One example is when Qiu Ju and her sisterinlaw were in the city and they had just bought city clothes. They looked very entertaining in those clothes but also that scene was not made purely for comedy because the writers were also trying to show that they were very countryside oriented and had probably never been to the city and they were trying to show how their lack of experience through their incorrect wearing of clothing.".

But it's the kind of film where you get the point right away and you have to spend 100 minutes watching the filmmaker stumble toward the foregone conclusion. Gong Li plays the title character a hugely pregnant woman. Her husband just got kicked in the nuts by their farming community's chief and Qiu Ju wants an apology. Unfortunately none of the officials she takes the case to can actually force the guy to apologize. They can make him dole out monetary compensation but that's not good enough for Qiu Ju. Every time she doesn't get the results she wants she attempts to go to a higher level of authority. It's an amusing situation but the film kind of plods along slowly. I won't demand Zhang Yimou stick to his wonderful visual talents but it is disappointing how mundane this film looks and feels. The worst crime perhaps is that Gong Li isn't given much acting to do. I love the final look on her face when the film ends but I think pretty much anyone could have played Qiu Ju. I know it sounds like I hated it but I didn't. I just wasn't overly impressed with it despite its obvious qualities.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Zhang Yimou as in many of his films stars Gong Li in the title role. This film adaption of Chen Yuanbin's novella The Wan Family's Lawsuit tells the story of a peasant woman Qiu Ju Gong Li who lives in a rural area of China. When her husband is kicked in the groin by the village head Qiu Ju despite her pregnancy travels around looking for a apology. When apology isn't given she goes to the nearby town to find the policemen to press charges and later a big city to deal with its bureaucrats to try to find justice for her husband. Her lackback husband on the other hand is just happier to just move on and let bygones be bygones but for Qiu Ju it becomes a never ending cycle dealing with lawyers judges and courts. It's a humorous fable of justice that shows how justice is distributed varies between classes. Gong Li is wonderful as Qiu Ju a tenacious farmer determined to right a wrong done to her husband. If watching this film with hopes of seeing Gong Li's ravishing beauty you will be disappointed. She is blandly dressed and pregnant through most of the film. Defying all stereotypes of the passive Chinese woman she remains unbowed by the frustrations of bureaucracy in her quixotic search for dignity. In this case The Story of Qiu Ju shows how the legal authorities find money as a just compensation whereas Qiu Ju finds an apology more appropriate. The movie has a Frank Capra Mr. Smith goes to Washington feel to it with a simpleminded person go to the government looking for change. Also the camera work whose influence comes directly from the Italian Nero Realism films such as Francis Truffaunt's 'the 400 Blows' as the ending nearly mimics that ending shot using the freeze frame and close up. The story feels like Bicycle Thieves due to it's well narrated story about the modern day parable that explores the gray area between seeking justice and exacting revenge is chilling. It is a cautionary tale as well since it shows that justice is not an absolute. Justice can be a somewhat intangible concept  something that needs to be defined by the human experience. One person's injustice can be another person's justice. The movie intent to expose the daunting bureaucratic Chinese government with it's use of comedy drama and political satire. Although the film takes place in China there is a sense that it could be just about anywhere in the world since the struggles contained within are so universal in nature. The snakelike pathways of the bureaucracy to an unexpected outcome is a universal problem that is as much in evidence in a Democracy as well as Communist. The resulting film as an exercise in frustration is as essential an addition to the literature of the law as Dickens' Bleak House or Trollope's Orley Farm and should be on the curriculum of every law school. The movie is a bit of a frustration to get through as well. The faults of the film are that the movie is hard to get through in one sitting there are long periods of nontalking and nothing going on screen and the never ending tragic results of Qiu Ju not getting her way. The slowpaced temp of the film really hurt the film. The kick is never shown but the entire film is based around it. I would love to see the action being case but having the kick not show add another layer of mystery. The humor is dry but it's funny that one point that the director seems eager to make is that the people are not hungry in China. Nearly ever other scene shows people eating. The film lacks any of the visually stunning as his other film 'The Road Home' but it's does what it can with the shots they have. The rural scenes and settings are real. The village journeys and settings are all real China not a Hollywood set. The background actors are incredibly real people who don't work for screen actors guild. It's feel like Communist China. While the film might be for all audiences it's worth checking out".

	schema:reviewBody "Many perhaps would like to limit Qiu Ju to a quiet disquisition on the inefficacy and passionless drive of Chinese bureaucracy. The only matter that is truly ineffectual is making such a rash and shallow statement about a film that actually bears more emotion for bureaucracy than against it.Each instance of appeal to the officers of the government raises the level of kindness and mercy shown to little country Qiu Ju venturing so far into a civilized wilderness packed with wolves. Whenever she is addressed by those in the government they offer every motion of help that they can. The only thing they're unable to demand of the offending chief is an apology. It would seem that the only kind of justice that any government may demand of a human being has been supplied. The undercurrent of The Story of Qiu Ju is its distinct relation to aspects of August Strindberg's sexist realism. Qiu Ju is portrayed as stubborn and unreasonable insisting that an apology be made when so much monetary compensation has been offered. It is a solemn portrait of a woman in a maledominated universe.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many perhaps would like to limit Qiu Ju to a quiet disquisition on the inefficacy and passionless drive of Chinese bureaucracy. The only matter that is truly ineffectual is making such a rash and shallow statement about a film that actually bears more emotion for bureaucracy than against it.Each instance of appeal to the officers of the government raises the level of kindness and mercy shown to little country Qiu Ju venturing so far into a civilized wilderness packed with wolves. Whenever she is addressed by those in the government they offer every motion of help that they can. The only thing they're unable to demand of the offending chief is an apology. It would seem that the only kind of justice that any government may demand of a human being has been supplied. The undercurrent of The Story of Qiu Ju is its distinct relation to aspects of August Strindberg's sexist realism. Qiu Ju is portrayed as stubborn and unreasonable insisting that an apology be made when so much monetary compensation has been offered. It is a solemn portrait of a woman in a maledominated universe.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very brief review of Red Sorghum 1987 Ju Dou 1990 Raise the Red Lantern 1991 The Story of Qiu Ju 1992 and To Live 1994 five films by Zhang Yimou. Each film stars actress Gong Li each works as a companionpiece to the other and each deals almost exclusively with the oppression of women within early 20th century China.Zhang's debut Red Sorghum stars Gong Li as Young Nine a peasant who is sold to a wealthy leper. Things only get worse for Nine who must fend off a series of rapists mean men and the Japanese Army itself all the while running a successful winery. Throughout the film Zhang uses boxes deep reds and tight squares to amplify Nine's sexist surroundings. Indeed the film opens with Nine literally forced into a box a social reality which she spends the film attempting to break free of or even transform. For Zhang China wasn't disrupted by the Japanese invasion it was hell long before. Like most of Zhang's films during this period Sorghum sketches the cultural and socioeconomic conditions which spurred China with hopeful arms toward Maoism.Zhang's next film Ju Dou covers similar material. Here Gong Li plays Ju Dou a woman sold to a violent oaf When I buy an animal I treat it as I wish! who owns a fabric dying establishment. After her husband is crippled Ju Dou forges a relationship with Yang Jinshan a relative. When Ju Dou and Jinshan have a child together the kid grows up into a mean brute. Like Sorghum Ju Duo is a tragedy obsessed with rich reds boxes and patriarchal violence. Whilst its plot superficially echoes Zhang's own adulterous thenscandalous affair with Gong Li Zhang seems more interested in the way Ju Dou and Jinshan hide their illicit affair from other villagers. For Zhang the duo's tacit submission to social mores merely validates the notion that their love is scandalous and so merely validates the symbolic power of the crippled patriarch a power which Ju Dou's son must  as per his mother's very own actions  thereby respect and avenge.The arbitrary nature of power and how this power is always symbolic and always unconsciously maintained via ritual personal belief and shared delusions is itself the obsession of Zhang's Raise the Red Lantern. Here Gong Li again plays a woman sold to a wealthy man. This man has several other wives all of whom begin to violently fight one another in an attempt to win the patriarch's adoration. Is it the fate of women to become concubines? a character asks pointing to the film's deft critique of feudal relations. Zhang's first masterpiece Lantern is again obsessed with reds boxes and sequestered women though here Zhang replaces the voluptuous colours camera work and widescreen Cinemascopes of his previous films with something more restrained. Because of this Zhang's conveying of claustrophobia and oppression of mind and spirit pushed to madness feels all the more powerful.Next came Zhang's The Story of Qiu Ju. A near masterpiece it stars Gong Li as Qui Ju a peasant farmer who embarks on a quest to avenge her husband who's had his crotch kicked in by a village leader. More emasculated by this attack than her own husband Qui Ju's quest takes her all across China dealing with a Chinese bureaucracy which seems quite helpful polite and even rational. And yet still this bureaucracy does not please Qiu Ju. It thinks in terms of commodities monetary recompense and punishment whilst Qiu Ju like Zhang Yimou himself whose previous films were banned without explanation by Chinese authorities seems more interested in acquiring a shuafa a simple explanation and apology. By the film's end both the primitive justice of rural China and the civilized justice of modern China are simultaneously mocked praised and shown to be thoroughly incompatible. Zhang's first neorealist film Qiu Ju was shot with hidden cameras amateur actors and so is filled with subtle observations cruel ironies and beautiful sketches of peasant life.One of Zhang's finest films To Live followed. It stars Gong Li as Jiazhen the wife of a wealthy man Ge You who is addicted to gambling. When this gambling results in the family losing its mansions riches and status Jiazhen and her husband are forced onto the streets. Ironically this setback saves the family the Cultural Revolution arrives and with China's shift to nascent communism all wealthy land owners are demonised attacked and killed.Unlike most films which tackle life under Mao's Great Leap Forward To Live carefully juggles the good and bad of what was essentially a nation shirking off feudalism monarchs uniting and then trying clumsily to cook up some form of egalitarian society. This quest results in all manners of contradictions and sociopolitical paradoxes community solidarity and a simple life save our heroes but their world is one of paranoia danger and in which everyone and everything is accused of being reactionary. The film ends with Jiazhen's daughter dying a death which is the result of both unchecked consumption a doctor dies gobbling food and communist reorganisation all competent doctors have been killedjailed for being counterrevolutionary. This jab at communism got the film banned in China further highlighting the insecurity of the regime. Ironically Maoism saw massive positive health care reformations and saw an improvement in mortality rates which at times surpassed even then contemporary Britain and parts of America life expectancy doubled from 32 years in the 1940s to 65 years in the 1970s. But such things don't concern Zhang. Spanning decades To Live is mostly a broad account of life love loss and growth the personal and political all unfolding upon a canvas that is devastatingly cruel. Significantly the film's title is both adjectival and a command this is what life is but one must nevertheless always push on. Gong Li and Ge You in particular are excellent.810  See Murder on a Sunday Morning.".

The operative lesson from this movie Be careful what you wish for you just might get it.Having visited the Chinese country outside Tianjin and Beijing in 1999 this movie is the most realistic I have ever seen. This film serves as a geniune window into what everyday life is like in rural and urban China. The humorous scene of the shy young couple applying for the marraige license seems almost too real as if they had a Candid Camera on them. I am most curious how the makers of this film were able to plop one of the most famous and most beautiful stars of mainland China in the middle of the many onlocation scenes and not have anyone recognize her?? Although in a couple of scenes it looks like people might have. Doubtless her unflattering costume emphasizing her pregnancy helped disguise her for most of the movie. Also note the distant camera shots which enables the camera to be hidden and inconspicuous and also not draw attention to Gong Li. Either that or the makers must have used the most extras ever hired for a movie. I would like to find out more about the methods used to make this film. In any case the results are another delightful and glorious piece from Zhang Yimou.".

In that case Qiu Ju may very likely get murdered and disappear into thin air.  One person's life in China is not viewed precious like in the West.  Powerplay removes anyone in the way even LIU Shaoqi the 2ndman in power before the Cultural Revolution of 1966 was gotten rid of because he endangered Mao's position like to see a movie on that story but it's guaranteed banned material in China.Qiu Ju is admirable because she is earnest and persistent.

If this spirit gets into everybody in China we will see a revolution.  The student's movement in Beijing 1989 was one of such and the result blood shedding.

She would hate to find the villagehead tortured in prison Qiu Ju may not know it but oh yes there is severe torture in China's prisons all over the country or even sent to labor camp where one would wither away.  The truth behind this movie is China's bureaucrats never listen to people's voice.  And why would they?  They are appointed at high levels not elected.

Losing his temper Wan states that Wang can do nothing more than raise hens meaning that Wang is a worthless man because he has no son. Angered Wang beats Wan and even kicks him in the privates. This incident will eventually lead to a ball of bureaucratic red tape as big as a boulder.Recuperating at home and letting his privates air out Wan is willing to let the matter pass but his wife Qiu Ju Gong Li argues her case to the Party official Officer Li and he orders Chief Wang to pay for Wan's medical bills and lost wages. Yet this is not what Qiu Ju desires. She wants Chief Wang to explain why he kicked her husband in the family jewels and apologize for doing so but being that he is a proud man and feels that he was wronged by Wan the chief refuses to do so. He even goes as far as to toss the 200 Yuan he is supposed to give Wan in front of Qiu Ju and tells her to pick up each bill individually so that she bows to him twenty times.Infuriated by Chief Wand the very pregnant Qiu Ju with her young sisterinlaw Meizi in tow heads for the village office. When the verdict is the same as the one handed down by Officer Li Qiu Ju and Meizi head for the county seat. When Chief Wang is only ordered to pay 50 Yuan more Qiu Ju and Meizi make their way to the big city.While on its surface this film might at first seem as nothing more than one woman's search for justice it is much more than that. This film is openly critical to those in power. When Qiu Ju demands Chief Wang to apologize not only does he refuse to do so he dares her to try to sue him. He believes that and is probably right in most cases that his membership and loyalty to the party will protect him from a commoner such as Qiu Ju. Qiu Ju doubts the system when she wonders if someone like her has a chance against someone in Chief Wang's position.Outside of politics the film also does a good contrasting the lives of those who live in the countryside with those who live in the city. Almost immediately after arriving in the city Qiu Ju and Meizi are taken advantage of by a taxicyclist. However their naivety moves a few people to aid them such as the old man who owns the hotel in which they reside and Official Yan a Party official who Qiu Ju holds great respect for.Displaying the beauty and poverty of China's frigid northern landscape The Story of Qiu Ju while not a polemic blast against the Chinese political system displays the complex web of the Middle Kingdom's political system and the ways in which those in power even if that person is just the chief of a small village takes advantage of those in weaker positions. However on another note the film could also be viewed as a criticism against pigheadedness. At any rate this is an enjoyable film that should be watched by those who enjoy Chinese films especially the films made during the heyday of the Zhang YimouGong Li collaboration.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fighting bureaucracy at any time and in any place is a tremendously frustrating experience. No disrespect intended but how much more frustrating it must be in a Communist country! The Story Of Qiu Ju is the story of a woman's fight against the Communist bureaucracy as she struggles to get justice for her husband Qinglai. Qinglai got into a dispute with a local village chief and was kicked in the groin as a result.

Even in the midst of the dispute the village bonds aren't broken. Still something was missing here  maybe the subtitled comedy maybe what I thought having visited China was the too beneficent view of the local police. The first third of the movie I found quite dull and while it picked up from then on it still wasn't as much fun as some Chinese movies I've seen. In the end I'd rate this as a 410".

	schema:reviewBody "In China there are a lot of films about rural stories they delivered audience the impression of Chinese country life and the honest but obstinate personality of people living there. The film The Story of Qiu Ju is one of the masterpiece directed by Zhang Yimou in 1992 describes an ordinary rural woman Qiu Ju who has similar personality as others born and live in countryside despite she is more stubborn and persistence. Her strong personality is related with the influence of the openingup and reform policy of the day women have the awareness to seek for justice. In fact most of Chinese films talk about political implicitly especially at the year of 90's. In The story of Qiu Ju we can see the difficulty of find justice under the old bureaucracy in China. In order to find righteousnessQiu Ju a woman from China's undeveloped area small village of Shaanxi when her new married husband is kicked in the groin by the village head she goes to the closest town then the bigger city to try to deal with the bureaucrats and find justice in spite of her pregnancy.The story of Qiu Ju is a Chinese comedydrama film the genre category is established based on the storyline. For the character delineation I think Zhang Yimou express the personality of the characters with some connotative details. Especially Qiu Ju at the beginning of the film crowed people walking towards the camera Qiu Ju is one of them ordinary and common. I think her name Qiu Ju also have same meaning Qiu Ju means autumn chrysanthemum in Chinese which can be seen every where and have Strong vitality. However Qiu Ju is stubborn but she is also humble and timid. The long take of the old man ask money for writing indictment the pedicab driver fraud Qiu Ju's money which shows her cowardice. Also we can see her determination to find justice no matter how much it takes. It is quite uncommon for a poor rural woman. The delineation of the village head is also great. Most scenes about him was shoot in his home with high angle he was squat while Qiu Ju standing in front of him. He is not that kind of village head which lean on the position and bullying villager. But as every government officer in China he do not want give what Qiu Ju need because of saving face. I think he saves Qiu Ju and her son's lives not due to he forgive Qiu Ju's stubborn but the responsibility of a village head. He need every villager respect him. Moreover the scene did show but we all clear he had an argument with Qiu Ju's husband because he was insulted due to he have four daughters but no son. In traditional Chinese concept son preference rooted in every people's mind. We can see a warmhearted but too proud village head according to these scenes. Also I believe one of the reason push Qiu Ju insist to find justice is because she is pregnant but she can not sure if it is a boy.The narrative approach is based on the time line the development of the story. The story was happened in a harvest autumn to cold and snowing Shaanxi winter until they celebrating New Year one more evidence is during Qiu Ju's pregnancy to she give birth to her son straight forward from what happened to the end. The cinematographic style is as simplicity as the characters. Most of scenes took by long shoot and according to Zhang Yimou he took candid snapshot in order to keep the villagers acting naturally. One thing need to mention about cinematographic style is the closeup of Qiu Ju's face. Her face expresses multiple emotions after she knew the village head is caught then run after the police whistle which are surprise unbelievable awkward and sense of loss. She is seeking for an impartial end not money not this one either.To sum up the film is a story of bureaucracy and ordinary people traditional code of conduct and the law. Every time I saw Qiu Ju walking on the white snowing country road then get free ride to the town and city I was touched and wondering how long will rural people live in China will go through to get justice. As Zhang Yimou said about the film every person in this film is good and decent but the result is not. In most cases the law can give us justice but it does not comfort our heart and the atmosphere of forgiveness. The most important thing in human's relationship is understanding. However the officers in this film is all kind and dedicated to helping Qiu Ju I think is not common in China there is barely no one like Yan. Maybe it is the way the director encourages rural people to find justice just as Qiu Ju did.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film of Qiu Ju Da Guan Si was produced by Zhang Yimou who was the fifth generation filmmaker in China. Also this is the most realistic film I have ever seen before. The story was happened in a small mountain village the main characterQiu Ju is a peasant woman whose husband was kicked by the village Chief. The only thing that Qiu Ju wants is an apology. However it is difficult to achieve. Because of village Chief is a stubborn man he did not think he made a mistake at that case also he wants to save his face so he did not want to give apologies. After that Qiu Ju wants use the legal system to get an apology. The whole process is from the village to county from county to city finally to the court.The plot of this film revolves around the Qiu Ju's action. Through the process it describes the rural life and the relationship between people and people. Also it highlights the realistic ethics. The filming technique is unadorned and includes some practical life scenes so it can make an overwhelming1y strong sense of reality. From the beginning of film we can see a typical Chinese mountain village with a traditional ditty of Shan Xi. Then we can see a pregnant women walking in the snow and her name is Qiu Ju this scene make me impressive. From the whole we can see many different kinds of expression in her eyes. It includes Confused obstinate anticipate disappointed curious and beatific. These changing also reflect the development of her case. In this film the officer Li Gong An always say the village chief is very stubborn. But in fact Qiu Ju is more stubborn than village chief. The dialogue 'Want a reasonable statement'appeared many times it means Qiu Ju just want a statement. The structure of this film is very clean and irregular the light also natural. Some of the lens is candid and plus some nonprofessional actors' performance it makes the film more rustic. The costume is very particular we can see Qiu Ju's clothes are red and there are many pimientos around their house also she always wears a green scarf it forms a strong comparison. In addition there are many metaphors in the film. For example the music in the beginning of this film is a ditty of Shan Xi. When Qiu Ju went to prosecute the village chief and then we can hear the ditty When she get the same result and back to her village the ditty also come out. That is a tough process but she never give up we can hear the ditty many times it means Qiu Ju do the same thing many times. Besides there is a scene that Qiu Ju talks to the prefecture officer she told them she graduated from high school. As we know a high school degree is quite good for the villagers. It means due to she had a high school degree so she knows that she can get a reasonable statement through the legal system. From this aspect we can get an idea that Qiu Ju was trying to protect her rights. In this film we can find out anther point that many villagers did not know the laws and regulations so they do not know how to protect their rights. Even the writer who helps people to write the application for their lawsuit was not familiar with laws. It is a social problem at that time. Otherwise there was a contradiction in this film as we know Qiu Ju just wants an apology but the village chief did not gave her an apology. So she tries again and again. During the process Qiu Ju's childbirth was not successfully and then her husband went to chief's home and asks for help. At that time the chief ignore the misunderstanding and still help them. After that the chief told Qiu Ju's husband if Qiu Ju still wants a statement then she can continued to prosecute him. I think this part is very important to this story. Finally the chief was taken by the policeman that is the statement for Qiu Ju. However Qiu Ju just wants an apology she never want see this result. At last we can hear the sound and see Qiu Ju was searching for the car. At the end of the film the camera gave her a closeup her face was full of helpless and confusion.In short the director Zhang Yimou uses this story to express the awakening of personal rights. Also Gong Li played the role of Qiu Ju is very well Gong Li's performance praises the peasant woman's new characteristic which is selfconfident selfrespect. In my opinion this film is full of Chinese characteristic it reflects the social condition of that time and includes people's thought changing. So I think this film is very good.".

It would seem that any film with an all AfricanAmerican cast set in the American south is required to beat us over the head with an idea we are all I would hope aware of. ie Jim Crow sucked. Instead this film simply portrays people with hopes and dreams faults and virtues capable of love and hate good and evil. in other words people. Not black people. That was refreshing. and IMHO a far stronger statement than one could ever make through heavyhanded symbolism Is the film perfect? Far from it. The plot is in many ways pedestrian. The film telegraphs plot twists rather than foreshadowing them. However are there flashes of brilliance? Good Lord yes. These are two astonishingly talented men Andre and Big Boi and simply as a showcase for that talent this film succeeds. If you just sit down and let the film wash over you you will enjoy. If you overthink and ask it to be something it isn't you won't. It's that simple.".

Outkast aren't just any old rappers as their fans could no doubt inform you. Most of their material even though much of it is anachronistic for a film set in the 1930s nonetheless fit the movie quite well. Some of the pieces of course aren't rap. Indeed Andre 3000 might as well no longer be called a rapper considering the breadth of his material. The plot was surprisingly well thought out. It had a certain symmetry yet was not completely predictable. I enjoyed the whole thing and didn't have to close my eyes thinking this is so stupid all through the film.".

	schema:headline " IDLEWILD  a film for people that love the cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a very good reason that films in general are getting significantly worse in every quality. Why? Because in our time when a film is made that is intelligent or creative in some significant way it is usually ripped to pieces by critics and the general audience teaching 'Hollywood' a lesson that they take to heart all too well.Idlewild is a first rate musical and feast for the eyes. Like 'Running Scared 2006' the director believes that there is no reason a movie made in the 21st century should not benefit from all the options modern film technology offers and no I don't mean the visual rubbish that assaults the eyes in recent Tony Scott efforts. However the stateoftheart methods are used strictly in the service of 'old fashioned' film entertainment values and this seemingly 'insults' the 'too cool for school' types for whom enjoyment seems to be the last reason to pay to see a movie.The actors are great the acting is fine and the production values are top notch. The story is a little clichd and as a result the writer does seem to have cutnpasted from various familiar sources. However this is a very minor criticism in a film that uses music as much as the spoken word to tell a story.While the music is mostly contemporary it was written with the aim of slotting into a fantasy period drama and does so beautifully. While many of the performers may seem to have a 'rap' background if this puts you off seeing Idlewild you are seriously misjudging the creativity and range of their talent.Some may claim the film is a little 'tame' but a much better description is 'inclusive'. In other words Idlewild really wants to reach and impress a wide audience and it is a great pity that this doesn't seem to have happened yet.Idlewild is a sexy sophisticated 'feelgood' musical a vanity project for OutKast no doubt but also a wonderful treat for those that value todays's rarest treasure a new movie worth making the effort to see.By the way Idlewild is NOT 'one long music video' and I'm hard placed to see such comments as 'innocent' given the power of this lie to put people off seeing the movie. So forget any fear of 'opera' like Evita where everything is sung or MTV masquerading as a film. This is a HBO production like Deadwood or the Sopranos and that means quality first especially the quality of the dramatic presentation. However although Idlewild is an 'adult' film thank heaven the PG13 sludge is killing me it lacks the extreme and explicit content of many of HBO's TV productions so may be safely viewed by more 'sensitive' types.If you watch a lot of films and have no greater pleasure than finding an unexpected gem give Idlewild a go. It really is 'the one that got away'.".

	schema:headline " Idlewild is a movie that tries to attain great musical heights but fails as often as it succeeds.";
	schema:reviewBody "Idlewild's greatest fault is that it is really uneven in tone. There were parts of it I really loved  the prologue scenes and some of the musical numbers and then parts that just seemed to go splat on the screen. The tone of the beginning very witty and hellbentforleather was great and seemed to be a great frame for a story about two hustlers  it seemed reminiscent of the winking headlong tone of The Sting  and if the movie could have maintained that tone it might have been a tour de force. But other parts of the film were morose and uninteresting. Which leads us unfortunately to Andre 3000.I understand making 3000 the Luke Skywalker and Big Boi the Han Solo but Boi's character of Rooster was so much more interesting a character that whenever he wasn't on the screen the movie just went flat. It just seems to be a bad idea to have a main character who seemingly has no desire to attain his dreams  he's kind of an antiJosephCampbell hero  and the other characters have to shove Percival toward his dreams like corralling a steer to slaughter. His mortician father is supposed to be his obstacle to the life Percival is meant to live but it seems apathy is a more likely stumbling block Percival looks more uncomfortable on stage than he does dressing bodies in the funeral home instead of coming alive when he performs which seems to be what the character requires.I liked the music for the most part but 3000 is the major failing here as well. His persona it's hard to say that either he or Boi are acting since their characters hew so closely to the personas they have created for OutKast is such the brooding artist that when the movie needs a shot of I've finally made it! razz ma tazz he's not up to the task and the ending comes away like a lead balloon. I thought that for the most part they did a rather clever job blending the 30's music with the OutKast brand of the hippity hop and my only complaint here is that Barber directed the music scenes like music videos and so the actors are obviously lipsynching where a live performance captured for the film might have been exhilarating here it comes off with the rote polished quality of any hip hop video with the actors seeming to walk through their performances rather than actually performing. The anachronistic quality of the songs isn't as jarring as I thought it might be it's just the presentation of the music that takes you out of the time and place.Otherwise it's shot really well. There are some innovative visual effects that help guide the story and the dances are staged with such vigor and bawdy realism that they have the gutbucket charm of the early race musicals.The period look of the film is gorgeous there's a whole lot of production value here  the sets and costumes notorious clotheshorses 3000 and Boi sport made me drool a little and the ensemble cast is fantastic. It's DepressionEra Black South but this particular vision seems to be a time and place little explored in cinema. With the exception of a touching scene late in the film in which Rooster wayward after his longsuffering wife finally leaves him encounters a religious woman literally at the end of the road gives her some money and receives a Bible in return the majority of the movie takes place among the black bourgeoisie and race or class is never an issue. Unfortunately that touching scene is just an excuse to set up an unbelievably clich and predictable scene later on when the Bible does what most cinematic Holy Books end up doing.Overall the plot is clich at times and predictable more often than that and gives the sense of a firsttime writerdirector finding his way and there are some scenes that just don't make sense  without spoilering there's a glaring flaw that happens in the crucial first act that's both sloppy and stylistically clich storytelling.The biggest travesty though is something that didn't hit me until I was on the way home. Ben Vereen is cast as 3000's mortician father the supposed restraining influence. Toward the end of the movie they have a confrontation which eventually leads to a reconciliation  I can't possibly be giving anything away by saying that or you've never seen a movie before. But on the way home it struck me  how do you have Ben Vereen in this movie and not write it into the script to have Ben Vereen DANCING?!? He's BEN VEREEN for crying out loud! Anyone who directs a musical and doesn't see the necessity of having the most talented cast member perform should have their DGA card revoked. All right I got a little polemical there but it seems a grievous oversight to overlook one of the film's greatest resources especially when you're supposed to be honoring the past and this oversight is somehow indicative of the whole project and now that I look at it Patti LaBelle never sang in her cameo as the real Angel Davenport either. Crispity Crunchity! All right call the DGA I'm serious now..Idlewild is a movie that attempts some rather ambitious things it's just a shame it achieved so few.".

The Impresarios of Rap present Idlewilda hip hop love story set against the daily grind of running a juke joint during Prohibition in the town of Idlewild GA. All the players were there the piano player the singer and of course the bootlegger. Whether it's a murder mystery a gangsta tale or a love story can be debated after you see itjust go see it. Idlewild a film by Bryan Barber starred Antoine Patton and Andre Benjamin. However the music was done by Big Boi and Andre 3000. Outkast fans will get the difference. The rest will have to see to believe. Let us not forget where there is a Big Boi and an Andre there will be a fair amount of quirky a little bit of weird a lot of imagination and some stepping outside of the speakerboxx.The film had the musical stage appeal of Chicago with the black gangsta love of movies like Harlem Nights and Hoodlum. But unlike those Yankee tales this story took place in the south before it became dirty or is it derty???? where's my ebonics dictionary? It speaks to a time and place accurately and without insult. It was clever and funny but also a little predictable. Which was ideal because the storyline is actually just scenery for all the incredible musical numbers and didn't need to be complicated. The characters had that twodimensional feel reminiscent of the melodramas so popular in the 1930's. Idlewild rose to the challenge and very successfully captured the times which is often a difficult task in a period piece.Saying Outkast has an innovative approach to music is like saying that guy Picasso is alright with a paintbrush. The original score by Outkast blended the sound of the 30's the jazz the blues and the swing with rap and soulful rhythm and blues. It was kind of like a family reunion for homegrown syncopation. It was ingenious as well as inspired. The choreography only complimented the musical numbers giving the audience a complete juke joint experience. The film also offered notable cameo appearances by Cicily Tyson Ving Rhames Bruce Bruce Patty Labelle and the tease of Tony award winning Ben Vereen who doesn't dance. Also noteworthy is Macy Gray's performance as the falling diva Taffy. If Rappers must make movies they should all be so good.".

It has everything great choreography great music I normally dislike musicals nice plot and very good actors.It opens with the saying that the world is a stage and the men and women are just actors it goes on to show two very different friends grow up and deal with the choices they've made or in some cases haven't made. It has the usual elements of a movie love loss betrayal murder but what makes this movie stand out is the visual and audial stimulation the 1920's30's costumes which weren't afraid to show a woman's femininity and the men who didn't leave the house unless they were suited up. The stage performances were a little wild and so is Outkast which makes then so great and unusual. I love Roosters' last performance. Outkast has a way of stating the obvious about life but in a light you normally wouldn't see it in.I highly recommend this movie and don't leave until the very last words have rolled off the screen!".

Byran Barber's directing of the idea he chose this picture is excellent and even though he's a music video director he still makes it a great film. If you want to see this film with your kids then it's better if you make sure that they will be mature about nudity.This film is a beautifully made film and I believe that this film should at least win an Oscar for their main song by Outkast I don't know the name but it has a catchy tune. GREAT FILM 1010".

We felt like the screenplay could have been written for this cast and the juxtaposition of rap music over 1930's rhythm worked in a crisp and welcome way.

The dancing is good the characters incorporate the songs with their personal lives and these scenes are a lot of fun to watch. One of the best production numbers is at the very end. The special effects are fun to watch and the cinematography is very well done. The show gets off to a fun start and the characters look promising. Yet as they age something gets lost. The story line between Percival and Angel was the only one I found natural and plausible. Rooster has little interaction with his wife which makes that storyline hard to believe and Trumpy's character comes out of no where and tries unsuccessfully to run the show. It was interesting to see the members of Outkast in such different roles especial Percival. The movie was entertaining and I would sit through the boring parts again any time to see how brilliant the dancing and music was.".

Idlewild is about two friends Percival Andre 3000 and Rooster Big Boi that grow up in different lifestyles but have the same dream that dream is make it out of Idlewild and into show business. However both are stalled by family life and trouble with Trumpy Terrence Howard. Percival meets a woman that goes by the name Angel Davenport the stunning Paula Patton and with her he plans to be loosened from his father's Ben Vereen grip. The film serves as one big musical containing new original music and some songs from their 2003 diamond selling CD SpeakerboxxxThe Love Below and is the directorial film debut of their longtime music video collaborator Byran Barber. Barber does one hell of a job and makes the film so visually pleasing. Every cut and angle put you right in the middle of the frenzied action going on in The Church. Also some familiar faces such as Cicely Tyson Ving Rhames comedian Bruce Bruce and Ms. Patti LaBelle pop up from time to time.

The ever so deftly crafted admixture of snappy well articulated dialog rousing stage numbers romantic interludes gangster highjinks animated cartoon comedic characters and whatever else I have left out is a resounding testament to Bryan Barber's cinematic skills.Mr. Barber uses an almost exclusively Black cast in a Black cultural setting yet this story line with its several accompanying subplots is most decidedly universal in nature.

To wit note the amusing animated rooster on Mr. Rooster's flask who sounds and jokes like a resurrected Robin Harris.

If you like the shootemup gangster stuff it's in here too and carried off well by the likes of Terrence Howard and company.The aforementioned principals were true to form in their respective roles as was Antwan PattonRooster Mr. Howard Ving Rhames Ben Vereen just to name a few. There was a cohesion a sense of unity as they performed their individual roles.

The dancing was upbeat and impressive. The wardrobe was excellent. The sets were also very good. The character of Taffy was almost written for Macey Grey. She delivered it very well and her singing was good. Even though the music was not typical of the time period it was refreshing to hear music that took its beat from the 20's and 30's with lyrics you could understand. Hard to believe these guys are rappers.Sprinkled throughout the movie is social issues of the 20's 30's poverty alcoholism violence. Also touched on is infidelity Roosters character and being able to resist it with a good outcome.Overall this movie was very well done and worth buying for your collection. This movie is the the Halrem Nights of our generation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Idlewild was one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. That was something of a surprise to me because I'm not particularly a fan of OutKast or of rap and hiphop music in general. Okay full disclosure I'm a middleaged white gal who listens mainly to classic rock stations and I've managed to successfully ignore the whole rap genre. I can't recall if I had ever even heard of OutKast before this movie maybe the name rang a faint bell but I really had no idea who they were. Anyway it would be a shame if people overlooked this movie just because they're not into rap or hiphop because it is a truly magical and inspiring film.The main characters were very engaging and appealing and the acting ranged from skillful and nuanced to truly superb even on the part of the lesserknown actors. There were creative and surprising plot twists to move the action along with never a dull moment. The cinematography was lush and beautiful with a few creative special effects that added to the surreal feeling of the story and the setting. The spirited music and dramatic dance sequences were a joy to behold and that provided an important contrast and balance to the more somber or frightening moments of the film. The necessary scenes of violence were handled well being neither distasteful nor excessive given the context of the story and the sexual overtones were also spicy but not overdone.Idlewild touched lightly on some profound philosophical and spiritual themes without resorting to heavyhanded lecturing. There was a faint aura of the mystical and magical glimmering about the borders of this film but it was done lightly and effortlessly so that it wove seamlessly into the compelling story line without distracting from it. Most important of all for me personally is that this film really had warmth and heart in a big and powerful way. It also turned out to be an inspiring and uplifting movie even if not an entirely happy one.When I go to the movies I want to come away having had an experience of beauty and magic and also having things to really think about. But most of all I want to feel emotionally enriched by the experience and to come away with a bigger perspective on this crazy game of life. So many movies today just drag the viewer down into a cesspool of cynicism indifference and despair rather than helping us engage more deeply with life they only pull us away for an hour of meaningless distraction. Idlewild was a rare and sparkling exception in cinema today and I urge everyone who has a heart to go see this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've read the synopsis above you pretty much know the long and short of Tony Scott's Unstoppable. Based on the reallife story of an unmanned train that went careening down the tracks in Ohio after a railroad employee failed to set the air brakes while switching tracks this dramatization of that little incident amps up the thrills for a whiteknuckle 100minute nonstop rollercoaster ride just think of it as an adrenaline shot that pretty much grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go from start to finish.The setup is plain and simple on one end of the track is rookie conductor Will Colson Chris Pine paired with veteran railroad engineer Frank Barnes Denzel Washington on his first day of work. Frank and Will each have their own share of family problems and each bear their own reservations of the other so there's a fair bit of tension between the two of them as they begin their shift especially since Will is seen as the company's new blood employed to replace the older workers including Frank who have one by one been forced to retire.Then on the other end of the track some bumbling employee gets off a train in an attempt to switch tracks puts the stick in throttle and sends the massive locomotive whizzing down rural Pennsylvania towards the more heavily populated areas. Corporate represented by Kevin Dunn's VP of operations and local ground operations represented by Rosario Dawson's rail commander can't agree how to stop it the former as usual weighing the options in terms of dollars and cents on the stock market.It is only halfway through the film that Frank and Will cross paths with said locomotive nicknamed The Beast and come out with a plan to link their engine to the back to it and gun it in the opposite direction. Tony Scott spends the first half of the film doing two things one emphasising the workingclass backgrounds of Frank and Will and two laying out bare the peril of the situation. Both are deftly played for the nailbiting finish which is guaranteed to leave you wideeyed and openmouthed.By portraying Frank and Will's as everyday men with real concerns over livelihood and family Scott and Die Hard 4.0 writer Mark Bomback make the point loud and clear later on that that reallife heroes are really just ordinary men who do extraordinary acts of courage in the face of danger and calamity. Indeed though it is apparent that both Frank and Will are the heroes of the story playing down the chestthumping heroics of their act proves to be a wise choice in painting them as regular people who rose to the occasion to save the lives of thousands including their families and loved ones.Scott instead stresses the magnitude of the occasion in repeated failed attempts at halting The Beast each and every attempt highlighting the destructive force of the locomotive at that weight and at that speed. Choosing to film the highoctane action sequences in a more straightforward realistic manner than his usual flashy visual style i.e. jump cuts shaky camera zooms and colourcorrection also lends the proceedings an authentic and an altogether genuinely riveting feel further underlining the gravity of their heroic act. Special mention goes to the sound design of the film which in a proper theatre with good sound system will set the hall rumbling with the sound of the locomotive.Because much of the focus of the film is on The Beast more screen time seems to be dedicated to the train than to our two lead actors Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Still the everreliable Denzel Washington delivers a lowkey but no less commanding performance as the dutiful railroad worker Frank. He also shares a nice buddy chemistry with Chris and it's interesting to watch how the initial tension between the two gives way to mutual cooperation understanding and finally respect.Unfolding at a breathless pace Tony Scott makes the most of a simple premise to deliver a relentlessly exciting action movie that plays like Speed on tracks. It wastes no time in getting to the meat of the action and doesn't once let up right until the end of the thrill ride. In between you get the story of two men folks like you and I who display an outstanding act of heroism when faced with imminent danger. Precisely because they are so relatable Unstoppable becomes so much more gripping and you'd be advised that this highoctane action movie is just the adrenaline fix you need for the week.".

Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's latest collaboration is pretty much the definition of high concept  a runaway freight train loaded with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel eight carriages of a highly toxic chemical and a worryingly curvy track ahead of it versus two train operatives armed with little in the way of stopping impending disaster bar a onecar locomotive and their vivid imaginations.It's not without its faults but Unstoppable is a brisk solidly entertaining thriller from start to finish. Scott has little time for characterisation or back story preferring instead to kick things off via a pair of laughably incompetent rail yard employees roughly five minutes in and then letting his leads fill in the blanks as we go along for the ride.Washington and Star Trek's Chris Pine play it straight for the most part  their characters are the reluctant Johnny Everymen found in most films that rely on extended peril for thrills and they've both nailed the mixture of brooding intensity and occasional comic relief that typifies movies of the genre.Enough about the acting though  when you're watching a film of this nature you want the action sequences to impress rather than worry too much about the story and on this front Unstoppable delivers. Scott's track record in the field puts him in the perfect place to deliver the goods and there's very little of the distracting overdone camerawork that has plagued his recent output.There's perhaps a little too much ShakyCam for my tastes but for the most part everything is shot with enough scope to be extremely impressive. The near total lack of CGI means the film looks suitably gritty and the pace is utterly utterly relentless  there's no time to breathe here just setpiece after setpiece with only brief conversational respites to quickly set up the next danger faced by our bluecollar heroes.This type of film never goes down too well with critics and you can predict the reviews already  yes Unstoppable IS cheesy it IS forced it IS derivative and has all the depth of a puddle but if you want to switch your brain off for 100 minutes and sit back for a magnificently enjoyable slice of escapism you couldn't do much better. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Simple Thrilling and Very Entertaining. Unstoppable never tries to be anything more than it is. It follows a runaway train that occurred in Pennsylvania and the two men that try to stop it. First off I gotta five Tony Scott credit for making a film about trains that in itself is pretty interesting. How many people know about and use trains regularly? Then take that and turn into one of the most suspenseful entertaining films of the year culminates into a really good time. The film's opening credits starts with how the train was lost and runs away so right off the bat you know that it's not going to be a dull film. Before any of the main characters are brought into the story the antagonist and therefore the action get underway. Your then introduced to Will played by Chris Pine and Frank played by Denzel Washington. Will is the rookie conductor that is placed under the veterans Frank's wing. Then you have Connie played by Rosario Dawson as the head of all the trains currently running basically a conductor that oversees all operations who is in charge of finding a solution to the runaway train while also dealing with the corporate suits mainly Oscar Galvin played by Kevin Dunn who are more interested in stock prices and money losses then the overall safety and physical damage the train could cause. So after some failed attempts to stop the train Denzel comes up with a plan to stop it and this is where Will and Frank become involved with the runaway.Tony Scott does a pretty good job of making the runaway train look menacing almost like a monster that no matter what you do always keeps coming for you. The majority of special effects and stunt work were done realistically with very little CGI being used which for me is always a plus. With it being based on a true story he definitely uses a lot of tactics to make it feel less like a film and more like your actually watching the action happen presently. There's a lot of bird eye shots of the trains making it feel like a news helicopters are shooting it while also cutting to news broadcasts following the runaway train through the majority of the film creating a more realistic view of the whole story. He also filmed on location in Pennsylvania which was pretty cool living in central PA and having the opportunity to talk with some of the crew. As for the characters the first half of the film is where the majority of the very little character development comes into play. Will and Frank bicker back and forth at each other when unsurprisingly they find a common bond through broken families with their wives and children. There are also many conversations which mostly turn into arguments between Connie and Oscar about how to stop the runaway train and the potential problems it could cause. Yet due to the pacing and strategic place of key conversations you end up caring about the characters and are pulling for them to get out of this disaster alive. The most important and character revealing dialogue occurs during the more explosion filled scenes with the train. Overall it's a pretty fun time and never has a boring moment. Just when you think the dialogue may be getting a bit to breathy and boring Scott crashes the runaway into some object causing a major explosion. It's one of those no brain activity films that you can just sit back and enjoy. The characters are there and Scott makes sure not to fill the runtime up with too much dialogue but with just enough to develop Frank Will and Connie into people we want to see succeed. Lastly it doesn't try to be anything more than it is. It's a film about a runaway train and the people trying to stop it that's it. Unstoppable is a thrilling ride and a guaranteed enjoyable viewing.".

	schema:headline " Trains Denzel and Tony Scott again? Yeah but this one's so much better than that dreadful Pelham remake.";
	schema:reviewBody "Unstoppable is a pulsepounding runaway thrill ride with ironsided savetheday heroism on display courtesy of Washington Pine and Dawson.Spoil sports have been grousing that Unstoppable can't possibly be inspired by true events. In fact the runaway AWVR777 in Unstoppable is based on the reallife CSX8888 crew Y11615 incident that took place in 2001.CSX8888 was a single engine pulling 47 cars 22 of them loaded for inyard car switching. The Final Report on the CSX8888 incident is available on the Internet along with other accounts and documentation.All six gross errors committed by the engineer responsible for CSX8888 are reproduced in Unstoppable one of them being sugar coated with magic pixie dust when the engine selector handle automagically pops out of dynamic brake and into power mode with the throttle handle set to 8 the maximum setting.The dynamic brake should never have been set during yard operations gross error 4. Dynamic braking is optimal at speeds 40MPH and it is ineffective at speeds 10MPH except on AC locomotives of which 8888 wasn't.The independent brake of the locomotive was also set which nullified the alerter switch system which would have otherwise acted as a circuit breaker to the incorrect selector and throttle settings.All six gross errors really happened and had to be made in the proper sequence in order to result in a powered runaway.Two CSX employees chased CSX8888 in a private vehicle to a grade crossing because they feared that its engineer had suffered an heart attack at the controls. The engineer had already stepped off the moving train back at the yard gross error  3. The CSX employees intercepted CSX8888 but were unable to board it.The runaway CSX8888 did have hazardous cargo on board variously reported as two cars of molten phenol acid CNN or molten sulfur local Ohio news sources the latter being less hazardous than the former although both are toxic. The two hazmat cars were in the middle of the train and they were not considered to be at risk if the train had derailed. The hazmat cars were far enough in for the surrounding terrain that they should have remained on the track even if an engine derailment had succeeded.CSX8888 had an average speed of 3035MPH and may have been going as fast as 47MPH at one point. Four attempts were made at derailing CSX8888 three by diverting it through sidings and one by using a portable derail. CSX8888 dislodged the portable derail and threw it from the tracks. All attempts to derail CSX8888 failed.CSX8888 was eventually stopped by a pursuit locomotive running in reverse CSX6462 crew Q63615. Avoiding a collision course CSX6462 had to run in reverse which blindsided the engineer during right hand turns. That required the conductor to setup at the rear of the locomotive now the front so that the conductor could spot for his engineer. The maximum unloaded speed rating for CSX6462 was 30MPH. It had to achieve speeds in excess of 50MPH to catch up with CSX8888. This meant that the conductor's end of CSX6462 swayed 18 from sidetoside at times. Had CSX6462 derailed there would have been no way for the conductor to survive. Life and limb were definitely at risk.CSX8888 was stopped without loss of life limb andor property.When CSX6462 caught up with the runaway it coupled from the rear and then the engineer applied CSX6462's dynamic brakes to slow CSX8888 down exercising great care not to break the train apart between the two locomotives. Once CSX8888 slowed to less than 11MPH a prepositioned engineer was able to run alongside board it and take control of CSX8888 bringing it to an orderly stop.Almost all of these elements are incorporated into the story of Unstoppable albeit in Tony Scott's ScottFree way. It's reality x2 and all of that's in the service of delivering a ripping yarn. The same people complaining about Unstoppable probably swallowed everything Scott  Co served up in Top Gun without chewing.Unstoppable does make a point of belaboring the fact that the hoses for the air brake system were never connected but that happens to be SOP for inyard flat car switching. You can't properly kick cars if their hoses are still connected. That's my only beef. There are plenty of other things that never happened or couldn't have happened but none of that matters thanks to the acting talent on board.Denzel Washington's Frank Barnes is a seasoned engineer and 28year AWVR veteran who never shows any of is his inward concerns whether they be about job security in downsizing times or worry for his two daughters working their way through college. Denzel's Barnes is all about the job and doing it right. Chris Pine's Will Colson is relatively new to the ranks of conductors.

	onyx:emotionText "Unstoppable is a pulsepounding runaway thrill ride with ironsided savetheday heroism on display courtesy of Washington Pine and Dawson.Spoil sports have been grousing that Unstoppable can't possibly be inspired by true events. In fact the runaway AWVR777 in Unstoppable is based on the reallife CSX8888 crew Y11615 incident that took place in 2001.CSX8888 was a single engine pulling 47 cars 22 of them loaded for inyard car switching. The Final Report on the CSX8888 incident is available on the Internet along with other accounts and documentation.All six gross errors committed by the engineer responsible for CSX8888 are reproduced in Unstoppable one of them being sugar coated with magic pixie dust when the engine selector handle automagically pops out of dynamic brake and into power mode with the throttle handle set to 8 the maximum setting.The dynamic brake should never have been set during yard operations gross error 4. Dynamic braking is optimal at speeds 40MPH and it is ineffective at speeds 10MPH except on AC locomotives of which 8888 wasn't.The independent brake of the locomotive was also set which nullified the alerter switch system which would have otherwise acted as a circuit breaker to the incorrect selector and throttle settings.All six gross errors really happened and had to be made in the proper sequence in order to result in a powered runaway.Two CSX employees chased CSX8888 in a private vehicle to a grade crossing because they feared that its engineer had suffered an heart attack at the controls. The engineer had already stepped off the moving train back at the yard gross error  3. The CSX employees intercepted CSX8888 but were unable to board it.The runaway CSX8888 did have hazardous cargo on board variously reported as two cars of molten phenol acid CNN or molten sulfur local Ohio news sources the latter being less hazardous than the former although both are toxic. The two hazmat cars were in the middle of the train and they were not considered to be at risk if the train had derailed. The hazmat cars were far enough in for the surrounding terrain that they should have remained on the track even if an engine derailment had succeeded.CSX8888 had an average speed of 3035MPH and may have been going as fast as 47MPH at one point. Four attempts were made at derailing CSX8888 three by diverting it through sidings and one by using a portable derail. CSX8888 dislodged the portable derail and threw it from the tracks. All attempts to derail CSX8888 failed.CSX8888 was eventually stopped by a pursuit locomotive running in reverse CSX6462 crew Q63615. Avoiding a collision course CSX6462 had to run in reverse which blindsided the engineer during right hand turns. That required the conductor to setup at the rear of the locomotive now the front so that the conductor could spot for his engineer. The maximum unloaded speed rating for CSX6462 was 30MPH. It had to achieve speeds in excess of 50MPH to catch up with CSX8888. This meant that the conductor's end of CSX6462 swayed 18 from sidetoside at times. Had CSX6462 derailed there would have been no way for the conductor to survive. Life and limb were definitely at risk.CSX8888 was stopped without loss of life limb andor property.When CSX6462 caught up with the runaway it coupled from the rear and then the engineer applied CSX6462's dynamic brakes to slow CSX8888 down exercising great care not to break the train apart between the two locomotives. Once CSX8888 slowed to less than 11MPH a prepositioned engineer was able to run alongside board it and take control of CSX8888 bringing it to an orderly stop.Almost all of these elements are incorporated into the story of Unstoppable albeit in Tony Scott's ScottFree way. It's reality x2 and all of that's in the service of delivering a ripping yarn. The same people complaining about Unstoppable probably swallowed everything Scott  Co served up in Top Gun without chewing.Unstoppable does make a point of belaboring the fact that the hoses for the air brake system were never connected but that happens to be SOP for inyard flat car switching. You can't properly kick cars if their hoses are still connected. That's my only beef. There are plenty of other things that never happened or couldn't have happened but none of that matters thanks to the acting talent on board.Denzel Washington's Frank Barnes is a seasoned engineer and 28year AWVR veteran who never shows any of is his inward concerns whether they be about job security in downsizing times or worry for his two daughters working their way through college. Denzel's Barnes is all about the job and doing it right. Chris Pine's Will Colson is relatively new to the ranks of conductors. Rumor in the yard is that Colson's a beneficiary of union boss nepotism. Will's also got domestic problems at home that distract him from the job. This sets up professional tension when Barnes are Colson are paired to crew AWVR1206 for a routine run. Although Barnes has seniority Colson's technically in charge. Pine  Washington have a lot of tensioncutting fun with this.Rosario Dawson plays Connie Hooper a rail control supervisor who has got to plow through considerable BS not only to find out what's going on with doubleengine AWVR777 but also to figure out how best to deal with it once it's determined that 777 is a fully powered runaway. Even after corporate cuts Connie out of the CBACYA loop Dawson makes us believe that Connie is going to do the right thing no matter what.Kevin Corrigan deserves special mention for his turn as FRAMPE Inspector Werner.

	schema:headline " Unstoppable  thank you Hollywood for putting out an action movie that works";
	schema:reviewBody "Unstoppable plays out like a basic action thriller that keeps us engaged the entire time. With the train as the center of the story in a way we get transported back to the days of great entertainment where the storyline is simple characters pure and the dialogue isn't overdone. Here is an action film that stays on track and keeps you glued to the edge of your seat until the highintensity climax is over. It operates at gutlevel mode as we get to follow all the twists and turns of the main character runaway train 777. Unstoppable is a summer movie action blockbuster released in a winter spot that doesn't pause for a breath as it picks up steam and most likely you won't either. It's one of those mindless thrillers that was made so well you probably will miss a lot of the detail as the movie literally sweeps you away which is what a great action movie will do.Unstoppable is based on a true story that comes out of Ohio where we have a lowlevel employee who fails to set the air brakes on a train while changing tracks and the issues that ensue as a result. The director Tony Scott no newcomer to the action genre sets the stage for the highoctane second half by letting us get to know the 2 main characters Rookie conductor Will Colson Chris Pine and veteran engineer Frank Barnes Denzel Washington. The two both have their share of family issues which adds to the difficulty of being able to work together initially. Another dynamic we discover is that the company is forcing employees to be laid off as evidenced by the fact that Barnes is being replaced by younger engineers such as Colson. The 2 characters provide solid lowkey performances and we see the tension that initially exists turn into mutual cooperation to work together for a solution and then at the end respect.Solid performance also given by Rosario Dawson who is both the eyecandy and sounding board for our heroes planted where she can see all train activity.As the movie progresses we come to find out that this runaway train laden with toxic chemicals is headed towards heavily populated areas and our stomach starts to sink about the devastating possibilities that may occur should everything go wrong. The plan? to link up to the phantom engine from the back and pull it the other way coming to a full stop.It is fascinating to watch the failed attempts to stop the train which seems to add to the power giving the audience a realistic idea of how unstoppable this train truly is with it's 10M pounds of force going fullsteam ahead.In the end what we are left with is ordinary men putting on extraordinary acts of courage. Where there might be chestpounding there are a couple of family guys doing what they felt should have been done by anyone in that situation and a humbleness that brings a more realistic quality to the movie.I'm glad that the sensationalism was toned down so that the thrills that the movie had to offer truly thrilled me. As others have stated already Unstoppable is truly a Speed on tracks and definitely one of the year's finer action movies.710 stars".

It works on the principles of late afternoon escapism and it's quite efficient as a nailbiter. Kicking off to big bursts of kinetic action almost right from the beginning and lasting for a taut ninetyeight minutes it proved itself as one of the more wholesomely entertaining action movies I've seen in the last half of the year.The movie is based loosely on the CSX 8888 incident of 2001 in which a freight train ran amok and unmanned across the state of Ohio for two hours. Here the setting is switched to Pennsylvania and it's running at such high speeds that it threatens to destroy Stanton should it derail itself on an elevated railway and smash its toxic cargo. Of course for the conventions of the actionescapism movie plot we've got two troubled heroes who are just going through the motions of their notsohappy lives when they assume the Superman personality and race against time to stop the train.The train is the real star of the movie. More interesting than the people trying to control it. Director Tony Scott gives us several impressive and creative shots of the halfmilelong mechanical monster as it rampages around. Listen carefully to the soundtrack and amongst all the crashes and grinding sounds you'll hear noises reminiscent of the tyrannosaurus in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park. The movie almost seems like a bigbudget homage to Spielberg's earlycareer movie Duel in which you had an innocent man being pursued by a giant tractortrailer.The characters are modeled after Action Movie 101 Writing stereotypes. You know the veteran and the rookie. One of them is splitting up with his wife the other is having a hard time maintaining a relationship with his daughters. You've got the noble yardmaster wanting to save lives and the greedy vulgarityspitting corporate executive whose more concerned about how much dough he's lost. And of course it takes a major catastrophe in which lives are risked in order to glue everything back together again. And no morbid as it sounds I didn't care who lived and who died.However however the filmmakers are smart enough to play with this to their advantage. They do not waste any more time than they really need to with this flat caricatures and instead devote as much of the brief running time as they can to very gritty action sequences. I must commend Mr. Scott for his ability to coordinate his pyrotechnics crew. Although I still detest his overly extravagant dolly shots and irksome quick zooms in which the camera inches in and out of people for no reason at all he does hold your attention when letting loose a wave of inertia. The last quarter of the movie is consumed by an enormous very intense action sequence that develops suspense and nailbiting tension reminiscent of Back to the Future. Complications are thrown in and as they kept on coming I gradually discovered myself nervously toying with the zipper of my jacket. He also does a fantastic job of balancing sequences with Live Television shots as news cameras record the incident.Unstoppable is not a work of art but heck it's not trying to be. Movies are meant to be one of two things art or escapism. Unstoppable is the latter. It achieves exactly what it is targeting ninetyeight minutes of bloodpumping action smartalec dialogue and a barrel of fun for all who participate. It's more fun and less painful for me than any roller coaster I can remember being on at the fair. On the basis of it being a solid matine thriller I liked the movie.Denzel Washington as the wise old train veteran is his usual self sincere and convincing. Chris Pine is also in fine form as the goodhearted but troubled rookie whom he finds himself both bickering and laughing with. Rosario Dawson an underrated actress turns in another strong performance as the yardmaster supervising the disaster. And Kevin Dunn is sinister despite the twodimensional character he's given to play. Supporting roles are played mechanically but well by Ethan Suplee Meagan Tandy Elizabeth Mathis and Jessy Schram.P.S. the movie almost shoots itself in the foot at the end but just ignore that as everything before it works just fine.".

	schema:headline " Look at da choochoo";
	schema:reviewBody "And now ladies and gentlemen we have the gripping story of a runaway train and the many valiant attempts to stop it. In order to impress upon us the urgency and turbulence of the developing situation our director has seen fit to keep the camera moving in a distractingly hyperactive fashion be it a quiet personal confrontation between characters or overloud footage of the train bowling along at speed. Among the jerky handheld constantlymoving camerawork is one technique which wore me down very quickly indeed and that was the quick rough zoom I have termed the 'gawk'. Once established the 'gawk' is a constant companion throughout 'Unstoppable' just like an annoyingly bored and sugarprimed kid next to you on a long bus trip. The movie's characters are but ciphers with Denzel Washington obviously now in 'money dear boy' mode as the bestknown face. The wouldbe trainstoppers are a pretty lame bunch but then how can mere humans stop something so determined to wreak havoc? The iron behemoth known as '777' one worse than 666? puts itself into gear takes off with an audible moan and proceeds to charge through the countryside laying waste. It growls bestially travels at whatever speed it damn well feels like and acts downright malevolently any time anyone tries to shut it down. Apparently 'Unstoppable' has been in development hell since 2004 and frankly it looks like it's been there since 1984. The CGI is brief but rest assured it looks like it was done at 3 AM after a long cocktail evening. 'Unstoppable' is basically 'Christine' with a train but shh you didn't hear that from the director All it would have taken is some expository dialogue about how 777 fell over at the factory and killed three workmen and we would be away.

	onyx:emotionText "And now ladies and gentlemen we have the gripping story of a runaway train and the many valiant attempts to stop it. In order to impress upon us the urgency and turbulence of the developing situation our director has seen fit to keep the camera moving in a distractingly hyperactive fashion be it a quiet personal confrontation between characters or overloud footage of the train bowling along at speed. Among the jerky handheld constantlymoving camerawork is one technique which wore me down very quickly indeed and that was the quick rough zoom I have termed the 'gawk'. Once established the 'gawk' is a constant companion throughout 'Unstoppable' just like an annoyingly bored and sugarprimed kid next to you on a long bus trip. The movie's characters are but ciphers with Denzel Washington obviously now in 'money dear boy' mode as the bestknown face. The wouldbe trainstoppers are a pretty lame bunch but then how can mere humans stop something so determined to wreak havoc? The iron behemoth known as '777' one worse than 666? puts itself into gear takes off with an audible moan and proceeds to charge through the countryside laying waste. It growls bestially travels at whatever speed it damn well feels like and acts downright malevolently any time anyone tries to shut it down. Apparently 'Unstoppable' has been in development hell since 2004 and frankly it looks like it's been there since 1984. The CGI is brief but rest assured it looks like it was done at 3 AM after a long cocktail evening. 'Unstoppable' is basically 'Christine' with a train but shh you didn't hear that from the director All it would have taken is some expository dialogue about how 777 fell over at the factory and killed three workmen and we would be away. Yet despite so much evidence to the contrary we were evidently meant to accept the story as nonsupernatural. Add to this several ridiculously stupid the cops shooting at the train driving in Blues Brother fashion etc. and physically impossible moments and you have a movie which doesn't work even if you do turn your brain off.

This movie is a silly joke about an unmanned train and nothing along the way is a surprise.The dialog is bland the characters are not compelling and nothing drew us in.Way too predictable. In the end you'll realize this is an hour and 40 minutes of your life that you can't get back.Everything with this film starts and ends with the writing it's terrible but it just goes downhill from there.There are no spoilers in this review only life savers... time savers. The one climactic point in this film is when the train has to slow down to 15 mph or it'll derail into some fuel tanks. You tell me was there ever any doubt the train wouldn't crash? If there were an ounce of originality in this film something unforeseen would have happened and it didn't. Sometimes after films are over my friend and I get into pretty good discussions. We discussed Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive for a long time and still talk about them occasionally. This is about how our conversation went after UnstoppableWhat would you rate this film? I said 4. He said Out of 5?. No 10. Really? I'd give it a 1. I said well I personally think it's 1 star but it's an action film with Denzel and if I were a movie critic I'd give it a 4 just because some may find it entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "It would not be much for me to say that above having Denzel Washington re teaming up with his frequent collaborator director Tony Scott on yet another movie involving a train very soon after last year's Pelham 123. Comparisons no matter how many people try to avoid it is futile. One is always going to end up better than the other.Fortunately Unstoppable is better than Pelham 1 2 3. The main reason is that while Pelham works as more of a crime thriller Unstoppable like the title suggests is an action film. It has exhilarating action sequences laced with heartstopping suspense and whiteknuckle thrills the moment that train is let loose. It is clich to say it but it's terrific edgeofyourseat entertainment. For those who are short on thrills after bland aftersummer borefests here's looking at you Takers this movie is for you.Is it going to win any Oscars? With a movie like this? No of course not. This isn't There Will Be Blood. It's not exactly intelligent but it is mostly believable. Inspired by true story writer Mark Bomback's Live Free or Die Hard script is fueled on one simple very basic premise  a runaway train of doom complete with highly toxic and explosive material packed in the last of its carriages. There are no human villains just human heroics stupidity and carelessness plus a speeding and out of control giant bullet that can cause certain doom for many people. Those human qualities are what gives this film a realistic and believable edge.The heroes are just everyday guys like you and me  Denzel Washington especially proves himself adaptable to every role assigned to him in fact you can say that Washington plays himself in many his films with that friendly smile and gentlemanlike charm. He is tense and worried when the role requires him to and you feel for him and root for his character all the way.But Washington is not alone in trying to stop this missileonwheels. Chris Pine here shows star power and he has many heroic moments. I'm not saying that all looks no substance. The guy shows like Denzel emotions when he needs to. The chemistry between him and Denzel is great the buddy moments were there as well.Both of them are the two main characters but others are busy trying to stop this giant behemoth most to useless effects. Rosario Dawson Kevin Dunn and Lew Temple all give solid supporting performances as they try to stop the train at all costs.Yes the script could use some reworking especially in the clich filled dramatic parts but Mark Bomback's script is ultimately an extended chase sequence that doesn't relent the moment it starts. The aforementioned dramatic moments take place during the action so the film's pace is about as tight as a bullet. It's short simple we're talking barebones simple here don't expect any hidden meanings to be unfurled like the vastly superior Runaway Train by Andrei Konchalovsky and straight to the point. And perhaps that is why Unstoppable works  it has a very nice touch of simplicity with an easy to understand plot and likeable everyday guys who have no choice but to save the day before pandemonium breaks out.Technical wise it is outstanding. All of the films action sequences are filmed with REAL trains and REAL destruction and mayhem making it perfect eye candy for action junkies drained of an adrenaline rush. Twisted metal and explosions are almost always a joy to watch ESPECIALLY if they are real  but in this film some may cringe with the action sequences knowing that it may destroy a town  the danger is there. Not a tinge of CGI perhaps only the sparks? is seen throughout the film. The production design  the setting of the film which takes place in rural Pennsylvania is calm serene and kind of homely most of the film is set outdoors for obvious reasons. The cinematography thankfully is bright lively and crisp  thus allowing the audience to see the scenery as well as the action sequences in all their glory  the shakycam is sparingly used and even so you can still see what's going on as the shakycam is used from a distance. The editing is also very fluid Chris Lebenzon has definitely learned and improved from his dizzying and messy hatchet job on Pelham but this is also due to the intervening of other editor Robert Duffy a frequent collaborator of avantgarde filmmaker Tarsem Singh. Frequent Scott collaborator Harry GregsonWilliams also composes a tense if not unoriginal orchestral score that gives tension to scenes when it needs it.Last but not least director Tony Scott himself. Here is a man who knows how to make an action film. Having made many action films for nearly three decades age has certainly done nothing to slow his signature style down. The direction is kinetic and focused and Scott delivers the action goods in spades. I think due to the friendship and frequent collaboration with Denzel Washington this film marks their fifth collaboration overall that Scott continues to be an indemand action film director and this film contributes to that winning streak. If it ain't broke don't fix it.Take this  anybody can describe the film's plot in just two words runaway train. If people want to see a movie about a runaway train they certainly got it in the form of this film. It's what they pay for. See it with friends especially in a big theater hall with a nice sound system. Glad to see a movie that works entirely without flashy CGI and 3D visuals and still manages to be a terrificly entertaining crowd pleaser.Overall rating 70100 GoodEdit R.I.P. Tony. Such a shocking end to a marvelously kinetic career. You and your films will be missed. Condolences to Ridley and the Scott family.".

Not a tinge of CGI perhaps only the sparks? is seen throughout the film. The production design  the setting of the film which takes place in rural Pennsylvania is calm serene and kind of homely most of the film is set outdoors for obvious reasons. The cinematography thankfully is bright lively and crisp  thus allowing the audience to see the scenery as well as the action sequences in all their glory  the shakycam is sparingly used and even so you can still see what's going on as the shakycam is used from a distance. The editing is also very fluid Chris Lebenzon has definitely learned and improved from his dizzying and messy hatchet job on Pelham but this is also due to the intervening of other editor Robert Duffy a frequent collaborator of avantgarde filmmaker Tarsem Singh. Frequent Scott collaborator Harry GregsonWilliams also composes a tense if not unoriginal orchestral score that gives tension to scenes when it needs it.Last but not least director Tony Scott himself. Here is a man who knows how to make an action film. Having made many action films for nearly three decades age has certainly done nothing to slow his signature style down. The direction is kinetic and focused and Scott delivers the action goods in spades. I think due to the friendship and frequent collaboration with Denzel Washington this film marks their fifth collaboration overall that Scott continues to be an indemand action film director and this film contributes to that winning streak. If it ain't broke don't fix it.Take this  anybody can describe the film's plot in just two words runaway train. If people want to see a movie about a runaway train they certainly got it in the form of this film. It's what they pay for. See it with friends especially in a big theater hall with a nice sound system. Glad to see a movie that works entirely without flashy CGI and 3D visuals and still manages to be a terrificly entertaining crowd pleaser.Overall rating 70100 GoodEdit R.I.P. Tony. Such a shocking end to a marvelously kinetic career. You and your films will be missed. Condolences to Ridley and the Scott family.";

It did not. The train was the bad guy and it had to be stopped even if that meant organizing an entire squad of riflemen trying to shoot the train a veteran soldier from Afghanistan swinging from a rope from a helicopter and a futile derailment setup that looked as though it was made of plastic.This movie is comparable to the likes of 2012 in its ability to brutally offend the eyes ears and rational sensibility of any viewer with a true appreciation of quality filmmaking. It is a pitiful indication of the lengths that Hollywood will go to in an attempt to achieve mediocrity.To very existence of this kind of horse sht is an insult to train drivers. Hell it's an insult to trains! Millions of dollars were spent on this impotent garbage and for what? What did it contribute to the art of filmmaking? Nothing!

It does well in establishing the normality of the lives of these railway workers and the rhythm that they work in. Scott does well in setting the tone of the film early on and with the music accompaniment the tension slowly rises. Pine and Washington are good in their roles and work well together. Perhaps it is because their characters do not get along well which may be easier to portray. Anyway their delivery and chemistry with each other fit the film. Dawson does well in roles with a sense of urgency to them. I vaguely remember her being an FBI agent somewhere else and with this character she is able to portray how intense a situation they're in. I especially liked the cinematography and editing in this movie. With a high speed train moving through various landscapes the numerous wide angle and aerial shots give a good view of the surroundings. The quick jump cuts and juxtapositions between the various characters on screen also helps to keep the audience well informed.One thing that I felt was a bit forced was the family angle. I guess being characters the filmmakers felt that they needed to incorporate family values so put that in there. I didn't care much for the drama of Pine's life though. I was intrigued a little at what may have happened but Pine's character didn't really fit the drama. Overall quite an exciting but simple film.".

	schema:reviewBody "There seemed to be a potential for a good action thriller here such as Speed and seemed to be off to a good start. The first act of this film smartly eases into the dilemma but uses every clich in the book to pad out the story. I am sure that this Tony Scott product depicts the story inspired by true events down to the last detail to laugh. It is not even 5 minutes into the movie and a bunch of school children are tossed in front of the runaway train. Both lead actors Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are given little to work with. Denzel is a bythebook train engineer Pine is a rookie learning the ropes. Their family side stories are fleeting and lack any gravitas. Cue the tracking shots. My god the tracking shots. Tony please by making your tracking shots faster and more frequent you don't automatically make your movie any better. Literally every line of dialogue seems to be a tracking shot. The same tracking shot of Chris Pine's closeup. Again and again and again. I had to look away. I was getting nauseous like I do from the Paul Greengrass effect.Contrary to the the line in the opening credits the screenplay feels uninspired. There are hamhanded digs at corporate insensitivity. TV reporters are continuously providing spoonfed exposition in a way that would insult sixyearolds. And just in case you don't a get enough of the Fox News graphics in the corner of every TV report there is a blatant full blown FOX NEWS ADVERTISEMENT thrown in. And geez what's with the constant helicopter action shots? Do you have to throw two news helicopters in EVERY SINGLE CUT? Every single angle? Every closeup medium wide? Please please please have someone like your brother tell you about the value of LESS IS MORE. In other words you will care more about the characters if you don't put them in cartoonish moments of conflict.Minor Spoilers ahead...A train being driven by Denzel and Pine must move to a side track to get out of the way of the oncoming runaway train. The runaway roars down the main track and slams into the other train with about 10 cars still on the main track. By all logic the 10 cars going the opposite direction should stop or at least derail the runaway train but the runaway seems to only smash through a single railroad car and go along unimpeded. One ridiculous threat of danger is the Stanton Turn an obvious bit of CGI where big obvious fuel storage tanks are neatly lined along the most dangerous point of the curve. With no safety embankments or anything. But of course Tony Scott has to push it to another laughable extreme where the entire town of people wait  weren't they supposed to be evacuated? emergency vehicles and a slew of reporters are STANDING DIRECTLY BELOW THE DANGEROUS CURVE. Come on you stop feeling a sense of danger when you turn it into a Road Runner cartoon.Minor Spoilers finished...A much better film is Runaway Train with Jon Voigt and Eric Roberts. Voigt gives a performance of a lifetime and Andrey Konchalovsky creates a far more powerful sense of danger and excitement. And please don't fall for the inspired by real events. Although the basic elements of the story were based on a real incident in Ohio in 2001 the train never reached 70mph and there never was a dead man's curve. Like the awful Taking of Pelham One. Two Three Scott makes the mistake of remaking a film without improving it. This makes it no better than a TV movie in fact Taking of Pelham was previously a TV movie. I laughed out loud when a seriously infantile piece of animation depicted the imminent disaster again for those born without a brain in Unstoppable just a few moments before the big climax. Perhaps one could defend this approach to filmmaking as being a roller coaster ride not serious cinema. I would disagree because you still get thrill of danger on a real roller coaster. This movie is the kiddie merrygoround.".

I am disappointed that they didn't put a nuclear power plant there with a big target for the most vulnerable spot to hit with a train. I also agree with other reviewers that I have never seen hundreds of cops show up and make so many road blocks nearly instantaneously in the middle of nowhere like that they didn't need to show a dozen of them for the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite it's uninspiring title Ken Russell's Gothic is actually an intriguing and uniquely inspiring piece of cinema. Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is one of the stories that has helped to shape horror cinema and so the story behind it is guaranteed to interest horror fans. This film isn't exactly the story of how the story came to fruition but rather a compilation of ideas surrounding what could have happened but quite clearly didn't. The film takes influence from the enigmatic Lord Byron more than anything and it's always him that springs to mind as we watch the small cast delve into their imaginations culminating in an orgy of sex and violence. The story is simple and focuses more on imagery and the ideas behind what is happening on screen. We follow Percy Shelly and his wife to be Mary along with her sister Claire who travel to the selfexiled home of Lord Byron. While there the four of them along with Byron's biographer decide to indulge in the art of making up ghost stories. However the fun gets out of hand when the quintet begins to believe that they have actually created a monster.The film has a very 'intellectual' flavour but the fact is that there isn't a lot below the surface of this film. Gothic to me at least is a visual treat rather than food for thought  with Ken Russell's imagery providing more than any deep and complex substance. The imagery is stunning and fits into the film very well. Russell's sets compliment the story excellently and the atmosphere in which the film takes place is more important than the story itself. Lord Byron's house is almost a character within itself and when combined with the actual characters Russell has provided horror fans with a very surreal film indeed. The cast is excellent. Films with a small cast rely more on their actors and this film certainly doesn't fall down in that respect. Gabriel Byrne leads the cast and does an excellent job of holding the film together. Julian Sands Natasha Richardson Myriam Cyr and Timothy Spall who all portray their characters excellently join him. On the whole I can easily see why people dislike this film as it's somewhat messy and doesn't adhere to common horror standards  but if you like your horror different this is highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Evocative and nightmarishlike retelling of the creation of a literary classic";
	schema:reviewBody "It must be said I love the work of Ken Russell. If he were of any other nationality or generation he'd be subject to a veritable tome of critical analysis with amazing films like Elgar 1962 The Debussy Film 1965 Women in Love 1969 The Devils 1971 and Savage Messiah 1972 all standing out as some of the most radical imaginative and visually impressive feature films of the last fifty years. Too often his excesses got the better of him as in films such as Lisztomania 1975 The Lair of the White Worm 1987 and Salome's Last Dance 1988 but despite the overall quality of those films the results were always interesting and visually unforgettable. Gothic 1986 has much in common with the latter collection of works being somewhat messy and decadent whilst still trying to remain somewhat conventional in its approach to character and narrative. It is this aspect of the film that is the weakest with the story and the characterisation often feeling somewhat weak or unformed particularly in the first half. However once the film gets going  and the wild images and hallucinations begin to accumulate  Russell's energetic style and talent for creating outr and unforgettable visual compositions and ideas really begins to take off creating a film that is fascinating and open to deeper interpretations regarding the character of Mary Shelley and the unfortunate circumstances of her life that may have led to the creation of her classic and iconic horror story Frankenstein.Naturally the roots of the film are based in fact taking place in June of 1816  the year without summer  when the five central characters met at Lord Byron's Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva. From here the film creates a fictional backstory to the wet and windy night that would give birth not only to Shelley's Frankenstein but also Polidori's celebrated novel The Vampyre. What follows is a bizarre and overwhelming example of pure visual storytelling which is all the more impressive when you take into account the obviously limited budget. However if you can overcome this aspect  as well as the rather poor performances from Julian Sands as the exaggerated Percy Shelley and Myriam Cyr as Mary's halfsister Claire Clairmont  then the film will reward with a truly astounding final act filled with Russell's typically surreal and lurid imagery an escalating sense of feverdreamlike horror and exaggeration and the three fine performances from Gabriel Byrne as the seductive Lord Byron Natasha Richardson as the tortured Mary Shelly and Timothy Spall as the beleaguered Dr. John William Polidori. The tension is also heightened by the choice of location with the film taking place almost entirely within the Byron estate and almost entirely at night although there are two separate framing devises one of which takes place in the presentday and helps clarify some of the scenarios depicted in the film's aforementioned final act.These don't necessarily add much to the story  though neither do they detract  simply giving a certain sense of context before Russell gets on with the mindblowing imagery and finely tuned atmosphere of eroticised dread. Some have likened the film to Dario Argento's classic supernatural thriller Suspiria 1977 with the use of Gothic locations bold colours and a selfconsciously visual approach to storytelling. These similarities stand though you can also see the film as an extension of the earlier Altered States 1980 and Crimes of Passion 1984 both in certain thematic preoccupations and in the actual visual presentation overall. The film works simply because of the intensity of the images but ultimately going deeper than even that tying the whole thing into the character of Mary Shelley and her own sense of personal tragedy. It gives the film that much needed emotional quality helped along by the fine performance from the incredibly young Richardson in one of her first leading roles. She's complimented well by Byrne who takes the role of Byron entirely seriously even when spouting some incredibly pretentious dialog and attempting to seduce every character in the film. Nonetheless the intensity of the role shines through and really establishes the character with his fears and weaknesses going towards the creation of his own personal nightmare that will reverberate through time.The film suggests that by raising the spirits of the dead you fate yourself to an inescapable evil. This is reflected by the tragic circumstances that surrounded the characters  hinted at in that tourdeforce final  and their eventual fate as documented by history itself. It's very clever once you get past the awkward slightly giddy and anachronisticlike feeling of the first few scenes and really get into the horror aspect and the more much rewarding sense of human interest. Naturally it won't be to all tastes as the factors that Russell tends to highlight in his work  religious symbolism garishness sex and sensuality brutality and anachronistic humour  will obviously cause problems for viewers looking for a more conventional horror story. I liked the break in convention though. After all there are plenty of horror films that regurgitate the same old stock tactics and scenarios. Gothic goes for a different approach one that is more eccentric singleminded and unique layering the fact and fantasy elements of Stephen Volk's imaginative screenplay with a lurid and sensational approach to the visual telling of the story rife with his usual themes and obsessions. If you love Russell's work and appreciate interesting and unconventional cinema then Gothic is well worth checking out if not for the bizarre visual aspects and exciting nightmarish final then certainly for the nicely judged performances of Richardson Byrne and Spall.".

	schema:reviewBody "As this film seemed to be the first film that I could find anyway to describe how Mary Shelley came up with the idea for Frankenstein published in 1818 I must give some consideration. However the pains the film goes through in depicting a druginduced nightmarish landscape of horrors is too far gone.Laudenaum a popular hallucinogenic drug during the 19th century brings to life the imagination of five manic individuals Lord Byron his physician Dr. Polidori Percy Shelley Mary Shelley and Claire Claremont Mary's half sister. When Lord Byron challenges them all to come up with the most horrific tale they can muster each cultivate hisher own macabre web of selftorture. This film in an attempt to show the frantic workings of the mind comes off as merely comical at times. Some of the scenes which are intended to shock and convey horror seemed to simply repel. Gabriel Byrne aptly plays the decadent Lord Byron but his character is overly vicious and twisted. Julian Sands plays Percy Shelley who is like a lunatic pedant at best. If you can figure out one thing he says as he seems to spout nonsensical intelligence if there is such a thing then kudos to you. Natasha Richardson does well in playing Mary Shelley although the described free love she was supposedly a participant in I think was a bit of a stretch in this movie and could have been left out.I must admit for all the reviews I read of the film I expected more of a punch and more of a meatandpotatoes thriller story. This film did little but disorient using a sexuallyhedonistic Rubix cube. Perhaps that was the director's intention but the film did little in translating its horror and madness to its characters. Thomas Dolby's score just grates the disorientation further into the bone.I will give the director credit for doing his homework in researching the odd amount of death that seemed to riddle Mary Shelley's biography. The marriage of Frankenstein's creation to this aspect as being nothing ironic is quite clever. All in all I just think a better job could have been done with a brilliant idea. And somebody please give Julian Sands a role where he is not a blithering crybaby! 410".

How true to their actual lifestyle this film actually is I'm not sure but it makes Mary Shelley's masterpiece make more sense.  As for the film Gothic itself words are hard to describe it as it is hard to understand it.  But once one does get it it is far more intriguing than Frankenstein in my opinion.  With the insanity freaky images and the insight into the lives of these famous literary people I would highly recommend this film to intelligent people who like horror films.  It may be far from the best film ever made but it is excellent for people with a mind.  And as I tell people who haven't seen it 'this movie will make you never want to do drugs again'!".

Well it's not a mistake as much as a missed opportunity. Only an constipated intellectual would object to Gothic's Byron portrayal or to the AmadeusMozart  nothing wrong with that. It's just that it would have been much more interesting to have a 'new' view on Byron different from the same litany we've had to hear for the past 200 years. But!But the thing that does it in this one is the casting! The actors are simply great. Julian Sands IS Shelley although maybe with some slight overacting. Same for the others Timothy Spall!. Gabriel Byrne does a terrific job as the Lord himself and even manages at several points to squeeze in some glimpses of Byron's vulnerability eg when Mary rejects his avances. He makes the tragic Byron come alive and not just the dark dangerous madman. However he's too old. And I'm not saying this out of puristic concern. It's just that the partly 'selfcreated' nature of Byron's theatrical tragedy would have come out better if he'd been portrayed as the 28year old he was at the time Byrne was 10 years older and it shows. From the looks pointofview Hugh Grant was better casted in Remando al Viento though his acting was terrible or 'Grantish' and at no point did he manage to portray the subtlety in character that Byrne gave Lord B.Russell had the great idea not to try and portray a significant part of Byron's life but rather to focus on the atmosphere that was about in naive early19thcentury Europe awaking to romanticism. A bit unfortunately Russell focused on the hallucinogenic parts of the Genevanights who would have expected anything else from him?  and misses out on some of the other aspects of that era that formed the Byron character. Of course when you set the movie in one single night you have to invent something to keep the action going  Byron eats drinks and tries to write some verses is not exactly a plot.Anyway cool movie but also a missed opportunity. Maybe make another Byron movie with exactly the same cast? you'd be surprised to see what they can do with makeup these days I see it at least 5 times a year. More for Byron fans however.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gothic directed by Ken Russell is a rather interesting film that deals with among other things the dark side of creativity and imagination. More specifically it's about the night when Mary Shelley came up with the idea that she would later turn into the novel Frankenstein. By and large the performances are quite good although I didn't really care for Julian Sands. However the story was almost nonexistent and ephemeral existing merely to have a bunch of people go around saying stuffy lines and get scared out of their wits by creatures borne of their imaginations. Granted some of these sequences and images were haunting and surreal but it all added up to a lot of style with very little substance. As far as the score is concerned I thought that the work Thomas Dolby did was impeccable as far as its musical quality but some of the cues didn't really fit to me with this kind of period piece. The story takes place in the early 19th century but a lot of the music sounded very 1980's with synthesizers and programmed drums. It's a score that I'd buy but I'm not too sure that it completely fit the film. From a technical standpoint I thought it was very wellmade i.e. it was welllit and the shot composition was varied. There were also some Dutch angles that accentuated the disorienting feel the filmmakers seemed to be going for. Overall if you're looking for a welltold story that has characters you care about and identify with this might not be the best choice for you. However if you like heavily stylized and surreal horror this will probably suit your fancy.".

After much drugfuelled recourse dodgy parlour games and sexually liberated liaisons it becomes apparent that the ever omnisexual Byron has questionable motives and is basically trying to firein to all the guests!

Russell delivers this movie with complete frankness and is somewhat mercenary in his reshaping of the facts to suit his own ends.

Julian sands gives a fantastic performance here he is also intense and watching his mind go crazy was a treat! plus his chemistry with Natasha is so on!. Natasha Richardson is great here she is beautiful on top of things and gave a very good performance! plus she was very likable. Myriam Cyr is very good here she creeped me out in several scenes.

This film is about that night and the people who birthed the modernhorror genre. Poe would cement it shortlyafterward. With lusciouscinematography and an eye for the Romantic Russell capturestheessence of where Mary Shelley's Frankenstein camefrom aswell as the genesis of the Vampireasseducer that was Byron. Ironically Lord Byron never wrote his story nor does it appear did Percy Shelley. Nearlyall of the people from that night were dead withintenyears nearly all diedyoung. Russell almostsuggests they unleashedacurse that fatefulnight yet he also underminesit intentionally showing us that the seedsofdestruction were already present in Byron Percy and Polidori.Fitting to a Ken Russellfilm we are regaledwith lots of sexualexpression and insanity! To say this film is intoxicating for lovers of the Romantic would be euphemisticit is sensual and free totallyunapologetic for its' excesses. It is a genuinelycreepy film with a great sense and love of the unknown a terror morethan a horror as much of the film is the buildup with occasionalrevelation that is horror. Somany images from this film will haunt you for years and many of them include the stillborn children of Mary Shelley the genesis of her creature. Horror is only horror if it is about the concerns and fears of our ownlives and this is why these stories continuetoresonate today. With geneticengineering becoming a reality we can see that Mary Shelley's work also constitutes sciencefiction it is visionary. She would survive both Byron and Shelley to be haunted by her deadchildren and lovers an eternalstory itself. Starring Gabriel Byrne Byron Julian Sands Percy Shelley Natasha Richardson Mary Shelley and Timothy Spall as Dr. John Polidori it's unlikely there will ever be a finertribute to these creatorsof and inspirationsfor modernhorror.Note The PioneerDVD is shoddy. It's simply OK and was taken from a VHSmaster. I saw the film in the theaters and it was definitely matted to be 1.851.

Thomas Dolby She Blinded Me With Science provides a great if somewhat out of place score.Trust me you'll feel like you've been on an acid trip after watching this one!";

	schema:reviewBody "Gothic is set in Geneva at the Villa Deodati where English poet Lord Byron Gabriel Byrne lives in a self imposed exile. Percy Shelley Julian Sands his lover Mary Godwin Miranda Richardson  her sister Claire Myriam Cyr all turn up wanting to spend some quality time with Byron  have some fun Byron invites everyone in  says they are welcome. Over the course of that very night lots of strange things happen which I'm at a loss to explain  the film itself doesn't do a very good job either...This British production was directed by Ken Russell  is a film which almost defies logical explanation or any reasonable critique of it I don't know what Kenneth was on when he made this but it must have been strong stuff  it's no wonder he's been relegated to appearing on Celebrity Big Brother  making home films which noones ever seen. The script by Stephen Volk which takes itself extremely seriously is a strange beast to say the least although one has to bear in mind that what ended up on screen maybe isn't what he actually wrote as many things can happen between writing a script  the finished product if this finished version was representative of his script though one has to wonder how this piece of crap ever got financed  who did he think this mess of a film was going to appeal to? Certainly not your average horror film fan that's for sure. The basic plot about the the events which lead up to Mary writing Frankenstein  Byron's doctor John Polidori Timothy Spall to write The Vampire could have been decent but it's totally lost under loads of pretentious arthouse visuals which are far from impressive. As a whole Gothic is bizarre weird  just totally out there unfortunately it's also pointless boring crap rubbish meaningless empty unsatisfying  what really kills it is that it provides zero entertainment value yes it really is that bad. It's not even historically accurate did you know it was actually Byron who visited Shelley  not the other way round as Gothic would have you believe? Well now you do. I pretty much hated this film from start to finish.Director Russell is in total overthetop mode here with some strange imagery unfortunately it's not very striking  it just all comes off a weird  pointless. The whole film is quite abstract  surreal in fact it's maybe the Salvador Dali of horror films! Just when you think it's settling down into some sort of proper story as Claire admits that she's pregnant with Byron's child or when they hold a sance around an old skull it goes nowhere  ends back up with some more strange scenes which makes no sense. Although the visuals are strange  weird I don't think they are particularly stylishly filmed or constructed which doesn't help. The film as a whole is quite tame the nudity isn't excessive  there's no gore or violence to speak of.Technically the film is alright the location used was Gaddesdon Place in Hamel Hampstead in Hertfordshire which is in good old England  the house in the film just feels very empty  basic although it's obviously of the right period  looks the business. It's generally well made with decent production values throughout. This has a good cast with Byrne Richardson Spall  Sands but they ham it up  put in pretty bad overwrought performances.Gothic is a film which I personally hated I'm positive it has some fans out there but most filmgoers will find it an absolute mess. In fact I'd struggle to even call it a proper film it's that bad who in their right mind actually green lit this piece of crap  how did Kenneth manage to convince anyone to finance it?".

To see it brought to life with so much BAD dialog and these were literary greats! and SENSELESS grotesqueness was a huge disappointment. An example below with a very minor spoiler.VERY MINOR SPOILER When Shelley sees his wife crawling around on the basement floor naked covered in filth and clutching a dead rat in her mouth he intones with terror in his eyes This is madness! She hates rats! Ugh.Sorry fans. I give it a 010.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great situation. Here are Byron and his girl friend Camille Shelley and his wife or rather his girl friend and Dr. Polidori. All come together on a haunted evening and agree to dream up ghost stories. Poor Polidori tried but his effort stank. Byron put in a bit more effort and talent and incorporated it into the introduction into a later longer work. Or was that Shelley? I get them mixed up. The most important thing to come out of that summer was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. Well it's understandable. It was a time when science was flexing its technological muscles during the industrial revolution and theology was coming under rational scrutiny which is always bad for theology. Within a few years there would be a virtual revolution underway. Andrew Dickson White's The Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom Madame Blavatsky a kind of sance movement in which lots of celebrities joined including Sir Arthur ConanDoyle and Houdini's widow. The question at the time wasn't so much What can science do? as What can science NOT do? It is utterly fascinating to wonder what went on during that summer. Lord Byron was a manicdepressive vide Touched With Fire by Kay R. Jameson. Shelly was effete and almost a semimystic. Camille I don't know anything about. Mary Shelley was the daughter of William Godwin who had been inspired by the French revolution to write Enquiry Concerning Social Justice in 1793. He was kind of a preMarxist and believed the world was moving towards a perfect condition in which government would be unnecessary. He got most of his notions from the Marquis de Condorcet who ironically was hiding from the revolutionary extremists who wanted to cut off his head for advocating such counterrevolutionary ideas as the abolition of the death penalty.It's a terrific situation and Ken Russel through an excess of self indulgence doesn't get the job done. What we see is at the same time boring shocking and irrelevant. I won't go on about this. The acting is okay but everything else except the sets and photography are dismissible. The party guests drink wine laced with laudanum an opiate and then have horrifying hallucinations. When was the last time an opiate user experienced anything but pleasant imaginative reveries and transient euphoria? Russel has people crawling around in the mud eating rats doing the vampire thing how did that sneak in? arguing and fighting with each other and not having a good time at all. Jeeze I'd never go to a party like that. Been to too many already. Natasha Richardson looks good and acts good as always. I don't know why with her talent she didn't move farther up the ladder. Perhaps it's because she is merely attractive instead of dropdead gorgeous thanks to fabulously expensive dentists. She put in a turn on one of those Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series that was truly memorable. Sands looks properly wimpy as Shelley a monstrously talented poet with colossal legs of clay. Nobody seems to know much about Camille so it's okay that she looks like one of those blackandblue Tijuana hookers with slightly jellied flesh. Actually I wouldn't mind biting her throat with my incisors myself. But all seriousness aside this is a ghastly movie. It's not fun at all. Boiled down it's hardly a narrative but rather a succession of increasingly revolting images  of cockroaches blood rats. A bit of orgiastic sex might have saved it but there's very little of that. I can't imagine to whom this movie is designed to appeal. What does the word depraved mean?".

Gothic covers the story the Romantic Poets Lord Byron  Percy Shelley Shelley's wife Mary as well as their companions and the evening that lead to the creation of Frankenstein and the Victorian vampire tale. Russell uses an 80s MTV aesthetic combined with lavish period set pieces and bizarre horror elements to create a rock star world that the poets would have surely be drawn to if they had lived 150 years later. On top of this Russell successfully integrates Henry Fuseli's  an early love interest of Mary Shelley's mother painting masterpiece The Nightmare into his film. This piece of art caused such a sensation when unveiled in 1782 that it can really be considered the first great horror franchise so it's very cool to see it come to life on screen and such surrealism sets Gothic apart from Haunted Summer and Rowing in the Wind.... 2 pretty good contemporary efforts that also cover Byron and Shelley's Swiss exploits.".
