The story has some clever stuff in it but it strictly played for laughs and reactions since credibility is about zero in many parts of this story. However it's supposed to be outrageous. I don't think Geena Davis has ever played a nicer role than this. It was good to see. The husband was just as nice played affably by Hugh Laurie.The jokes are good for the kids and adults. I know a couple of parents who liked this movie even better than their kids so don't believe it when someone writes that this is a film strictly for kids. That is not so. I did object to some profanity in here at the end which seemed so out of place but it's hard to expect Hollywood to get everything right. The sequel to this film is even better!".

Luckily the human characters don't interfere too much with the animals and still bring a certain charm to the screen. Stuart is wonderfully voiced by Michael J.Fox and he joined by a hilarious Nathan Lane as Snowbell and a villainous Chazz Palminteri as Smoky. The script is intelligent and sweet and there are plenty of charming scenes with Stuart and George. All in all really sweet fun and memorable. 810 Bethany Cox.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you told me five years ago that I'd be watching a movie about a mouse who is adopted by humans I'd probably ask you what kind of drugs you were taking and how many would I need to take to enjoy such puerile piffle. But five years ago we didn't have the kind of technical wizardry we have now witness Toy Story the new Star Wars or any of the recent Disney films. Five years ago the mouse would have been a regular rodent with a nottoosubtle voiceover. Remember Homeward Bound the movie about the two dogs and the cat? There was no computer animation there and you were basically left with three animals who appeared to cavort onscreen while some humans talked in the background. So now here we have Stuart Little a tiny little mouse voiced by the alwaysfresh Michael J. Fox who has lived his entire life in an orphanage. One day the Littles Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis come to the orphanage looking for a brother for their young son George Jonathan Lipnicki. Of course with so many cute little boys and girls it's impossible to choose  until they come across Stuart who seems smart funny and wise beyond his years. George isn't too fond of Stuart at the start  he expected something a little... um taller  but this is a kids' movie after all so eventually they bond as only a boy and his mouse brother can  by winning a boat race against a nasty bully.There are a few storylines jammed into this 85minute extravaganza. Stuart wants to learn about his natural parents the family cat wants to kill him and the parents want Stuart and George to get along. The way most of it plays out will come off as standard movie fare  predictable to those of us over 10 perhaps  but the winning charm of Fox as the loveable Stuart coupled with an engaging and appealing cast of characters makes up for any familiarity you might feel. On top of it all  the special effects. Now I'm not one to heap overweening praise on special effects but at no point during the viewing of this movie did I consider Stuart or the cat voiced by Nathan Lane to be an artificial computer creation. Sure you have to suspend belief a little bit for this movie but hey  don't you have to do that with almost any movie anyway?".

The mouse is entirely computergenerated in an efficient way and the contributions of Michael J. Fox's voice work out very well. The same goes for the other animated characters. All of the liveaction performances were welldone and they blended in perfectly with the CGI characters.Stuart Little has a good heart and it is can be a very warm little family movie for everybody to enjoy.

To get rid of Stuart Snowball reaches out to some local alley cats to set up a whack on Stuart.If my plot synopsis has talked up the mafia connotations of the cats it is because that is the part of the film that I find the funniest part of the film because it is lacking in the syrup that kind of takes away from the rest of the film.  The main story is quite sweet but also has a good sense of humour that will appeal to adults as much as children.  It's not perfect for like I said it does get a bit overly sentimental at times although it just about manages to stay sweetly sentimental and not fall into being sickly sentimental.The animation is superb and only occasionally does Stuart look out of place in the frame.  For the most part it all flows well together and was deserving of the Oscar nomination.  Just as deserving is the animal training  anyone with cats will know how hard it is to get the little bstards to do anything you want so to have them do so much work is very impressive although I understand it is all about food.The cast are all pretty good.  Davis and Laurie play it straight and are lumbered with carrying the emotional side of the film and don't have much comedy a shame considering Laurie's talents.  Michael J. Fox does the best work  he makes his Stuart very sweet and likeable a true prince amongst mice!  Lipnicki does OK but is basically just the cute kid' that is legally required in all American family movies.  The funny stuff comes from Lane Zahn Kirby Tilly and best of all Palminteri who's mafia cat is hilarious and sends up his own characters by doing so.Overall this is an enjoyable family film.  It may not be hilarious for adults in the way Toy Story and it's like are but it is not dull.  It has characters for adults and plenty for children and it's all a bit of fun with a slightly overly sweet centre to it.".

In short it is a film suitable for all audiences. The voice of the mouse in English is done by Michael J. Fox and Snowbell is done by Nathan Lane.

	schema:headline " Great movie for all the Family";
	schema:reviewBody "Note  This is a condensed version of my review Pros To start I felt the voice and on screen actors gave great performances. Michael J. Fox as the voice of Stuart little was a great choice as he brings in my opinion allot of charm and emotion to the role now it may seem strange to cast him as the voice of a ten year old mouse even though at the time Michael was in his late thirties. It's really hard to comment on though because I thought the voice and the character design fitted perfectly. The rest of the voice cast are great too Nathan lane as the voice of Snowbell is again another great casting choice and he brings so much charm to the role as this reluctant and over melodramatic feline not to mention Steve Zhan as Monty the alley cat who brings allot of wisecracking humour to the role. The on Screen performances are also very really great Keep in mind that Huge Laurie Geena Davis and Jonathan Lipnicki all had to work with thin air literally. As Stuart was this CGI character he'd later be brought onto the big screen through post production as all the on screen actors had to work with was maybe a replica doll of Stuart and then would have to do the actual take with just them imagining he was there on the set so it's pretty impressive considering that's what they had to work with throughout the majority of the film. I also have to mention that the score by Alan Silvestri is incredible. I felt the score truly brought Stuart little to life and made all of these small sized adventures seem more grand and captivating than originally thought. Now some may say that the score can get some what overly whimsical at times however I thought the score was perfect for this film and really stands out during the Central Park Boat Race. Alan Silvestri has performed scores for many films including allot of Robert Zemeckis productions including the Back to the Future Trilogy Forest Gump Cast Away and even the first two Predator films not to mention a couple Marvel films including captain America The First Avenger and the Avengers. I should also mention the direction of Rob Minkoff is great too some of the action scenes in the film including the Central Park Boat Race and a car chase that happens later on in the film are very well shot and extenuate how daring these events must be for a mouse like Stuart. As I said at the beginning of this review Stuart little was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects how this wasn't for best original score I don't know but considering the other two films nominated for best visual effects were the Matrix and Star Wars Episode One The Phantom Menace I think the film got overshadowed by those two films but I do think the CGI for Stuart has held up incredibly well and considering the Film came out over 16 years ago the Oscar nomination is well deserved and plus id rather take Stuart Little any day over Jar Jar Binks. Cons Some of the dialogue is also a bit odd like there's this scene when Mr little and George are preparing their boat for the Central Park Boat Race. George is unsure about the boat race and Mr Little asks if George is okay and George says he wants to go home. Mr little asks 'why' and George says 'I forgot to bring my lucky underwear Mr little replies'you don't have lucky underwear' but George replies with 'well maybe we should get some and then come back for another race'. What? I don't know whether that was meant to be funny but to me at least it's a very strange piece of dialogue but then again this movie was written by M. Night Shyamalan so I shouldn't really be surprised one bit.I'm also not sure how close the movie follows the original novel and keep in mind that I haven't read the novel and I have heard that the worthy follow up Stuart Little 2 follows more closely to the original novel than the first film. I heard in the original novel that Stuart got caught in a windowblind while exercising and then Snowbell places Stuart's hat and cane outside a rat hole panicking the family. I believe they may have replaced this scene with the one from first film in which Stuart is accidentally thrown into the washing machine although the Central Park Boat Race is in the original novel. I think the biggest complaint that this film gets quiet often is how unbelievable it is because well how can a mouse walk around New York without being stepped on by the foot of a human. How can you adopt a mouse as your son and take him home on the same day how come cars and boats are operational with inner working parts without the use of an RC steering wheel and Batteries. You really do have to go into this film with as much suspension of disbelief as possible otherwise you'll probably hate this Movie for how unbelievable it is. Final Verdict Overall I think Stuart little is a good movie for all the family. Although the film takes some liberates with adapting the film from the novel and the dialogue is a bit odd the excellent voice and on screen performances Incredible score by Alan Silvestri and amazing special affects make this film stand out over other family films the film has also in my opinion has held up surprisingly well after the film was released 16 years ago in my opinion Stuart Little gets an Seven out of ten".

However after watching it fully not only I have got addict to watch it every time it is telecast on TV on any channel and irrespective of the fact whether the version is Hindi dubbed or English the original one. This movie has gone so deep into my heart that it moves me every time I watch it.Stuart Little is a unique combination of computerised animation and live action. The central character  Stuart is a rat and there are certain other animal characters in the movie in the form of the cat  Snowbell his friends cats and one rat couple playing the fake parents of Stuart. These have been managed through computerised animation with their dialogues dubbed in human voices. And then we have human characters too which are the members of the Little family husband wife and male kid plus the supporting characters. The activities and relationships of all these animated and human characters form the touching screenplay of Stuart Little which is undoubtedly an outstanding movie winning many awards.Little rat Stuart is adopted by Little family consisting of Mr. Fredrick Little his wife Eleanor their son George and the pet cat Snowbell. The Little couple loves its adopted son very much but George is not ready to accept it as his brother and Snowbell is not happy to have a new member in the house sharing the love of its masters. How Stuart wins the hearts of both George and Snowbell and finally settles down in the family after a short span of separation from them because of a rat couple claiming to be its parents forms the remaining story.Director Rob Minkoff has excellently directed the story adapted from the book of E.B. White with the screenplay written by Manoj Night Shyamalan and Greg Booker. The movie is so engrossing that the viewer hardly realises when it comes to its end. It is wellpaced yet very touching movie. Right from the background score to the dialogues of the animals in the voices of Michael J. Fox for Stuart Nathan Lane for Snowbell and others to the camera work and art direction to the performances of the artists Huge Laurie Geena Davis and Jonathan Lipnicki as the Little family everything is just superb. The animated white rat Stuart looks adorable and lovely. Seeing it wearing different style of clothes and doing different things like the humanbeings is an experience to cherish. The scene of the boatrace is outstanding. The film does not let the viewer down even for a moment.Now the bigger question is  why do I like a children's movie so much that I am ready to watch it countless number of times ? In fact I have given standing instructions to my children to call me immediately whenever they find Stuart Little being telecast on any channel whether in English or in Hindi dubbed version. Let me explain the reason for being so much passionate about this movie. This movie establishes Indian family values which are universal in their appeal in the most effective manner. The love and affection among the family members their adjustments and compromises to accommodate one another their readiness to sacrifice own joy and benefit for the fellow member's sake everything touches me deep within. Two members of a family may not look alike they may not be associated biologically and there may be a plethora of apparent differences between them still the bond of love if wellknit can keep them mentally close.The love of the Little couple especially the mother for the adopted rat and the rat's reciprocation is able to confirm my view that our love can find its genuine expression even for the animals. When Snowbell the pet cat of the house after first misguiding Stuart when it returns back to home and then consipiring with its friends to kill Stuart finally saves Stuart's life from its friends i.e. other cats Stuart tells them other cats that it is not necessary for two members of a family to look like one another and the love can stand despite the appearance difference is a lesson for all in the humanworld too.Stuart Little has everything to recommend itself. It generates laughters. It generates amusement. It generates emotions and tears. Not only me anyone who has seen it once can watch it several times. I have seen its sequel too. However it is the first and the original part which has had a standing positive impact upon me.I end my review with the final dialogues in the Hindi version of the movie. When Stuart is finally back home in the ending scene it asks George  Kya Ek Sukhi Parivaar Aisa Hi Hota Hai ? Is a happy family like this only ? and gets George's reply  Haan Jab Sapne Sach Hote Hain Yes when the dreams come true.".

Fox as a brother for their son GeorgeJonathan Lipniki who at first doesn't like Stuart Little until he learns he can be a big help with such things as building boats and winning boat races! But Snowbell the cat voiced by Nathan Lane who I think did a good job as the voice of Snowbell just like he did Timon in The Lion King is jealous of Stuart and wants to get rid of him but also later learns that Stuart isn't such a bad mouse either! My two favorite scenes are when Monty voiced by Steve Zhan says a mouse with a pet cat? And he rolls over with laugher That scene was just hilarious! I also liked it when Snowbell told the other cats that Stuart was apart of the family and the cats start laughing but Stuart manages to tell them that you don't have to look alike act alike or like each other to be apart of the same family as Snowbell didn't like Stuart but still saved Stuart's life! Good message Stuart! Filled with wonderful characters story and setting Stuart Little is in my opinion one of the best family films since The Lion King. My mom and my Aunt Joyce didn't like it but I loved it! True family movie that the whole movie can enjoy! 10 out of 10!".

Interestingly this was the last movie Estelle Getty starred in before her retirement as well as the fact that the screenplay was written by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Booker. The story's loosely based on the book written by E.B. White with some of the plot being moved to the sequel. George Little Jonathan Lipnicki is the only child of Eleanor and Frederick Little played by Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie. He wants a brother so while he's at school his parents visit the orphanage to adopt. They decide to adopt an anthropomorphic mouse named Staurt voiced by Michael J. Fox much to George and their pet cat Snowball's disappointment.It doesn't take long for Stuart to get the picture and begins to feel like an outcast. This leads him on a journey to find his real parents while avoiding cats who want to make a meal out of him. Will he find his true home and earn his place in the family? See for yourself. The movie's heartwarming and the effects are great. Both Stuart and Snowball voiced by Nathan Lane look like they're actually there. I like how the moral of this story is finding your true self and where you belong. The movie doesn't shy away from the dark side of being a foster parent and what they to go through. At the same time it's not completely dark as there're a lot of funny tender moments. Not much else to say. Just watch and I guarantee you'll enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "aka FLAVIA THE HERETICFinally Synapse releases the full uncut version with the sex torture and nudity intact.  This is supposed to be the ultimate 'nuns in hell' movie so it deserved a definitive version.In the 15th Century Flavia is sent to a convent by her evil father in order to cleanse her soul.  She questions why the rules are the way they are and why men have to be in charge of everything.  She also questions why nuns are routinely tortured for even the slightest of transgressions.For instance in a truly repellant scene they dip cups of black tar on the stomach and breast of one nun and then cut her burned nipple off.  Flavia can't stand any of this so she runs away with a local Jew who is an overseer of her father's dowry to the church.  They are quickly caught and sent back to be punished.  Flavia gets flogged with a whip while her Jewish companion is held in a dungeon with chains.Then Flavia takes up with a Moslem commander after an attack on a coastal church thereby guaranteeing her revenge on the convent.  The Moslems rape and pillage the nuns leaving all of them dead except for Flavia.  She also stands by while the Moslems push her father down a hole leading into the torture chamber they used to routinely punished the nuns.  The scene where the blond woman climbs into a cow's carcass is classic although I think Pier Paolo Pasolini did something similar to that in one of his films.  No? In the end her Moslem lover leaves her behind because she is disobedient leaving her to her fate at the hands of the surviving Christians who torture her in an obscene manner.  You the viewer will have to see it for yourself.The film does have it's flaws however.  The pace is a little slowgoing at times and the battle scenes between the Christians and the Moslems looks amateurish.  The Synapse DVD has an interview with Florinda Bolkan concerning her views on feminism and the making of this film.  She's aged quite a bit in the last 25 years although I think she was already in her mid30s when she made this film.6 out of 10 for showing some originality in the nun genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flavia the Heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euroexploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored. This is an intelligent and complex film beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate! This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well. Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent. She refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this. After a fruitless attempt to escape she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty Muslims into the walls of the convent.Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film! Almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco Mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing. I challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneerfeminism more intensely than Flavia does. Several sequences are quite shocking on the verge of nightmarish actually as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes torture and mutilation. Yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds mind you. I'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'Flavia' is trying to communicate Humanity the Catholic Church in particular historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further. Films like Flavia the Heretic have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and I truly admire them for it. Flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography the glorious costumes  scenery and a breathtaking musical score by Nicola Piovani. Florinda Bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's Mara Casares who steals the show as Sister Agatha. She's a manhating and loudmouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field! Amen sister!".

A lengthy druginduced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise far more flamboyant DEVILS notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semiporn reputation.

She later flees and becomes the lover of the leader of an invading Muslim army and with his muscle underpinning her she enacts grisly revenge on those who have wronged her.Flavia the Heretic is one of the prime examples of the subgenre known as nunsploitation. Along with The Devils 1971 it combines some serious drama along with gruesome exploitative material. Although it could be argued that in both of these films the nasty scenes are pretty necessary in reflecting the grimness of their respective stories. Both films look at the dubious actions of the church in the middle ages but Flavia more specifically has a feminist outlook as well and considers the role of women at that time. Consequently this is an unusually serious minded bit of nunsploitation. It is considerably helped in this regard by a standout turn from the always impressive Florinda Bolkan in the lead role. She essays the emotional story arc of Flavia quite expertly and certainly elevates the drama of the story. This is a very interesting central female character of a type you don't see very often leading a movie especially in a film of this type.In regards to the more visceral aspects there were a few very grim scenes of torture and graphic excess including a borderline unwatchable castration of a horse and a gruesome climax. Some of the horrible scenes have a definite overall point though such as a sequence where a rich and decadent duke rapes a servant girl in a pig sty. It's a scene that illustrates the way that women were treated like animals by the ruling classes who were at liberty to act as they saw fit. On the whole Flavia the Heretic is an Italian genre film with a more arthouse sensibility than was typical. It provides both vicarious thrills and something to actually think about. And that's not a bad achievement really.".

Flavia questions the submissive treatment of women and is submitted to the repressive Catholic system in the convent. When Flavia has the chance she flees from the convent with the Jew friend Abraham Claudio Cassinelli. However they are captured by her father and Flavia is whipped and Abraham is imprisoned in the dungeons. During the Musulman invasion of Italy Flavia becomes the lover of their Muslin leader Ahmed Anthony Corlan and uses him to revenge against the nuns that have humiliated her and her father. I was curious to see this 1978 movie of nunsploitation not because I am fan of this subgenre of exploitation film but because of the Brazilian Florinda Bolkan. Flavia la Monaca Musulmana is a brutal nunsploitation associating the usual themes of sexual repression and religious oppression with revenge. There is no historical background and most of the situations are only pretext for nudity torture and violence. Now I am satisfied but this film is only recommended to very specific audiences since it is very offensive specially for religious viewers. In the Extras of the DVD there is an interview with Florinda Bolkan. My vote is six.Title Brazil Flvia a Freira Muulmana Flavia the Muslin Nun".

Ms. Bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences her witnessing of the hated local Duke's casual rapist activity her forbidden love affair with a Jew her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed Anthony Corlan There are some painfully realistic gory sequences human flaying in this film that are not for the squeamish but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest. Deserves to be seen if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reportedy based on actual historical events this disturbingly violent bloody and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era. Ms. Bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences her witnessing of the hated local Duke's casual rapist activity her forbidden love affair with a Jew her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed Anthony Corlan There are some painfully realistic gory sequences human flaying in this film that are not for the squeamish but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest. Deserves to be seen if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world.";

Of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the story.It is set in 15th Century Italy at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto. The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards that the mother superior would ask Why do you fear the Muslims they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you? Certainly there was enough torture on both sides.Sister Flavia Florinda Bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father. In the process she witnesses and endures many things the gelding of a stallion the rape of a local woman by a new Duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew. The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun and her nipples cut off.Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the maledominated society in which she lives. She even asks Jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all men.Eventually she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent. Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time. But tragedy is to come. She manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the Duke and her father but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same. She is a woman and that is all there is to it.I won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades.Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.".

As it turns out though four years earlier Florinda had also played the role of a vengeful sister in the infamous ItalianFrench coproduction Flavia the Heretic. This earlier film however takes place around the year 1400 in the Pulia region of southern Italy. In the film Flavia Gaetani is forced into a nunnery by her monstrous father.

Florinda who appears in virtually every scene in the film has rarely been bettershe is a terrific actressthe picture's lovely and memorable score by Nicola Piovani does much to establish a medieval atmosphere and director Gianfranco Mingozzi's work here is assured and imaginative.

	schema:reviewBody "Flavia la monaca muslmana aka. Flavia the Heretic of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of Italian Exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists. Set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful Florinda Bolkan Flavia the Heretic may be referred to as a 'Nunsploitation' film. However this film differs quite drastically from the typical Nunsploitation flicks from the time as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism sadistic lesbian punishments etc. Personally I saw more similarities to the Hexploitation flicks of the time such as Mark of The Devil even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witchhunts which focus on the brutal execution of Christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period.Italy around 1600 After witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded Muslim soldier young Flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent. When her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later Falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church and she joins a band of Arabic scavengers...One thing is for sure Flavia the Heretic is not for the fainthearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings. Director Gianfranco Mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes. The many torture and executionscenes are extremely disturbing with skinnings spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film. The violence here is never superfluous however. After all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in. The film is very wellmade with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by Nicola Piovani. The stunningly beautiful and great Florinda Bolkan has proved her talent in many great Italian cultproductions including Lucio Fulci's Giallomasterpiece Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino of 1972. She delivers another great charismatic performance here and I couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does. The film has some minor inconsistencies E.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cultfollowers into convents in the first place. However it is overall amazing how realistic this film is. Flavia the Heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of Italian Exploitation Cinema. This is a great Exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood. Highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.510".

It tells the story of a 14century nun Flavia Gaetani Florinda Bolkan who after being placed into the church by her overbearing father embarks on a journey through a world dominated by men. She witnesses one of her fellow nuns being brutally tortured after losing her way during a visit from the 'tarantula sect' sees rape at the hands of powerful men and is even captured and whipped by her own father.After the Moslems invade Flavia falls in love with one of their leaders Ahmed Anthony Higgins and the two start a love affair. Returning to her convent Flavia with a band of Moslem warriors behind her wreaks revenge on all those who have wronged her and succumbs to an orgy of sex and violence. It is here within the last forty minutes where the film certainly ignites the interest. The juxtaposition of sexual violence which includes male rape and sex with swords with the violence is quite disturbing in the same way as Pasolini's Salo 1975 was but came out the year before. Pasolini's controversial movie is by far a better film but Flavia did surprise me with its world cinema attitude and scenes of almost avantgarde strangeness a naked woman crawls inside a hanging animal carcass as the violence explodes around her.Although I would say it is unfair to label this as simply 'exploitation' the film does succumb to the Grindhouse audiences desire for cheap thrills. The endless array of 1970's flesh does become tiresome in the first half where the events that are supposed to be developing Flavia's feelings of injustice come across as nothing more as an excuse to get more tits on the screen. This causes the majority of the first film to be extremely slowmoving and often quite tiresome. Yet overall when you peel back the layers of exploitation there is an interesting movie beneath that does a lot with its apparent small budget just as long as you can stomach scenes of sexual mutilation and human skinning.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

The film's reputation for gory depictions of carnage and torture was not exaggerated but seeing how these scenes are part and parcel of its unflinching portrayal of the Middle Ages stunningly shot in earthen tones by Alfio Contini they do not feel gratuitous or sensationalistic besides the whole comes wrapped in an evocatively beautiful soundtrack courtesy of future Oscarwinner Nicola Piovani. Bolkan able to convey much without the benefit of dialogue is impressive as ever she convinces in her character's every facet including donning a soldier's armor and this is possibly her signature role. Maria Casares bestknown for playing Death in Jean Cocteau's ORPHEUS 1950 is animated and uninhibited despite her timeravaged looks a' la Alida Valli for the record I thought she would be playing the convent's obligatory stern Mother Superior but is actually the one to inspire Flavia towards rebellion.

While having undeniably greater significance and scope than most films of its ilk though the expected hysterical writhing is still present in the form of a wandering sect afflicted by the bite of a tarantula! plot development is curiously lacking here  which coupled with the trademark deliberate pacing of the EuroCult style makes for an altogether muddled if never less than interesting affair.

	schema:reviewBody "Whoops it happened again! I was all set to watch the harmless sounding Violent Bloodbath when my finger slipped off the keyboard grabbed this DVD and accidentally put in the in the DVD player. Fathers of teenage daughters during the early 15th century When you notice that your teenage daughter is taking a bit of a shine to the last surviving muslim invader on a bloody battlefield it's probably not a good idea to capture that invader behead him then stick his head on a pike right in front of her. That kind of things makes a lasting impression and throwing your daughter into a convent shortly afterwards isn't going to help the situation. Flavia the Heretic is a grim document of what occurs when this happens.Years later Flavia is still a sexually repressed nun who is about to learn a lesson that all men are bastards. The hard way. Not only does her father continually berate her she also witnesses an arrogant Duke raping a farm girl and get away with it and her nun friend tortured to death for letting her sexual urges get the better of her. Flavia begins to question why the world is male dominated from religion to war to God himself and bitter rage wells up inside. Seeing your best friend's nipple sliced off by your father's cronies will do that to you. Of course this being a film by Gianfranco Mingozzi who thought it was okay to have someone drive a car into a herd of sheep in the film Island of Crime we also get to see a horse getting castrated while Flavia watches. As Ralf Wiggum would say in the Simpsons the castration stands for obviousness. With the encouragement of a grizzled old nun Flavia begins to break free from her maledominated shackles and seeks to destroy the convent and the all the men who have supressed her all her life except good guy Claudio Cassanelli who plays her friendly Jew sidekick. Flavia achieves this by doing what every woman does by joining forces with an invading muslim army and hitting it off with their leader then using his army to kill everyone. Whilst having a very serious point to make about male dominance and the various ways male society has crushed and controlled women in various ways and the sad fact it seems to happen in most cultures the film still has plenty of exploitation elements that go way beyond the boundaries of taste. For every angry speech about female power you have the rapehappy Duke getting revenge bummed by a mob of Islamic soldiers. The part that takes the biscuit for me is when Flavia drugs the entire convent and everything breaks down into a surreal orgy where one woman jumps into that's into the empty carcass of a bull hanging from a ceiling. When she jumps back out again and hits her head on the still attached knackers of the bull I really did start to wonder why I watch these things.That said beyond all the symbolism naked women and suspicious absence of lesbian activity there's a good serious film. Florinda Bolkan is no trash actress and Claudio Cassanelli moody as usual supports her well. So there you go. Flava Flav The Movie.".

Unhappy with this state of affairs she flees with her Jewish friend Abraham. Soon captured she is punished by the convent which causes her to resent them even more. making friends with an older nun who all too understands Flavia's anger they plot to revolt. Eventually teaming up with an army of Muslim warriors called the Tarantulas she leads them back to the convent to raise hell. Now Flavia is the warrior nun determined to revolt against those who caused her such suffering....Flavia The Heretic is far more than your usual Italian exploitation schlock in that it's got far more heart and is interested in actually saying something as opposed to cheerful schlock tactics and exploitative content for the sake of it. Beautifully shot with a fairly lavish set design it can either be read as Italian exploitation cheerfully throwing in issues of the time for a wider audience or a militant feminist tract against the male dominated establishment.But either way Flavia comes across as an angry powerful film with message to go with its sleaze. Exploitation fans need not feel short changed either as there are some eyebrow raising scenes of nastiness here which still have the power to shock today. Florinda Bolkan is excellent in the leading role with a brave performance. Bolkan is a strong featured actress and this brings an unusual presence and intensity to her role that might not have been so effective with another actress.Overall it's by far the best nunsploitation film I've ever seen and it's a pretty good film in its own right.810 well recommended for fans of horror exploitation or just plain good films.".

I know absolutely nothing about the director Gianfranco Mingozzi but he has created an absolutely amazing movie which is like a cross between 'The Sinful Nuns Of Saint Valentine' and 'Tis Pity She's A Whore'. It manages to be a well made historical drama with no punches pulled AND a deliberately provocative exploitation movie simultaneously so it should prove to be extremely entertaining to all kinds of movie fans. I'm no expert on Italian history but I think it's set in the 15th Century not the 17th as the plot summary on this page states. Florinda Bolkan star of Fulci's brilliant giallo 'Don't Torture A Duckling' plays Flavia a young woman who is forced to become a nun by her domineering father. While in the convent she witnesses many example of depravity and violence including the castration of a horse and the rape of a woman in a pig sty by a local Duke. She forms a strange friendship with a fellow nun Sister Agatha Maria Casares who played The Princess in Cocteau's amazing 'Orphee'. Agatha is a freethinker and profoundly influences Flavia's way of looking at the world. Eventually she flees the convent with Abraham Claudio Cassinelli 'Mountain Of The Cannibal God' a Jew she has befriended. This leads Flavia on to the path of enlightenment and subsequently revenge. 'Flavia The Heretic' is fantastic entertainment. Bolkan takes the material seriously even if Mingozzi doesn't the production values are quite high and there is plenty of nudity and gore including a memorable climax involving the skinning alive of Flavia. You either love European horror and exploitation movies of the 1970s or you don't and if you do then this one is HIGHLY recommended! I loved every minute of it!".

	schema:headline " Something of a history lesson via nunsploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Flavia the Heretic has been put in with the 'nunsploitation' subgenre although personally I'd say it fits in closer with the historical period epic genre. Most of the time when these films say that they're based on actual events you have trouble believing it but that's not the case here as although I don't know anything about Italy in the 1600's the film is of a far higher quality than most nunsploitation garbage so it could well actually be based on a true story. I have to admit I prefer the trashier side of nunsploitation myself Joe D'Amato's masterpiece Images in a Convent being my favourite so far but this film deserves respect for its classy and bloodthirsty historical portrait. The film focuses on the title character Flavia. Flavia is a nun at convent that is invaded by a 'Tarantula Sect' and this sect proceeds to insult the nuns and their Christian beliefs by defiling their place of worship. Flavia decides that she cannot take this blasphemy and flees the convent with revenge in mind...The blood sex and violence in this film actually has more power than that in a lot of similar movies. The whole film is very realistic and this is a huge benefit to it as this allows director Gianfranco Mingozzi to create a truly macabre and morbid atmosphere. Much of the plot goes towards building up the central character and this sets Flavia the Heretic apart from many of it's seventies counterparts as it means that the character gets developed in a way that makes sense and it's clear that the director and everyone involved wanted to make a serious piece of art. Florinda Bolkan is excellent in the title role and brings some real credibility to the film alongside a good support cast. There are some truly nasty sequences in this film including many shots of people being spiked a decapitation a very realistic 'skinning' scene and plenty of rough sex. But none of this appears out of place as the director ensures that the graphic violence fits with the rest of the film. Overall I can't call Flavia the Heretic a favourite of mine but it deserves more respect than a lot of these films do and it's definitely worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Flavia the Heretic has been put in with the 'nunsploitation' subgenre although personally I'd say it fits in closer with the historical period epic genre. Most of the time when these films say that they're based on actual events you have trouble believing it but that's not the case here as although I don't know anything about Italy in the 1600's the film is of a far higher quality than most nunsploitation garbage so it could well actually be based on a true story. I have to admit I prefer the trashier side of nunsploitation myself Joe D'Amato's masterpiece Images in a Convent being my favourite so far but this film deserves respect for its classy and bloodthirsty historical portrait. The film focuses on the title character Flavia. Flavia is a nun at convent that is invaded by a 'Tarantula Sect' and this sect proceeds to insult the nuns and their Christian beliefs by defiling their place of worship. Flavia decides that she cannot take this blasphemy and flees the convent with revenge in mind...The blood sex and violence in this film actually has more power than that in a lot of similar movies. The whole film is very realistic and this is a huge benefit to it as this allows director Gianfranco Mingozzi to create a truly macabre and morbid atmosphere. Much of the plot goes towards building up the central character and this sets Flavia the Heretic apart from many of it's seventies counterparts as it means that the character gets developed in a way that makes sense and it's clear that the director and everyone involved wanted to make a serious piece of art. Florinda Bolkan is excellent in the title role and brings some real credibility to the film alongside a good support cast. There are some truly nasty sequences in this film including many shots of people being spiked a decapitation a very realistic 'skinning' scene and plenty of rough sex. But none of this appears out of place as the director ensures that the graphic violence fits with the rest of the film.

Definitely Medievalera though I don't think any specific year is ever given. This being the time of Christian ascendancy the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well.Flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she's immediately taken with him. Her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes. But she'll continue to see him in her dreams.Her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an openair insane asylumthe residents so harshly repressed by unyielding Medieval Christianity slowly go mad. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her. Her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with Flavia who being young and apparently sheltered is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped.The movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world showcasing a lot of unpleasantness. We see a horse gelded a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pigsty the pious torture of a young nun. Through it all Flavia observes and questions rejecting eventually the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic. I disagree with that criticism. Flavia's views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example thencontemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in 1974 revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions. It is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor. Flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight. Getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees.Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive invading the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome Islamist who still visits her dreams. Smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battlegear and directing the invaders to pull down Christian society and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil.Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so but Muslims of that era weren't big on feminism either as she soon learns the hard way. As they say meet the new boss...This is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending. Not a massaudience movie at all to be sure. It's quite good though and doesn't belong on the nunsploitation pile on which it is often carelessly thrown. I think there's much value in the final film and I'm glad I saw it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a mean Mother Superior abusing and torturing her charges Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated.It actually has a feminist storyline though I don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. It certainly wasn't practiced. Women and the Jews and the poor are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. Throughout the story Sister Flavia Florinda Bolkan witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it albeit with disastrous results.The precredit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured evil Muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him. Before she can her hatefilled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics huh?. After this her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Though scenes do involve violence rape and nuns I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. Indeed many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there but the acting camerawork storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. Most nun films I've seen usually have the basic premise of A good girl somehow winds up in a convent where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people andor make their lives a living hell.Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strongspirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me but it's a lot easier for guys Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators of the cruelty and nearslavery of the abbey. In fact it is a Christian not a Muslim invader that impales dear Sister Agatha. It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. I don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story but be prepared to be shocked devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great film so don't be put off by its undeserved reputation as a trash epic. Plus how on Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with Mara Casares' other works but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character.I have read many great reviews of the Synapse US release but I love my German XRated Kult DVD copy.

	schema:reviewBody "Please forgive the cheesy opener. I know that Rent hasn't started off with the best press in the world. Some questioning Chris Columbus' direction some questioning the actors some questioning the film in general. All I can say however is wow! I must admit that I was extremely skeptical about the entire project and that I'm not a renthead and this wasn't one of the movies on my wish list to see but it satisfied me plenty. First off lets talk story most know the story the one of eight East Villagers struggling with everyday life with a few extremes. Just problems like money issues drug addiction and AIDS! A story that could easily be drove full speed into clich heaven but doesn't. It makes you feel the ups and downs of these characters. And how they convey all this not only through dialogue but through song as well. Which brings me to my next point the music. Being a theater major I have heard the original cast album quite a few times and not that it was bad its just the movie music has this pop to it that vibrates your eardrums and your heart in the best ways. And like I said no disrespect to the original. My final point centers around what many are saying will destroy any chances of this movie entering the Oscar race the direction. Well sorry to disappoint the Columbus skeptics out there who think he should stick to Home Alone's and Harry Potter's but he captured exactly what this movie was about. The grittiness the hardships life love NEW YORK! He gives the movie realistic credibility which is always hard to accomplish with musicals i.e.  people breaking into song and dance on the subway. These people sing and it makes you think no differently of life. And to touch up on one more thing the acting what can you say? This cast overcame unbelievable obstacles to make this work and they did just that. Anthony Rapp does an amazing job in leading this cast. La Vie Boheme hasn't left my mind since I left the theater. Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are such a couple to watch. Such chemistry between the two. Their developing relationship throughout the movie makes you laugh cry and well cry a little more. Another scream of a relationship was Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Maureen. Talk about an unlikely couple! Somehow though they make it work oh so well. Taye Diggs is gold as usual as the roommate turned landlord to Mark and Roger. The two that really caught my eye though. The performances that will go in my photographic movie character memory in a very special spot are Angel and Collins aka Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Two guys I have yet to see on film exception with Martin on Law and Order brought to the movie what this movie was about the most and that is love. I'll Cover You sung by the duo will melt your heart in a second.In conclusion all I can say is just give this movie a chance. Don't just go off the negative buzz because this truly is a beautiful movie. A movie that will have you appreciating your life more and more by the second. The movie that will take you on the emotional roller coaster of life. See the Holiday movie of the year.No Day but Today".

Another scream of a relationship was Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Maureen. Talk about an unlikely couple! Somehow though they make it work oh so well. Taye Diggs is gold as usual as the roommate turned landlord to Mark and Roger. The two that really caught my eye though. The performances that will go in my photographic movie character memory in a very special spot are Angel and Collins aka Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Two guys I have yet to see on film exception with Martin on Law and Order brought to the movie what this movie was about the most and that is love. I'll Cover You sung by the duo will melt your heart in a second.In conclusion all I can say is just give this movie a chance. Don't just go off the negative buzz because this truly is a beautiful movie. A movie that will have you appreciating your life more and more by the second. The movie that will take you on the emotional roller coaster of life. See the Holiday movie of the year.No Day but Today";

Figures that journalists whose livelihoods depend on presenting news flashes that will easily fall into the shadows after something more captivating happens would find this material dated. You really think the topic of people living with  not dying from  AIDS is dated? Wakeup friends...I'm not one to throw around statistics but even I can tell you that AIDS is a much bigger problem today than when Jonathan Larson  a genius in his own right  wrote this almost 20 years ago. And drug addiction? Yeah let's not even guess how much that statistic has surged.True the material is not as shocking as it was when it first graced the stages of NYC 10 years ago. But  though I never knew the man  I have a feeling Mr. Larson was not going for shock value. I am sure he realized in his day that his masterpiece would create quite a stir but I highly doubt that was his purpose. What was it then? If you ask me it is obvious ...the human condition.The elements of humanity that satiate the stage version are virtually all apparent in the film version. These characters are vastly different from each other on the surface  but listen to their songs. They are all experiencing life. And not only that for the most part they aren't afraid to experience life  the devastations the love the convictions the laughter the tears. Just listen to Seasons of Love  it's all in there. That song to me is the premise of Mr. Larson's story  this is life. It isn't necessarily glamorous it isn't always glorious but this is what happens in a year of these peoples' lives. And the one thing that gets them through it is the fact that they have each other  their love for one another overshadows all of the intricacies of daytoday life. And that theme to me is never dated especially when it is portrayed so well as Chris Columbus and the incredible cast have managed to do.I applaud everyone who had any part in this film  aside from the excellent adaption of Jonathan Larson's exquisite piece of art I think it is extremely important to constantly expose our society to controversial topics about which most of us don't like to think. And I think the ones that are dubbed dated are the most important because it means that those are probably the ones we have forgotten. But just because it seems dated does not mean it has gone away.".

	schema:headline " Thank You Jonathan Larson";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been sitting on this review for a while and I actually have not had time to come around and post my thoughts. A crew member of mine from OC scored me some advanced screening tickets through Sony Studios which basically meant there was about thirty of us in a small theater watching RENT on the big screen.So on to the movie. To say the least it was an incredible and moving experience. I am the most critical RENT head. I love everything about the lesson of Larson but I was one of the most doubtful of whether or not this movie could pull through. But it did and in fact it was one of the most incredible refreshing flicks I've seen in a while. Too often are we left with movies that we've seen too many times before. Hackneyed plots and overzealous characters. RENT is none of that. From the minute the first chord of the movie starts you are whipped into that emotional and visceral sensation we all had going to our first rock concert as Chbosky would put it. So God damn happy. No really on to the movie. The first fifteen minutes are overwhelming. But in a good way. I'm not one to spoil in fact I refuse to do so. But the flash backs and forwards of character motivations and livelihoods and the song Seasons Of Love accompanying it all is a great way to start the film and by the time the actors really start acting you already feel incongruously close to them.The structure of the film is genius in itself and is what the play version is mostover lacking. With the opening montage and character motivations you immediately are attached to love these eight individuals. With the fun and excitement that follows through and pursues your bonds are strengthened so much more with each of them so that when the heartbreaking conclusion does occur you are all the more affected.Not one performance was lacking in emotion and the choice to bring back the majority of the OBC and bring onboard Dawson and Thoms were fantastic casting decisions. To me the standout performance of the feature was Jesse L Martin as Tom Collins. Not only is he given the biggest character dilemma to deal with and arguably one of the most fantastic character arcs in the movie but his acting is superb and in the event of Angel's death  you're right there with him. As emotionally wrecked as he.Rosario Dawson's portrayal as Mimi was phenomenal. The only reason Dawson failed to stand out as much as Martin is that she is obviously less 'musically inclined' than the rest of her cast. Her Out Tonight dancing however is hot and floored every male in the room. Dawson easily snagged her first nod buzz with this role as supplemented by the FYC poster with only her upon it and she very well could give any other actress a run for their money. Her spirit and her charm are almost entrancing to the audience and when she loses it all  and essentially dies emotionally and mentally it leads to a more heartbreaking moment than Angel's passing.Thoms and Menzel are the other two shining jewels of the cast offering two equally stunning performances and vocal talents. Menzel does well in portraying a very flirty ditzy and very Jewish Maureen  however even though some are saying Menzel will easily land a nomination Maureen is too realistic of a character to considerably be phenomenal acting and Menzel is really only given one scene to show the sensitive side to her frivolousness and the acting isn't anything to write home about.The other notable performance is by Adam Pascal. Mediocre scene motivation but incredible emotion and fantastic vocals. Pascal won't land any nomination for his portrayal but he certainly helps Dawson carry the movie as being the other lead in the love story between the two.Diggs Rapp and Heredia all do well in their individual role. Rapp is offered much more of a lead role than in the play but he fails to comprehend the fact that he is in a film and doesn't have to be as 'big' as a theatrical production. Diggs is solid for his scenes but rarely involved. And Heredia's performance is truly outstanding and when supplemented with Martin's Collins' is heartbreaking it's just a shame that he has absolutely no name for himself to land a nod. He certainly deserves it.All in all RENT is a masterpiece and should be recognized as so. Despite its PG13 rating it is a very fierce and intense movie that really draws out the issues of homelessness homosexuality AIDS and bohemianism in New York in the 1990s. The screening I saw included both Halloween and Goodbye Love contrary to what others are saying so whether or not the cuts were actually made I have no clue about.Needless to say RENT will be a blockbuster hit among all generations and is definite Oscar material and after such negative reviews of most contenders I'd say it has a shot at the gold. The Picture Direction and Cinematography were fantastic and the performances of Dawson and Martin may easily land them nominations. The movie doesn't feel the need to deal with the controversial subjects delicately because they are anything but delicate subject matter  but they do handle every situation with class and that is the class that gives RENT its charm.The movie is certainly a very moving piece of art and just as Colombus said on the OMS I caught myself crying Thank You Jonathan Larson.".

Also he cast many members of the original cast a throwback to old movie musicals. These were brave and successful moves and should finally knock down that door to MORE movie musicals.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!".

	schema:headline " Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll begin by admitting I have never seen Rent on stage. This review will concentrate on Rent as a movie rather than as an extension of a stage show.Rent the movie was a mixed bag for me. On the good side all of the actors perform well. Rosario Dawson and the guy who played Tom Collins stood out in particular. Additionally all of the singing voices were excellent outdoing similar Hollywood efforts like Chicago and Moulin Rouge although not exceeding legendary vocals like Cheryl Barnes' turn in Hair. The actress playing Joanne and the actor playing Collins deserve special credit for their voices and the actor playing Angel is a fantastic dancer far better than what is typically seen from leads in this sort of movie.Unfortunately despite its good production values there were several places where Rent failed to connect. For starters the set design was good but a bit too glossy. Another reviewer said it looked like Disneyland and I'm inclined to agree la vie bohemme in fiberglass. The sets were also dimly lit in many cases making it difficult to see the actor's faces.The most unforgivable aspect of Rent sadly is the pandering storyline. Despite the best efforts of the actors the drama simply fails to connect. Never in this film did I feel close to the characters or sympathy for their plight. Instead they came across as whiny self destructive and demanding. I do not know how much of this originated from the play. The message of the movie very nearly seems to be Honest work destroys the soul. Another criticism I have and as far as I can tell this goes all the way back to the source material is that the situation of these characters seems rather unbelievable and more specifically the musical style mostly irrelevant to them. If I had to guess what kind of music squatters in New York City would choose to represent themselves the lyrical stylings of Rent would be far far down the list. In this way Rent seems more to reflect external perceptions of the bohemian life than how real people in these situations would chose to present themselves. This may be what the author intended but I doubt if most viewers interpret it that way.On a final note I have already seen some people accuse some Rent detractors of not getting it because of inherent homophobia fear of AIDS and so on. As a gay man the exlover of someone who is currently suffering from HIV and someone with more than a little experience with some of the vices shown in this film I absolve anyone feeling guilty because Rent the movie does not really make a convincing argument about any of these situations. I am glad on some level that the film was brave enough to try but a better followthrough would have increased my enjoyment.My overall score 510".

	schema:reviewBody "It's obvious this musical has an incredible fan base. That became evident when we saw the movie version the other day. There were a lot of young people in groups that came to see what director Chris Columbus did to the musical that is still running on Broadway after nine years. The screen adaptation is by Steve Chbosky.Rent written and composed by Jonathan Larson started as a small musical at the NY Theater Workshop and then was transferred to the Nederlander theater where it's still playing. The film has six of the original cast members in it the exception being Freddie Walker who is substituted by Tracie Thoms and Daphne RubinVega who was the original Mimi a role that went to Rosario Dawson in the film.This movie will definitely resonate with a younger audience. The music is targeted to them. This is a poprock opera and make no mistake about it. Don't go thinking you are going to find anything resembling Puccini's La Boheme. The musical is extremely loosely based on the characters from the opera but that's where all the comparison ends. The people one sees in the musical are more real because the pain of what is going on in their lives is clearly evident. The AIDS epidemic affects a few of the characters there are gays and lesbians just being themselves without anyone judging what they do. At the bottom of it all is every day survival in that environment.What Rent is it's a celebration of the life on that side of New York during the 80's when anarchists populated the lower east side of Manhattan squatting in abandoned buildings and living precariously at the edge of a society that didn't want them around. The young people that were attracted to the area brought with them a new way of living without prejudice.Alas everything comes to an end. In fact just a tour of the area today will show the gentrification that is taking place after Mayor Giuliani and his ilk got these bohemians evicted in order to give way to condominiums and new luxury dwellings where the people the movie celebrate will have no chance to live in them at all. This seems to be the problem when artists create spaces that later on are taken over by the establishment only to displace the creators as has happened in Soho Dumbo and will not be too far behind in displacing the Williamsburg's artistic settlers.As a film Rent has great moments. Even though one has heard the songs many times there is still a fresh take on them by the talented cast that sing them. Anthony Rapp Adam Pascal Wilson JermaineHeredia Jesse Martin Taye Diggs Idina Menzel Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson work as an ensemble under the direction of Mr. Columbus who would have appeared as an unlikely candidate for directing the film but who brings the best from his talented cast.By the way Rent was filmed in the west coast so don't go looking for any authentic East Village locations since most of what one sees was probably shot in a studio. The Horseshoe bar is shown on the outside and a scene of Tompkins Square Park but the rest is fake.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw 'Rent' at a screening on Nov.12. I had seen the stage version both in NYC with the original cast as well as in LA with a different cast. The music and story has been echoing in my head for the past 10 years. So I was bound to be critical but determined to be openminded as this was going to be a film not a stage musical. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job in preserving the message and feelings Jonathan Larson I think wanted people to take away with them. The changes made to bring this story to the screen were artfully accomplished. The film is gritty and sad and has a feeling of hopelessness that was difficult to transmit in a stage venue. The music that made it into the film is spectacular and the soundtrack is indeed better than the OBC recording. The loss of several songs though at first disappointing works in the context of the movie. I hope all you fellow 'Rentheads' give this film the chance it deserves. I will be in the theater on opening day next week to see it again for sure.".

	schema:headline " This property is condemned...";
	schema:reviewBody "RENT opens full throttle with the cast loudly singing to show us that they are intensely angry about something though just what they are angry about or why they feel compelled to put it into song is never made clear. Indeed as the film meanders along for over two hours it never really goes anywhere beyond the usual contrived plot complications about lovers breaking up and getting back together. It is obviously going for a sliceoflife quality trying to recreate a time and a place in this case AIDSera New York circa 1990. The multiaward winning play is based on Puccini's opera La Boheme but the film rather apparently seeks inspiration from the screen version of HAIR. Like HAIR RENT features a rambling plot that only provides an excuse for the songs but unlike Milos Foreman's underrated classic RENT is saddled with rather mundane music and cursed with lackluster staging. Tony awards and a Pulitzer prize notwithstanding RENT drones from one barely memorable song to the next trying to be soulfully operatic but revealing its greatest weakness it's faux operetta can't conceal that it is an utterly trivial story about utterly trivial people. HAIR has the added advantage of being about an era with distinction the late 1960s were utterly unique in style attitude and relevancy. Other than taking place at the heart of the AIDS epidemic there really isn't anything that lends distinction to the milieu that RENT desperately tries to document 1990 being not that much different from say 1975 or for that matter 2005. RENT has the sort of timeless banality that is purposely built into TV sitcoms so that they can play eternally in reruns if the dialogue didn't mention what year it takes place it would be difficult to tell. It is certainly difficult to care. The cast repeatedly breaks into one song or another that pointedly celebrates nonconformity as if such a thing was a unique and original concept. Unfortunately so much of what the film embraces as being bohemian seems less shockingly radical than just plain shallow and trendy. What is set forth as originality comes off as clich warmed over beatnik andor hippie counterculture posturing. Rather than being universal in nature the film's call for freethinking seems strangely generic. If anything RENT seems geared to do little more than to romanticize poverty and failure. A good example is the character of Mark Cohen a wannabe filmmaker played by Anthony Rapp. Mark is cursed with a caring middleclass family and is obviously slumming the great tragedy he suffers during the course of the story is that he lands a high paying job with a future. Throughout the movie he is constantly filming some sort of vague documentary about his own life which prompts him to prattle on about his artistic integrity. To this end he utilizes an oldfashioned handcranked camera eschewing opportunities to use stateoftheart equipment let alone get money to finance his project. The resulting film proves to be little more than an amateurish home movie. He is not an artist he's a kid playing with a toy. RENT is an ambitious effort about people without ambition merely kids at play. The roles are tailormade to safely conform to PC standards of diversity a carefully balanced quota of blacks whites Jews Latinos straights gays AIDS sufferers addicts yuppie scum and the now almost mandatory free spirit crossdresser. But it is the type of diversity that is only skin deep none of the characters stand out as unique individuals they are diverse for political correctness sake. The characters come together to keep their crumbling tenement building from being torn down apparently so the characters themselves don't have to actually get on with their inert lives. RENT is a contradictory story that celebrates nonconformity through characters who conform to their common fear of change and growth. The film's milquetoast radicalism extends to its production which is no more bold or original than its call for nonconformity. Director Chris Columbus makes little effort to experiment in staging or editing the musical numbers when he isn't obviously copying A CHORUS LINE or HAIR Columbus gives us an endless array of static shots of characters standing and singing so much so that the rare inventive moment such as Rapp and Tracie Thoms nicely doing The Maureen Tango seem strangely out of place. Had the film brushed aside its lame story and been more of a musical revue of showstoppers like HAIR or CHICAGO or GODSPELL or anything by Busby Berkeley or Astaire and Rodgers then the superficiality of the material would be irrelevant. RENT strives to be neither original nor traditional and ends up not being much of anything.".

What follows a nice opening is a film so pointless so banal you'll ask as my wife did for the two and half hours back you spent watching RENT.I remember when RENT opened on Broadway. I remember I had a buddy who camped out on the street to see the play. I remember people called RENTheads would record the shows in other cities and trade bad audio and video of the off Broadway productions starring Molly Ringwald and Doogie Howser. It was a phenomenon based on the tragic death of it's creator Jonathon Larson more than a well made show and so the play stayed untouched unfiddled around with for who would dare touch the Genius of Larson? Who would dare walk on his grave? If I were the director of this movie I would have begged for a rewrite. If ever there was a film dying for some heart some central core its RENT. It's jumbled it's messy it contains characters that don't mesh there's no coherence no one worth rooting for no one worth hating and that's wrong. The passion and drive of the clunky play may work as live theater heck CATS works as live theater but RENT is charmless pointless and murky and it really shouldn't be.RENT follows the exploits in the year of the life of Mark Anthony Rapp the angst ridden film maker Roger Adam Pascal the Rockstar with AIDS Mimi Rosario Dawson the heroin addicted Stripper with a heart of gold and AIDS Tom Jesse L. Martin the unemployed professor with AIDS Angel Wilson Jermaine Heredia the Drag Queen with AIDS who steals Tom's heart Maureen Idina Menzel the performance artist and Mark's ExGirlfriend and Joanne Tracie Thomas the Lawyer who falls in love with Maureen. They are the bohemians they can't pay the rent they can't pay the heat and everyday they stand the chance of being evicted. So they sing. They sing a lot and at one point at a protest they Moo. That causes a near riot. I wanted to laugh but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater. But I had a feeling they were watching a different movie cause they kept clapping.Why was this film so joyless? Why were the main characters so whiny? Why does RENT have no real heart? The film just assumes that we the audience will like these people and so it makes no attempt to allow them to win our hearts. It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends. But half the film revolves around how these people don't get along. They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine. They hate progress they protest the idea of personal responsibility and fight the man for what? Nothing but a crappy apartment in New York City.The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops. The homeless women look at him and screams something like don't exploit me get a job. These people are not happy the lifestyle they promote is pointless and the film fails to take a stand on any of it.The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level. The dialog clunks haphazardly into the songs. The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater. But you'll have 521600 minutes attacking you in your dreams. If the screenplay would have been retooled to fit the screen instead of the screen trying to replicate the stage a better movie would have emerged. But RENT will appeal only to those who love the play.The other glaring problem is the actors seem too old to embody these parts. With actors culled from the original offBroadway cast it casts and even deeper gloom over the film. We all have to grow up this group of 30somethings edge on pathetic. A new cast of twentysomethings would have worked a bit better.So save your money. You thank me I promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will confess I never though I lived in NYC at the time saw this on Broadwayand despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.Ironically I would've been Bohemianish at least somewhat at the time this was set and I would've have nothing but contempt for a group of pretentious slacker junkies who couldn't be bothered to do SOMETHING to support themselves ethically. I also hung out in the East Village at the time...11th and Ave A was fully gentrified at least 6 or 7 years BEFORE this silliness even takes place. One of the first trendy restaurants The Pharmacy located at A and 9th was well established by 1982 for crying out loud! Very few true struggling bohemians could afford the East Village by 1989.I found nearly every character thoroughly loathsome and painfully dim as well. The only one I could stomach was Joanne probably because really she was largely an outsider and she had an actual gasp job!!!! Which she did without issues!!! Other things I found just repugnant it was twice treated as completely hilarious that Angel killed a dog for 1000. Akitas are LOVELY dogs and animal abuse is sick and gross Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a coupleand given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first placeMaybe NOT such a good coupling I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar I frequented the real one it looks nothing like that insidefor their avant garde status they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes chances are the servers are boho tooTHEY just take responsibility for their lives. I bet all those  don't tip either.I rented this movie since the awful and yet still too kind reviews kept me from wasting my  at the theater. I want my 3.79 rental fee back though.P.S. there was one OTHER character I did like the homeless lady who told pompous pretentious Mark and his junior high film project to  off.".

	onyx:emotionText "I will confess I never though I lived in NYC at the time saw this on Broadwayand despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.Ironically I would've been Bohemianish at least somewhat at the time this was set and I would've have nothing but contempt for a group of pretentious slacker junkies who couldn't be bothered to do SOMETHING to support themselves ethically. I also hung out in the East Village at the time...11th and Ave A was fully gentrified at least 6 or 7 years BEFORE this silliness even takes place. One of the first trendy restaurants The Pharmacy located at A and 9th was well established by 1982 for crying out loud! Very few true struggling bohemians could afford the East Village by 1989.I found nearly every character thoroughly loathsome and painfully dim as well. The only one I could stomach was Joanne probably because really she was largely an outsider and she had an actual gasp job!!!! Which she did without issues!!! Other things I found just repugnant it was twice treated as completely hilarious that Angel killed a dog for 1000. Akitas are LOVELY dogs and animal abuse is sick and gross Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a coupleand given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first placeMaybe NOT such a good coupling I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar I frequented the real one it looks nothing like that insidefor their avant garde status they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes chances are the servers are boho tooTHEY just take responsibility for their lives. I bet all those  don't tip either.I rented this movie since the awful and yet still too kind reviews kept me from wasting my  at the theater. I want my 3.79 rental fee back though.P.S. there was one OTHER character I did like the homeless lady who told pompous pretentious Mark and his junior high film project to  off.";

This movie did not hide the fact that it was a musical the characters would break into song walking down the street in the subway or at a restaurant. I did hear some people discussing the film afterwords saying that they had to hold in laughter every time a character started to randomly sing. I must say it was a little weird though knowing every line of a movie the first time you see it. If you are a huge Rent fan like myself and know the original CD by heart you will find yourself talking and singing along with the film. This movie is a solid 10 and truly lives up to the musical.".

I was very disappointed. I wasn't sure if it would make a good movie in the first place and watching it I became convinced it could it just wasn't this movie. The casting is terrible. Granted it's better to bring the original cast back than to use big names like Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera and the performances are solid. The actors are just too old. This is a generational piece. It's about people of a specific age group and all of the actors were about twelve years too old.Columbus' direction was uninspired and unimaginative. Every number looked exactly the same. If people weren't singing and dancing on a table they were singing and dancing up the street usually holding hands. I understand the desire to capture the grittiness of the environment but there's a way to do that with style and in a way that doesn't look like a Bon Jovi music video. It was painfully obvious that Columbus didn't trust the piece to be the piece. Cutting the music from the recitative but having the actors speak the lyrics was a terrible mistake. It made the screenplay sound like it was written by Dr. Seuss. The first act ran way too long the second act was eviscerated because the first half of the movie was so dreadfully paced and I wanted to leave the film the whole time. I hate to say it but don't see it.".

You'll see in this review that the story and acting were both good but in the end enough was missing to take it from a surefire Oscar winner to another alsoran that was barely worth mentioning.Jonathan Larson's script and compositions are there among the best and he gives us a story that is so moving that it would be hard to mess it up. The movie focuses on a group of friends mostly from the viewpoint of Mark Cohen Anthony Rapp a man giving up a nice life to live in New York and find himself as a filmmaker. He lives with a songwritersinger named Roger Adam Pascal who wants to put out one great song as he is dealing with AIDS. Also entering the picture is Mark's exgirlfriendactivist Maureen Idina Menzel and her new girlfriend Joanne Tracie Thoms. Mark and Roger meet a woman who lives in their building Mimi Marquez Rosario Dawson who is dealing with AIDS and a drug problem while working at a strip club to make whatever money she can. Lastly are two former roommates of Mark and Roger. Benjamin Coffin IIITaye Diggs is a man who gave up the Bohemian ideal to try to create a film studio after marrying into wealth. Thomas Collins Jesse L. Martin has gone off to studyteach and returns to meet a companion of his own Angel Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Mildly confusing no? The story focuses on one year of their life from Christmas to Christmas and what happens within that year. There are problems relating to AIDS death drugs money issues and a few love stories thrown in along the way. While it sounds like a long way to go for this it is truly worth the ride.Most of the movie cast are simply reprising the roles that the created on Broadway. Only Tracie Thoms subbing in for Fredi Walker and Rosario Dawson replacing Daphne RubinVega were not in the original Broadway cast. While the idea of bringing the Broadway cast with them from the show eased a lot of doubts about the movie it also created a problem. The story is supposed to be focusing on a group of young men and women in their earlytomid 20s from what is being said in the movie including the character of Mimi being 19 when we meet her. The problem is that these actors no longer look that age. That is only a mild detraction from the film.In fact a lot of the acting is quite good. Despite not being in the original cast Tracie Thoms is fantastic in her role and made you want to follow her character even when she was just in the background. Idina Menzel was quite good although no longer truly seemed to fit the part in my eye. Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal know these characters inside and out and had no problem bringing that character back to life for the screen. Jesse L. Martin was very good although the age factor seemed more noticeable with him than with any other character in the movie. Wilson Jermaine Heredia makes you entirely forget that he is a man in the movie and wraps himself around this character that he created. Finally Rosario Dawson does an apt job as Mimi Marquez. She didn't seem to take a lot of risks whether it was acting or vocally but conveyed more than enough to complete the role.As I mentioned above the problem lies very much in the directing of the film. Chris Columbus is a fine director showcasing his eye in films like some of the Home Alones Harry Potters and the movie Only the Lonely. However it feels too often like he is shooting a sequence of music videos rather than a film. This is never more prevalent than in his handling of the song What You Own. The song is somewhat of an indictment on modern culture somewhat of an escape song a very nice piece. In the movie it has been turned into a roadtrip song turning one of the only weaknesses in the script a segment where a character leaves then quickly comes back into almost a rock video.As I said the material here is fantastic. With a better vision of the film this could have been an Oscar contender easily. However that is what separates the great from the good and while this movie has moments of greatness its not enough to overcome the partial mediocrity. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I am very surprised at some of the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for  at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's  being so out there and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals nobody would believe you but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City now very much gentrified and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic it was supposed to evoke emotion and that it did at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters both as a group and individually.You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS  the urgency to create the urgency to love  since in 1990 there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of I'll Cover You all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss grief and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus who is well known for directing family films directed this movie. Unfortunately Bob Fosse is no longer with us because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material.".

	schema:reviewBody "They waited too long to adapt Rent to the screen and as a result Chris Columbus's film seems dated and irrelevant. A bunch of 30 something's perhaps it was unwise to use the original now too old cast members complaining about having to pay their rent refusing to work for a living and spouting sanctimonious crap about how much the artistic life is better than the corporate one though not one of them has ever had a corporate job so how would they know? is just too much for this 30yearold who doesn't have a choice about not working in order to pay for a mortgage to take.On stage Rent was fresh and exhilarating. It was about the freedom to be whatever you choose to be and a celebration of art of all kinds. It didn't feel preachy condescending or smug. It took place in an artificial world and a hefty dose of melodrama and unlikely plot contrivances were easier to accept given the fact that it was 1. a piece of theatre and so by necessity an illusion to begin with and 2. based on an opera where melodramatics are readily accepted. In bringing the musical to the film and adding an illfitting realistic structure to the material much gets lost in the translation. The plot contrivances are not easy to overlook and everything feels arbitrary let's see who's sleeping with who now? The music still sounds great and the cast does have a lot of chemistry. Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Idina Menzel are the two original cast members who make the easiest jump to the big screen. Adam Pascal looks lost and Jesse L. Martin mugs too much. Of the newcomers Tracie Thoms is the best addition as Joanne. Rosario Dawson is fine in the role of Mimi but that character doesn't seem like much of a character on screen. And Taye Diggs' role is nearly written out of the film.Really to be honest none of the characters is much more than a type easily summarized in a sentence. This was true of the stage version as well but there the music was allowed to define the characters. On screen Columbus must come up with things for the actors to do and images for the audience to look at and he comes up with nothing memorable.Not every single play book or musical needs to be made into a film and I wish producers would figure that out. I love movies but I love movies when they're cinematic or tell a story in a way that could only be told via the medium of film. I'm all for people who don't have access to Rent in its stage version being able to see it but perhaps a filmed version of the stage production would have been a better way to go. This film will make people who don't already know the material wonder what all the fuss is about.Grade B".

It's a film that flirts with greatness and may actually achieve it in some places but can never seem to do so with any consistency.Jonathan Larson's musical an update of La Boheme is basically a series of vignettes that follows a year in the lives of several starving artists and rebels living in the face of poverty and AIDS and trying to avoid selling out to corporate conformitywhich if you were a college kid in the late 90s when Rent premiered really did feel like the worst thing that could happen to you. Of course much worse befell the world on other end of the millennium and in 2005 the material feels almost innocent in spite of the alternative lifestyles and seedy living. But the cast knows how to sell it and well they should six of the eight principal players originated their roles on Broadway. The newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms fit into the group seamlessly This means of course that they are no longer the fresh young faces they were back then Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs have carved out screen careers Idina Menzel has a Tony award but frankly this doesn't bother me much. I'd rather watch this group of talented performers play a little under their age than suffer Brittney Spears or Justin Timberlakeor any wannabe clones thereofany day.It goes without saying that the cast knows how to give a song dramatic impact and when director Chris Columbus gives them the tools to do their job Rent is very good indeed. Out Tonight the exotic dancer Mimi's Dawson call to the nightlife carries the right balance of liberated joy and desperate longing. A duet where filmmaker Mark Anthony Rapp and lawyer Joanne Thoms lament being wrapped around the fingers of bisexual flirt Maureen Menzel is staged and performed effectively and segues into a delightful dreamsequence tango. And when one of the central group of friends succumbs to AIDS the resulting memorial service is every bit as moving as it should be.Unfortunately Columbus doesn't always know how to channel the talents of his cast. For example there's the nonconformist anthem La Vie Boheme in which a gathering of the young and rebellious celebrate a life of going against the grain going insane going mad and being an 'us' for once instead of a 'them'. If ever there was a song in music theater that begged for highenergy kinetic camera work it is this one. Yet Columbus films it in static shots and slow pans which almost deaden the energy from the castthere's just so much dancing on tables that one can take before it starts to feel stale. At other times Columbus makes the same mistake Joel Schumacher did in Phantom of the Opera of having movement without purpose. Mimi and Roger Adam Pascal step out into an alleyway to share a love duet. They stand and sing for a while move a few steps down the alley stand and sing again then walk back. Why did they move at all? If the answer isn't immediately obvious then the blocking needs to be rethought.Ever since the financial and Oscar success of Chicago studios seem to be searching for the next big movie musical. Rent tries and it comes tantalizingly close but doesn't quite get the brass ring. Here's hoping next month's The Producers nabs it.".

	schema:headline " Mixed bag good outweighs the bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's just say I'm curious to see what somebody who is clueless about Rent thought about this movie. I'm honestly not sure if the things I hated are because I love the show and if the things I loved are because I love the show. Overall it left me with the same wow that was something special feeling but at the same time...I dunno...grasping for more? First the bad news...The beginning. What's up w that??? And I'm not talking about leading w Seasons of Love that was fine. The very beginning is where the characters get introduced and I got the sense that people who weren't familiar with the show or the story would be a little clueless. I've seen the show twice and even I was a little bit um..what's happening? The fact that almost NOTHING happens before Rent was just a little weird. And everything within the song that gives any further indication as to what on earth is going on was cut as well. The thoughts in my head were honestly Good Lord what have they done???The songs were absolutely fantastic except What You Own but I felt like the space between the songs was just bland filler. On stage you don't get that feeling. Maybe because stuff that was originally sung was spoken? Maybe because they faded out after every song like it was the end of a music video? I'm not sure exactly why.Something was just...missing. I think it was the audience and the charge in the air of a live show. Rent is different from a more traditional show like Phantom. It's not just a sit back and watch kind of thing. You are engaged. It's almost interactive. Some people in my theater clapped a little after Today For You Tomorrow For Me and Over the Moon and La Vie Boheme etc etc...and I felt compelled to as well but it was a movie theater and it felt a little odd. It also felt like there should be mooing. The closing shot on Angel...close but no cigar. I was actually looking forward to him coming out to sing with them and experiencing that moment of joy but it didn't come. I'm not saying it should be a Rocky Horror kind of thing but in the theater you are just so right there with them! Particularly during Seasons of Lovethey did a good job here for what it was but when they're up on that stage lined up across the front and making eye contact with the audiencethat's just powerful!! Having said all that I can begin my rave. I loved it and will definitely see it again and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I never saw Daphne RubinVega on stage but her voice on the OBC drives me up the wall so Rosario Dawson was a welcome addition and she NAILED Out Tonight. I always hated that song before because it sounded like nails on a blackboard to me and now it might be one of my faves. Tracy Thoms was a great Joanne and her frustration and love really come through. Tango Maureen? Good God that was fantastic! At first I thought it was kind of blasphemous that we saw Maureen before Over The Moon but it really and truly worked. The highlight was absolutely hands down I'll Cover You Reprise. Collins completely broke my heart. I cry pretty easily in movies you know the old tear down the cheek...I was actually SOBBING struggling to control myself! Far more than the stage show too. And Take Me For What I Am? The commitment ceremony thing was weird I never got the sense they were heading that direction but it was a great setting for a great song. Contact wasn't missed. Well seeing all the bodies writhing under a white sheet would have been kinda cool but for me the song was always about leading into Angel's death which was handled VERY nicely in Without You.The story is the same captivating tale of love and is just as timely today as it has always been. The words and music couldn't help but convey that message. That is what makes Rent Rent. Thank you Jonathan Larson indeed.".

On stage you don't get that feeling. Maybe because stuff that was originally sung was spoken? Maybe because they faded out after every song like it was the end of a music video? I'm not sure exactly why.Something was just...missing. I think it was the audience and the charge in the air of a live show. Rent is different from a more traditional show like Phantom. It's not just a sit back and watch kind of thing. You are engaged. It's almost interactive. Some people in my theater clapped a little after Today For You Tomorrow For Me and Over the Moon and La Vie Boheme etc etc...and I felt compelled to as well but it was a movie theater and it felt a little odd. It also felt like there should be mooing. The closing shot on Angel...close but no cigar. I was actually looking forward to him coming out to sing with them and experiencing that moment of joy but it didn't come. I'm not saying it should be a Rocky Horror kind of thing but in the theater you are just so right there with them! Particularly during Seasons of Lovethey did a good job here for what it was but when they're up on that stage lined up across the front and making eye contact with the audiencethat's just powerful!! Having said all that I can begin my rave. I loved it and will definitely see it again and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I never saw Daphne RubinVega on stage but her voice on the OBC drives me up the wall so Rosario Dawson was a welcome addition and she NAILED Out Tonight. I always hated that song before because it sounded like nails on a blackboard to me and now it might be one of my faves. Tracy Thoms was a great Joanne and her frustration and love really come through. Tango Maureen? Good God that was fantastic! At first I thought it was kind of blasphemous that we saw Maureen before Over The Moon but it really and truly worked. The highlight was absolutely hands down I'll Cover You Reprise. Collins completely broke my heart. I cry pretty easily in movies you know the old tear down the cheek...I was actually SOBBING struggling to control myself! Far more than the stage show too. And Take Me For What I Am? The commitment ceremony thing was weird I never got the sense they were heading that direction but it was a great setting for a great song. Contact wasn't missed. Well seeing all the bodies writhing under a white sheet would have been kinda cool but for me the song was always about leading into Angel's death which was handled VERY nicely in Without You.The story is the same captivating tale of love and is just as timely today as it has always been. The words and music couldn't help but convey that message. That is what makes Rent Rent. Thank you Jonathan Larson indeed.";

But that's just what it is and more this is definitely the best thing I've seen since Memento.  Although Pitt is really good and Redford plays himself as well as he has in years I think the most credit should go to Tony Scott. In the hands of a lesser director this could have been something more like Mission Impossible.  But Scott stays right on target keeping us interested developing the characters and keeping the pacing nearly perfect.  Scott also shows us that he's stayed with the times he employs the full array of modern camera tricks like fast motion reverse zooms and funky lenses but in a way that actually makes the film better instead of being an annoying distraction.  The dialogue feels natural all the actors do good work no one tries to steal the show or be the star.  The story is interesting and almost never lapses into the kind of hyper violence or sappy sentimentality one has come to associate with modern studio pictures.  You get a feeling this is pretty close to how the CIA really operates a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but who's ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances.  I really enjoyed this film I hope it's a sign of things to come and not a rarity.".

For me this is the case in witch small things were enough to like it the two main actors the places in which the action occurs and the fact that it has more to do with a love affair in a tragic atmosphere than about spies. Well of course this is about spies  two of them  and mostly about the relation between them if they are similar enough to understand each other they are also different enough to generate some tension in the relation. Maybe this is more about how the characters move around each others than about action or intrigue. In fact this is so obvious that the way in which the story is told is mostly in flashback with Muir Robert Redford introducing all of them and narrating part. So the story is the story and the spy game is what Muir does within the CIA in 24 hours or so. The distinction is important because if you think of this as a traditional spy movie maybe like the Bourne Identity or Supremacy it has two obvious flaws for the genre the plot is very simple maybe predictable and there's no bad guy no one to kill or to revenge there's also almost no genuine action and as far as I can remember Bishop Brad Pitt only fires one weapon in the whole movie. Maybe what mislead most of the people was the title of the movie and maybe that's why most of them didn't like it. However in my opinion this is a very good movie with strong leading roles and a compelling story. No gadgets no arms no villains no action...oh nothis is a whole different game and it's a serious and a dangerous game the game of people and their relations.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPY GAME  2001  out of fourTony Scott is known for his big budget fastpaced actionpacked extravaganzas. His latest film Spy Game is no exception. He takes advantage of a massive budget but loses sight of human comprehension. It's difficult to grasp his moral when it's awash in a superficial style where individual shots seldom last more than thirty seconds and where dialogue never exceeds the length of a short paragraph. There's not much time to introduce characters situations or even locationsdatelines appear on the screen to identify times and places.Yet it doesn't just feel as if we are in another movie by Tony Scotteverything feels very real. The danger is real. The characters are real. Many action films are about the action special effects and car chase sequences. Spy Game does contain those things but they are in a focused tight evocative thriller. This movie is about the characters not the action. It never forgets that. Spy Game contains a complex structure. We begin in 1991. Veteran CIA officer Nathan Muir Robert Redford prepares for retirement. On his last day he learns that his onetime protg Tom Bishop Brad Pitt has been captured in a foreign prison on a charge of espionage and will be executed in 24 hours. Fearing international crisis the CIA decides it would be too risky to save him. But with a new generation in control of the agency Nathan is no longer an insider. He must outsmart his own agency in order to save his old friend.Most of the film plays out in flashbacks as the CIA digests valuable information from Muir. The movie spans from the Vietnam war to the end of the Cold War with years ranging from 1965 to about 1991 although the characters don't seem to age much. We learn Nathan chose Tom as a sharpshooter in Vietnam. He trained with Bishop. They formed a close bond until something came between thema woman.The fortyyear span in time poses no problem for Spy Game. The engaging screenplay by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata focuses on only the necessary characters. The soundtrack by Harry GregsonWilliams masterfully captures the various time periods spicing the scenes with a slick sense of style and intrigue. The cinematography by Daniel Mindel makes the differences in location clear. Christian Wagner's editing gives the movie a frenzied almost rushed emotion that puts us right in the middle of the race against time.Pitt and Redford retain their ground despite a thick style. Redford creates a character out of nothing. We know little about him at the beginning and we know little about him at the end. But he somehow gives his character a conscience human values and a lot of interest. We care about him because we do not like the black and white CIA operatives. Thus we care about Pitt's character as well. Pitt gives his character an immature nature. He is in a stereotypical young hotshot role that might have fit him better a few years ago but he still creates a grave sense of panic and fear.With a structure like this we expect subplots to evolve from the flashbacks. There is an intriguing terrorist story. A love story. Themes about betrayal trust position friendship commitmentbut Spy Game never slows down and allows us to absorb these important details. By the end we feel exhilarated and we know we just watched a very smart wellcrafted film but the most we can take from it is that it is a very smart wellcrafted film. I think beneath all the style and surface there is a little more to the movie than that.".

Fearing international crisis the CIA decides it would be too risky to save him. But with a new generation in control of the agency Nathan is no longer an insider. He must outsmart his own agency in order to save his old friend.Most of the film plays out in flashbacks as the CIA digests valuable information from Muir. The movie spans from the Vietnam war to the end of the Cold War with years ranging from 1965 to about 1991 although the characters don't seem to age much. We learn Nathan chose Tom as a sharpshooter in Vietnam. He trained with Bishop. They formed a close bond until something came between thema woman.The fortyyear span in time poses no problem for Spy Game. The engaging screenplay by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata focuses on only the necessary characters. The soundtrack by Harry GregsonWilliams masterfully captures the various time periods spicing the scenes with a slick sense of style and intrigue. The cinematography by Daniel Mindel makes the differences in location clear. Christian Wagner's editing gives the movie a frenzied almost rushed emotion that puts us right in the middle of the race against time.Pitt and Redford retain their ground despite a thick style. Redford creates a character out of nothing. We know little about him at the beginning and we know little about him at the end. But he somehow gives his character a conscience human values and a lot of interest. We care about him because we do not like the black and white CIA operatives. Thus we care about Pitt's character as well. Pitt gives his character an immature nature. He is in a stereotypical young hotshot role that might have fit him better a few years ago but he still creates a grave sense of panic and fear.With a structure like this we expect subplots to evolve from the flashbacks. There is an intriguing terrorist story. A love story. Themes about betrayal trust position friendship commitmentbut Spy Game never slows down and allows us to absorb these important details. By the end we feel exhilarated and we know we just watched a very smart wellcrafted film but the most we can take from it is that it is a very smart wellcrafted film. I think beneath all the style and surface there is a little more to the movie than that.";

The relationship between the two men is told in a series of flashbacks that span a timeline of about 20 years starting during the Vietnam war to the cold war in Berlin and the mean streets of Beruit as Redford's character stalls for time during a debriefing into the rescue failure on his last day of work before retirement. In the meantime between breaks of debriefing he mines for information about why the CIA won't save one of their own as well as setting up a covert operation to get Pitt and his girlfriend out of prison before they are executed.Cinematography is reminiscent of brother Ridley grainy washedout imagery in tones of brown and blue and editing and camera movement is more like recent films from Woo or Ang Lee. The action is realistic without being over the top. There are no fancy gadgets or impossible stunts.Compared to stuff like XXX or worse XXX2 Mission Impossible 1  2 or any number of action thrillers about secret agents such as the most recent crop of James Bond films or Charlie's Angels this movie seems to tell it the way it is or the way you might think reality might be. The tradecraft actually makes way more sense then say a watch with a laser cutter built in or a car with missiles an ejection seat. All in all a very watchable and believable film.".

In fact most of the movie takes place inside an office as Nathan Muir Robert Redford tells a story about Tom Bishop Brad Pitt and himself when they used to do spy stuff together between Vietnam and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.Great plot interesting turns in it and both Redford and Pitt play well together. I especially like how Nathan takes Tom under his wing like a father figure while he teaches him everything that he knows about being a spy. There is quite a realistic portrayal of the violence and death that is involved with that field of work as well. It's not as glamorous and cool as most movies make it out to be.My only complaint about the movie is the fact that Bishop who supposedly serves as a sniper in Vietnam under the command of Muir looks exactly the same age forty years later during the current event timing of the movie. He doesn't age at all and it was very noticeable and annoying while I was viewing the film.Oh not sure what was edited out for the TV version other than some language but the original has language and content to make it Rrated FYI.

	schema:headline " Quite a good thriller...more of an expose on some dirty tricks of CIA operatives!";
	schema:reviewBody "It is refreshing to watch an older Robert Redford pitting his acting skills against a younger Brad Pitt in this spy thriller movie. Both of them acted very well despite the sketchy plot.To me the storyline is pretty straightforward A retiring CIA operative Nathan Muir Robert Redford learned that his protg Tom Bishop Brad Pitt had been arrested in China as a result of a botched rescue attempt of his girlfriend. He was due to be executed shortly. Because of vested interests CIA refused to mount a rescue. Out of friendship Muir engineered a successful but unauthorized rescue.The entire movie is beautifully choreographed through black  white flashbacks  pure dialog during which Muir recalled his personal encounter  close friendship with his protg. That relationship spanned across a time line of about twenty years from the Vietnam War in the 70's to the end of the cold war in Berlin during the 80's  then to the mean streets of Beirut in the 90's.The movie moves on to show how Muir had taught Bishop all the skills or dirty tricks? of spycraft...how to case a restaurant fix a radio...to be callous look at the big picture...to stay remote...to sell out people if that's of use...to kill.There is no typical highoctane action sequences in this spy thriller movie except for a heartpounding escape scene in a China prison.Throughout the movie one can see how Muir had to use his wits  all the skills or dirty tricks? he had learned while working for the CIA to outsmart the CIA's top echelon as well as his fellow CIA operatives to mount a personallyfinanced rescue mission.I really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie. I just loved the part where he juxtaposed CIA satellite images to fool his bosses. He even forged the signature of the CIA Director. At the end of it all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening  had happened.On the whole I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller. It is also comforting to know that an accomplished Singaporean actor Adrian Pang had a small role in the movie. He played a medic during the botched rescue attempt.".

That relationship spanned across a time line of about twenty years from the Vietnam War in the 70's to the end of the cold war in Berlin during the 80's  then to the mean streets of Beirut in the 90's.The movie moves on to show how Muir had taught Bishop all the skills or dirty tricks? of spycraft...how to case a restaurant fix a radio...to be callous look at the big picture...to stay remote...to sell out people if that's of use...to kill.There is no typical highoctane action sequences in this spy thriller movie except for a heartpounding escape scene in a China prison.Throughout the movie one can see how Muir had to use his wits  all the skills or dirty tricks? he had learned while working for the CIA to outsmart the CIA's top echelon as well as his fellow CIA operatives to mount a personallyfinanced rescue mission.I really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie. I just loved the part where he juxtaposed CIA satellite images to fool his bosses. He even forged the signature of the CIA Director. At the end of it all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening  had happened.On the whole I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller. It is also comforting to know that an accomplished Singaporean actor Adrian Pang had a small role in the movie. He played a medic during the botched rescue attempt.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is what an intelligent and entertaining Spy movie should look like. And I don't mean the SuperSpy genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent Pitt who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved McCormack from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and a presidential visit and trade talks ahead decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor Redford to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his proteg free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from Clear and present danger where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods here it enhances the film instead ruining it I regret watching the otherwise great movie Man under Fire. Speaking of action if you expect an action packed spy movie like the forementioned Clear and present danger you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers first Vietcong later on US Marines and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong especially Redford and Pitt which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie. His scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon his smile in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed Redford it is most memorable. I think this is one of his strongest acting. Summary If you read and like intelligent thrillers from authors like Forbes Le Carr or Nichols you might already have devoured this gem of a movie and if not go and get it.".

This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent Pitt who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved McCormack from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and a presidential visit and trade talks ahead decide to burn the rogue agent.

He does an excellent job of appearing normal and not star struck. Robert Redford is excellent in his ability to draw you into his character and wonder what he is thinking throughout the movie. Redford is even better at appearing smart and witty than he was in 3 Days of The Condor. Both actors have charm and a flare for making simple situations more complex witch adds depth to the movie.The flow of the movie is smooth and has a lot of dialog witch i love. The DoubleStorySimultianity is very smart and entertaining the story between Brad Pitt's and Redford's past and the current story line of Redford working against the government and trying to save Pitt from execution. The plot isn't spoon fed to you so it leaves you guessing as to what is going on and which way the movie will go but at the same time it gives you enough information that you don't ever get confused.The cinematography is very entertaining and not boring. The acting of the government employees was excellent and very believable. The scenes of Redford talking with the officials is very smart and captivating as you try and figure out what is going on in the heads of all involved.Over all this movie has good light action good plot smart and entertaining actors smart dialog and good cinematography. If you like spy government conspiracy light action actiondrama movies Brad Pitt and Robert Redford than check out this great film.".

Gordon takes this simple plotslightly based in The Outsider and adds depth to Combs character and his family he killed his 6 years old son in a car accident while driving drunk. This event has marked his family destroying his relationship with his wife SusanBarbara Crampton and his daughter RebeccaJessica Dollarhide who was blinded in the accident.All this conflicts explode in the castle when a prostitute brought by John appears brutally killed in a savage way and all the clues point to John who now not only must prove himself innocent but also must save his family from the mysterious being who lurks in the castle.Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton give one of their best performances. Crampton's Susan Reilly is truly believable as a mother who has lost a child and blames his former lover of everything that goes wrong in her life while Combs shines as the man overwhelmed by guilt who must face his own demons to gain the strength to save his family.Gordon's direction is remarkable as he manages to keep a Gothic atmosphere while making the film shocking by including a few extremely graphic gory scenes. Makes a nice contrast that many have attempted but very few manage to achieve.The makeup is outstanding and very realistic there was a lot of heart in the production of the horrifying scenes. A true love for the horror genre.The movie does not disappoint and flows smoothly from the beginning to the end it never gets boring and the script is really well constructed. While the movie may not be exactly Lovecraft's story it still has that spirit mixed with that visual style of Gordon that has given us jewels such as the previously mentioned ReAnimator and the awesome Dagon.While this is not as good as those 2 movies it still stands as one of the best horror movies of the 90's keeping that soul that 70's  80's horror films used to have.Very recommended for fans of the genre. 810".

What a pleasure then that this turned out much better than expected. Good use is made of the Italian locations especially the castle and Stuart Gordon uses many cool angles to keep things interesting. Reputation has him as an overthetopgore director but this doesn't do him full justice. He is also good in building atmosphere and this is Castle Freak's biggest asset. The gore is relatively minimal and instead of indulging us with gore he goes for a dark and tragic atmosphere convincingly combining a traumatized family and a mistreated misunderstood monster in the Frankensteintradition. This means that despite reuniting the GordonCombsCrampton triumvirate ReAnimatorFans should beware this one is played strictly as dramatragedy with not a single laugh in sight. The screenplay is welldeveloped with convincing characters and reasonably good dialogue. Nothing that is Academy Awardmaterial but who'd expect that from a movie called Castle Freak? Acting is also spot on especially Jeffrey Combs in a straight man role for once. While it would go to far to call this a lost genre classic it deserves to be seen by more people than probably did. If you're a genre fan give Castle Freak a chance. It might just win you over like it did with me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stuart Gordon's Castle Freak of 1995 is a creepy gory sad and quite original little horror flick and yet another proof that the man is a more than gifted director. It is certainly not Gordon's best movie his absolute masterpiece is ReAnimator with From Beyond as a close second but it nevertheless is a highly atmospheric and unusual Horror film and especially worth watching as the 1990s were a more than poor decade for Horror in which good horror films such as this one were rare. The film takes place in the homeland of great Horror namely Bella Italia where it is excellently set in an eerie old castle. John and Susan Reilly a troubled married couple have inherited the castle and come to Italy with their blind daughter in order to take a look at their inheritance. The Reillys soon have to realize that their marital disputes are not their only trouble in their creepy new home... Gordon's regular star the great Jeffrey Combs who is without doubt one of the greatest Horror actors of his generation stars as John Reilly the family father and he is great in the role. His fellow ReAnimator cast member the beautiful Barbara Crampton is very good as the wife. Jonathan Fuller is also very good. The film is creepy and highly atmospheric throughout and has many highly intense moments. Castles are always a great setting for Horror films in my opinion and this one is particularly eerie. This certainly isn't one of Stuart Gordon's best but there is no doubt that it outshines most other Horror productions from the mid 90s. As far as I am concerned Castle Freak doesn't reach the brilliance of ReAnimator but it is definitely a creepy highly atmospheric and original above average example of good 90s Horror. Recommended!".

That secret being a Castle Freak. A Castle Freak you say? Yup. After his caretaker sh!ts the bed poor ole C.F. is left alone. Luckily for him Jeffrey Coombs and his family hot mom and hot blind daughter by the way say no more inherit this mammoth castle. Eventually C.F. gets loose and unfortunately he doesn't know how to control himself. You tend to feel bad for C.F. in the movie so when he does kill spoiler maybe?....shut up! you really don't care. But I connected and cared for him most was when he had trouble with members of the opposite sex. Definitely the top scenes of this flick. The acting was surprisingly efficient. You have B movie actor extrodinaire Jeffrey Coombs play the dad in a really great role. I was expecting his trademark expressions but instead of the close ups they focused more on his tone of voice and the scene. Which really helped the film and acting. The others all played the roles very well no complaints. If you're complaining about this movie's acting you need your head checked....it's a DirecttoVideo film. It was definitely a surprise to me....and most likely it'll be a surprise to you....the horror fan.I give it around a 7 12.....like I said it wasn't great. But damn the movie was unique fun sometimes creepy and overall a welcome edition to the land of HORROR! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!".

But damn the movie was unique fun sometimes creepy and overall a welcome edition to the land of HORROR! AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!";

If he gets loose the family's heritage may become one of pure carnage.Stuart Gordon ReAnimator directs this film with a cast consisting of Jeffrey Combs ReAnimator and Barbra Crampton ReAnimator produced by Charles Band ReAnimator. Maybe you've caught on but this is something of a ReAnimator reunion... with a few people missing. And a much lower production value the film quality looks like 1970s issue or something from PBS during British comedy hour. For the most part this is pretty solid film.Combs is quite good and one wonders why he's not given leading roles more often. Crampton is also good and the blind girl Jessica Dollarhide in her only feature film was remarkable. The freak? I have to say the makeup effects and even the mannerisms were impressive. There's a scene where a prostitute meets her end... and they really went out of their way to show how horrific the freak could be.The story isn't fastpaced or actionpacked so if you need to be constantly entertained this may not be for you. But if you like a good development in your plot I think you'd appreciate this lost treasure definitely one of the lesserseen Gordon horror films. I wasn't paying as close attention as I should have been because I was half in the bag from drinking Scoresby Scotch it's the connoisseur's Scotch... but it kept me feeling pretty good.

I dont think that is fear at all. I mean do we ever ask an extreme painter why he is toying with our emotions?Who is it for? Well as I mentioned before this is a pretty violent piece of film. It is not for kids and not for adults who dont feel good about seeing killings and torture up close and personal.

Some pretty gory scenes featuring nudity with gore dismemberment and mutilation for those who are into that sort of thing.The movie had a low budget feel to it which many horrorgore fans are into but regardless the creature looked pretty realistic and disfigured. My complaint with the creature is that when you are disfigured handicapped and starved nearly to death that would weaken you. It seemed to make this a superhuman disfigured person who can jump out of second story windows and still run to catch up to it's victim. He wouldn't be so quiet either at least in his case.It took nearly an hour for the movie to fully get going with the horror after the build up but it turned into a pretty decent effort. I didn't even rent this movie it came as a special feature to Deathbed on the DVD and felt this movie was far better than the one they actually featured. I give this movie 7 of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "A well made horror flick. SPOILERS!Castle Freak isn't a straight slasher even that it's very gory. The scare factor is present and works in the right moments. The haunted mansion elements are effective and with the presence of a deformed killer the movie gets a strong 80's horror movie feeling. The atmosphere is dark as the castle is big and creepy. Too bad that only few places in the castle were used. The acting is pretty good here for being a mid 90's direct to video horror film from Full Moon Pictures. Jeffrey Combs John Reilly delivers a solid and believable performance expect when he's drunk. He carries the film on his back and delivers. Barbara Crampton Susan Reilly gives a good performance but her cute face and pretty looks makes difficult to believe that she can survive the situations. Jessica Dollarhide Rebecca Reilly is good at the blind daughter character not to mention that she's hot. Girgio the horrible freak is just o.k. About the Giorgio character it depends on your point of view to label him as villain victim misunderstood being or retarded person.Giorgio lost contact with the real world for 40 years he didn't perfection his 5 senses and his body grew deformed. He obviously was a victim of his crazed mother. It wasn't his fault to act like a wild nonsense animal when he escaped. In fact his intention wasn't to kill he just copied human behaviors and acted in selfdefense when attacked. For example when he enters Rebeca's room he looked for a blanked to cover from the cold I didn't see any intentions to have sex with her. I can't talk about his sexual needs as it's shown that his mother castrated him. His sexual instinct  was repressed and it seemed to cause him emotional disorders as he couldn't satisfy it. But that's not the main point of the movie. He's portrayed as the killer and that's what it matters.The makeup is also pretty good Giorgio looks gross and scary at some times and the gore scenes look pretty gruesome. The prostitute's death is the highlight of the movie as it's extremely graphic and gruesome. It has somewhat generated an opinion in almost every horror fan that watches this film. I found it disturbing but pleasant for the gore genre. The scene is one of the most memorable gory deaths from any movie in the 90's. The score didn't work a movie with this atmsophere and plot needed a more chilling score. Stuart Gordon's direction isn't something you've never seen it's just decent. I like the 80's horror feeling in this movie combined with the dramatic tones. At the ending even that John failed as a husband and father he managed to save his family from death. The chasing scene at the ending is thrilling unlike the final confrontation with the freak who deserved a better death. Still the ending pleases the viewer as the main hero and the villain die at the same time. Susan forgives him for J.J.'s death his alcoholism and his unfaithful after he dies. Nice dramatic touch in a horror film. I'd recommend this film to any horror fan it delivers expectations. But watch the director's un cut version that's the one that worths the watch. A good crafted horror flick.7.510".

This abuse derives from what her American soldier husband did to her leaving the duchess for her sister. This adulterous couple bore John who is carrying some personal demons that torment him so. John who was an alcoholic was responsible for a car wreck which killed his son and left his daughter with damaged blinded eyes. His wife SusanBarbara Cramptonhates him but has traveledwith their daughter Rebecca portrayed by Jessica Dollarhidewith him to the castle. I'm guessing that Susan has remained married to John for the sake of their daughter who would be crushed by a divorce. But what John doesn't understand is that the brutalized man is still down in the prison tomb and now resembles a monster. He is able to free a hand from a shackle when he breaks off his thumbOuch!and remove the door that has closed him in for decades. Able to roam free the monsterJonathan Fuller under a latex suit and heavy makeuptakes a liking to Rebecca but remains hidden in the 150room castle often watching the others from behind furniture sheets etc. The monster has a massive gash on his mouth and chin which may've resulted to a severe gash from the whip his mother often bludgeoned him with. John really wants to make his marriage work again but Susan's suffering is too overwhelming for any form of forgiveness..he was driving drunk and because of that their son is dead and daughter blind. When John finds his marriage at the peak of disaster with Susan pretty much stating she wished he had dies in that wreck instead of coming away without a scratch he heads for the bar and finds a prostitute only eager to take his cash. Drunk and sneaking the prostitute in the castle unbeknown est to his wife and daughter John realizes after a little graphic foreplay that he is making a mistake and stops. The prostitute however doesn't make it out of the castle..the castle freak wants to have a little foreplay. When his advancements are turned away in horror at his grotesqueness the freak will eat..her! John was the last to see her alive and will face possible murder charges which only grow worse when the freak kills the cookmaidElisabeth Kazaas well.Really well made horror item during Stuart Gordon's tenure with Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures. Good creepy setting for the freak to run rampant. One might feel some sympathy for this freak because the only reason he is acting so monstrous is because of decades of torture and abuse. The idea of having that created freak opposite a tormented Jeffrey Combs..playing the most normal character I can think of to datedealing with guilt over the trauma he has caused his family gives this a lot of serious clout. One thing missing from this creature feature often seen in most of Stuart Gordon's work is the humorous bits. This is a very serious picture and there's just not much room for laughter. These characters are dying inside..one's a freak on the insideCombs the other is on the outsideFuller. The photography music performances are all firstrate..everyone did a commendable job. Despite Gordon's various ways of clothing the freak in darkness at times he just looks like a man in latex. Still Gordon does frame him in some gruesome freakish ways such as blood dripping off his snarling teeth when his face rushes at the screen. But most of the time Gordon tries keeping as much of the monster hidden as possibleat one point during the film the freak robes himself with a sheet he stole off of a chair.".

Drunk and sneaking the prostitute in the castle unbeknown est to his wife and daughter John realizes after a little graphic foreplay that he is making a mistake and stops. The prostitute however doesn't make it out of the castle..the castle freak wants to have a little foreplay. When his advancements are turned away in horror at his grotesqueness the freak will eat..her! John was the last to see her alive and will face possible murder charges which only grow worse when the freak kills the cookmaidElisabeth Kazaas well.Really well made horror item during Stuart Gordon's tenure with Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures. Good creepy setting for the freak to run rampant. One might feel some sympathy for this freak because the only reason he is acting so monstrous is because of decades of torture and abuse. The idea of having that created freak opposite a tormented Jeffrey Combs..playing the most normal character I can think of to datedealing with guilt over the trauma he has caused his family gives this a lot of serious clout. One thing missing from this creature feature often seen in most of Stuart Gordon's work is the humorous bits. This is a very serious picture and there's just not much room for laughter. These characters are dying inside..one's a freak on the insideCombs the other is on the outsideFuller. The photography music performances are all firstrate..everyone did a commendable job. Despite Gordon's various ways of clothing the freak in darkness at times he just looks like a man in latex. Still Gordon does frame him in some gruesome freakish ways such as blood dripping off his snarling teeth when his face rushes at the screen. But most of the time Gordon tries keeping as much of the monster hidden as possibleat one point during the film the freak robes himself with a sheet he stole off of a chair.";

As I read in a fan site of his ... some act bad in good movies...he acts good in bad ones!. There is gore don't expect anything too much 2 or 3 scenes there is nudity and there's Jeffrey Combs who manages to raise interest in his sad role.

	schema:reviewBody "'Castle Freak' has a lot to live up to as Stuart Gordon's first two H.P. Lovecraft adaptations 'ReAnimator' and 'From Beyond' which also starred Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton are modern horror classics. Even more loosely based on a Lovecraft story 'The Outsider' though you'd be hard to spot it! and with Gordon's usual black humour and outrageousness it doesn't live up to the earlier movies. Perhaps it was the absence of any involvement by producer Brian Yuzna I don't know but it's a very disappointing movie and quite forgettable. The only thing I really liked about it was Jeffrey Combs performance. He always seems to take the material he's given to work with very seriously and he was pretty impressive as an alcoholic family man trying to get over a tragedy which is unfortunately tearing apart his marriage. Barbara Crampton plays his wife and it's a more subdued unsexy role for her with no skin so her fans might be a little let down. Combs inherits an Italian castle after the death of a relation Helen Stirling and comes over with his wife and daughter Jessica Dollarhide to settle the estate. While staying in the castle mysterious events begin to occur culminating in the murder of a prostitute Elizabeth Kaza who also appeared in the 1970s cult classic 'The Beast' which the local police soon suspect him of. Combs frantically tries to clear his name noone believing he is innocent the murder being the responsibility of  you guessed it from the title  the castle freak. The movie has one or two moments but overall it's pretty mediocre and I would only recommend it to big time Combs fans. He's very good but 'Castle Freak' isn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've got to say I'm surprised. After all that I'd heard about this film I really wasn't expecting it to be very good but Stuart Gordon has once again proved his worth as a horror director with this excellent tale of terror! Castle Freak sees a great director doing what he does best. Gordon's love for HP Lovecraft is well documented and Castle Freak sees him in distinctly different territory from where he was with previous successes From Beyond and ReAnimator. Castle Freak is a slower film than those two mentioned but it's all the better for it. The story is the strongest element of the movie and at all times is at least as interesting as the central horror theme. We follow a family who move to a castle in Spain after it is inherited by the father. However they are marred by tragedy ever since a car accident cost them their young son and the daughter her sight. The tragedy continues when they move into their new home only to discover that they aren't the only inhabitants within the sinister castle's walls.Like all the best Stuart Gordon films this one is lead by the great cult star Jeffrey Combs. Like the director the lead star has found himself with a role that is nothing like the one that made him famous. However Combs doesn't falter and his performance here sees him really prove himself as an actor. The script puts a lot of weight on the characters and it is this that ensures Castle Freak is a cut above the majority of nineties horror films. Combs gets into his character excellently and as the script allows his motives to be adequately explained the cult star is given more than enough opportunity to ensure that he stands out. Combs is joined by From Beyond and ReAnimator costar Barbara Crampton as well as Jessica Dollarhide in her only film role and Jonathan Fuller who had a role in Gordon's The Pit and the Pendulum. The rest of the cast is largely made up of European stars which help to cement the film's Spanish location. The castle at the centre of the tale with its many rooms provides an excellent environment for horror of this kind and Gordon makes best use of this to draw in a claustrophobic and horrific atmosphere. Overall this film is highly underrated Castle Freak manages to take in elements of horror tragedy love and loss all tightly wound around a distinctly Lovecraftian horror story. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not only is this one of the final films of Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures of the 1990s but it is the last of the moderately budgeted horror genre's collaborations with the Stuart Gordon Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton trio. This is considered by many to be a complete failure on many levels but good delivery of bad material and some very gory moments give fans a run for their money.Combs and Crampton are grieving parents after a car accident leaves their son killed and their daughter blinded. She can't seem to forgive the distraught dad for being intoxicated behind the wheel when it happened which leaves the plot open for Comb's inevitable redemption. Sooner if not later the family inherits a castle in Rome and unfortunately they also inherit the hideously deformed and tortured man chained up in the basement. After eating a cat the freak gains enough strength to break his chains and go on a rampage after anyone found in the castle. Its pretty tasteless stuff as the completely naked creature bites a prostitute to death tears out the throats of policemen and other sorts of gory mayhem meanwhile the blind daughter and Combs are the only people convinced that there is someone else in the castle.This is a dingy looking movie that fails to provide mood or ambiance short of trying pretty hard. Combs and Crampton are now pros at what they do considering the material that they're given. The creature is more amusing than scary but gore fans will be pleased with the overall gruesomeness. Too bad Full Moon Pictures didn't end their stay with a better bad movie but left audiences in the rain with just plain bad instead.".

However there is a dark secret lurking in the castle a secret that has been hidden for decades but now it's free it has nine fingers  wears a bedsheet. Oh  it's also a deformed cannibalistic killer...Cowritten  directed by Stuart Gordon I thought Castle Freak was a decent enough horror film but didn't quite reach the heights of greatness. The script by Gordon  Dennis Paoli was based on the story 'The Outsider' by H.P. Lovecraft  is a reasonable way to pass 90 odd minutes but I just felt there was nothing here that really stood out  grabbed my attention you know what I mean? There's the family who inherit a property with a dark secret  that's about it only we know what the dark secret is within five minutes because the freak monster is seen even before the opening credits have started. Also why didn't the freak bite his own thumb off years ago to escape? How did it open the huge locked cell door exactly? Who put  subsequently removed the picture of John's dead son in the family crypt? The body counts consists of exactly four it's hardly the most exciting film ever made  it just feels a bit too routine predictable  ultimately rather forgettable as there just seemed to be too many shots of people walkingrunning around the same corridors. It's still a good horror film make no mistake about it  has some positives going for it but I think I'd have completely forgotten about it by the end of the week.Director Gordon knows how to turn in a decent flick  Castle Freak is a nice enough looking film it has a a great setting  the real castle location adds to the atmosphere immensely. There are some creepy moments but don't let anyone fool you into thinking this reaches the gory heights of Gordon's ReAnimator 1985 or From Beyond 1987 as there's not much gore here the one  only real gore scene involves the freak biting the nipple off a prostitute  then there's some shots of her dead body with further bite marks  a bit when someone has some skin bitten off their face the special makeup effects are good on the freak  there's a fair amount of blood splatter but overall this isn't that gory.Technically the film is good certainly better  classier than the majority of Full Moon productions that's for sure. Actually being shot in a real castle owned by the head of Full Moon in Italy helps give the film a great look. The acting is pretty good it's always nice to see Combs in a genre film  he is reunited with Crampton as they both appeared together in a couple of other Gordon horror films ReAnimator  From Beyond.Castle Freak is a watchable well made  perfectly decent horror film but while I definitely liked it I didn't love it Gordon has done better but this is still worth a watch.".

The story is intense though the color and editing is a bland mix of shock effects and creepy dullness. The 'freak' itself is rather unrealistic but remains frightening due to the graphic nature of its life and plight for freedom. Dollarhide makes a good debut and Richard Band's music is highly appropriate. Be warned! There is a rather unpleasantly raw sex scene and much 'freak' nudity!?! Incidentally this entire film is an easter egg on some DVD copies of director Stuart Gordon's equally surreal Death Bed. The original idea is from Charles Band and he alongside father Albert Band executive produced the film.".

Sure they already made a lot of brilliant horror  with Mario Bava Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci  in the earlier decades but back then the American horror also was a lot better. Stuart Gordon always one of the most talented horror movie makers jumped right on this trend and shot this film on a beautiful location in Italy. Stuart Gordon already made some alltime favorite horror films in the 80's. The brilliant ReAnimator and the amazingly intelligent From Beyond still stand as few of the best horrors in that decade. When it comes to purely comes to the level of entertainment Castle Freak is a not that good but Gordon manages to add some great dramatic scenes to this film. There even is a little room for sentiment. Not too much but just the right amount for a horror film. But diehard Reanimator fans don't have to fear because there still is plenty of gore and blood as well. The make up effects are perfect as ever in Gordon's film and it's nowhere near cheesy. Gordon really is the best horror director alive and he had the chance again to work with his and mine favorite cast members. Jeffrey Combs is brilliant as ever in his leading role and he sure proves here that he can handle the more serious roles. He's my favorite Bmovie actor and I'm still hoping that he'll get famous all over the world one day ! Barbara Crampton's role is a lot less expressive than the one she had in From Beyond but she still is adorable. The dramatic atmosphere fits her very well. Castle Freak is very underrated and it's often left out when talking about good recent horror. Certainly recommended to the fans of this terrific genre. What shall follow below is a small summary of the story. It contains SPOILERS and I advise you to stop reading if you want to be completely surprised by the movie yourself...SMALL SPOILERS HERE !!!! It's about an American family that is already torn apart when they hear the news they've inherited an old big castle. The wife can't stand her husband anymore since he was responsible for the death of their son. Still both of them move to Italy together along with their blind daughter. The castle isn't completely forsaken though ! The son of the Duchess who lived there first is kept hidden in the darkest dungeon of the castle. He has been there since 40 years while everybody thought he was dead. He escapes and filled with lust and frustrations he starts to terrorize the castle and anybody who dares to enter it. END SPOILERS !!!".

The makeup effects by Optic Nerve are impressive and Richard Bands' music is excellent.Castle Freak definitely deserves a wider audience.

	schema:reviewBody "Castle Freak is a genuinely good movie. Loosely inspired by The Outsider probably my favorite H.P. Lovecraft story the film is also probably my favorite Stuart Gordon film and bar none the classiest thing Charles Band ever pushed out of his studio. Somewhat ironically since the original Full Moon Entertainment was slowly decomposing at the time. Castle Freak despite its exploitive title actually has its roots in deep themes of family forgiveness childhood responsibility cruelty and love. A family inherits a castle in Italy. Deep in the bowels of the castle is a man kept imprisoned for forty years starved castrated and routinely tortured by his mother. But the castle isn't the only thing with a secret. The Reily family is slowly coming apart after alcoholic father John wrecked the family car killing their youngest son and blinding their teenage daughter. Mother Susan has never been able to forgive him and it's made clear quickly John has never quite forgiven himself. The two story lines slowly come together the emaciated twisted Giorgio a shadow mirror reflecting back the family's darkest impulses.The film is far more serious affair then the previous GordonCombsCramptonLovecraft collaboration. ReAnimator and From Beyond are certainly great in their own ways but Castle Freak is a much richer deeper film. It's also far scarier. Gordon had previously displayed a strong handle of atmosphere on Dolls. Here he graduates to full shadows expert. The final act where Giorgio stalks mother and daughter throughout the castle each hiding in deep shadows is intense and sustained. The blind daughter is an inventive device as it allows the villain to creep around her undetected several times. The castle is an excellent location of course which helps. It's definitely the most frightening film on the director's resume.It also delivers on the grossouts. Gordon had perhaps unfairly received a reputation for a goremeister following ReAnimator. There's also more to his films then that but honestly Castle Freak delivers some nauseating gore effects. A cat being pulled back through a trap door is an early unnerving moment. Bones crack and flesh rips as a thumb is gnawed off. The most notorious moment involves the titular freak's encounter with a prostitute. In what is probably a homage to extreme Italian filmmakers like Lucio Fulci deranged Giorgio attempts to recreate an earlier rendezvous. It's a disturbing memorable moment that skillfully combines twisted gore and protracted thrills. The makeup design for Giorgio is impressively unnerving as well. He looks truly starved and tortured. Odds are this movie will show you far more eunuch bits then you desired to see.The performances truly anchor the film. Jeffrey Combs frequently trots out his Herbert West personality without acting much while Barbara Crampton is usually confined to indistinct scream queen roles. Combs shows no ego as the alcoholic John. He sweats and cries frantic a man at the end of his rope. He is pulled between his frustrated libido his persisting guilt over his son's death and his own guilt over refusing to take responsibility for it. It's a careerbest performance for Combs. Similarly Crampton blows the roofs off. She marks a strong figure against Jeffrey her grief translating as anger not selfpity. Her own path to forgiveness is also wrought. As the blind Rebecca Jessica Dollarhide conveys the blindness well if not the character's panic. It is disappointing that she would disappear from acting after this. Jonathan Fuller no doubt had the most difficult performance under extensive makeup and without his voice. He makes Giorgio far more then just a hideous villain but a sympathetic being. Castle Freak is a world where monsters aren't born they're made.For once the fisticuff endings doesn't feel awkward a natural evolution of the characters and themes. The final scene powered by Richard Band's typically excellent mournful score conveys a poetic sense of sadness and resolution. Castle Freak is fantastic all around a true hidden gem. If you're a Combs or Gordon fan you've probably already seen it but I think it's essential viewing for any horror fan.".

Moral to this story choose the better looking liar who is less of a gentleman and can lay you first your job title means more than actually who you are or how much time you have and your mistakes happen but everything will be okay if not better because of them.1 rating is my opinion but barring I had no issues with how they dealt with relationships and reasoning I may have had rated it a 5".

It would probably come up with a new genre called the 'romantic action comedy'. It would probably come up with 'This Means War'. I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who it was targeted for. First no adult with a few functioning neurons will find the plot compelling. I doubt if women would find the romance unforgettable. I therefore concluded that the movie was targeted towards 15 year old boys out on their first dates. Yes there are the obligatory action scenes with the required number of explosions and car chases but this is mainly to wake up the 13yearolds who fell asleep during the 'romantic' scenes. The comedy and I am stretching the dictionary definition of that word here comes mainly from the sexual remarks of Chelsea Handler and are directed at the same sleepy 13yearolds.It's too bad. I like Reese Witherspoon and prior to this movie I had concluded that she was never in a bad movie. Isn't she being offered any better roles than this? It is one of the few movies where you feel sorry for the guy who gets the girl. Actually by that point in the movie you really don't care. Yet the sad truth the very sad truth is that the movie will probably be a box office hit a fact that will generate more movies in this genre and keep computer programmers employed for years to come.".

It doesn't look a cheap film and the cast and premise could  have made for something memorable but how could the end result be so  unsatisfying.

He is too good of an Actor for this movie and his talent is wasted. Chris comes off as this creepy older smooth operator and that just doesn't go away a normal woman would have picked that up in a heartbeat. I didn't pause or fast forward which is a plus but I really wouldn't recommend the movie if you are truly wanting a feelgood RomCom. I agree that Reese wasn't her best or if she is she's NOT my kind of actor. Again I have to go with it being just too silly. It would have made a better movie if one of the guys had had to choose and not the other way around. She wasn't believable and quite frankly Tom was too good for this movie.".

Lauren Witherspoon is presented as a 30 something frumpy self conscious idiot who's introduction is spent lying about her life to an ex she runs into and sighing over her loneliness. After her friend hooks her up with an online dating profile she sees Tuck's Hardy picture and decides she is going to give it a shot. She meets Tuck they immediately engage in back and forth watered down humour and then suddenly due to poor editing the date ends without any sign of how long it was. She then goes to rent a DVD.. who does that in 2012? where she meets FDR Pine who tries to obnoxiously hit on her. In the span of a few hours she is hit on by both Hardy and Pine and develops wit and confidence and actually shoots one of them down. This is coming from a chick who hasn't been able to talk to men in years. All it took was for her to experience a wardrobe change and miraculously we never see awkward frumpy Lauren again. Instead enters the sexy irresistible Lauren we always knew was under that frump! The rest of the movie we see Pine and Hardy competing for her affection and the ultimate answer which man does she fall in love with?!There is an unlikely friendship between Pine and Hardy federal agents who consider each other family yet have no problem sabotaging one another for a girl. Neither of them have parents yet we are constantly reminded that this is more of an embarrassing problem for sensitive Hardy than Pine. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. There are a lot of plot holes and hints at what emotional direction the film wants you to take but without resolution. When they first meet Hardy's character relies more on his honesty and genuine kindness to win over Lauren yet Pine basically tricks her into liking him after her rejection. The film clearly steers us in the direction of favouring Tuck yet Lauren chooses FDR in the end. WHY does Lauren pick the man who deceived his way into her heart over the guy she was naturally falling for? WTF.Never mind this being an action movie these men don't have time for action! They are too busy falling in love! Too busy calculating their next chess move against each other by spending their time spying on her. Any woman with an ounce of self respect would be completely mortified after finding out her home was invaded and tapped with surveillance. Yet this wasn't even questioned. Like people have mentioned the moral of the story is the American asshole wins the girl while the British gentlemen gets his own left overs his ex wife.Through out the entire film I felt embarrassed for Hardy. So much talent charisma sexiness... all gone to waste in this ridiculous film although he actually pulled off what he could with a terribly written script and terrible costars. This type of movie I would expect from Witherspoon and Pine but Hardy... at the peak of his career? Why did he do this? Out of pity? I just don't understand. I am left with confusion and frustration. I will let this one pass Tom but if you ever do this to me again... I just don't know if I could excuse it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is interesting to note the review that I read on this film about the writer not understanding why the critics hated this movie when he and the audience he was with loved it. Well while I am not a paid critic or film reviewer I will have to say that I pretty much hated this movie. I thought the whole concept of two CIA agents abusing their privileges to stalk a girl that they both liked was ridiculous and the fact that they actually get away with it borders on the really concerning.I really don't know about the United States but here in Australia stalking is illegal and can land you up with a gaol term. Also using resources to check up on somebody for your own personal interests is not only illegal but unethical. The question that I then ask is whether people's right to privacy have been taken away to the point that if a CIA agent wants to track some woman because of some desire to have sex with her then he can? If that is the case then I guess all of the rightwing conspiracy theorists are actually correct because it seems that nothing is sacred.Of course there is also the girl whom the director plays as a stereotypical dumb blonde. That personally is insulting and to be honest quite sexist as well. Personally a woman who drags two guys along because she cannot make up her mind as to who she really wants to date is not really a woman that I am interested in. Further the fact that two friends are at each others throats over a single girl is just pathetic though I must admit that it does happen. However since she actually chose one of them thus leaving the in my opinion better man out in the cold just wasn't a satisfying ending even though the better man got back together with his estranged wife.Okay you might argue that it is just a movie but seriously when has that argument actually held any water? Time and time again I hear people referring to Hollywood movies as lessons in life right up until somebody like me points out the holes and the flaws in these movies as well as the incredible moral ambiguity that surrounds them at which point they simply say 'it is only a movie'. Seriously people make up your minds. Are you going to use Hollywood movies as moral guideposts because if you are please don't hide behind the pathetic excuse of 'its only a movie' because if you are stop using them as moral guideposts.".

Anyway I can't defend McG with This Means War his most recent film because it ended up being truly horrible.The most important problem from This Means War is its screenplay which I found incredibly weak and predictable if you don't guess during the first minutes which one of the two gallants will stay with the girl you haven't seen any romantic comedy in your whole life. The humor lacks of any spontaneity the jokes are terribly predictable and the performances are pathetic specially Reese Witherspoon's which feels so false and studied that I hated her character even more than the two gallants.The action scenes lack of any suspense or emotion. There are various fights chases and explosions but everything is so uninspired that I wouldn't be surprised if editors Nicolas De Toth and Jesse Driebusch made a confusion with the reels and included in this film scenes from Mr. and Mrs. Smith Knight and Day Killers or any other deplorable action romantic comedy.It's easy to note that nobody that worked in This Means War put any effort to it and that makes it a horrible film which I suggest you to avoid by any means.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay critics what the hell? I saw this movie at 730 at Movieland A Bow Tie Cinema in Richmond VA. Great theater props! Anyways. The theater was packed. It was the biggest screen too but it was the only showing. If the audience reaction was anything to go on this movie was hilarious. I certainly thought so. But not only thatit was a good movie! Summary aside this movie actually turned out to be one of my favorite romantic comedies and buddy comedies all in one. It was very fastpaced. It had the element of government agents but also government agents that abuse their job's resources. There are 'bad guys' but it doesn't dominate the movie. The scenes with the bad guys start off with the preconception that they would be long and intense but were actually only 60 seconds long and just a short break between the comedy and action. The funny partsyes they were funny. I was cracking up the entire time and I don't do that often. Visually it looked amazing watching on BluRay will be spectacular. I for one will buy this on BluRay. My roommate will thank me.Yes young people like myself will enjoy this movie but it's also targeted for late twentieslate thirties people thinking about love and marriage. I saw a lot of older couples at the theaters and they were enjoying it just as muchthey were laughing loudest in fact! I'd give this movie a 910. Pure enjoyment.So my issue WTF Critics? You give this movie zero credit. Is it because of the actors? They're all great actors. Plot? Actually pretty goodsomewhat predictable in hindsight but I'd still watch the movie again. Director? Supernatural and Nikita both have a fanbase and aren't that bad with action or drama. If they actually watched the movies they wouldn't have rated it that low I think they were going off plot summary. Back off critics! When more people see this movie the ratings will go up! Rotten tomatoes said audience enjoyed it 71 so far but opening day isn't even over yet. Critics give it 33? Come on. From tvcinema.tumblr.com my blog ".

I... kinda liked the movie... it was kinda bad but I kinda liked it. Lets get a few things out the way. Editing was horrible the entire opening looked like a trailer and the later scenes I was screaming CUT! at the movie. Acting is solid through out the movie although the movie really just centres around FDR and Laurens relationship because Tuck and her don't have any chemistry really. There are about... four fights they use shaky cam and you cant tell what was happening for some reason when FDR and Tuck fight its really short and Tuck takes most of the hits. There are a few good scenes in the movie but I didn't laugh that much apart from Tucks date scene that I found amusing as he guns down teenagers and manhandles others in a paint ball game.Really the best parts were in the trailers and thats really it if you want Chris Pine watch Star Trek if you want Tom Hardy watch Bronson or Warrior Reese Witherspoon... I haven't seen any good movies with her in...This Means War could have been a good movie but its to much of a RomCom that has horrible editing and choppy fight scenes. The action scenes are few and far between and generally meh except the Paintball scene that is in all the trailers.".

	schema:headline " As ridiculous as it gets this McG liveaction cartoon with unfunny lines and terrible action wastes the great bromantic chemistry of its lead stars";
	schema:reviewBody "McG must have watched one too many cartoons when he was a kid how else will you explain his obsessive love for them? After venturing into more mature territory with the inspirational sports drama 'We Are Marshall' and the scifi thriller 'Terminator Salvation' the director is back making liveaction cartoons in the vein of his 'Charlie's Angels' duo logy and 'This Means War' sees him at his most indulgent. Indeed there is nothing that can be taken seriously about this loud preposterous and utterly logicless action comedy that requires that its audience to check every brain cell at the door just so they can watch two handsome hunky CIA agents go at each other to win the affections of the same girl.That is the only catch of this lazily plotted movie from Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg the former an actor turned writer who sadly demonstrates little of the subversive cleverness from his earlier 'Role Models' nor the broad but nonetheless inspired hilarity of 'Just Go With It' and the latter an experienced hand at the genre responsible for the studio's earlier hit 'Mr and Mrs Smith' enlisted to polish the banter and distract the audience from the glaring plotholes. Neither writer tries hard enough and without a solid wellgrounded script to rein in McG's fluffy excesses the result is a 'Smith' wannabe without the entertainment.To be sure a film like this is always going to be as good as its individual gags and so to trick you into the theatre the trailer showcases the best the film has to offer. Remember the one where Agent Tuck Tom Hardy shoots a dart right into Agent FDR's Chris Pine neck so he falls fast asleep just before he is about to bed the girl Lauren Reese Witherspoon? Or the one where Lauren accidentally shoots a paintball at Tuck's crotch while attempting to discharge its triggering mechanism? Trust us these individual sequences in the movie don't go beyond what the trailer already shows so you're not really missing anything more.The banality of the rest of the movie is only made more apparent by the onenote characterisation. Tuck and FDR are both goodnatured sensitive guys equally eligible while Lauren is the pretty attractive girl with no luck at love. Then just to add in a shade of raunch because 'Bridesmaids' showed there was a place for girls to be talking dirty Lauren has a perpetually horny best friend Trish Chelsea Handler whose only purpose is to goad Lauren to have sex with Tuck and FDR. At no point do you care if Tuck or FDR get the girl simply because either guy is just as shallowly drawn.Ditto for the tired banter between Tuck and FDR scripted without the wit nor the punch of Kinberg's 'Smith' or 'Sherlock Holmes' in fact the most memorable line is delivered by a fellow agent who tries politely to tell Tuck the night after FDR beds Lauren that the latter had 'entered the premises'. Fortunately there is genuine bromantic chemistry between the two actors Pine and Hardy both of whom do their best with the trite material that doesn't do justice to their heretoforeunknown sharp comedic timing.Against their natural bromance Reese Witherspoon ends up regrettably nondescript giving as little as the script demands of her. That the romance between Lauren and Tuck or FDR doesn't ring true is not entirely the actress' fault however for some inexplicable reason the script has them falling in love over a private trapeze session at an amusement park and a private showcase of Gustav Klimt masterpieces at some warehouse. Granted that a suspension of belief is de rigueur for most movies but the leap of logic this McG liveaction cartoon demands is just too absurd.And don't get us started about the poorly conceived action sequences that are so badly choreographed it's no wonder they are over before you know it. We're not just talking about overthetop but absolutely head scratching nonsense that turns the pair of CIA agents into superheroes who pretty much emerge unscathed except for some cuts from every supposed lifeendangering situation. Even with the paucity of such sequences we count only three in total McG can't even get the climax right and a highspeed chase that ends on a deadend freeway ramp is so laughably shot it goes in the running for the worst action sequence of the year. Whether as action or as comedy this mishmash of a buddy picture spy thriller and romcom fails in every regard. We can accept a movie that doesn't take itself seriously but one that disregards every ounce of logic ultimately causes its audience to pay little attention to it as well. Like we said it's really another one of McG's liveaction cartoons how else really can two spies use the full resources of the CIA to spy on a personal subject without anyone raising any alarm and it is as juvenile as its titular claim that two guys fighting over one girl could really mean war.".

I really haven't seen a truly good and funny American comedy in years.They moved to TV.I'm trying to find specific things to say what was so wrong but there was too much of it. Firstly I don't buy the bromance between FDR and Tuck. You just don't see the closeness they talk so much about. No.2 Chelsey Handler is soooo annoying I actually hoped she'd die when Tuck blew her tires. The whole movie has just too much talking and talking and talking without saying anything a good movie for politicians LOL. For me personally a good movie is quite the opposite  saying with very little talking guess that is why Woody Allen annoys me so much.Actually the only decent performance came from Til Schweiger and I hoped he'd be the last one standing.And one more thing since I'm from Serbia and can't help mentioning since Sokolov and Tuck talk in Serbian Sokolov is not a Serbian name it's Russian. Russian language is not the same as Serbian language. Serbian people who speak English fluently speak it with almost no accent and if thay do it certainly doesn't sound Russian.

	schema:reviewBody "I ignored this film when it first came out in 1981. There were just too many cool films to see that year. Friends who saw it told me it was a laughable hoot. Despite it's august cast and attempt to cash in on the mythic quest themes of Star Wars it rapidly sunk from sight. In 1995 looking for a film appropriate for my 7 year old daughter I pulled this film out of the 'family' section of my local library. The critics are right. The FX are clunky even by 1981 standards.Harry Hamlin is wooden. Judy Bowker is forgettable and Laurence Olivier hams it up shamelessly...and yet...IT ALL WORKS! The sets and lighting perfectly capture our deepest feellings of mythic Greece. There isn't a drop of contemporary forays into irony  cynicism. It is unalloyed GOOD vs EVIL lovingly given to us by the effects wizard Harryhausen. His monsters have a childlike beauty that makes them 'scary' without trying to gross you out. It's the myth the quest and finally the theme that love does conquer all. No need for smartalecky eyewinking protaganists. Just a good old fashioned story told straight and true. My now 14yr. old daughter wife and I just saw it again last night. See it with the child in your life or the child in you.Thank you Mr. Harryhausen for this and all your wonderful films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been a favorite of mine since i was a kidi was very into Greek mythology during grade school so i loved this film even though i've seen it about two dozen times it continues to be a Sundayafternoon staple on TV. There are a number of mythological inaccuracies in this film the Kraken wasn't a mythological monster Perseus didn't have Pegasus but actually borrowed Hermes' winged sandals etc. but it's still a good kids' introduction to ancient mythology. While the actors playing the mortals are definitely inferior to those playing the Gods i suppose it works in the sense of their being the Olympians' puppets and well a little limpness in the thespian department is somewhat de rigeur as is the wisecomic sidekick of Burgess Meredith and the 'little and cute' factor of the mechanical owl for the kind of classic matinee swashbuckler that Clash of the Titans is.But all these complaints that the Harryhausen effects are crap and it would be so much better done with CGI... well that's pure craziness. Sure the monsters don't look convincing but they look a hell of a lot more convincing then they would as cheap computer animationcan you honestly imagine the Medusa sequence being done any better with some cartoon computer program? Why? So it could look like the crap in Phantom Menace? I've always felt that Harryhausen's stopmotion technique and the resultant odd way in which the monsters moved added to the sense of their mythic status their unreality the sense that these are creatures from another world another plane. The recent Asian fantasyaction film Onmyoji paid tribute to the master by having a CGI demon army move in Harryhausen stopmotion style and damn me if they didn't look scarier more unearthly for it. In my opinion CGI looks even less real more like a paintedon cartoon. There's a depth and detail to creatures that have actually been created in the threedimensional real world that those who have only existed on a computer screen don't have. Also no matter how good an actor is there's a difference between someone who's in the same room with the monster he's fighting or who at least knows what it looks like and someone who's just trying to act scared in the general direction where something will be inserted later. Imagine the Alien movies made with a hypedup animated creature you know that even motionless and plastic squeezed between light stands that giant H.R. Geiger monster gave everyone on set the creeps. Maybe people like CGI because they feel safer with obviously fake monsters things that never even existed as a threefoot high model next to the ham sandwich in someone's shop.".

Does this mean that every movie made before computer graphics should be rejected out of hand. Should we start by throwing out The Wizard of Oz because the flying monkeys used piano wires? It ultimately gets down to whether there is a story worth telling and how well that story is told. Clash of the Titans is not a masterpiece. It does however tell a pretty good story. The characters are interesting and the thread of mythology is interesting enough to carry it to its conclusion. The special effects are the stop action kind that were the only thing available at this time. Believe me they were a lot of fun when the movie first came out.This tells the story of Perseus who is not as well known in mythology as say Hercules Theseus or Jason but his story is a fun one. The quest for the evil Medusa the need to figure out a way to defeat her without being turned to stone the evil Calibos a complete creation and of course the beautiful Andromenda Judi Bowker who is absolutely stunning is the prize. It is paced nicely and the scenery is pretty breathtaking. The music is also very nice. I enjoyed the creatures. I liked the boatman and the river of death. I liked Pegasus I liked the sound effects. But I don't mind suspending my disbelief.The downsides are numerous but I think they have more to do with what the director chose to do. The gods and goddesses are stiff and uninteresting including Laurence anything for a buck Olivier. Some pretty important actors to throw away at these Olympian debriefings. They could have lost the owl. He is a mini version of R2D2 with his silly metallic bleeps and erratic actions. I'm sure they did this for the kids but it really diminished the integrity of the story. Still if you allow yourself you can have a lot of fun with this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Mount Olympus Zeus Laurence Olivier destroyed the city Argus with the Titan Kraken to punish King Acrisius Donald Houston that sentenced his daughter Danae Vida Taylor and her son with Zeus Perseus to death in the sea. Zeus orders Poseidon to save them and Perseus grows up in a paradisiacal island with his mother. Years later Zeus punishes Calibos Neil McCarthy the evil son of the goddess Thetis Maggie Smith and fianc of Princess Andromeda Judi Bowker turning him into a monster doomed to live in the swamps. The vindictive Thetis curses Andromeda with a spell and every suitor should solve a riddle otherwise he would be sentenced to the bonfire. Further she brings Perseus Harry Hamlin while sleeping halfnaked to the City of Jopa but Zeus gives magical helmet shield and sword to his son for selfprotection. When Perseus sees Andromeda he falls in love with her and uses the magic outfits and Pegasus to discover the answer of the riddle with Calibos. But Thetis dooms Andromeda to be sacrificed to the Kraken otherwise the City of Jopa and the inhabitants will be destroyed by the Titan. Perseus now has to defeat Medusa and the Kraken to save his beloved princess.The saga of Perseus the mortal son of Zeus and the intrigue among the Gods of Olympus is brilliant presented in this magnificent film. The delightful story is supported by an outstanding international cast with names such as Laurence Olivier Burgess Meredith Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress and by fantastic special effects considering this is a 1981 movie. The golden mechanical owl Buba is hilarious and responsible for some of the best moments in this film. This epic is a wonderful and highly recommended entertainment for the whole family. I do not recall how many times I have had the pleasure of watching this film. Yesterday I saw on DVD for the first time and there is a pleasant interview with the producer in the extras. For me this movie is a classic in the genre. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Fria de Tits Fury of Titans.Note On 01 August 2010 I saw this movie again.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the Mount Olympus Zeus Laurence Olivier destroyed the city Argus with the Titan Kraken to punish King Acrisius Donald Houston that sentenced his daughter Danae Vida Taylor and her son with Zeus Perseus to death in the sea. Zeus orders Poseidon to save them and Perseus grows up in a paradisiacal island with his mother. Years later Zeus punishes Calibos Neil McCarthy the evil son of the goddess Thetis Maggie Smith and fianc of Princess Andromeda Judi Bowker turning him into a monster doomed to live in the swamps. The vindictive Thetis curses Andromeda with a spell and every suitor should solve a riddle otherwise he would be sentenced to the bonfire. Further she brings Perseus Harry Hamlin while sleeping halfnaked to the City of Jopa but Zeus gives magical helmet shield and sword to his son for selfprotection. When Perseus sees Andromeda he falls in love with her and uses the magic outfits and Pegasus to discover the answer of the riddle with Calibos. But Thetis dooms Andromeda to be sacrificed to the Kraken otherwise the City of Jopa and the inhabitants will be destroyed by the Titan. Perseus now has to defeat Medusa and the Kraken to save his beloved princess.The saga of Perseus the mortal son of Zeus and the intrigue among the Gods of Olympus is brilliant presented in this magnificent film. The delightful story is supported by an outstanding international cast with names such as Laurence Olivier Burgess Meredith Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress and by fantastic special effects considering this is a 1981 movie. The golden mechanical owl Buba is hilarious and responsible for some of the best moments in this film. This epic is a wonderful and highly recommended entertainment for the whole family.

It is a grand story told on a grand scale with the best tools which were available in 1981.  Note the differing ways in which Caliban and Perseus handle misfortunehow many ordinary mortals become so sorry for themselves that they much worsen their own condition?  To be sure it is an invented tale but it is a myth not a pack of lies.It is hard not to like Ray Harryhausen's superior special effects.  The technology is better today but Harryhausen was and is unsurpassed at getting his mythologicals to act and interact with the cast.Oddly enough Laurence Rosenthal's scorewhich recently became available on CDisn't given the attention which it deserves.  The music which he composed is spirited unique and utterly supports whatever is happening on the screenfrom the seemingly careless destruction of an entire city to Perseus' love at first sight when he sees the sleeping Princess Andromeda.If you have the gift of mythological consciousness this is a 10 film for sure.

	schema:reviewBody "It's nice to know that with all the different Herculeses running around that no one forgot Perseus the great grandfather of Hercules as a matter of fact. While the creators took obvious liberties with the story the special effects are stunning some of Ray Harryhausen's best. Medusa is right dead on although the concept of her as a naga snakegoddess hit me out of left field. The visualization of Olympus and the gods on it was a boring and stagnant without any major grandeur. They're attired in white togas with no creative costuming what so ever and no glimpses of the other myriad gods of Olympus. Ursula Andress would not have been my choice for Aphrodite but Susan Fleetwood resembles Isabella Rosselini of The Odyssey enough to pull off Athena but kudos have to go to whoever got Sir Laurence Oliver to play Zeus. Even next to Roy Dotrice John RhysDavies or perhaps Sean Connery he is the only man who could give the role the command it deserves. More liberties were taken with Thetis as the wife of Poseidonthough her presence forced into the story is only merely there to inflict the fateful curse. Harry Hamlin may not be an action star but he does well in the role. Beautiful Judi Bowker makes for an entrancing Andromeda despite the trial she went through chained to a cliff at high tide. Burgess Meredith is whimsical and wise as the playwright who Perseus befriends and Neil McCarthy emotes as best as he can as the new character Calibos inserted into the legend. The few things I can find fault with at all is the obvious overuse of previous footage whenever Perseus flies over Joppa. The tiny robotic owl Bubo is as charming as a big stupid purple dinosaur on PBS but the images of Pegasus are as spectacular as you would expect. The images flying through the air again are foiled by the obvious overuse of stock footages and the telling scenes with stopmotion. Despite these few faults this is a very enchanting fantasy and a very underappreciated movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clash of The Titans is one of my favorite films from specialeffects wizard Ray Harryhausen and it is also one of his last films in the 1980s. This film is also one of the last films to star Laurence Olivier I have three of his Shakespeare films. And lastly I do study World Mythology as a hobby not just Greek but other countries too. There are five things I have found in the storyline that differs from the original myths 1. In the original story Acrisius wasn't jealous of Danae. An oracle warned Acrisius that Danae's son would someday kill him so Acrisius shut Danae in a bronze room away from all male company. However Zeus conceived a passion for Danae and came to her through the roof in the form of a shower of gold that poured down into her lap as a result she had a son Perseus. When Acrisius discovered Perseus he locked both mother and son in a chest and set it adrift on the sea. The chest came ashore at Seriphus. After his great adventure of slaying Medusa Perseus and Danae returned to Argos in search of his grandfather but Acrisius had gone to Larissa. When Perseus arrived there funeral games were being held and Perseus being a great athlete joined in. However during the discus throwing an accident occurred. By chance the discus Perseus had thrown hit Acrisius and killed him the prophecy had come true.2. In Mythology Thetis wasn't a sea goddess but one of the Nereids sea nymphs and also mother to the hero Achilles not Calibos he is an original whom she tried unsuccessfully to make immortal. She dipped the child in the river Styx holding him by the heel. All the parts that the river touched became invulnerable but the heel remained dry. Achilles was later killed in the Trojan war.3. In Mythology Pegasus the winged horsewas fathered by Poseidon with Medusa. When her head was cut of by the Greek hero Perseus the horse sprang forth from her pregnant body. His galloping created the well Hippocrene on the Helicon a mountain in Boeotia.4.The Kraken was not the name of a titan in Greek mythology but a sea monster from Scandinavian mythology. And...5. In Mythology Medusa was not a priestess but she was a beautiful maiden. She desecrated Athena's temple not Aphrodite's by lying there with Poseidon. Outraged Athena turned Medusa's hair into living snakes. I love the film's Princess Andromeda. This might seem strange to you guys but I put her on a list I have made of my favorite movie princesses animated or live action. Overall this film is an awesome fantasy to enjoy with all the adventure humor and romance.".

He was one guy who really didn't have to prove anything as an artist. And I'm sure it amused him no end to be cast as Zeus king of all the Deities.Seeing Olivier trading lines with such folks as Maggie Smith and Ursula Andress and Claire Bloom in the realms of Olympus reminds me a lot of the Irwin Allen film The Story of Mankind. It was a bad flop but the scenes in which Cedric Hardwicke Vincent Price and Ronald Colman argued about man being good or evil are classic. With such intervention and such traps as the Olympus crowd puts on earth. young Perseus son of Zeus and a mortal like Hercules fulfills his destiny and of course saves the princess Andromeda. Harry Hamlin and Judi Bowker made an attractive pair of young lovers. Certainly Harry Hamlin has gone on to a substantial career.Burgess Meredith has a very nice role as companionmentor to Hamlin almost the same as the Mentor role in and to Captain Marvel. You've got to love that mechanical owl who speaks in bleeps that only Hamlin can understand. Clash of the Titans also was the farewell performance of Flora Robson who played one of the Stygian witches.And like the dragons and cyclops and huge flying birds that Ray Harryhausen created in my youth his version of a Kraken is a worthy addition to his gallery of monsters. Might even be better than the Kraken of Pirates of the Caribbean and without computer graphics to do it.Clash of the Titans is aimed for the juvenile trade. But if it sparks an interest in the classics than the film will be worth the admission.".

It's true it must compare with the newer version but if one enjoys the special effects and the excellent cast it seems a worthy offering. In this movie we have the legendary hero Perseus Harry Hamil who is born the son of mighty Zeus Laurence Olivier cast ashore on a distant land where he must seek out his true destiny. There he is helped by Ammon Burgess Meredith and Thallo Tim PigottSmith to win the hand of the beautiful Andromeda Judi Bowker. With a bevy of British actresses like Claire Bloom Maggie Smith Ursula Andress and Sin Phillips the movie carries the Olympic story well. Ray Harryhausen produced this film and added the stopaction sequences he is so famous for and as a result has created a Classic for all time. School students of many ages and grades are sure to remember this fabulous myth for generations to come. ".

He created monsters at a time when there was not the kind of money or technology that we have today. Rick Baker monster maker who does the Eddie Murphy movies and Michael Jackson videos is good and so is John Carpenter but Harryhausen was and will always be the best in the business.Hey we know that this is now a real story but just the fantasy aspects of it is wonderful. I remember seeing this with some of my friends we were all adults and we enjoyed it immensely. We got to see Harry Hamlin without a shirt on before he got famous on L.A. Law. We got to see Ursula Anderss the fabulous 1st Bond girl British actors Maggie Smith was in her prime and Laurence Olivier finally living out his fantasy of actually being a God. We got to see Burgess Meredith after the Penguin but before Rocky. The acting was kind of flat but it is a fantasy and based on Greek mythology so anything is possible.This movie taught me not to be vain like Caseopia don't try to get revenge like Calibos to be strong and wise in order to find my destiny like Perseus help others find their destinies and when others fall down help pick them up like Zeus did Perseus. Make sure that we you know what you are do to and do it well not letting your circumstances dictate your outcome.That is why I like this movie so much life lessons are there you just have to look for them. Also being judgmental never helped anybody and judging this movie too harshly is a big mistake there is no cursing no explicit sex and is timed just right for a big box of popcorn and soda. Get this on DVD and show it to your kids or grandkids let them see how movies were made without 400000000 budgets still came out good and have life lessons.".

This is raw Ray Harryhausen gold at his finest and I'm glad to finally have bought this on DVD. Anybody who critiques this movie is thinking too hard. Simply sit back and enjoy the ride would you? The only weak aspect of this movie I could point out would be the B movie acting but that's to be expected and really shouldn't deter what most and I myself consider a classic. Everything else in this film is superb. The story flows fluently and never drags and the characters no matter how badly acted they maybe to you are interesting and plot driven. If you look at it with the right perspective you could find this a very ideological piece concerning the frailty of a man compared to a deity and how a man can truly over come the crushing binds of overtyrannical religion. But hey that's me you might view it as just another Harryhausen flick.Regardless the movie delivers on that aspect as well. The stop motion is life like the pinnacle of its day and more than enough to stand against the over blown CGIfest of today. There are so many visual feats in this movie its hard to pick one that was truly my favorite. The amount of detail on each one is extraordinary. Overall I'd say the Kraken is undoubtedly my favorite of them all but my favorite scene all together is the battle with Sedusa. Just from the eerie start of the sequence with the boat ride across the foggy river to the dark and gloomy innards of her temple all leading to a very intense fight. Not only does the cinematography always capture the tension and bold atmosphere of the film throughout. And the score by Laurence Rosenthal was just astonishing and sharpened every moment of the film beautifully. Whether it be the terror of Sedusa or the majestic emergence of the Kraken or rather the silence of the score as Perseus and his men battle the deadly scorpions.Clash of the Titans is a classic by all means even in the wake of its remake I believe the original is far superior.".

Don't make this as preference in your big test in this subject but to enjoy the film us the story goes on and finish. The graphics and animation although that it was very old but still good. Also do not abuse this movie because of some nude shots in there but totally not for me but for you unless you watched it. I also thanks for the stuff and cast for making a good movie. Just seat and understand what the story about and ready your popcorn and drinks because this will make you stand while watching The Clash of the Titans. Thanks and enjoy the film.".

And then those cats attributed with typical Dutch characters. Lovely! The audience here was of the same opinion as I heard a lot of them laughing out loud. This movie is especially great for children AND adults with a ticklish inner child!! Praise for the acting of Carice van Houten.

	schema:headline " Terrific Dutch film for all ages";
	schema:reviewBody "I love this Dutch film in any way possible. It has charm it is funny and sweet and most of all it is heartwarming. It starts with a simple premise. A cat changes into a young woman because she eats from some chemical stuff in a barrel. She Minoes Carice van Houten is allowed to stay with Tibbe Theo Maassen. He is a reporter who is about to get fired but since Minoes can help him with some news which she hears from other cats she saves his job. They make a deal. She can stay but she must provide Tibbe with some news.Mr. Ellemeet Pierre Bokma is the hero of the town. He seems to be a very good man but Minoes and the other cats slowly discover that he is not that good after all. Now the shy Tibbe wants to help the cats and expose Mr. Ellemeet but he has no prove besides the stories of cats. Minoes the other cats and a girl named Bibi Sarah Bannier who lives next door come up with a plan to help Tibbe.The simple story is based on a novel written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was and is probably the most read author for children books in The Netherlands. Although it is quite simple it has so many nice touches you almost forget the simplicity. The nice little touches deal with Minoes who has a struggle with herself. She is a cat but slowly becomes a human being. The hunger for fish and birds and the need to climb trees when dogs are near are those little nice things.Carice van Houten plays her part extremely well. It may seem pretty easy what she does but that is only because of her. Theo Maassen finds the right note for his character as well and Pierre Bokma is a good villain. The performances are good and it looks very good as well exactly the way a movie like this should look. The movie is perfect for children and I think that adults will have at least the same amount of fun. There is simply nothing wrong with this movie considering it is for the whole family. If you want to see a great family film try this Dutch little treasure.Note A nice fact is that Jan Roelfs is the coproducer. He was Oscarnominated as the production designer for 'Orlando' and 'Gattaca' and is the production designer for the upcoming 'Alexander' from Oliver Stone.".

Amidst the noise of the other novel adaptations Harry Potter Lord of the Rings Discovery of Heaven comes a simple loveable heartwarming story of a cat that turned into a young lady.Based on the famous children's book by Annie M.G. Schmidt the movie tells of a young lady Minoes who takes shelter at Tibbe's house. Tibbe is a shy reporter on the verge of getting fired because he is too afraid to go up to people to get any news. But Minoes turns out to be a big help. She still speaks with cats and in this way she hears about all the things happening in town. She tells tibbe the news and in return he lets her stay at his room. Things get complicated as Minoes and Tibbe find out about an evil plan of one of the town's most forestanding men. But with help of the cats and Tibbe's neighbourgirl Bibi they are too good a team to be beaten.The story is one thing but there is more to enjoy. The overall feeling of a smalltown community comes through well. The characters are clearly drawnout the situations are simple and the worldevents are fare away. People care about the fishcar that got crashed and a pot of golden coins found in the cemetary.In that environment we get to know Minoes played by Carice van Houten. She puts the problems and enjoyments of being a young lady with catqualities convincingly to the screen. She climbs roofs is fond of fish and is terrified of even the smallest dog. Throughout the movie she more and more finds a balance between being human and cat at the same time. And that is the most important theme of the movie being happy with your self and standing up for that. Tibbe the reporter has to overcome his shyness to stand up to the evil plans of mr. Ellemeet and convince the townspeople of those evil plans. But fortunately he has Minoes Bibi and bunch of cats to back him up. Tibbe played by comedian Theo Maassen is fun to watch and really makes you feel for his problems.And there is more like the talking cats that all have different personalities all the other actors that do great jobs the typically dutch look and feel of the movie etc. But above all Minoes shows us the heartwarming qualities and timelessness of a wellmade oldfashioned simple story. Treat yourself and take your kids or somebody elses.".

	schema:reviewBody "KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Brianna Hope Beaton age 12 reviews the film below Video review httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vxqC3Wk6bKcThis is a very cute entertaining and enjoyable film with lots and lots of cats. I like this film because it has a little humor and creativity. I love how Miss Minoes Carice van Houten turns from a cat into a human and still has all her cat like instincts. To me this is a very challenging role to be able to switch back and forth like that throughout the film. I really start to enjoy this film when Miss Minoes become friends with the humans and see how she is communicating and reacting to them. This is really cool. I like how most of the background music is upbeat and goes beautifully with the specific scenes. Miss Minoes is a Siamese cat that is curious and gets herself changed into a young woman by drinking some dangerous chemicals. She dresses and talks like a young woman but also eat and climb trees like a cat. She finds and helps a shy journalist Tibbe Theo Maassen prove to his town that they have a villain for a factory boss that is not to be trusted. She gets all the latest and greatest information from all her little cat friends and passes it to Tibbe. Vincent Bal directs Miss Minoes which is an adaptation of the 1970 novel by Annie M.G. Schmidt and was released in the Netherlands in 2001. This film is dubbed in English is easy for follow and enjoyable. Another main character is Bibi Sarah Bannier who is Tibbe's closest friend but also is a kid. A couple of great messages in this film are to respect each other's differences and to not judge a book by its cover because Miss Minoes outside appearance is a woman but underneath she is truly a cat. Miss Minoes is great for ages 8 to 12 and mostly girls who love cats will definitely enjoy this film. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars because although it's a great cat film I just think it has a little too many cats for a dog lover like me. Miss Minoes is overall a good film and I'm sure you will like it as well. So don't forget to get your copy on DVD or Blue ray and always listen to your felines.".

This is apparently based on a very popular children's book I haven't read. A cat turns into a woman after coming across some chemical stuff spilled from a barrel. She finds herself transformed into a woman on the rooftops of her small town. Eventually she takes refuge in the apartment of a struggling but honest reporter and through her ability to communicate with her fellow cats she helps him expose a case of local corruption a scoop that saves him from being fired from his newspaper. This movie wouldn't work as well as it does without the charming Carice Van Houten performance as the titular womancat. Theo Massen's performance as the shy reporter is also great.".

She finds herself transformed into a woman on the rooftops of her small town. Eventually she takes refuge in the apartment of a struggling but honest reporter and through her ability to communicate with her fellow cats she helps him expose a case of local corruption a scoop that saves him from being fired from his newspaper. This movie wouldn't work as well as it does without the charming Carice Van Houten performance as the titular womancat. Theo Massen's performance as the shy reporter is also great.";

In Minoes she is a very sweet and fun girl and together with Theo Maassen she really put together a lovely movie. Though not more than 1 hour of entertainment this movie is something you could watch over and over and over again. Why? It's lighthearted very funny and brings out the genius that was Annie M.G. Schmidt who wrote the story years ago. The power of this movies is also the voices of the cats. Famous Dutch people like Wim T. Schippers a.k.a. Ernie Bert and Ernie and Hans Teeuwen a renowed Dutch comedian make funny jokes all the time and besides it's really fun to hear someone be a cat. If you enjoyed this movie I highly recommend Ja Zuster Nee Zuster which has a similar class and quality. Go ahead and watch them and have a great time!".

It's their performances that are responsible for most of this movie's charm.A word about the cats used in the movie. I train dogs and would never want to even try to train cats for a living. The people that were responsible for the cats in this movie probably deserve an Oscar or some award because it had to have been literally herding cats at times.No one is going to confuse Miss Minoes with a Bergman film and it's unlikely to be studied in any USC film classes.

They will have fun and be entertained by it.It isn't really a movie were an awful lot is wrong with it's just a movie that is too simple in every way to be considered a great and memorable movie. I also have to say that I wasn't exactly fond of the musical score by Peter Vermeersch. It's this typical simple musical score were I can't quite put my finger on or describe it to you. To put it short and simple just like this movie it was just terrible to listen to.The cast consists out of many well known Dutch actors and a famous voice cast for the cats. Pierre Bokma is on of the best Dutch actors at the moment and he plays a great and enjoyable villain role in this movie. This was Carice van Houten's big breakthrough movie and she is currently filming Zwartboek with Paul Verhoeven in which she plays the main role. The voice cast has some recognizable voices in it especially Wim T. Schippers who is the Dutch voice for Kermit the Frog and Ernie for the Dutch Sesame Street and who believe it or not actually used the live in the same street as I did here in Groningen. And no with the same street I don't mean that I lived in Sesame Street...I haven't read the book this movie is based on written by Annie M.G. Schmidt so unfortunately I can't comment on whether or not this movie is loyal enough to the book its story and atmosphere.It isn't a great or remarkable movie but children will simply be entertained by it and that's the most important thing of course.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

An ageing beautiful authoritative successful and famous actress caught in her own personal quagmire and that of a strange historical era.It's 1942 and Paris screams under the German occupation. A quiet scream at least as portrayed by Truffaut where Parisiens go on living their everyday lives as close to normal as they can. The German element is of course ubiquitous always lurking in the shadow of normality like an undiagnosed disease. The black market the Jewish persecution the curfew the collaboration and the resistance all are accepted as just another fact of life.The real threat though is the unknown. What will the war bring? How longer will it last? And yet decency and normality go on being the bourgeois lifestyle of choice simply because most don't know how to really survive without the city without its theaters and fashion circles. Without this superficial normality.In the middle of this strangeness stands a woman disillusioned by her life. Deep inside this poignantly beautiful famous smart and strong woman is empty. Torn between her professional and artistic duties that have increased dramatically since her Jew husband and theater chef fled to save his life and her ageing femininity and her devoid of passion life she revolves around the sole remaining centrepiece of her life acting. Only acting proves to be just another lifeless remain of her previous life.Should she stay faithful to a husband that she stopped loving a long time ago? Do they both cling on to their failing relationship just for the sake of normality to survive this strangeness of an era? Will tomorrow ever come and if it comes will she be too old to enjoy it? Deneuve is perfection. The script has most probably been written with her in mind and it shows. Nowhere in the film is she caught relaxing even in the most ambiguous moments her eyes are crisp clear on her intentions.Depardieu is solid but lacks the internal flame his character should possess probably due to him being influenced by Deneuve's coldness.Poiret and Bennent are sublime in secondary but very important roles. Richard underplays his character's potential as a threat. The rest of the cast are adequate and in control of their roles.Truffaut delivers a quiet film with claustrophobic cinematography lowbudget sets fabulous costumes and minimal music. Just like a real theatre show. The director's brilliance drives through the sharpness of the second World War with a fine comb and picks only what's relevant to the story and nothing more. A film to admire but not to be inspired from. And there lies probably the only fault of the film. The nouvelle vague has matured and settled down with a sigh.Watch this film just to experience the ferociously magnetic beauty and strength of Catherine Deneuve. Or if you really love theatre.

Her Jewish husband Lucas Steiner Heinz Bennent the writer director and owner of the theater has officially moved to South America escaping from the Germans. Indeed he is hidden in the basement of the building. Bernard Granger Grard Depardieu is a promising actor hired to act with Marion in a new play. The survival of the theater depends on the success of this play. Marion falls in love with Bernard but hides her feelings due to her respect for her husband. Although having a very simple story this movie is marvelous. The story is a great homage to theatrics where not only the persons wants to survive but also desire to save what they love the theater. I recalled the movie Il Viaggio di Capitan Fracassa' where theatrics is also honored. It is a love story in times of war. It is a human story where citizens are presented trying to have a normal life even having to share their sovereignty and culture with the invaders. It is not corny in any moment. The direction is from one of my favorites directors Franois Truffault who was born in 1932 therefore he was a ten years old boy when this story begins. Certainly he has had a great experience of life in an occupied country and how life goes on. The beauty and the performance of Catherine Deneuve are astonishing. Grard Depardieu is in an excellent shape and has also a wonderful performance. Although having 133 min. running time the film is not long since the story hooks the attention of the viewer. My vote is nine.Title Brazil O ltimo Metr' The Last Subway Train'".

	schema:reviewBody "One often sees the criticism of Francois Truffauts Le Dernier Metro  The Last Metro that he had turned to making films in the tradition of the films that he had scorned as a young critic in the 1950s. Of course most of these writers are not familiar with the films that he had scorned. I would say yes he was working in a tradition. He could almosthave titles the film Si Paris occupe nous tait cont. Sacha Guitrywas one of his heroes. But he did call the film Le Dernier Metro and that title points to the tradition of the film and explains its style.It is true that the early scene where Bernard tries to pick up Arlette bears some resemblance to the scene at the beginning of Les Enfants des Paradis in which Frederick attempts to pick up Garance. It must be remembered though that the young critics of the 50s had no ax to grind with the PrevertCarne films of the late 30s and the first half of the 40s. Anyone who watches the clip of Godard from 1963 on the Bande a Part will hear him praise the Carne of Quai des Brumes before deprecating the Carne of Les Tricheurs. Even their criticism of Carne that merely photograph his screenwriters scenario that he was more a metteur en image than a metteur en scene had started in the mid40s by Henri Jeanson Carne's onetime collaborator. But getting back to my point that scene occurring in the midst of the crowd on the Boulevard des Crime in the Carne film explains its title and theme.Carne's film is about theatergoers even his four theatricalprotagonists all attend plays. Truffaut's film though is not so muchabout the audience as it is about the theater world and hence its title Le Dernier Metro. Before I get back to my point I believe I should note here that Le Dernier Metro was meant to be one panel in a trilogy on the entertainment world. La Nuit Americaine Day for Night was of course the film panel. And L'Agence Magique a film about Music Hall was never made. In the late 70s Truffaut had a screenplay for this film ready to shoot and had begun preproduction but the failure of The Green Room caused him to alter his plans and to film L'Amour en Fuite. The voiceover prologue describes an occupied Paris where night workers have to scurry to make the last metro in order to beat the curfew. What is left to our imaginations is to realize that many of these workers are theater people. Jean Marais whose reallife thrashing of the Je Suis Partout drama critic Alain Laubreaux provided the inspiration for one of the key scenes in the film described the last metro thusly in his autobiography Histoires de ma Vie page 159The last metro was marvelous. As packed as the others. It carried all of the theater world of Paris. Everyone knew everyone else. We spoke of the latest concert of the ballet of the theater. Outside it was the blackout the militias German patrols hostages if one was out past curfew. NOTE ToutParis usually means  Paris high society but Marais in the book frequently uses in a narrower sense of the theater world. In other words Les Films de Carosse had produced a film that represented the last metro as the golden coach of occupied Paris. Some quarter of a century earlier before Truffaut made Le Dernier Metro he with Jacques Rivette had interviewed Jean Renoir and Renoir told them that in order to do his film on the world of theater The Golden Coach he had found it necessary to subordinate his style to a theatrical style. Could it be that there is one explanation of the style of the film? So now Truffaut was returning to the style of The Golden Coach. Some other ideas gleaned from Nestor Almendros' A Man With A Camera. Remember the scene from the beginning of the film that I spoke about earlier the one were Bernard accosts Arlette. I can still remember the feeling of claustrophobia that I felt the first time I saw Le Dernier Metro. And of course I was going to soon discover that one of the main characters in the film was hiding in a small room in the basement of his theater. Almendros speaks of using the camera to create a feeling of claustrophobia in this film. He also reveals that it was normal for Truffaut to keep his windows open. But in this film because of its theme and its time period windows remained shut. Also he and Truffaut wanted the look of early Agfacolor of films like Munchhaussen and Die Goldene Stadt. A look that was gentler and softer than the vivid Technicolor films of the same period. Thus the set designer were asked for ochercolored sets and the props and costumes were chosen in subdued colors. Also they changed their film stock to Fuji because it was closer to this look they were cultivating. As long as we are discussing Almendros I think it might be appropriate to end with a quote from his chapter on the film The Green Room. As expected The Green Room was not very well received. The theme of death rarely attracts crowds. This is almost an axiom in the cinema and by producing so difficult and personal a work risking almost certain economic failure Truffaut showed once again that after sixteen films he was still the uncompromising artist he was as a young man.

As packed as the others. It carried all of the theater world of Paris. Everyone knew everyone else. We spoke of the latest concert of the ballet of the theater. Outside it was the blackout the militias German patrols hostages if one was out past curfew. NOTE ToutParis usually means  Paris high society but Marais in the book frequently uses in a narrower sense of the theater world. In other words Les Films de Carosse had produced a film that represented the last metro as the golden coach of occupied Paris. Some quarter of a century earlier before Truffaut made Le Dernier Metro he with Jacques Rivette had interviewed Jean Renoir and Renoir told them that in order to do his film on the world of theater The Golden Coach he had found it necessary to subordinate his style to a theatrical style. Could it be that there is one explanation of the style of the film? So now Truffaut was returning to the style of The Golden Coach. Some other ideas gleaned from Nestor Almendros' A Man With A Camera. Remember the scene from the beginning of the film that I spoke about earlier the one were Bernard accosts Arlette. I can still remember the feeling of claustrophobia that I felt the first time I saw Le Dernier Metro. And of course I was going to soon discover that one of the main characters in the film was hiding in a small room in the basement of his theater. Almendros speaks of using the camera to create a feeling of claustrophobia in this film. He also reveals that it was normal for Truffaut to keep his windows open. But in this film because of its theme and its time period windows remained shut. Also he and Truffaut wanted the look of early Agfacolor of films like Munchhaussen and Die Goldene Stadt. A look that was gentler and softer than the vivid Technicolor films of the same period. Thus the set designer were asked for ochercolored sets and the props and costumes were chosen in subdued colors. Also they changed their film stock to Fuji because it was closer to this look they were cultivating. As long as we are discussing Almendros I think it might be appropriate to end with a quote from his chapter on the film The Green Room. As expected The Green Room was not very well received. The theme of death rarely attracts crowds. This is almost an axiom in the cinema and by producing so difficult and personal a work risking almost certain economic failure Truffaut showed once again that after sixteen films he was still the uncompromising artist he was as a young man.

It also talks of a restrained love affair which is dwarfed due to two lovers' arrogance. German occupation of Paris is shown in a light tone as there are no scenes of atrocities perpetrated by German soldiers. In this film we get an idea of how artists cinema and theater behave in a given set up.It also depicts cold critics who are able of destroy not only somebody's career but also an entire theater production house.Among the actors Andra Ferrol is at her sensual best.Jean Poiret looks sleek too. The best thing about this film is German actor Heinz Bennent's performance as Lucas Steinera theater director who is fed up of his isolation.His character is similar to that of Marniea role played by Tippi Hedren in Alfred Hitchcock's film Marnie.".

Thats what everybody else besides his wife believes however since he's still hiding in the basement of the theater. She brings him food and keeps him company while she can but her main attention is on a new play that the theater is producing and is a decisive one since the survival of the theater depends on it. She plays the lead actress in this play and opposite her is an actor played by Gerard Depardieu. Listening in on the rehearsals Lucas through Marion gives tips and is a kind of a second director of the play.Though I wouldn't call myself an expert on the subject I think this film does an excellent job of portraying the wartime atmosphere of German occupied lands in WWII. A character I found most intriguing was a theater critic by the name of Daxiat JeanLouis Richard. Publicly he denounces Jews and says that each and every one of them must be hunted down. Deep down inside of him a side which he reveals to Marion he still has a lot of respect Lucas. People are living under constant fear of the Nazis especially Marion due to her hiding her husband in her basement.Overall a pretty good film.

I agree with most that this is a finely crafted work beautifully photographed extremely evocative of the era and never dull. Catherine Deneuve is breathtaking Depardieu has boyish charm and Heinz Bennent is a revelation.All of that is not sufficient to make a great movie even though many of the images are memorable. The problem is that the film does not deliver what it promises. Having built up slowly in tenseness having exposed the deadly problem of collaboration with the Nazis having stimulated the viewer's concern over the fate of the Steiner couple the director then chooses to turn the whole thing on its head and give us a surprise ending of sorts that for me anyway was highly unsatisfactory. This surprise is actually triple since each of the three protagonists does something unexpected and out of character or at least at variance with the way we have been led to perceive the character.Lucas cannot accept capitulating to the enemy nor can he envisage the loss of his theater but he seems to accept with masochistic resignation if not downright generosity the adultery committed by his wife. Marion is depicted as a woman sincerely concerned with her husband's well being and assiduously protective of him. Even if she feels an illicit attraction there is no reason for yielding as she does to temptation. This cheapens her character beyond redemption. Couples separated during the war frequently sought consolation but Marion and Lucas are together.Bernard is apparently bipolar. He collaborates though we don't know why then does an aboutface and joins the Resistance! We don't know why he does that either. Is the grass greener on the side of patriotism? To reward his inconstant wife and her unreliable leading man Lucas displays magnanimity beyond the call of duty by writing a play about the affair. In the final scene triumphant Marion gets BOTH men and a hit play to boot. People of Jewish faith may regard this as a slight since the Jewish director becomes the servant of his own wife and her once proNazi boyfriend. I'm sure the director did not mean it this way but frankly I don't know what he meant except that adultery has no dire consequences in any case a hit play is the best revenge.Are we supposed to understand this to be a comment on art imitating life or on theater as catharsis or on human beings coping with unbearable adversity? It would be fair to say that it is all that. Most of all it's about the show going on at all costs. The characters in this film are all subservient to the Greater Good namely Theater.But the film lacks a moral core because the director cannot bring himself to moralize. So he resorts to showing people not as flawed but as detached from scruples and lacking in any selfjudgment that would result in guilt feelings. This contrasts strikingly with the films of Eric Rohmer in which the characters all experience an inner struggle and a constant need to analyze their own actions.One could say that the absence of an inner struggle is the salient feature of the film resulting in a final product that is visually stunning but so detached emotionally that its message such as it is is inconsequential.".

	schema:headline " A CrowdPleaser about Art's Power to Carry on Even Through the Most Despairing Times";
	schema:reviewBody "As a sketch of an era this affectionate story of the plain and symbolic parable of the stage is a tenderly staged and skillfully shot bit and it substantiates Truffaut's passion for art and its power to endure even throughout the most turbulent of times. The story is set in 1942 and orbits mainly around the people working within the Thtre Montmatre a renowned Parisian theater that like all theaters during the Occupation is in perpetual peril of being shut down by the collaborationist Vichy government. The theater is run by its star Catherine Deneuve the wife of the theater's Jewish director Heinz Bennent who has fled the country or so he's thought to have. The theater has recently gotten an shot of fresh life in the form of Grard Depardieu a committed rising actor who made his bones at the Grand Guignol and has been hired to play the lead role in a Scandinavian play called Disappearance that Bennent chose right before his own vanishing act. Unbeknownst to the rest of the ensemble Depardieu plots numerous feats of sabotage when he's not in rehearsal.The screenplay by Truffaut and Suzanne Schiffman builds drama along various interconnected threads. First is the future of the theater. Its unceasing threat owes to pervasive censorship which is personified by the utterly vile antiSemitic theater critic JeanLouis Richard whose harsh reviews bear much more than just critical import. For Truffaut who began as a film critic with a repute for being hardnosed and sometimes brutal Richard's is a genuinely dismal individual as he has warped the critic's duty of promoting art into a poisonous mishmash of biased persecution and explicit prejudice. This links to a succeeding strand of conflict in the film which is the problem of whether Bennent will be exposed. Deneuve is the only person who's aware of his location and when she visits him it is both an effort to maintain their marriage and an occasion for him to give her notes on the direction of the play. Consequently the director prolongs his creative undertakings clandestinely using his wife as his puppet.There is also romantic friction in the film as Deneuve and Depardieu cultivate an implicit attraction that rather than drawing them together deters them like divergent ends of a magnet. Both actors were foremost stars of the French cinema and Truffaut uses their luminous screen presence to distinguished effect protracting their attraction to one another like a piano wire that ultimately breaks when Depardieu goes off on Richard's behavior toward Deneuve in one of his reviews and thus puts the whole theater in jeopardy. Deneuve and Depardieu make an absorbing screen pair merely since they're so completely disparate she being the elegant French beauty composed and sophisticated while he is an uncharacteristic French leading man with his hulky body odd looks and coarse disposition. Early in the film Deneuve likens his character to Jean Gabin in La Bte Humaine which lets Truffaut selfconsciously associate his leading man to one of the French cinema's screen idols and also to allude to Renoir one of his favorite directors.While there are countless characters in the film whose intermingling story lines compel its energy the real hero is the Thtre Montmartre itself which becomes a badge of the strength of art and the spirit of resistance both of which Truffaut idealizes almost to a blemish. We can see this in celebrated cinematographer Nestor Almendros's use of color which is largely hues of amber and brown that are counterbalanced by the arresting use of red within the theater portentous of the fervor of artistic triumph just within its otherwise measly frontage. It's for sure that this most clever of love stories is a crowdpleasing movie that commemorates its characters' determination during a bleak time that many viewers at the time could still readily recall. And while it is not one of Truffaut's most brilliant works it is all the same a remarkable and appealing film one that echoes the great filmmaker's affection fir inventive concept and its part in sustaining civilization.".

Consequently the director prolongs his creative undertakings clandestinely using his wife as his puppet.There is also romantic friction in the film as Deneuve and Depardieu cultivate an implicit attraction that rather than drawing them together deters them like divergent ends of a magnet. Both actors were foremost stars of the French cinema and Truffaut uses their luminous screen presence to distinguished effect protracting their attraction to one another like a piano wire that ultimately breaks when Depardieu goes off on Richard's behavior toward Deneuve in one of his reviews and thus puts the whole theater in jeopardy. Deneuve and Depardieu make an absorbing screen pair merely since they're so completely disparate she being the elegant French beauty composed and sophisticated while he is an uncharacteristic French leading man with his hulky body odd looks and coarse disposition. Early in the film Deneuve likens his character to Jean Gabin in La Bte Humaine which lets Truffaut selfconsciously associate his leading man to one of the French cinema's screen idols and also to allude to Renoir one of his favorite directors.While there are countless characters in the film whose intermingling story lines compel its energy the real hero is the Thtre Montmartre itself which becomes a badge of the strength of art and the spirit of resistance both of which Truffaut idealizes almost to a blemish. We can see this in celebrated cinematographer Nestor Almendros's use of color which is largely hues of amber and brown that are counterbalanced by the arresting use of red within the theater portentous of the fervor of artistic triumph just within its otherwise measly frontage. It's for sure that this most clever of love stories is a crowdpleasing movie that commemorates its characters' determination during a bleak time that many viewers at the time could still readily recall. And while it is not one of Truffaut's most brilliant works it is all the same a remarkable and appealing film one that echoes the great filmmaker's affection fir inventive concept and its part in sustaining civilization.";

This doesn't happen which makes the movie somewhat offbeat and optimistic but also a bit pointless.

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately i've seen only a couple of Truffaut's films but nevertheless i think i understand why is he so legendary. And i also understand why this film won 10 Cesars when it was released in 1980.First of all  the actors. Catherine Deneuve is really great here and plus her role is very challenging because as Bernard says there are two women hiding inside Marion. At times she is so gentle and loving especially towards her husband Lucas and sometimes she's really arrogant and cold. In general her Marion is a very confused and stressed and in love at the same time which makes her very her very hard to play but i think Catherine Deneuve did a magnificent job. The same can be said about Heinz Bennent in the role of Lucas but i don't think Depardieu is on the same level although there are several scenes where he's really great at the rehearsal of the shouting scene and in the nightclub. At the same time i don't think it's his fault. I think that he actually has too little screen time and his character is not so fully developed.The cinematography is great and the script too although i have some criticism or maybe i just misunderstood some points. First of all i didn't understand how does Lucas realise that Marion is in love with Bernard. OK she kisses him after the premiere but even i didn't realise it was this kind of kiss and Lucas doesn't even see it 'cause he's in the basement. And there's one scene where she asks Bernard to sit next to her but Lucas is not there too. So how does he know? Am i missing something because it's not just a small detail it's a major point. Nevermind the film still has more meaning then a great deal of American nonsense.And what i liked about it the most is the overall in the time of war atmosphere. During the whole film we can feel the tension we can hear the radio broadcasts we can see how the people are forced to hide whenever they hear the alarm and the electricity often goes out. Truffaut makes sure that whenever we start to feel safe watching the rehearsals and observing the relationships inside the theater something interrupts the relatively calm existence and reminds us that there's war outside. His direction is superb here as it was in La peau Douce  the other film i saw made by him. I of course i know these are not even among his best. But i can't really know that. All i know is that this film is really great and i enjoyed it very much.".

It is a film of little violence and a more subtle restrained view of Paris during World War II. I have to believe that much of life went on during this time and this is a small cross section of that portrayal. The Germans sort of absorbed France and went about their business. Much of the horror goes on offstage but the focus of the movie is what happens to a small theatre on a day to day basis. Catherine Deneuve is a woman who manages to pull something from her limited resources to maintain what she loves including her husband who hides in the cellar of the theatre. She dominates the screen. Also Gerard Depardieu is excellent as the young actor who works for the underground while those around him see him merely as a flippant letch. This has a lot of flaws and perhaps a little trouble with verisimilitude but it is an inspiring story of strength and endurance and is very enjoyable.".

It's not as easy as it would sound since this piece of art is secured by the most modern antitheft devices and a direct alarm to the police. So of course the details has to be carefully planned at first. The only problem is that Egon's surrounded by amateurs and idiots. Anyway typical Danish comedystyle of its time though a bit weak as the insults and characters ain't fully developed in this first movie. I'd recommend movie 313 of the series instead as they're much more enjoyable.Sir jeg vil gerne reportere at... SIR NU KOMMER DER ET TOG! Sir I'd like to report that... SIR INCOMING TRAIN! The enjoyable scene where Hr. Mortensen is trying to report back to his chief in a phonebooth and a lone trainwagon derails and smashes into the phonebooth and his car.".

Of course it can't be compared to some of the serious movies from Denmark in recent years but this was the way we made movies back then.Now the production company Nordisk Film has just released the first four movies on DVD recently and the rest are to follow.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this is kind of like watching a drawing by Picasso from his childhood... or a home video shot by Stanley Kubrick. Arguably the greatest Danish series of the comedy genre the films about The Olsen Gang have entertained countless people in many countries... as my father informed me the former Eastern Germany found it delightful as it mocked authorityit was permitted by the censors due to Denmark being a primarily capitalistic system. Actually when they translated the filmsby dubbing as Germany and France are two of the only countries to possess too much arrogance and pride over their language to learn any other including English they had to cut out the character of Yvonne... as they simply could not find a German actress to match her. That says something about the energetic and hilarious performance she brings to each of the filmsapart from the very last... as she had unfortunately passed away which was one of the main reasons that it was delayed so many years... and was pitifully awful of a movie by most standards. The actors basic plot progression even the theme was in place right here from the beginning... it just wasn't as refined as it got to be through the series. Much of it is just dreadful the humor is silly and mostly stays at the level of the common denominatorthough there are some traces of the satire and social commentary of the later films as well as the human touch the small details apparent in most of the films. The acting is incredibly overdone in most cases... even in that of Poul Reichchardt a seasoned veteran within the art of acting renowned not only for his film work but for his many plays in The Danish Royal Theater. The plot is all over the place... for an 80minute filmmost of the later films reach over 100 minutes it's got more mixups and complications than most films of three or four hours. In spite of its almost insipid uninspired simplicity it's almost difficult to follow and far harder to recall. The pace is almost constantly insistingly off... as if the film doesn't know when to move where it's going... or how to get there. Some scenes consist entirely of jokes and many of these are of a comic cartoony nature... the gang survive a major blast from explosives to give a brief example. Anyone who's seen the film will most likely grant that the last few scenes of the film are just about impossible to take seriously. Then there are all the quipsthough admittedly some are somewhat funny at porno and the diverse reactions towards itat the time just before it was released the issue of it was heavily debated... all in all this film is just very much a sign of its time. It was made to appeal to the masses and this is what Danes preferred back then... silly mindless fun. It wasn't until a few films later that this series really started to become sophisticated. But that doesn't mean that this film should be forgotten apart from of course an excellent window into the world view of the Denmark of the late 60's this film should be watched simply to see the roots of this grand series. Most of what people remember of all the good films of the franchise starts here... it may not be as refined or wellexecuted as it got to be but it's still there. The walk of the gang Yvonne's rants Egon's impassioned speech to Benny and Kjeld the very first heist of the film which is always destined to go wrongone might add that the visual of the three as we first see them might have been better saved for a later film or at least a later moment in this one as it would have a more humorous effect once the audience were used to the sight of the three as they usually look... it started here. It has been said that the most important step of the journey is the first... and while this is arguably among the least memorable or entertaining of the steps that is the journey of this series it is still that vitally important first one. Without this the world would never have known The Olsen Gang. For that alone it has my respect. Starting with the next movie there are changes made. The series heads towards grandeur... slowly perhaps but it makes it. I recommend this film to any fan of Danish cinema and The Olsen Gang. If you don't know any of the other films of the seriesthis wasn't the first I saw this wasn't where my interest in the franchise begun I suggest you either look for the good funny things in thissince they all reappear many of them done far better in the later films or give one of the later filmsstarting around number 5 Runs Amok a chance before or after watching this. There is somewhat little in the way of overall plot throughout the seriesthough I advise making sure you see at least one other film before Runs Amok and make sure you don't start with one of the 2? I think Gang films that start at their holiday destinationany real fan of these films will be able to answer that off the top of their head and anyone who isn't should find out from the films and not this review. Not an exemplary start but does show some promise evidence of things to come. 610".

While the film has mild sexual references and mild coarse language it really shouldn't be an issue for anyone but the prudish.The film depicts an orphaned nine year old refugee facing deportation from Sweden and how she finds shelter in a rundown public housing block staying with a punk rocker. For me a good children's film should cater for all ages including adults which means not underestimating the intelligence of children. Kidz in da Hood doesn't quite meet this criteria yet my son enjoyed it immensely as did the group of several children in front of us aged 8  12.It tackles issues of ethnicity acceptance crime and humanitarianism in a manner that is digestible for children so is worth seeing for that alone.

The director does a pretty good job as well the movie bathes in a very outrageous atmosphere that's really fitting for the source material. No to me it's purely a script thing. The jokes are mostly just flat and predictable it's absurd comedy by writers who haven't really gotten the gist of it yet. Take the running gag with the king who rhymes every sentence for example you know there are some good scenes in there but they can't fish them out. Inevitably some stuff does work the guy using another guy as his horse is a nice touch but the laughs are few and far apart. However the movie is still enjoyable for some reason mainly because I'm a sucker for this kind of pseudohistorical comedy.

Even things such as hardasnails Russian henchmen return. It completes the upward curve of scale in Ritchie's crime films from a rigged card game to a rigged boxing circuit to rigged property development. The crime lords get larger in stature the sums of money owed have more zeros on the end and the capers required to resolve the situation more grand but it's still the same concept.You'd think this was a list of criticisms and if you found Snatch wearingly familiar you shouldn't need it spelling out that this film won't impress you. Looking for originality? Look elsewhere. RocknRolla may be pushing the formula a little bit but if you accept that it's still enormous fun. Ritchie's directing is as proficient as ever it moves at a merry old pace and the plot just about stays on the rails. The characters are endearing and there's plenty of laughs to be had. Other than its dearth of invention the only real flaw with the film lies in the opening fifteen minutes where Ritchie sets up the plot strands which will then unravel. Whereas previous films did this in a smooth unforced way here Ritchie lathers it with a liberal helping of voiceover narration so there's absolutely no confusion possible as to who is who and what they're after which on many occasions extends to pointing out the bleeding obvious. Show don't tell it's the first rule in the book Ritchie! It may be getting to the point where RocknRolla must go down as a guilty pleasure but guilty pleasures are often the most fulfilling kind.

	schema:reviewBody "RocknRolla seems to be the beginning of the resurrection of Guy Ritchie's career. Not to anyone's surprise he does this with what he has been so potent with throughout his career a British gangster film. If you've had any experience with Ritchie movies you know exactly what you're getting into here a comedic thriller. This of course may seem problematic in Ritchie's case it is not.The writing and dialog is fast paced and quite witty and entertaining to watch. The movie as a whole maybe be a bit of a head scratcher here and there but the pay off is good and the idea is a bit of a parody of itself which is what makes this film so fun.What Ritchie accomplishes though in the same way he has with his past successful productions is putting together an extremely diverse and yet correlating cast. This starts with the lead man in Gerard Butler whose notoriety has steadily risen largely through his performances of comical caricatures not an insult. With RocknRolla Butler seems to have found a role perfect for his appeal and charm he brings to the screen. This is largely because of a witty script and great fun performances all around.Then of course there is Mark Strong who until this year was largely a total unknown at least in the American mainstream. While Gerard Butler may have found a genre he is most strongly suited for Mark Strong could certainly use this along with Body of Lies to launch to the very least a respectable acting career. His posture range and ability to change tone and style subtly not only between films but within them is something that should be and surely will be recognized.".

If you've had any experience with Ritchie movies you know exactly what you're getting into here a comedic thriller. This of course may seem problematic in Ritchie's case it is not.The writing and dialog is fast paced and quite witty and entertaining to watch. The movie as a whole maybe be a bit of a head scratcher here and there but the pay off is good and the idea is a bit of a parody of itself which is what makes this film so fun.What Ritchie accomplishes though in the same way he has with his past successful productions is putting together an extremely diverse and yet correlating cast. This starts with the lead man in Gerard Butler whose notoriety has steadily risen largely through his performances of comical caricatures not an insult. With RocknRolla Butler seems to have found a role perfect for his appeal and charm he brings to the screen. This is largely because of a witty script and great fun performances all around.Then of course there is Mark Strong who until this year was largely a total unknown at least in the American mainstream. While Gerard Butler may have found a genre he is most strongly suited for Mark Strong could certainly use this along with Body of Lies to launch to the very least a respectable acting career. His posture range and ability to change tone and style subtly not only between films but within them is something that should be and surely will be recognized.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is a new gang of Russian mobsters in London planning to create a real estate goldmine lead by UriKarl Roden. But they need the help of LennyWilkinson to get permission so he lends him his lucky painting this in turn disappears bringing Stella the accountantNewton and the Wild BunchElbaButlerHardy into the Fray. Amongst all this Is Rockstar Johnny Quid and his AgentsKebbellPivenBridges. Get ready for another multi stranded cockney Ritchie film.First of all so you know I have been long anticipating this film I mean who wouldn't just for the cast alone? so didn't go in with low expectations they were high and this film still managed to surpass them. Lets start with the aforementioned cast... they are all absolutely fantastic but they are aided by beautifully written characters. Gerard ButlerOne Two and Idris ElbaMumbles have more chemistry on screen than most Hollywood romcom leading couples. They snap and crack off each other like they've done it for years. In fact the entire Wild Bunch as they are known in the film provide some of its best moments from a visceral heist scene with some unstoppable Russian heavieswhich oozes style to a hilarious running subplot about Bob'sTom hardy sexual orientation. Matt King also provides a great turn as the Wild Bunch's in house drug dealer Cookie he also turns in one of the movies best scenes an eerie narration on heroine addiction. Wilkinson is firing on all cylinders in a role that could have just been his Carmine Falcone with a cockney accent but manages to be much more as well as pretty scary. But it is Mark Strong who comes up trumps in this storyline his portrayal of Archie the right hand man is probably the most rounded character in the film full of humour and wit and with an undeniable likability he steals much of the scenes he appears in. And now on to Toby Kebbell as junkie Rockstar Johnny Quid this is a role that if the academy were a little less narrowminded they would consider supporting actor nod. He is scum but his character is such that he is witty and somewhat of a poetphilosopher fantastically written and Kebbell plays it brilliant. You are never sure what hes going to do next I guarantee he will take you by surprise.And now onto the man of the moment Ritchie. There was a lot of scepticism about this film considering how badly his past two films did critically and commercially. But what is clear from this is that instead of going the safe root and doing a film that will please all he has once again done his own thing the way he wanted to do it and the result is a fantastic piece of filmmaking.I really hope RocknRolla makes the money it deserves and gets a wider release in America it is a film that needs to be seen. Its funny clever visually stunning and is a perfect example of a man doing things his own way and not succumbing to the pressures of the media. Well done Ritchie well done cast Im up for the Real RocknRolla and when you see it so will you!".

	schema:headline " Ritchie rolls back into action with a pulse pounding viciously funny return to form";
	schema:reviewBody "In a business as enormously subjective as the film industry it would seem near impossible to attempt to remain individual and innovative continually raising the bar without the occasional stumble. Writerdirector Guy Ritchie who at first garnered countless approval for his vicious hyperstylized tales of dirty deeds in the British underground had found the critical tides turning in recent years after the succession of universally panned Swept Away to widely baffling Revolver begging the question as to whether Ritchie's cinematic genius had been limited to his initial films. However fans of the unconventional filmmaker will be enthralled to hear that his latest project RocknRolla proves a confident return to form a snappy stylish piece of work bristling with energy and acerbic wit  in short classic Ritchie.Returning to his defining genre Ritchie crafts yet another convoluted myriad of intersecting story lines focusing on greed deception doublecrossing and plenty of stupidity in the seedy underbelly of England. With viewers trusted to be familiar with his unique style Ritchie uses his familiar story template to worm in social commentary amidst his trademark edge and humour satirising the increasingly developed state of London and the enormous demand for real estate and location. But this is not the ordinary romanticized London as Ritchie's cinematic eye appears determined to capture every last dank filthy gutter every ounce of crime and corruption in a fashion akin to the least flattering cinematic depictions of New York. And yet amidst the filth and edgy comedy the occasional moment of raw humanity flawed as it may be emerges from the fray of unanimously unsympathetic characters whether it be the vulnerability of rocker Johnny Quid shuddering and rocking back and forth on a drug trip or the witty interplay between 'The Wild Bunch' a trio of hapless thieves. For a film so cynically detached RocknRolla sure can hit the emotional gutpunch buttons for brief but unsettlingly crucial moments.However in the midst of his caustic reflection on his home town Ritchie has mercifully left his sense of uproarious fun intact. After a relatively slow start serving mostly to set up the convoluted array of characters and plot points the central Maguffin this time being a 'lucky' Russian painting which goes missing the film takes off at the frenzied pace those familiar with Ritchie's work would expect. Plunging into a fray of hilarious coincidences and situational comedy watch for a priceless slow dance scene and one of the most hysterical sex scenes in many a year double crosses intimidation rants philosophical monologues and the time worn Ritchie tradition of indestructible Russian hit men it becomes clear that no matter how many similarities it may bear to past work the delight of seeing a dynamic talent back on the top of his game cannot be understated. While the hyperkinetic editing and camerawork and bold music cues of Snatch have been toned down and the casual violence is more removed the cinematic flavour is unmistakable  Ritchie is back and just as bombastically entertaining as ever. As usual Ritchie's cast rise to the occasion of matching the brilliance of their script and director. Gerard Butler brings an endearing charm to tough talking goofball thug OneTwo inevitably raising laughs whenever on screen and anchoring the film as one of the few likable characters. Tom Wilkinson takes on the role of resident British mobster with considerable aplomb spitting out his lines with a vindictive joy and proving easily more than adequate on the intimidation front. Thandie Newton evokes an alluring mysterious air as a devious accountant playing each side of the conflict against each other exuding a subtle quirkiness in her execution of the traditional femme fatale figure. Mark Strong delivers harried menace and perfect comic deadpan as Wilkinson's right hand man crafting another memorable Ritchie reference with the Archie slap and Idris Elba and Tom Hardy are fittingly hilarious as OneTwo's bumbling fellow hard men Mumbles and Handsome Bob. Finally Toby Kebbell eerily essays the most commanding character on screen as allegedly deceased rocker Johnny Quid. A narcissistic painfully vulnerable haphazardly philosophical and cheekily insulting pile of flaws and potent observations Quid is as classic as any of Ritchie's more beloved characters and Kebbell's offkilter performance rivets the viewer's attention  whether hilarious or tragic he is always invariably impossible to ignore and far too interesting to discount. While the occasional cry of rehashing story elements from past successes may be raised Ritchie's return to form is too supremely entertaining to dwindle under such complaints as the formula proves to have just enough shelf life along with countless inspired tweaks to remain miles ahead of any stylistic impersonators. For any finding the cinema's fare too dull or uninspired fear not  a genuine talent has reemerged and RocknRolla proves just the antidote to the hackneyed mainstream offshoots which slunk up in his absence. The prospect of the announced two sequels is mouth watering indeed  if anything should prove indicative of the film's quality it is that. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout his career director Guy Ritchie Snatch Lock Stock and two Smokin' Barrels has slowly gathered a cultlike following ensuring that his movies be they good or bad will always earn a few dollars from loyal fans. With his 2006 release of Revolver many of his avid followers found new 'stylistic' directors to drool over the movie itself receiving mostly negative reviews as a majority of moviegoers claimed it to be 'all style and no substance'. His latest release RocknRolla shows Ritchie returning to his roots of gangster oriented moronic villain centered hitman featuring fun. It's a welcome return.RocknRolla is an ensemble piece centering on many many characters while remaining surprisingly capable of not focusing on any one member of the neverending cast. Gerard Butler 300 plays a goodhearted crook for hire by the name of OneTwo a member in a group of 5 bloodtobones friends each of which doubles as a partner in crime. The main focus in the gangsterrelated circle of characters is Lenny Cole a ruthless old fashioned thug brought to life by Oscarnominated Tom Wilkinson Michael Clayton.The movie truly begins 15 minutes or so after the rather unique opening credits which in itself foreshadows Ritchie's stylistic thematic which circulates throughout the movie. The eclectically charged plot follows Lenny Cole and his cohorts as they meet and greet Uri a seemingly reasonable Russian mobster as the two speak realestate business. Cole a selfproclaimed King of London runs each and every aspect of London and agrees to allow the Russians their building  for a small sum of 7 million Euros. Agreeing Uri offers Lenny his favourite painting as a token of appreciation a hopeful symbol that all will go well.From this point on viewers are treated to a mishmash of confusing twists an infinite pallet of characters and some of the most intelligent writing to hit Hollywood in years. The aforementioned painting is stolen from Cole and a search ensues throughout the entire movie eventually leading to Johnny Quid Jamie Campbell the lead singer of The Quidlickers and stepson to none other than Lenny himself. Quid also known as The Rocknrolla represents a solid contrast to his devilish stepfather. Providing monologue after brilliant monologue Quid becomes a character of classic cool embodying olden day suave with modern day style a true to time Rocknrolla.As with every one of Ritchie's gifts to the silver screen the subtle yet slick script throws the few negative aspects of the movie to the backburner leaving only pure gold to shimmer and shine. With a never ending stream of British mannerisms combined with overseas terminology North American viewers are faced with a rather tricky dilemma Sit through a movie that may require a small amount of effort to comprehend due to it's foreign tendencies or instead rely on Dicaprio and Mr. Crowe to deliver yet another bland meaningless CIA centered action movie in the form of now premiering Body Of Lies. Unfortunately for the masses that truly enjoy a movie with an intelligent script box office numbers generally speak poorly for Guy Ritchie's films on our side of the pond his movies usually making no more than a few hundred thousand dollars only to become cult hits once released on DVD.Viewers may be shocked to see Gerard Butler best known for his overly masculine performance as King Leonidas in 300 hidden amongst an amazing yet unknown cast with each actor holding their own and providing more than authentic performances. It is a rare yet beautiful sight to behold a cast full of actors that have not yet been granted the fame or spotlight yet manage to upstage a majority of the actors that we are presented on a day to day basis. It is beyond sad the least can be said to see Chris Bridges  A.K.A. Ludicrous 2 Fast 2 Furious  and Jeremey Pivens Smokin' Aces failing miserably in their attempt to act in brief yet important cameo performances also singled out as the only two American actors in the film their talent shadowed and overcast by the nobodies surrounding them.To those readers out there who are contemplating seeing this notquitesocommon piece of theatre in the form of British Cinema it is best for you to know there are many worse things you can do. Director Guy Ritchie weaves an intricate quilt the likes of which hasn't been since his debut to theatres managing to create a truly witty film from nothing more than a missing painting. Definitely a must see.5 out of 5 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Early previews has called this a return to form. Hardly. This was for me a major disappointment. The moment the film begins its as if it intentionally tries to confuse us as to what the hell this film's all about. Describing the plot is close to pointless. After all Guy Ritchie isn't adept in the old art of storytelling his films ran along the lines of sitcoms  a series of events instead of an actual story. Which wasn't a bad thing in the case of Lock Stock  Snatch because emotional resonance with the audience was irrelevant. The goal there was to generate laughter. But RocknRolla is only funny in minor  and I DO mean minor  spots. What's more it also doesn't help as it begins of how it mentions that Britain is on the up in the property market. Seeing as of now the country is currently enduring creditcrunch problems inflation rises and a major decrease in property value. You'd be surprised how automatically dated this makes the film.Its unfair to judge a new film based on the director's previous efforts but when its Guy Ritchie  who's been running on the same formula for the past 10 years  you can't help but do so. This film was advertised and touted as a return to form ala Lock Stock and Snatch but after the first time I watched those two I loved them. Not looked at them with total scorn. The moments of humour and wit is few and far between and some lines of dialogue and monologues try to add a little swagger but come off as pretentious and are inches away from falling into selfparody and returning to Revolver territory. And when the best laughs this film can generate involves around a character's homosexuality you know this film is headed for the pits. The performances here are strong but it still doesn't account for the dialogue which just goes nowhere. The entire persona of Tom Wilkinson's cockney villain is almost entirely derived from Bob Hoskins in the Long Good Friday and Tony Kebbell's Johnny Quid the RocknRolla of the film's title is pretty much a totally pointless character  honestly did this guy have any purpose in this film other than that he stole the painting?  No. In the end it doesn't help when the film's excuse for a plot is merely a bunch of distractions to hide what is really  a completely mediocre film. Its so convoluted anyway its virtually nonsense. Unlike Lock Stock and Snatch where all the characters and their situations are established in this film they're not and it finishes with too many loose ends and plot holes and contrivances.  What actually happened to Thandie Newton and the Russian with that painting?  Where did the whole Lenny's frame up of the characters come from then?  Will all this be revealed in Ricthie's intended sequel? Who knows? And who cares? Because if that were the case the best described feeling that this would generate would be that you were cheated.Guy Ritchie's flashy hyperkinetic style is what keeps this film from being a total bore but now's the time where he should stop writing scripts.".

You'd think that after the debacle of Swept Away and Revolver he'd throw us all a sheepish grin and amble back to the pub. Yet time and again he drags his director's chair from the allotment and breezily plonks it down in the middle of the corpsestrewn warzone that is the business of film. At the very least you've got to admire his tenacity. And as he stresses none of his movies have actually lost money so far. Tom Wilkinson is Lenny Cole oldstyle gangstercumproperty developer with councillors and half of London's skyline in his sky rocket. A taxdodging seven million euro deal with a new Russian oligarch on the block the Abramovichlike Uri is compromised after Lenny loses the lucky painting Uri has loaned him in a display of good will. The painting stolen by a couple of Scally junkies winds up in the hands of Lenny's stepson crackhead musician Johnny Quid reported missing at sea though very much alive and terrorising clubland. Because clearly that's what our wimpy smackedup skinnytrousered indie rockers are capable of these days leaving bouncers for dead. Also in the mix are a trio of stickup guys dubbed the 'Wild Bunch'. After finding themselves in hock to Cole the Bunch hatch a plan with Uri's treacherous femme fatale accountant Stella Newton to rip off the Russian acquiring that painting along the way. Then things get messy. This is a Ritchie plot after all akin to one of those children's puzzles where the finger must follow a number of tangled fishing lines to see if Ernie the Eskimo Wally the Whaler or Pat the Poacher is having mackerel for supper. One thing you can be sure of following a number of nearmisses each party will bump into one another at the climax and have a massive fishfight. If this all sounds familiar it's probably because Ritchie has just remade Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. Not content with being a magpie's magpie The Long Good Friday and Pulp Fiction are both reflexively referenced here he's also started ripping off his own films. Fair enough. Even the dimmest bulb must eventually come round to the fact that when all else fails it's prudent to nudge the least mouldiest bit of old fruit to the top of the apple cart. But a decade after Ritchie surfed that frothing zeitgeist there's an appalling weariness about RocknRolla a terrible sense of sadness surely springing from the lesson that trying to bust out of one's own limited remit doesn't always pay off. Unfortunately the director can now barely remember how he got the right things right in the first place. Yet again a film jumping with fantastic character actors has been utterly capsized by the script. There are actors here the calibre of Idris Elba  Guy or his people have been watching 'The Wire'. And Matt 'Super Hans' King  Guy or his people has been watching 'Peep Show'. And not least the extraordinary Toby Kebbell here apparently channelling Russell Brand. Against Ritchie's juggernaut of mediocrity they are all powerless to resist. Mark Strong for instance in his second Ritchie film after Revolver has been rewarded for his loyalty with a bigger role as Lenny's enforcer Archie  though simultaneously punished with more dialogue. It is deeply depressing to watch King voice lines like This lot are doing more bugle than a brass section and indeed every utterance sounds like a photo caption from 'Maxim' magazine In there like swimwear Think before you drink before you drive me mad and repeatedly that new favourite phrase of mockneys everywhere Jog on. At one point Uri actually says to Lenny without irony We are very much alike you and I while scintillating exchanges such as Reality is a cruel mistress I must remember that Be my guest are par for the course. Elsewhere there are some schoolboy giggles at the expense of Uri's enormous seminaked henchmen as if the Epic Movie team were remaking David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises although keen to emphasize his noughties credentials Ritchie has Elba saying of a gay Wild Buncher If I could be half the human Bob is at the price of being a poof I'd think about it. Well it's almost convincing. Yet as an encounter between Butler and the dull notespeciallyfatale Newton demonstrates Guy's films aren't all that interested in straight sex either.Those underandovercranked cameras may be less inyourface this time round but there's no disguising the director's other tics convoluted plot lines daftnames the same old railway arches and tunnels 'gritty' backdrops for the same tired old chase scenes those interminable cracker barrel philosophies like sallies from a depressed barfly There is no spring without a winter. And no life without death. Or That which starts sweet ends bitter. And that which starts bitter ends sweet. It's as if Ritchie didn't realise Being There was a satire. Wading through this stuff is akin to peeping through one's fingers at a retired punchdrunk boxer climbing into the ring or a recidivist junkie ripping out their naltrexone implants.

I cannot believe that anyone can see this film as anything other than what it is  a stream of Guy Ritchie consciousness packaged up with a load of bad language embarrassing dialogue twodimensional characters you couldn't care less about and utterly utterly stupid plot  at least this time he's not trying to make it look like a Bacardi Breezer commercial  and for that I give it one more star! As if to justify some kind of scriptwriter credentials he makes almost every single major character of which there are many take turns to spout halfbaked philosophical claptrap as if it would give this UTTER RUBBISH some kind of value See that fag packet over there.....it's like life.....

It disintegrates also on action and comedy which sadly adds to the further halfhanded mediocre of RocknRolla. The characters however do sometimes interest with their more than average dialogue and quirky sense of humour. Despite saying that the characters do make their fair share of jokes this doesn't alter the fact that it's not consistency throughout Rocknrolla. The action and stylish violence that Ritchie once demonstrated in Snatch sadly is mislaid by a poor story.So RocknRolla is by far not Ritchies best and should be kept away from audiences expecting the brilliance well balanced story and classic action that Ritchie once shown in Snatch. Sadly though RocknRolla puts a downfall decline in Ritchies status and directorial package.".

Luckily for him he returned to what he was best at and took a back to basic approach.The film is a gangster story set in London. It tells of OneTwo Gerald Butler who has a small crew Mumbles Idris Elba and Handsome Bob Tom Hardy. OneTwo at the beginning of the film and ends up entering into a dodgy property deal where he owns money to Lenny Tom Wilkingson a major London gangster. Lenny basically tricks OneTwo so that he could get the property and bribe the London council to let him build up the property and take all the profits. Lenny seeks to make a major deal with a Russian billionaire who owns a football club I wonder who he is meant to be based on. The billionaire seeks to make a new concert hall very quickly and wants to use Lenny's contacts to make sure that planning permission is granted. Lenny wants 7 Million Euros so he can do it. The billionaire has a dodgy accountant Stella Thandie Newton who asks OneTwo to rob the Euros and takes a nice slice of the profits. At the same time the Russian also loans Lenny his lucky painting as a symbol of truth and as a thank you. Unforuately this painting is stolen by Lenny's rock star stepson Johnny Quid Toby Kebbell. As the film goes on all these story lines become interlinked.Ritchie goes back to the types of films that made his name which shows that he is really a one trick pony. This film felt a little be like a best of Ritchie. I felt that some of the subplot felt a bit tacked on especially the part involving Johnny Quid and at times characters completely disappeared. The problem with Guy Ritchie is he thinks he is smarter then he really is and wants to be clever with his script. But at least for Ritchie he is in safe territory. Another problem is Ritchie is a mockney a wannabe cockney the kind of person most people look down on. However there are positives. Most of the story does work and some of the comedy is good. Fans of the original two Guy Ritchie film will love it for that. There is also a very good cast in the film. Tom Wilkington was the best as Lenny the leading gangster but most of the other actors gave very good performances. Butler and Newton are a very good actors. There were also fine setpieces especially the second raid against the Russians and has a good comical fight in a sports shop. But at time it did feel like Ritchie took a style over substances approach. There is also an excellent soundtrack to the film which is never a bad thing. If you are a rock fan you would enjoy it.I personally feel that Ritchie could have cut some times from the plot and it would have made a better film. But there are good performances and some fun bits and if you are a Guy Ritchie film would will enjoy this flick. A decent attempt.".

	schema:headline " Rocknrollin its way to one of the best films of the year";
	schema:reviewBody "Everybody loved Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Everyone hated Swept Away and Revolver. The question was how was Guy Ritchie's latest film Rocknrolla going to do? From what I've seen everyone better love this movie! This film has it all gunfights gangsters British slang Gerard Butler memorable lines and even some poorly behaved American crayfish. Somehow Ritchie finds enough film time to fit cameos by Jeremy Piven and Chris Ludacris Bridges in there.Butler returns to the kind of the role that made him a household name in 300. Butler stars as Mr OneTwo a criminal who isn't afraid to speak out his mind or let his fists do the talking. It's good to see Butler return to the badass role after starring in soft films such as PS I Love You and Nim's Island. Tom Wilkinson fresh off an Oscar run in Michael Clayton stars as Lenny Cole a tough old school British mobster who is prone to some senior moments. Ritchie's trademark of having the stories intertwine comes into play something that made Snatch and Lock Stock work so well. Lenny who has cheated OneTwo out of a land deal in London is working with some Russians led by the businessman Yuri Karel Roden on a land deal. However OneTwo steals Yuri's money meant for Lenny. This sets up a chain of events which lead to dead bodies and more.While Snatch focused on a stolen diamond and Lock Stock focused on stolen guns Rocknrolla chooses to focus on a stolen painting. You see it's Yuri's lucky painting and he's let Lenny borrow it. Turns out the painting has been stolen by Lenny's wild stepson Johnny Quid Toby Kebbell a crazy stoned rocker. While some fans will complain about how Ritchie films always seem to be about something stolen I just feel if it ain't broke don't fix it! Aside from Butler and Wilkinson fans will love performances by the all star cast including a sexy accountant Thandie Newton OneTwo's partners Idris Elba and Tom Hardy and two American club owners Bridges and Piven. However Kebbell and Mark Strong absolutely steal the show. As the stoned rocker Kebbell makes us feel compassion for the Johnny Quid character and we eventually root for him against his mean ol stepdad. Strong fresh off a classic role as a good natured hitman in Ritchie's Revolver portrays Archie Lenny's loyal right hand mate. Archie is a no nonsense criminal who also serves as the voice of reason in Lenny's crazy world. Archie is without a doubt one of Ritchie's finest characters.American filmgoers will probably complain that the film is too British. As an American I honestly say Who cares? Ritchie's use of British slang is fun hip and gives this action film a sense of humor. If this is too much for American filmgoers then they will be glad that this film somewhat reminds them of a film directed by the great American director Quentin Tarantino. A dance scene between Butler and Newton seems directly pulled from Pulp Fiction a scene where Johnny tortures a man to the tune of The Subways' Rock n Roll Queen seems like a sly Reservoir Dogs reference and the unseen painting will have fans guessing much like the briefcase from Pulp Fiction. In addition the opening credits sequence is on of the best you will ever see. The sequence almost has a graphic novel feel to it something we Americans love examples 300 Sin City 30 Days of Night.Overall Ritchie gives us a deep crazy and fun film. When it's over you think how this film could possibly be made better. As if right on cue the question is answered. A sequel The Real Rocknrolla is announced on screen. A perfect 10 I can hardly wait for The Real Rocknrolla.".

	onyx:emotionText "Everybody loved Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Everyone hated Swept Away and Revolver. The question was how was Guy Ritchie's latest film Rocknrolla going to do? From what I've seen everyone better love this movie! This film has it all gunfights gangsters British slang Gerard Butler memorable lines and even some poorly behaved American crayfish. Somehow Ritchie finds enough film time to fit cameos by Jeremy Piven and Chris Ludacris Bridges in there.Butler returns to the kind of the role that made him a household name in 300. Butler stars as Mr OneTwo a criminal who isn't afraid to speak out his mind or let his fists do the talking. It's good to see Butler return to the badass role after starring in soft films such as PS I Love You and Nim's Island. Tom Wilkinson fresh off an Oscar run in Michael Clayton stars as Lenny Cole a tough old school British mobster who is prone to some senior moments. Ritchie's trademark of having the stories intertwine comes into play something that made Snatch and Lock Stock work so well. Lenny who has cheated OneTwo out of a land deal in London is working with some Russians led by the businessman Yuri Karel Roden on a land deal. However OneTwo steals Yuri's money meant for Lenny. This sets up a chain of events which lead to dead bodies and more.While Snatch focused on a stolen diamond and Lock Stock focused on stolen guns Rocknrolla chooses to focus on a stolen painting. You see it's Yuri's lucky painting and he's let Lenny borrow it. Turns out the painting has been stolen by Lenny's wild stepson Johnny Quid Toby Kebbell a crazy stoned rocker. While some fans will complain about how Ritchie films always seem to be about something stolen I just feel if it ain't broke don't fix it! Aside from Butler and Wilkinson fans will love performances by the all star cast including a sexy accountant Thandie Newton OneTwo's partners Idris Elba and Tom Hardy and two American club owners Bridges and Piven. However Kebbell and Mark Strong absolutely steal the show. As the stoned rocker Kebbell makes us feel compassion for the Johnny Quid character and we eventually root for him against his mean ol stepdad. Strong fresh off a classic role as a good natured hitman in Ritchie's Revolver portrays Archie Lenny's loyal right hand mate. Archie is a no nonsense criminal who also serves as the voice of reason in Lenny's crazy world. Archie is without a doubt one of Ritchie's finest characters.American filmgoers will probably complain that the film is too British. As an American I honestly say Who cares? Ritchie's use of British slang is fun hip and gives this action film a sense of humor. If this is too much for American filmgoers then they will be glad that this film somewhat reminds them of a film directed by the great American director Quentin Tarantino. A dance scene between Butler and Newton seems directly pulled from Pulp Fiction a scene where Johnny tortures a man to the tune of The Subways' Rock n Roll Queen seems like a sly Reservoir Dogs reference and the unseen painting will have fans guessing much like the briefcase from Pulp Fiction. In addition the opening credits sequence is on of the best you will ever see. The sequence almost has a graphic novel feel to it something we Americans love examples 300 Sin City 30 Days of Night.Overall Ritchie gives us a deep crazy and fun film. When it's over you think how this film could possibly be made better. As if right on cue the question is answered. A sequel The Real Rocknrolla is announced on screen.

I should point out at this point that I don't accept the premise that he had ever struck vein of 'form' in the first place. He did to some extent and not necessarily to his credit create a distinctive genre of British film with Smoking Barrels and Snatch and in the sense that this is almost identical to those earlier films RocknRolla it is certainly a return to something.I'm a Londoner my parents were Cockney and my grandparents were Cockney in fact my Auntie Elsie lived only a few streets away from Violet Kray and as such I have always thought of Ritchie's Mockney gangster genre as the rather sad fantasy of a bored and insecure middleclass public schoolboy sitting in his 'dorm' reading A Profession of Violence and wishing that Mad Frankie Fraser was his dad and that Frankie would turn up in the senior common room one day and give a good slapping to all those rotten school bullies.I've never found any of Ritchie's films funny and I certainly didn't laugh at RocknRolla. It's juvenile has a silly plot and is too long as well. The characterisation is poor and the dialogue is annoying and dotted with the kind of toecurling phony philosophising that would probably not even make it into a Kabala recruiting video.Ritchie is a director of some technical skill but his limited imagination and interest in the human world at large means that he will never make a film outside this Mockney Gangster genre Swept Away showed us the disaster that ensues when he tries. The fans are there for the Mockneys and I'm sure he'll continue to make more at ever lengthening intervals probably with decreasing budgets and eventually going straight to DVD. They will all follow exactly the same formula and I won't sit through another.".

The Formalist style of film making is clearly seen in this film with the hard core action and violence and a scene where someone finds a creative use for a pencil by stabbing it in someone's neck but it is not as violent as I had hoped it to be and since this is formalism style of film making the violence and action had to look cool as opposed to being real which is probably why when Johnny Quid stabbed the guy in the neck like twelve times with a pencil there was no blood or markings but really I was too busy going what the hell? to notice.The film's story was a little bit clearer than Ritchie's next film Sherlock Holmes but there is no development of the story or plot but of the characters themselves. I think that is essentially where the main story of the film is suppose to come from and even if it didn't work for me I still found the characters engaging and fantastic. The dialog as always is very witty and well executed. The lines and come backs from one actor to the next was natural and emotional making them engaging and interesting. Like the film that follows Sherlock Holmes this film has a talented cast of well known actors as well as some promising new comers. The actors were the main reason that the film was successful for me in making me totally engaged with the film and that I would say if you want to watch an action film with great characters photography editing and a grade A British Film maker than RocknRolla is the film for you.".

The film was unique the first Rock Opera given the Big Screen treatment and this is still in my opinion the best of its genre. Of course the Music and Lyrics are the fulcrum of the film and the numerous album recordings are still popular now because the songs are so unforgettable but the performances of all the principle characters in this original film version give this interpretation a dynamic edge. All the cast probably give their definitive performances but without any doubt Carl Anderson as Judas is the real KING. Rest In Peace. For all you long term fans like me get the new Region 1 DVD special edition with improved sound and picture quality and extras especially the commentary with Norman and Ted you'll cry your heart out.

This movie hit theaters 6 years before I was born and I only just saw it now in Nov. 2004. and I was so moved that I had to comment. Visually it was psychedelic and the editing matches the music masterfully. The music rocks! Carl Anderson is beyond amazing as Judas and ALL of the performances are really magnetic. I love singing along with Annas Jesus and Kiafass. I mostly listen to KoRn and Rap so I never expected to remember rock opera lyrics and run around performing them. The feeling I got when 1st experiencing the movie was trippy. Similar to a live concert. The movie is outstanding and in my opinion will last for generations and generations. It speaks to a part of my soul and spirit.It says right on rock on".

	schema:reviewBody "I've heard much criticism of this film over many years and the most annoying criticism is that it didn't have the vitality of the stage productions back in the day.  There isn't much many of us can do about that though I did see a road production of it about 7 or 8 years ago. The most interesting thing about this film is that it was set in modern times rather than in biblical times.  Roman soldiers wearing shiny helmets and carrying machine guns is a real attention grabber.  The ruins used in the film added another fascinating aspect to the production.  In short the anachronistic approach in the visuals the lyrics and the music itself make this a genuinely unique and clever film.I thought all the acting singing and dancing was great and still appears to be rather fresh and modern.  The lyrics were the most memorable of any movie I've ever seen.  There were many of us that could quickly memorize the entire opera from listening to the soundtrack no videos back then and have much fun play acting ourselves.  The use of Judas as a primary character was probably the single most important aspect of the film.  One has to wonder how Judas became one of the inner circle of disciples if he was such an evil crud to begin with.  In church he is simply mentioned as being a traitor.  The filmmusical asks us to think more on this individual and speculate as to his true nature as a human being.  The only other person I know of that attempted to do this was Taylor Caldwell in her novel I Judas. The point that the crucifixionresurrection hinged on the betrayal of Judas should make any Christian wonder if God actually worked through him and that he wasn't actually damned for all time.People seem to be offended by the lighthearted and hysterically funny! King Herod's Song.  What does the Bible say about this meeting?  Certainly it doesn't say that this was an amicable meeting and indeed I seem to remember Jesus being beaten on the palace grounds.  The look on Neely's face throughout the Herod songanddance is one of seriousness that belies the true nature of what was going on in this scene.  This served to remind the viewer that this wasn't sheer levity and held the scene together in its proper context until it ran full circle with Herod spazzing and showing rabid rather than merely sarcastic hatred for Christ at the end.  This was sheer genius and master film craft in my book. I don't think Jesus' expression would come out as well in the stage version. The reservations Pilate had about authorizing the crucifixion seem to come out in the Bible as well.  Socalled Christians hold Pilate responsible though there was probably many political things going on that are only vaguely alluded to in the Bible.  Nonbiblical tradition says that he and his wife Claudia Procula eventually converted to Christianity themselves.  Who knows?My leastfavorite parts  I Don't Know How to Love Him reminds me a lot of As Long as He Needs Me in Oliver!.  Both songs are plodding and brings each film to a screeching halt.  I believe that this was actually intended to be a pop song but was thrown in when Webber and Rice were composing the opera.  Still Judas singing this through his tears towards the end of the film was very chilling.  Hosanna Hosanna I also find to be rather trite...still...the last stanza never fails to give me goose bumps when the crowd asks if Christ will die for them.  Simon Zealot's prolonged screaming and off keybeat never fails to annoy me...then again he was a rebellious zealot after all.  The falling down push up move in this dance sequence bugs me too. Another part that bothers me is that suddenly it was Pilate's dream rather than his wife's as stated in the bible.  I guess they did this to narrow the canvas simplify the number of key characters.  But what a beautiful song! And I thought the fact that nobody in the cast looked to be much over 25 was kind of weird.  My favorite parts  Caiphas' baritone and Annas' falsetto counterpoint. Too Much Heaven on Their Minds.  The guy with the froggy voice heckling Christ as he's shuffled between Herod and Pilate. The gorgeous girl in the purple shirt dancer in the Zealot scene...WHO IS SHE?????  Any scene with Judas in it.  The montage of crucifixion scenes. The great guitar all the instrumentation for that matter and something I wish they had MUCH more of in the movie that incredible electric piano.  I would buy just the instrumental track if it was available.".

	schema:headline " Andrew Lloyd Webber's signature piece!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film represents all that Andrew Lloyd Webber is capable of taking an old and complex subject and using a stellar rock score to look at it from a modern perspective. How strange it is that the most powerful epic of Christ's life should turn out to be this rock opera. This is probably because the main characters are expressed in modern terms of thinking. The best aspect of this film may be its portrayal of Judas Iscariot. Many films have tried to find a reason why Judas betrayed his master and mentor for thirty pieces of silver. However all of them have been pretty much making up their own stories Judas wanted to get Jesusto use his powers against the Romans Judas wanted to save his family. Allthese have been just very big guesses. However this film is probably theclosest to the truth about Judas. His reason is a more psychological one. He is simply worried that Jesus' teachings will get him arrested by the Romans and that they will be turned into propaganda like they are today. He is also just doubtful that Jesus is the Messiah wouldn't you be if someone told you? Jesus himself is portrayed as a dedicated spiritual leader and his followers are looked at largely from his and Judas' perspective. The scene with Simon Zealotes with followers throwing themselves at Jesus' feet in the dust is meant to make them look almost pathetically worshipping this man. To Jesus his own Apostles are like children pestering him about what his plans are for the future. Then of course there is the film's portrayal of Mary Magdalene as Jesus' lover. As she rubs ointment on Jesus' feet you can sense the deep passion moving betweenthem. Jesus is human and must therefore love. The priests and pharisees are shown as worried about Jesus' influence fearing it will turn into a revolution and Pontius Pilate is shown as a faithful politician trying to do what is right but pulled away from it by the people demanding Jesus' death. Just the title of this movie is enough to put some people away from it. But the title makes Jesus more modern because probably to people at the time Jesusseemed like just a passing fad. Maybe this was what Jesus thought too. In this respect Jesus may have had doubts about whether he could really make anydifference and if he would be remembered or if his followers were really just hungry for the next big thing. The film's setting in the Israeli ruins gives the film an almost surreal look which is furthered by the design of the film a stark mixture of ancient and modern which is so well done it is sometimes hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. This serves to point out the similarities between then and now. The film's greatest point moves through the score and the cast. Carl Anderson makes Judas almost unplayable by anyone else. Ted Neeley while his voicemay not be perfect has an amazing delivery and brings new depth to Jesuswith his rendition of Gethsemane. Yvonne Elliman is remarkably soulful asMary Magdalene and Bob Bingham's low gravelly bass voice cuts chillinglythrough the more serious scenes helped along by Kurt Yahjigan's falsetto asAnnas. Barry Dennen is a remarkable Pilate and Josh Mostel makes KingHerod the Jewish puppet ruler look remarkably petty and foolish yet funny in his ragtime burlesque style song. The film also contains Andrew Lloyd Webber's richest score especially at the end bringing out the suffering of Jesus. The sound distorts the soldiers laughter mixing with the vultures crying and the cross creaking the hammer pounding in the nails and the rattle of dice as they gamble for Jesus' clothes and the sobbing of Mary Magdalene. Jesus voiceremains normal and his death ends the film making this in my opinion themost powerful and moving and maybe most accurate version of the Passion.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was brought up Catholic and was taught that Jesus was first and foremost..... GOD. Little was ever mentioned about his human nature. He was a God so far above me that as a child I only knew to fear him the omnipotent One. This movie's greatest accomplishment is to show the human side of Christ. It creates an atmosphere that allows you if you try to suspend what you think you know to be true now and imagine yourself living with Christ the man BEFORE he became known as God's only begotten Son.Jesus was a man.  He had friendsfollowers he had women companions he got tired feet got hungry and had to go to sleep at night he was angered and he was doubtful If you deny any of this you are denying the true human nature of Jesus. Understanding this is not sacrilegious.The questions that are asked in the film such as Jesus did you expect it to go this far?  Jesus do you believe you are who they say you are?  are questions that seem foolish to believers today but for the people who knew him personally he WAS just a man. He never claimed to be GOD. It was only after his death that the gospel writers deified him.The garden of Gethsemane scene is one of the most powerful scenes ever put to film.  It is here that we see the true humanness of Jesus. His words of doubt an idea taken from the Gospel of John clearly substantiate Christ's humanness and his doubts about what was to befall him. In the movie Jesus asks God to tell him Why? he must die. It is very moving when seen through the eyes of Jesus the man. For me that was a life changing moment and it brought me to greater understanding of the historical Jesus. I was able to conceive of for the first time Jesus the man. I also realized for the first time that Jesus DID know what it is like to be human. I felt closer to him at that moment than ever before. The lyrics also raise some interesting questions.like Do we get too wrapped up in the man and not the message? This would seem true about all the founders of the world's great religions. They can't all be right Will there always be poor and suffering people?  How DO we love such a man?I think all of the performances were outstanding. I think it has the most powerful musical lyrics ever written and a musical score that fits the drama to a tee. For those people who criticize the performances remember this was never meant to be a movie in the MOVIE sense of the word.  It was a rock opera stage production put on film with expanded scenery  and what a perfect setting it was in order to bring the historical perception of Jesus into even clearer view. Some people think that calling Jesus Christ a Superstar is sacrilegious. Well I can't think of anyone who is more of a superstar in the role of a religious leader than Jesus. The people who think it is sacrilegious to put the bible to rock music well it was the music for the time. Any method that awakens an interest in Jesus Christ as a historical person or as God cannot be bad.Jesus Christ Superstar reclaimed the love for Jesus from many teens that were my age at the time and had fallen away from religion. I think the movie still carries that power if watched from the correct perspective. Anyone who thinks this movie is campy.....Just isn't getting it!".

For me that was a life changing moment and it brought me to greater understanding of the historical Jesus. I was able to conceive of for the first time Jesus the man. I also realized for the first time that Jesus DID know what it is like to be human. I felt closer to him at that moment than ever before. The lyrics also raise some interesting questions.like Do we get too wrapped up in the man and not the message? This would seem true about all the founders of the world's great religions. They can't all be right Will there always be poor and suffering people?  How DO we love such a man?I think all of the performances were outstanding. I think it has the most powerful musical lyrics ever written and a musical score that fits the drama to a tee. For those people who criticize the performances remember this was never meant to be a movie in the MOVIE sense of the word.  It was a rock opera stage production put on film with expanded scenery  and what a perfect setting it was in order to bring the historical perception of Jesus into even clearer view. Some people think that calling Jesus Christ a Superstar is sacrilegious. Well I can't think of anyone who is more of a superstar in the role of a religious leader than Jesus. The people who think it is sacrilegious to put the bible to rock music well it was the music for the time. Any method that awakens an interest in Jesus Christ as a historical person or as God cannot be bad.Jesus Christ Superstar reclaimed the love for Jesus from many teens that were my age at the time and had fallen away from religion. I think the movie still carries that power if watched from the correct perspective. Anyone who thinks this movie is campy.....Just isn't getting it!";

And the one I have watched most times in my life. Now there's some exaggeration in my title as nothing is perfect in this world but this is the one that comes closest. As small flaws I see the out of place icons during the fanfare in Gethsemane and the fact that the movie drags a bit at timesfor. ex. Annas takes too long to arrive to Caiaphas in their first meeting. But all that is vastly compensated by the breathtaking immensity of this cinematographic masterpiece. This is a film that you have to watch at least a dozen times to judge fairly. And each time you may focus on one specific item cinematography settings plot development writing dialogs acting pacing choreography editing soundtrack score musical arrangements lightning vocals metaphors etc. There you got for almost 20 viewings which is about the number I did when it first came out. And once you have finished you'll agree that this is an unique masterpiece one in which every one of those elements perfectly fits the rest as to achieve a flawless wholesome integration of image sound and action on one single piece of artsomething that has probable never been achieved in movies before and most likely will never be again. See for ex. all actors doing great jobs singing their songs while never losing the dramatic intensity the pathos needed for the part.Not one of them drops the ball in this regard !. And it's Anderson the one setting the bar at its highest possible level with Heavens on their Minds. But their flawless performances could have been lost diminished without a perfect contribution by the remaining components specially the cinematographic direction. BTW the recurring zooming on Judas is not an artsy whim but a metaphor indicating he'll be the main subject of the movie by making it appear as if the camera is trying to get him in perfect focus. Metaphors like this one abound in JCS like the tanks the planes or the fact that the actor doing J.C. won't be there at the end etc.Already others have showered enough praises so I'll just focus on the one element they have neglected but without which this wouldn't be much of a classic the camera work. In my AN review I speak of the incredibly dynamic camera during the Playboy show which last only a few minutes after all. In JCS this masterful use of the lenses lasts the entire film. Here the camera doesn't just show us the action it's not a passive observer but becomes part of it. It becomes one of the characters a crucial one following with its own displacements angles zooms fade outs the ups and downs of the story. A character that may become as calm relaxed in some scenesas in Everything's Alright for ex.as tense in othersas in Damned for All Timeor frantic ebullient in othersas in Simon Zealote or in the media circus after J.C.'s arrest. And see how it carries the movie upon itself during the scaffold bits specially the one before Hosanna. Last Supper wouldn't have all its poetic melancholy without those bucolic images of men and goats reflected in the water neither its pathos without the craning camera during its most crucial moment. Or see how it allows us to see Pilate from below as he descends godlike from his stone fortress only to be humbled by J.C.'s silencesee in that scene also the perfect chemistry and harmony between image action and music.As most JCS fans have their own favorites here are several of me. Best cinematography overall Everything's Alright specially concerning lightning color composition camera work  choreography. Most intense dramatic performance Pilate giving up on J.C. and washing his hands. Here Dennon surpasses anything that Neely Anderson could have belted out. Best choreography Simon Zealote. Best solo performance J.C. in the Gethsemane. Best camera work Simon Zealote everything on the scaffold. Most original element Pharisees in scaffold followed by Herod's song. Best lines of dialog J.C. and Judas in Gethsemane. Best song interpretation Judas' Heavens on their Minds. Best group song I've Living to See You. Best Edited segment jump cuts between a white clad Judas singing Superstar and J.C.'s marching with the cross.Enough said. And if I ever have the time in my life to watch one film a hundred times this will be it.".

Also being Jewish and never really studying the life and crucifixion of Jesus I don't have any strong or preconceived spiritual ties to the story.For me then this is a cleverly written and very wellperformed musical that mixes irreverence time juxtapositions and genuine emotions of sadness and wistfulness.  I'm not sure that the movie enhances the great musical in other words now that I've seen the movie I regularly listen to the cd of the musical and enjoy both about equally.  For me Carl Anderson as Judas is the standout but Ted Neeley does bring an angelic quality to the title character.  all of the other supporting roles including Yvonne Elliman are done well.I rate it 810 for its excellent music good staging and for what seems like a faithful filmization of the original..worth watching for sure!".

Judas is seen as the noblest and most knowledgeable of all Christ's disciples who is used by God to accomplish His master plan. The movie makes clear that the legacy of Jesus would not have been possible without the involvement of Judas. Pontius Pilate too is shown in a more positive light than modern Christianity would like. Pilatae is shown as a troubled man who has premonitions of the Jewish King and his own role in his death. In recounting his dream Pilate says that he saw thousands of millions crying for this man and then he heard them mentioning my name and leaving me the blame. As controversial as Superstar is and as wonderful  as the score is it can stand alone on just the merits of its movie making.   The cinematography is tops and the visual effects are magnificent.".

My all time favorite song is Could We start again please because it makes me nearly cry when i hear it. My favorite scenes are the ones with the ..what are they magistrates or we because of there voices.. i swear if i knew anyone whose voice was that whiny andor deep i might just show it off and make fun of it myself. The only parts i really didn't like were the images that they portrayed Jesus in e.g in could we start again Jesus shrugs ...... would Jesus shrug.. heck no also he was so skinny and short and ....not Jesus looking..i mean they must've based it on the fact that he had long hair and a minibeard.. and he could sing. But back to the point. LOVE LOVE LOVE Jesus Christ Superstar. The first time i had ever heard about this moviemusical i swore to myself that i'd never watch it because it sounded sacrilegious to make a rock musical about Jesus' life and to only cover Matthew and John. And my mom told me it was a waste of time so i put off watching it for 2 years and i think that was the worst mistake of my life.. because when i finally watched it i was speechless. Mary Magdelene and Judas Oh my gosh the best singers of the whole thing. My life was so influenced. I recommend that anyone who doubts the Christian religion hates musicals andor is a hypocritical idiot should watch this musical because it can seriously change lives.".

Marshall. I must say that back in the 70s I found personally that THE most fascinatingly charismatic rolesperformances after Ted Neeley's I Only Want to Say were that of High Priest Caiaphas played by Bob Bingham and his perfect adorably slimey cohort Annas played by Kurt Yaghjian. And okay I admit  Anderson Neeley and Bingham and the dude who played Peter just to mention a few of the male cast members have been MOST pleasing to my eyes at every viewing.One note on another user's comment I have always felt that the Israeli Army tanks rolling over the hill chasing Judas into the temple to crank out Damned for All Time represented his inner demons pushing him to begin his terrible bloody crime as opossed to representing the Romans. The Israeli Army jets flying off to So long Judas . . . Poor old Judas . . .  were the release of those demons juxtaposing the ancient with the modern setting the end in motion.This will always be one of my VERY diverse list of top 10 films!".

Ted Neeley as Jesus has an incredible and powerful voice. Carl Anderson as Judas is also great. I'm sure thousands of people are waiting for a better DVD edition than the ones we have. What if they put some old footage like interviews making of deleted scenes etc? As a curiosity the music is slightly different from the CD. It looks the same recording but it's not. You can hear some little differences. Make no mistake this is the real JCS. There are other JCS but this Ted Neeley IS definitely JCS.".

All the previouslyboring religious training I'd endured parochial school suddenly made some kind of sense and my idea of who and what God is was and could be was changed forever!

	schema:headline " the best presentation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes the Academy Awards forgot to list Carl Anderson as one of the lost actors of 2003 but isn't that fitting? Judas isn't recognized as the hero of the story despite giving up more than anyone else in it... he suffers the condemnation for carrying out God's inevitable will in Christian concepts of the story anyway. From a Jewish or Muslim perspective he's just getting a good Rabbi or Prophet crucified and that's probably damnation. The story isn't taking sides on this issue.It is a credible historical presentation despite its rock opera format. It's easily Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work.There's a lot to recommend this hippie version over some later ones.Jewison's decision to use Shakespearelike staging with modern props may be influenced by his exposure to Stratford Ontario's Shakespearean presentations. They're a Southern Ontario institution like himself. It should be said that Jewison's not Jewish he's a Methodist Jewison says people make that mistake a lot. Jewison's deep political empathies play throughout this story which clearly echoes the modern Holy Land  coming as it did in 1973 at the tail end of the IsraeliArab wars and at the height of the New Age reexamination of Jesus as a human being. I think it plays well as an authentic retelling of its time including the highly staged piece at the end where Anderson's voice is featured again. It can't age because it really does say both First Century and hippie era and it does what needs to be done to emphasize what is similar about those times unaccountable authority resisted by people intent on adopting a more peaceful way of life which echoes traditions and morality more ancient than any they can be taught using any ritual.This film belongs on a very short list of those that portray religious lives and sacrifices in an emotionally deep and rigorous way one that doesn't simply present the religious believer as a cartoon to admire wow you're brave  glad I'm not you!. The passion is strongly felt.Because it's specifically a Christian passion it's wholly appropriate that the secular Romans the shallow Herod are presented as uncaring unaware or unwilling to stand up to the scheming Pharisees. The story resembles that of the later Gospels in blaming the Pharisees not the Romans. This is thought by some scholars to reflect the post70AD reality when the Temple was destroyed and Christianity sought converts among Romans not Jews in which circumstances emphasizing the Romans' attempts to find and apply justice and their political inability to stand up to the Pharisees made more sense than painting them as sole villains. Scholars comment often on the Sanhedrin procedures being wholly discarded in Jesus' case and much is made of the trial being held at night and the unanimous condemnation which in proper unanimity minus one Sanhedrin rules is an acquittal for failure to field a proper defense. Webber doesn't make so much of this but the trial is obviously a set up and the Pharisees obviously political players though not wholly unsympathetic they think they are saving their state from a Roman crackdown. Musically the Pharisee's fourpart debate is one of the highlights of the film I'm biased I sang the bass part myself on stage once.But the highlight of the film version is Carl Anderson's solos. Make sure you see this film with a great sound system even if you have to rent it.If you buy the soundtrack the film version soundtrack is the best one.pardon what may be spoilers in the above but if anyone can spoil the Jesus story for you... well OK maybe they can if you've never been exposed to any Christian stories at all if so this is a great way to learn".

Jesus is powerfully portrayed with incredibly insightful lyrics exceptional musical score Andrew Lloyd Weber's masterpiece tremendous vocals and expert acting skill of the cast. In addition to the above plaudits add choreography that not only adds to the emotion and theme of the film but also was skillfully and energetically carried out by a host of quite gifted dancers and singers. Even the setting and the way the film began and ended leads the viewer to feel that the action within the movie and Jesus' actual sufferings and death is an ongoing and an occasion for contemplation and reverence.I thoroughly recommend this presentation. Here I feel I must single out four performers who standout as the best of a nearly perfect cast Judas Simon the Zealot Mary Magdalene and Jesus. Their tonal quality and how they weave the emotion and feeling of the moment into their performance of the musical score can lead the viewer into forget that this is a musical and not a traditional film although the music is beautiful and unforgettable in its' own right.".

	schema:headline " Be aware NOT a Christian work";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people get the wrong idea about Jesus Christ Superstar. It is NOT a Christian work. It is NOT a rahrah Jesus piece. It is NOT in any way attempting to be a simple retelling of the biblical story. If that's what you're looking for you're looking in the wrong place.What it is really is a very agnostic piece. Not atheist but agnostic. It is asking questions not providing answers. And the questions are those of a modern person looking back on the Jesus story and wondering What happened here?The whole question of the divinity of Jesus is kept delicately ambivalent throughout. On the one hand those closest to him those who know him best Mary Magdalene and Judas repeatedly assert that he's just a man. Herod is completely willing to be won over to Jesus if he'll merely perform a miracle or two but Jesus' only reply is seemingly impotent silence. Similarly he refuses to perform any miracles to help the beggars The Temple. Indeed we don't see him perform a single miracle throughout the show.On the other hand many are firmly convinced that he can perform miracles where did they get that idea from? And no explanation is offered for the way that Jesus accurately foretells Peter's triple denial. Most interesting is the song Gethsemane where it certainly feels like Jesus is talking to God or is it just a delusion?.But if Jesus is divine does the story make sense? I think this is hard for believers to see but to those who aren't believing Christians the Jesus story is... shall we say curious. And so we have Jesus Christ Superstar a work from the perspective not of a believer not of a disbeliever but from a questioner. From someone looking at it all and trying to make sense of it.And so at the very climax of the story when Jesus is sentenced to death the whole story freezes and the authors step out from behind the curtain to speak directly to us through the voice of Judas speaking to us from beyond the grave speaking to us today in the modern present. Speaking to us to ask the questions at the root of this opera as if to say Ok here was the story what do you make of it? And so he sings the key lyrics those that embody the entire meaning and message of the productionEvery time I look at you I don't understand why you let the things you did get so out of hand. You'd've managed better if you'd had it planned why'd you choose such a backwards time and such a strange land? If you'd come today you would have reached a whole nation. Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication. I only want to know Jesus Christ who are you? What have you sacrificed? Do you think you're what they say you are?This is it. This is the core. THIS is what the show is about. Not a glorification of Jesus but an inquiry into him. If you're a person of faith there is enough there for you yes. But if you are an unbeliever as am I there's something there for you too. And this is a big reason that Jesus Christ Superstar has always been a personal favorite.And oh yeah about the movie itself... Well I wrote an extensive review of the film itself but sadly this thing is complaining about a 1000 word limit so I just deleted it all. So in a nutshell there are weak points and strong points. Weak points Neely looks the part of Jesus but can't sing at all Caiaphas on the album has a much better bass voice the instrumental tracks are mixed way too soft relative to the vocals and the lyrics have been changed in places to water down the ambivalence and avoid offending Christians HEAL YOURSELVES!. Strong points some added verses and two extra songs that aren't on the original album Oh this is new! Respect for Caesar! the visuals the mixing in of modern markers to help tell the ancient story. And I leave my original final paragraphAnd finally there's the closing shot of Carl Anderson now no longer Judas looking back at the set that they are leaving and peering at the stillstanding cross. His searching questioning expression seems to ask What happened there? and beautifully summarizes the whole opera. Because Jesus Christ Superstar is about questions not answers.".

	schema:headline " The meaning of this movie to me";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout my life many things have inspired me touched me brought tears to my eyes and helped me through hard times. But nothing can be compared to what the movie Jesus Christ Superstar has given me. When I was little say 4 or 5 my parents showed me Jesus Christ Superstar. I loved it from the beginning but until recently I only loved it for the music acting and the way they portrayed Jesus' last days. I cried during the Garden of Gethsemane scene but I didn't know why I got the chills' in just about every other song but didn't understand the meaning of it all. I thought it was so cool that people portraying priests wore funny hats and everyone else wore haltertops and jeans and it was so awesome that the there were machine guns and tanks and airplanes in a time where they obviously didn't have those things. I have so many memories of every time watching it. Showing friends and having them not understand or hate it showing other friends who fell in love with it as well watching it with my grandma she started my mom on her obsession and fastforwarding through the scene where Pontius Pilate has Jesus beaten because it was so bloody and sad.

No I didn't cry until after he realized that what he does is all for the glory of God and he says the ultimate killer lines for me. God thy will is hard. But you hold every card. I will drink your cup of poison nail me to your cross and rape me beat me bleed me kill me take me now before I change my mind.' And even though I can't describe it now or even understand it something clicked in me. As I was reading all the comments for this movie I was realizing that some people didnt like it and apparantly I should be offended by it as a Catholic.  This movie isnt only not offensive to me its what keeps reminding me of my faith keeps me strong and happy. Oh yea the music kicks so much ass too.".

	onyx:emotionText "Throughout my life many things have inspired me touched me brought tears to my eyes and helped me through hard times. But nothing can be compared to what the movie Jesus Christ Superstar has given me. When I was little say 4 or 5 my parents showed me Jesus Christ Superstar. I loved it from the beginning but until recently I only loved it for the music acting and the way they portrayed Jesus' last days. I cried during the Garden of Gethsemane scene but I didn't know why I got the chills' in just about every other song but didn't understand the meaning of it all. I thought it was so cool that people portraying priests wore funny hats and everyone else wore haltertops and jeans and it was so awesome that the there were machine guns and tanks and airplanes in a time where they obviously didn't have those things. I have so many memories of every time watching it. Showing friends and having them not understand or hate it showing other friends who fell in love with it as well watching it with my grandma she started my mom on her obsession and fastforwarding through the scene where Pontius Pilate has Jesus beaten because it was so bloody and sad.

No of course not. This movie takes a very light and novel approach to making a movie about science. Not all the jokes are good. In fact most are pretty bad. But at least most of them are original.

The only explanation I can give for the low rating this movie currently has is that most people simply don't understand the jokes. If you don't know what splitting an atom is and if you don't know that beeratoms are noneexistent then you probably hate this movie. Otherwise it's worth a look.12 out of  stars".

The song played during the credits IceHouse  Great Southern Land is by far one of my all time favorite songs.  I found the soundtrack on Amazon a few years back and i play it regulary. The film itself isn't the greatest but I do enjoy watching the Journey to the Mainland not just for the song but for the amazing camera work and scenery. Yahoo Serious' career never really took off and he's kinda like Carrot Top. You either love him or you hate him.".

The movie is very offbeat but in a good way and very entertaining if you let it be.  I have always loved this movie and the soundtrack is excellent for any 80s music fan.  Serious went downhill with Reckless Kelly which isn't a bad movie in and of itself but got really bad with Mr. Accident.

The talent of Yahoo Serious who starred in and created this movie is awesome.  The scenes and acting are so good that this movie continually evokes the most wonderful memories between repeated viewings. I've seen it maybe 30 times mainly because it's a mustsee video I share with new friends. Although funny this movie isn't goofy. This is a witty script of wonderful downtoearth themes.  The music's great.  The gags are firstrate not only in being unexpected and very interesting but in being wonderfully acted and beautifully photographed.  I don't tire of seeing these gags time after time.  Everyone I've shown this movie to loves it. It's an alltimer one of a kind a classy colorful imaginative gem. Yahoo Serious is awesomely gifted and thankfully for us independent in his creations.  This is NOT a movie hacked out by bored corporate committee members filling in quotas of stupid juvenile formulas.  This isn't a spoof either. It's a unique work of art produced by a young genius who uses for a story line the idea what if Einstein was born on an Australian farm. The real Albert Einstein would have given this imaginative work of art an enthusiastic standing ovation.".

The plot in which the eponymous character transplanted from Germany to Australia Discovers the theory of relativity in the process of making beer and invents rock and roll despite the fact that it's only 1906.  Im sure there was some sort of satire intended when this was written but it was definitely lost in the transition from script to celluloid.  What remains is a series of scenes that almost amount to a narrative some of them funny some definitely not.  The only thing that is consisten is the scope of the production the sets costumes and cinematography are all devastatingly beautiful.  How so much effort and from the looks of things money came to be lavished on a story this ridiculous I will never know.  Despite this I have to applaud the sheer imagination evident in the script which includes Charles Darwin and Marie Curie as major characters nonetheless the elegance and creativity do not compliment the more ridiculous aspects of the film.  It certainly is a weird combination however.".

Albert Einstein is a genius far ahead of his time and his attempts to introduce Rock 'n Roll and electric instruments serve to illustrate that genius is often not only misunderstood but completely unappreciated.  This is in fact one of the major themes of the film  his parents don't understand him the scientist with Marie Currie and her teacher simply don't understand him or his theories. This film's wonderful scenery marvellous sets and fantastic camera work often give the impression of an extremely expensive film.  However this film was anything but!   Yahoo Serious pulled together this hilarious and thought provoking film on a very small budget. I have seen this film dozens of times now on cable and in little art house theatres and it always makes me laugh and gets my spirits a little bit up.

Imagine how glad I am the to find people here who have as much respect and admiration for Mr Serious as I do. There are more moments of original inspired unique hilarious comedy in this film than in just about any other I've seen. The story is both a framework on which a massive heap of great sight gags and comic dialogue are built and also one huge gag in itself. Serious' character performance is superbly charming and funny and the rest of the film is filled with great acting but it's the visuals that impress most it's really quite astounding that such great production values could go into such a nonmainstream film and be used so effectively.  This is a marvelous film that anyone thinking of taking up filmmaking should be forced to check out  it would certainly improve the general standard of movies today. If you've not seen it yet do if you have see it again if you can check out Reckless Kelly too  though not as great as Einstein it's up there and looks just beautiful. Can't wait for the next one.

	schema:reviewBody "Part of the genius of Branagh's interpretation of Hamlet is in the use of the techniques of the cinema to enhance the production. Branagh has not condensed the acts like some mass market soup as was done in Olivier's 1948 Oscarwinning production or in say Zeffirelli's 1989 Hamlet lite starring Mel Gibson both excellent though within their scope but has kept every word while directing our understanding so that even those only casually familiar with the play might follow the intent and purpose with discernment. Recall that for Shakespearethe ultimate actor's playwright who wrote with precious few stage directionsinterpretation was left to the direction and the actors an open invitation that Branagh rightly accepts.The use of flashback scenes of things implied such as the amorous union of Ophelia and her Lord Hamlet abed or of a vast expanse of snow darkened with distant soldiers to represent the threat of Fortinbras' army from without and especially the vivid remembrance in the mind's eye of the new king's dastardly deed of murder most foul helps us all to more keenly appreciate just what it is that torments Hamlet's soul. I also liked the intense closeups. How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.Branagh's ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation. A play is to divert to entertain to allow us to identify with others who trials and tribulations are so like our own. And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience and only then by happenstance and indirection to inspire and to inform. Shakespeare did this unconsciously we might say. He wrote for the popular audience of his time a broad audience it should be noted that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars and he reached them one and all. We are much removed from those times and yet this play this singular achievement in theatre still has the power to transcend mere entertainment to fuse poetry and story as well as the high and the low and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.Branagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet perhaps a bit of a ham at times as I think was Shakespeare's intent a prince who is the friend of itinerant players. He also lacks somewhat in statute as we conceive our great heroes nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince's torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father's murder speaks strongly to us all. Branagh more than any other Hamlet makes us understand the distracted anguished and tortured prince and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions wild and crazy as they sometimes are but to an identification and an understanding of why the eternal query Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action. In Branagh's production this old quibble with Hamlet's character dissolves itself into a dew and we realize that he was acting strongly purposely all the while. He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.I was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi's Claudius. One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude and he was an excellent Hamlet although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence. His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below as is the way of villains everywhere.Kate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia lending an unusual strength to the role strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role but with the poor sweet girl's vulnerability intact. She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellish the production.Richard Briers as Polonius proves that that officious fool is indeed that and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king. The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.Julie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen. In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son but to us all and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul. She is outstanding.The bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good. I liked Charlton Heston's player king although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect and Billy Crystal's gravedigger was finely etched. Only Jack Lemon's Marcellus really disappointed but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role. Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.The idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well but I know not why. Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way. And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare's play.There is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production. It is all things considered one of the best Hamlets ever done. Perhaps it is the best. See it by all means see it for yourself.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film immensely when it came out going to it five times while it was still in theatres. A much better way to spend an evening than watching the retread scifi thriller material out at the time.I have to admit though that after seeing it again a few times on video it doesn't have the same attraction for me that it originally did. As film it's solid. The settings are wonderful and I admire the desire to produce the entire play unedited.I don't enjoy the acting as much as I first did. In the case of Branagh that may be merely a matter of personal taste. I would prefer a less garrulous Hamlet. Obviously since all actors of Hamlet are working from the same script unless edited this is dependent entirely on the manner in which they portray the character. I find Branagh's performance a bit cloying and far too over the top in some cases.In addition some of the cameos are distracting. Heston and Crystal I enjoy but Williams and particularly Lemmon are annoying. The others Attenborough et al are fine.While I can't give Hamlet a wholehearted recommendation I have to say that it far surpasses the trite commercialism of all the new greatest films of all time which have come out over the last few years. That's a phrase being used far too often now revealing a lack of familiarity with the great films of the past. In that sense I admire Mr. Branagh's desire to bring great drama to the screen and hope that he meets with continued success in the future.".

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoyed this film immensely when it came out going to it five times while it was still in theatres. A much better way to spend an evening than watching the retread scifi thriller material out at the time.I have to admit though that after seeing it again a few times on video it doesn't have the same attraction for me that it originally did. As film it's solid. The settings are wonderful and I admire the desire to produce the entire play unedited.I don't enjoy the acting as much as I first did. In the case of Branagh that may be merely a matter of personal taste. I would prefer a less garrulous Hamlet. Obviously since all actors of Hamlet are working from the same script unless edited this is dependent entirely on the manner in which they portray the character. I find Branagh's performance a bit cloying and far too over the top in some cases.In addition some of the cameos are distracting. Heston and Crystal I enjoy but Williams and particularly Lemmon are annoying. The others Attenborough et al are fine.While I can't give Hamlet a wholehearted recommendation I have to say that it far surpasses the trite commercialism of all the new greatest films of all time which have come out over the last few years. That's a phrase being used far too often now revealing a lack of familiarity with the great films of the past. In that sense I admire Mr. Branagh's desire to bring great drama to the screen and hope that he meets with continued success in the future.";

It helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the text.One of the things I have heard criticized many times is the casting of major Hollywood names in the play. I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare.Also his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. Such as how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. All in all not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one does not have to be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized! This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play but Branagh didn't do it just because it was there. His intention I believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain.The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when you're watching a fourhour movie. Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of 'Hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels battles etc. this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actorwriterdirectors if not always the best since he made his big splash with 'Henry V.' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work. Let's face it 'Hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if they've read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.There are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers Nicholas Farrell Michael Maloney and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie Charlton Heston and Robin Williams who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn't inexplicably is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist.Not to be facetious when speaking of a fourhour movie but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if I may be so bold and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.Did I forget anything other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.".

But in making the translation to film the artist has two challenges.The first concerns the work as drama. This is Shakespeare's most ambitious vision one he tinkered with and enlarged both conceptually and literally. The purest choice the only choice which can encompass the full weave of the work is to include everything  and that's what Branagh has done. Consequently this work has extra dimensions of life. In doing so he's included some nice touchesgone are superficial hints of motherlust in the closet scene. These were never in the text.we are reminded that Hamlet's initial and sustaining anger is because his uncle jumped into the line of successionwe see the hints that Hamlet was a student of Bruno in the book on witchcraft he consults after seeing the ghost. Also his book on matters' often thought to be Bruno's is actually given to Ophelia. Nice. Shows deep research.Polonius is treated humanely as more than a dottering fool. This makes Ophelia's loss and earlier obedience believable.The second challenge is cinematic. The play was written for sparse settings it translates naturally to audio tape and unnaturally to film. So the filmmaker has an open palette. Branagh makes some interesting choices. Many work extremely well in particular the mirrors in the to be' and Ophelia sequence. Others are strangehe introduces recognizable actors in secondary roles to jar us into the realization that this is a play. One of these is really funny. How do you portray an actor among actors playing nonactors. Well you get a noticeably BAD actor. I wonder if Heston knows he'll be goofed on for this for many decades as this film outlives his sandled perorations.he introduces some almost satirical film reflections a cheesy ghost an Errol Flynn chandelier swing...he provides visual overlays for some of the images implied in the text Hamlet's lovemaking considerations in Norway reflections of the players. This ruins a few of the important ambiguities but we do have a wealth to spend after all.in perhaps the worst loss of ambiguity he makes Fortinbras an invader. This is done only to allow for some cinematic sweep at the end. Okay I'll reluctantly buy it since the alternative is extended mugging in the death scenes.I think Branagh and collaborators meet the first challenge nearly perfectly. As to the second challenge this is our very best film version in part because of extending the US tradition of playing the characters as real people versus the UK tradition of characters as speechifiers. So far as the cinematic challenge there are some great really great visions here but there are also some big cinematic misses which keeps this far from perfect. Until Greenaway attempts it this is the best film Hamlet we have and that simply makes it one of the best most rewarding films ever. I'll bet Branagh tries again before he dies.".

However I watched and much to my disturbance found myself not only paying attention but actually enjoying the movie too. This production of Hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies I have seen in a long time and it really brings to life what I expect Shakespeare wanted his plays to be like well with the difference that this is cinema much better than my English teacher harking over the text ever possibly could. The story is good the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring though a little hard to keep up with if you aren't used to Shakespeare's language and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you wouldn't expect mainly perhaps due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has. Brian Blessed and Charlton Heston are as great as you'd expect these two veterans to be even in such small parts but it is Robin Williams as Osric and Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger who really stand out giving such minor parts an unexpected zest as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy.The main stars of course are also wonderful. Kenneth Branagh excels as Hamlet bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes making the movie as a whole much more watchable. The other major players are also good but it is Kenneth Branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role.The set pieces too are often quite stunning giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we're used to seeing in Shakespeare productions as well as a real sense of the country around them.Of course the movie taken as a movie in its own right is not without faults but no major ones the pacing is the only real problem I can think of offhand as well as the prose for anyone not used to as I said Shakesperean language and especially when compared to the sort of Shakespeare productions I'm used to seeing in class it really is quite brilliant. It's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on Shakespeare that his plays are boring I came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring merely the teachers who recite them in class. If only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one English students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the Bard.Overall 710".

And Charlton Heston too but I wasn't sure if he was playing at being a hack. A lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks.What I think speaks very much in this play's favor is that it is accessible. Shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try because of its reputation as Serious Literature and its archaic English. If they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man's interpretation of the play. They will be seeing it more as Shakespeare's audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles and mighty kings and nobles murder and incest and evil schemes and ghostsand great art if one cares to look for it but in Shakespeare's day most didn't any more than most people do now. Branagh's overacting and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer may detract from Shakespeare's art somewhat but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it rather than nothing.I've got to say one more thing though. Some people are complaining that it's set in the 19th century and that wasn't Shakespeare's time. Well in Shakespeare's time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays. Shakespeare may have SAID it's in the days of ancient Rome or medieval Denmark or whatever but he didn't dress his characters up like they were he used the costumes of his own time. For the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms. For example in King John the English and French have cannonsin Robin Hood's day. In Julius Caesar they talk of chimneys which wouldn't be invented for another thousand years and in Henry IV they talk about Machiavelli who wasn't even born yet then. So I think this objection is sillyyou might as well complain that the play isn't in Danish after all they live in Denmark don't they?.".

What else could explain the movie's excessive length its lavish opulence and its absurd number of torso shots?  Why else would Branagh ask Gerard Depardieu one of the greatest living French actors to speak only five lines of text none of them memorable?  Why else would he get Judi Dench to play a role that doesn't even appear in Shakespeare's text?  Why miscast Jack Lemmon in a role that would have been played more effectively by a much younger actor?

Branagh's Hamlet is aggressive moody brilliant robustmore appealing than Olivier's brooding dreamer.  The larger roles are all played admirably particularly Jacobi's charismatic Claudius.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on its release and have watched it 3 or 4 more times including last week. I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. Branagh's performance.This is really a glorious sumptuous film to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long  beautifully shot and designed. Derek Jacobi Julie Christie Kate Winslet Richard Briers and many others do fine jobs. Then there's Kenneth Branagh. If ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and Mr. Branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in Hamlet. From the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. His performance confirms that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never been a great film actor. The scenery budget could be charged to catering Mr. Branagh eats so much of it. His performance is a perfect example of why people don't go to see Shakespeare  full of sound and fury signifying nothing. And if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard he was after all is said and done a playwright. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of Hamlet itself. It amazes me how Mr. Branagh mouthed it but did not hear it. It was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something and too little figuring out WHAT he's saying.While Mr. Branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. His direction has always been better than his acting. I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare. He set a great template for other productions. And it would be interesting to see him onstage from about 20 rows back. But I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.Is it worth seeing? Certainly. There are many little joys to be found in the film. But it's a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it.".

	schema:headline " Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet";
	schema:reviewBody "This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of Hamlet to ever reach the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco who shouts the very unShakespearean cry of ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack before being gunned down and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the How All Occasions Inform Against Me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film at least that's how it feels which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's I'll never be hungry again. This may serve Branagh's ego but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech when I saw the film in the theater I leaned over to my companion and snickered Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet. Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last when he attempts to outdo the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch impaling him with a sword. Branagh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so offthewall funny.While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy it is in fact nothing but a starstudded display of a oncetalented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece Hamlet 1996 a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written on the last movie besides The Master filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father who request the he kills his uncle the new king of Denmark because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors Charlton Heston Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes same with the music.The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation better than the Mel Gibson one and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time check it out. 810".

I was amazed in checking that Branagh was just thirtysix when the movie was made he looks considerably older too old to be Hamlet. The photography is straightforward and the setting into an actual Danish royal palace is clumsy and grinding.By no means the sex scenes between Hamlet and Ophelia could be forgiven.

The acting is extremely strong With a cast that features Kenneth Branagh Robin Williams and Billy Crystal how can you lose? and the change in time period Looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800's plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the Shakespearean play will get chills from.

	schema:reviewBody "The redeeming quality to this version of Hamlet in my eyesis the fact that it stays true to the original length and order of the play by Shakespeare. More filmmakers should try this especially with Shakespeare who is one of the obvious geniuses of the millennium. It would make sense since Branagh supposedly cares about staying true to the original to set it in the time it was meant to be set in NOT the Victorian era which Shakespeare never even saw.  It is garish and much too bright especially when the overacting and needless action is added. The dialogue should take center stage in many scenes especially the last one.Because of this I prefer both the Laurence Olivier and the Zeffirelli version of Hamlet which takes advantage of dark and spare castle rooms and the countryside where Ophelia spends her last hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play.What we get from this longer version the first in which not a single line has been trimmed is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness.We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality.I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sisterinlaw Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more.Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors some of which are passageways leads to one of the most original scenes  Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet  a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite bucktoothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a closeup and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buckteeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home.Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery.I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.".

Branagh's previous successes had come with narrow release art house movies which gradually built up an audience through the wordofmouth of opinion formers who saw them early on. But to release a four and a half hour version of Hamlet in 70mm meant that only the biggest cinemas could take the movie and in the multiplexes it came out against Independence Day and Mission Impossible2. The art house audience were never going to fill the huge cinemas required for the 70mm.

It's no mean feat that he managed to do this in a way that truly makes the material seem cinematic without losing any of the essence of the work as it was originally created.Although most films don't have anywhere near the amount of dialogue that Hamlet does the film doesn't suffer as much as it could have from an overabundance of words. The film is full of sumptuous visuals particularly in the multitude of interior shots of the castle which called to mind the elegant interiors of Luchino Visconti's classic film The Leopard. It's true that the images might have been even more powerful if they had been allowed time to sink in without the distraction of the dialogue but Branagh as a director does an excellent job of pacing the shots to get the best effect. Another way that he manages to avoid the pitfall of staginess is through judicious editing particularly with the use of brief flashbacks to represent Hamlet's memories in one key scene. Between the great lines by Shakespeare and the great images by Branagh this film's four hour runtime fairly whizzed by.Although Branagh was a bit older than I imagine Hamlet to be he still manages to pull off his eponymous role quite well. The supporting cast is also good particularly Billy Crystal in a brief but memorable role as a wisecracking gravedigger. Cameos by Jack Lemmon Gerard Depardieu Charlton Heston and Robin Williams are also successful to varying degrees but welcome nonetheless as they tend to add some much needed levity to the seriously tragic proceedings.I don't think this is the space to attempt to get into thematic material of Shakespeare's work but I will say that there really isn't much that has been lost in the adaptation process. Not only does this help enrich studies of the original text it also is as successful in its own right as any straightforward Shakespeare adaptation I've seen. There's really very little to quibble about in this excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Hamlet' has never looked finer. Bragnagh has brought the most out of Shakespeare's most beloved play. We truly get the complete story brought out in grand scale. The cast is probably the finest a Shakesparean film has ever received. The sets and camera work are epic in every sense of the word. However I feel Bragnagh's 'Hamlet' falls short of truly being a masterpiece. I really truly wonder if 'Hamlet' cries out to be an epic. It is a psychological drama and a character study. At the worst moments of Bragnagh's opus this is forgotten.I really don't know if I consider 'Hamlet' to be the greatest Shakespearean play. In terms of plot it is somewhat anticlimatic. I do however think that Hamlet is the greatest character I've ever read. To read Hamlet is like dissecting the psyche. Shakespeare's monologues and soliloquies in 'Hamlet' are brilliant dissections of the soul. If anything I want 'Hamlet' to be smaller and more intimate for a greater appreciation of this brilliant character and Shakespeare's language. Bragnagh's film sometimes looses sight of this. While I respect Bragnagh's ambition I somewhat don't understand why the epic scope is so necessary.

	onyx:emotionText "'Hamlet' has never looked finer. Bragnagh has brought the most out of Shakespeare's most beloved play. We truly get the complete story brought out in grand scale. The cast is probably the finest a Shakesparean film has ever received. The sets and camera work are epic in every sense of the word. However I feel Bragnagh's 'Hamlet' falls short of truly being a masterpiece. I really truly wonder if 'Hamlet' cries out to be an epic. It is a psychological drama and a character study. At the worst moments of Bragnagh's opus this is forgotten.I really don't know if I consider 'Hamlet' to be the greatest Shakespearean play. In terms of plot it is somewhat anticlimatic. I do however think that Hamlet is the greatest character I've ever read. To read Hamlet is like dissecting the psyche. Shakespeare's monologues and soliloquies in 'Hamlet' are brilliant dissections of the soul. If anything I want 'Hamlet' to be smaller and more intimate for a greater appreciation of this brilliant character and Shakespeare's language. Bragnagh's film sometimes looses sight of this. While I respect Bragnagh's ambition I somewhat don't understand why the epic scope is so necessary. There are brilliant shots of the Mountains and charges of soldiers but really what have they to do with Hamlet's inner turmoil? The film is at it's best when it is smaller.

In the meantime Larkin who is under surveillance is kidnapped thwarting Brannigan's plans for a quick extradition and embarassing Swann who has just berated Brannigan for losing Larkin in the first place and assuring him  It can't happen here. To Swann's obvious displeasure Brannigan decides to stick around and help Scotland Yard find Larkin even though he and Swann have a prickly relationship at best and disapprove of each other's police methodsi.e. Brannigan is a conservative who carries a gun and believes in the use of force and Swann a liberal who doesn't believe in either.  Brannigan also spends a great deal of the film dodging a hit man whom Larkin hired prior to his kidnapping.What follows is an amusing and lowkey caper that is culminated by a wellchoreographed chase through the streets of London a hilarious bar brawl and several attacks by the hit man including one in which Jenny is almost killed.  Wayne is in fine form here wellserved by the change of locales and by his character who unlike McQ is closer to his own age and not as much of a Dirty Harryclone.  The film is also marked by a much lighter tone than his previous outing and unlike his uncomfortable pairing with McQ's Eddie Albert he and Attenborough make a memorable team and have several terrific scenes together.  A warning howevercompaired with today's myriad of overthetop action films like XXX and every Lethal Weapon wannabe of the past fifteen years Brannigan is pretty subdued and the action scenes will seem tame to today's thrillseeking action audience.

I grew up with the crime dramas of the 1970s had little patience for Westerns and am sorry John Wayne had so little time left to make detective movies. His other police drama McQ was trying so hard to imitate other gritty characters and films was so formulaic artificial confusing dreary stiff heavyhanded and clich that these elements crowded out Wayne. Not so Brannigan.Wayne shined. He was natural and utterly comfortable and convincing in the role. He was likable frank goodnatured decent downtoearth and tough  so damn solid as Geeson's character put it to which he replied Fat you mean in a nice genuine scene where Brannigan talked about wanting to catch the hood responsible for killing his rookie partner because it was his duty to protect the kid even though no matter how nice a story it would make if the kid had been like a son to him he had not even liked the smartaleck kid. Wayne had terrific commanding screen presence. He looked as fit and acted as vigorous as called for by the role. Suggestions in other reviews that he was too old or too fat are nonsense. The mature cast is a pleasant contrast to today's rampant superficiality.All of the supporting actors  Attenborough Geeson Ferrer Vernon Pilon  were real professionals who similarly brought substance to their roles and played them smoothly and effectively. The characters were nicely sketched. For example Attenborough's titled Scotland Yard official was not a caricatured fop or dandy he was polished but also appreciated rough direct action to get the job done which created a nice grudging rapport between him and Brannigan. One review's dismissal of Pilon's hitman as Inspector Clouseau is absurd both the policeman and the hitman were portrayed effectively in this movie with the policeman actually outsmarting and outmaneuvering the hitman in believable ways. The story had action energy purpose and humor. The dialogue was smart and the plot interesting with some clever touches. The photography and music made it all the more enjoyable.This is a fun smart wellpaced wellproduced detective story with a good plot welldrawn and wellcast characters and good locations. The movie is excellent entertainment. As such I could not recommend it more highly. Reviewers who apparently failed to watch the film on its own merits and have nothing to offer but pseudosophisticated overly general cheapshot criticisms do not do it justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Brannigan' is a fairly routine thriller which doubles up as an advertising feature for American tourists wishing to visit London.  In both cases it does the job pretty well.  What gives it a boost is the strong supporting cast headed by leading British 'luvvie' Richard Dickie Attenborough and the good use of London locations including Tower Bridge which is utilised in an above average car chase.  Also there is a largescale brawl in a city pub  in Leadenhall Market which is a direct transfer from a saloon of one of the Duke's innumerable westerns.Tough Chicago cop Jim Brannigan is sent to London to extradite notorious American gangster Ben Larkin but before he can collect him Larkin is kidnapped and Brannigan spends the rest of his time chasing around London in search of his quarry. Whilst struggling to adapt to the British way of life and the restrained style of policing he employs techniques not usually seen outside Chicago.  In the meantime a contract has been put out on Brannigan's life by Larkin to prevent him from being extradited.Though menouvring his way around London like a big vintage Cadillac John Wayne lends his unique blend of charm and charisma and inevitably he is given most of the best lines in what is a lively screenplay.  For instance there is nothing he likes better than to smash down villains' front doors and bellow defiantly Knock! Knock!.  This is vintage John Wayne and there is no harm in this as he was very good at what he did and as a consequence he has a devoted following of movie fans around the world.Richard Attenborough gives sterling support as the on the surfacestuffy upperclass Metroplitan Police Commander not afraid to get his hands dirty . Though with characters as different as chalk and cheese on and off the screen there is clearly a good rapport between Wayne and Attenborough. There is continual conflict on screen about Brannigans retention and use of his handgun.  One of the best moments is when an increasingly hysterical Attenborough demands I've asked you politely now I'm asking you impolitely HAND OVER THE GUN!Of the rest of the cast pretty Judy Geeson is good decoration though underused. Her main purpose appears to be to ferry Brannigan around London and to scream Look out Jim! everytime the contract killer draws close. John Vernon as Larkin demonstrates why he was the 'heavy' of choice throughout the 1970's and Mel Ferrer is suitably slimy as his lawyer. James Booth Brian Glover and Don Henderson are all good as London thugs.  Tony Robinson has a small comedic role as an innocent dupe of a dispatch rider thrown into the Thames by Brannigan long before he became Baldric in the longrunning British tv series of Blackadder.  Look out too for an appearance by Tony Blair's fatherinlaw Tony Booth as a small time con given the 'good copbad cop' treatment.Humorous though a little bloody 'Brannigan' is good entertainment and if you are a fan of the Duke it is well worth adding the DVD to your collection.  My only gripe is that the movie was the inpsiration behind the godawful 1980's tv seires 'Dempsey and Makepeace'.  Forget this and you will enjoy it.".

And also in common with Sitting Target the direction papers over a somewhat deficient script. Great performances from John Wayne as Brannigan and Richard Attenbrough as the commander of Scotland Yard frustrated at the former's police methods which seem unorthodox by British standards. Judy Geeson is good as Detective Sgt Thatcher who is assigned to keep Brannigan out of trouble while Daniel Pilon is superb as the contract killer out for Brannigan's blood. The film is an obvious rip off of Dirty Harry 1971which Wayne regretted turning down after he saw that movie.".

	schema:headline " Trodding the Path of Eastwood";
	schema:reviewBody "By the mid 1970s the western film had really become a thing of the past. The action heroes by that time were police of all different kinds of character. Clint Eastwood had sure proved that with the success of the Dirty Harry Films. In fact by the time Brannigan came out Eastwood had two of them already done.I suspect that John Wayne was also looking for modern stories for reasons of health. Those western locations were and are pretty rugged. Wayne was 68 when this was done and playing a man in his fifties. He also had only one working lung in those last dozens years of work after the cancer operation of 1964.So in Brannigan Wayne makes a more successful transition from his western character to a modern policeman than he did in McQ. He's from the Chicago PD and in London to pick up gangster John Vernon who's skipped bail. An assignment that the San Francisco PD surely would have sent Harry Callahan on.Vernon is not only not in custody with Scotland Yard but he's been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Vernon's lawyer Mel Ferrer arrives from Chicago to pay the ransom.It's a merry chase from then on and while the ending is no kind of surprise the film is a lot of fun.Richard Attenborough makes an effective British foil for Wayne's all American hero. And Judy Geeson who first became noticed by movie fans as a student in Sidney Poitier's class in Two Sir With Love plays Wayne's driver and confidante as a police sergeant. The two of them have a marvelous fatherdaughter like chemistry.Wayne films are not complete unless there is a fight scene. In this case a London pub is busted up like a frontier saloon in a scene reminiscent of The War Wagon. It's sort of out of place though in a modern film.And the climax is a homage to Dirty Harry. Dare I say it but I'm still wondering why Eastwood's Malpaso Productions didn't sue the Duke's Batjac company for that scene which is ripped off from Magnum Force.Probably because Clint liked the homage.".

	schema:headline " Overlooked John Wayne gem.";
	schema:reviewBody "Brannigan represented John Wayne's second and final movie in which he plays a contemporary streetwise detective.The film involves him travelling to London to extradite a mob boss called Ben Larkin played by John Vernon upon arriving in London Brannigan discovers that Larkin has been kidnapped whilst under surveillance from Scotland Yard. The remainder of the movie follows Brannigan in conjunction with Scotland Yard headed by Commander Swan and their attempts to locate Larkin and bring him to justice.Brannigan is rather a good movie in which John Wayne exercises his enormous charisma and charm on screen to great effect. The movie is somewhat more lighthearted than Dukes previous cop movie 'McQ' however it still manages to deliver some rather dramatic moments such as the kidnapping scene and Brannigan's ongoing battle with a persistent hitman.Brannigan is faced with the problem of being continually compared to Clint Eastwood's detective movies and most comparisons made usually look unfavourably upon Brannigan which is unjust. Whilst Eastwood's 'Dirty Harry' movie is undeniably a better movie than Brannigan a strong argument can be made that Brannigan is superior to all sequels to this movie as well as 'Coogans Bluff' and 'The Gauntlet'. Several of these movies are clearly lacking in ideas and some of them have a cheapness about them 'The Enforcer' and 'The Dead Pool' spring to mind within this category. However they do have an undeniable appeal and are generally enjoyable movies they are certainly not cinematic masterpieces and many are living on the reputation of 'Dirty Harry'.Brannigan also fares better than 'McQ' due to the cinematography being fresher and more fluent better acting directing and stronger characters these factors all combine to create a better overall movie. However the movie does have its weaknesses such as an overdrawn money switchover that results in Duke pushing a young Tony Robinson into the Thames. The movie also suffers from some poor editing within it particularly prevalent during the opening sequences involving a police car tracking Brannigan while the opening credits are being screened the scene becomes too long and ineffectual. However these weaknesses do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.One of the best aspects of movie is the culture clash between America and the UK John Wayne and Richard Attenborough act as a microcosm of this clash with each trying to impose their methods upon the other. Brannigan's insistence on using physical force during the investigation contrasts with Attenborough's analytical and methodical approach to detective work. In fact the on screen pairing of both Duke and Attenborough was a stroke of genius as the two men play of each other very well their scenes are well written and there's an undeniable energy and excitement these scenes.Brannigan will never be remembered as one of John Wayne's best movies which is perhaps accurate however it is also not remembered as a good movie which is completely unfair it has some great scenes interesting characters and a good storyline it certainly deserves a much better reputation than it currently has.".

Along the way  Branningan is helped by two British Police Inspectors  Cmdr. Swann Richard Attenborough and Jennifer Judy Geeson . Nice and agreeable thriller with a great cast and a sensational John Wayne against his nemesis magnificently played by John Vernon in one of his meatiest roles as a villain who has fled the States rather than face a grand jury indictment . Humor  noisy action  thrills and suspense abound in this fun film . One of Duke's last movies with a more work modern day assignment than most  here he stars in the somewhat unfamiliar character of a twofisted and violent Chicago police officer in Dirty Harry style . Stepping out of his ordinary Westerns and into the character of a tough police man  Big Duke goes in search of revenge on the mobster who killed his rookie colleague . John Wayne starred in this film  along with McQ  because he missed out on starring in Dirty Harry 1971 . Although  it was originally intended as a vehicle for Steve McQueen  it was heavily rewritten for John Wayne . Here Wayne fits perfectly to this peculiar role  giving a topnotch and sympathetic acting  as usual . Wayne's image still remained impervious during the seventies surviving through an overlong career . Wayne unmistakeably a legendary figure of the West and by that time he would go playing good Westerns  as he triumphantly survived his own era with titles as True grit in which he won an Academy Award Big Jake Train robbers  The cowboys  Rooster Cogburn  his last film The Shootist and  of course  his two final thrillers  McQ and Brannigan . Even more oldfashioned that Wayne's former police drama McQhere playing a Chigago Police cop  Brannigan is also more amusing and entertaining . It rambles a bit  but then it does have full of suspense  intrigue and action . In Brannigan there are also brawls and punches at a typical London pub . Along with spectacular car races  bounds and leaps across Tower Bridge . Stirring film in which there are nailbiting action scenes  intrigue  blasts  suspenseful set pieces and a big star as well as an excellent plethora of secondaries such as  Judy Geeson  Richard Attenborough  Mel Ferrer  Ralph Meeker  Daniel Pilon  James Booth  Bruce Glover and brief acting by Lesley Anne Down as a prostitute . It packs a colorful cinematography by Gerry Fisher  showing splendidly the habitual London sightseeing  Big Ben  Parliament  Trafalgar Square  Regency Street  Buckingham Palace  Piccadilly Circus  Tower Bridge  among others . Besides a moving as well as exciting musical score by Dominic Frontiere . This tough crime drama was well directed by Douglas Hickock who was quoted at the time as saying that he just wanted to make a John Wayne film .

Face it Marion Morrison always played the character named John Wayne in everything he did. People loved that. They loved him. It's plain to see but I laughed out loud quite a few times in this police story of murder and mayhem in Jolly old England. Lt.

In the middle of a club in London and he is asking for Pancakes and bacon with eggs. What shame hath he none? Might he embarrass himself in front of the Queen's subject's? Nonsense! Here is a bull in a china shop. The original roughrider and with him a dedicated great casting of characters. John Vernon is irreplaceable as Mr.big! The quintessential gangster his voice is booming and he is definitely outspoken. Big bad Ben Larkin the one that J.B. wants to lock up or put under! I especially enjoyed even the little things i.e. when they decided to walk instead of ride and talked their business in the street heading through the park. The camera work etc. John Gorman is a Erie great addition to the cast as the hitman. Scary numb looking gentlemen. The story gets even more interesting with the partnering up of Det. Sgt. Thatcher 'Jenny' as Brannigan refers to her. American brevity. I especially enjoyed that she 'kissed' him at the dinner table when he admitted that he had made a mistake with a rookie. Then she said when asked why ' You're just so darn solid.' Fat you mean. He chuckles. From the question of Cmdr Swann when asked about describing an opinion of Jim Brannigan answers Well he's an American. to the bar room setup and brawl and the chase through the streets past Market Square and over Tower Bridge!! Brannigan especially loves 'Knock knock' jokes the punch line kicking down the front door! Then informed Ben Larkin that he could reach for his gun if he wanted to sing Soprano! I love it. The music in this for a Wayne film was in fact absolutely capitol it should have won an award. The film has intense Wayne action! The story and acting are just what they should be a seventies classic that can be enjoyed by John Wayne fans again and again!!I recommend to the discriminating Wayne fan that likes a taste of adventure mixed into the storyline.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has less depth than Paris Hilton. It's basically a very old John Wayne going to Britain and kicking butt just the same way he's done it in dozens of previous films. BUT on that level it is a very good and enjoyable film. In particular the film had wonderful Dirty Harrylike lines and a dark sense of humor. In fact I half expected him to say make my dayit was so much like an Eastwood film. And the film was much better than Wayne's previous attempt to knock off Dirty Harry in MCQ. So provided you can also turn off all sense of disbelief after all Wayne was WAY TOO OLD FOR THE PART you can enjoy it much the same way you'd enjoy one of his older flicks such as THE FLYING TIGERS or THE FIGHTING SEA BEES. In other words this is a 70s version of an old Republic Pictures action filmwith a few updates to reflect the times such as Wayne being saddled with a dame for a partner. Overall if you hate John Wayne films then I'm sure you'll hate this one and if you like him this film won't disappoint. It's just good oldfashioned fun!By the way according to Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies John Wayne was offered the role of Dirty Harry BEFORE it was given to Eastwood! You could tell Wayne wished he had taken the part since he soon went on to make his own variations on the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a spate of tired westerns and unmemorable cop programmers like McQ John Wayne was in need of something a little fresh. Brannigan doesn't have much in its plot that we haven't seen before but it is freshened up by its unusual London setting. Nicely directed by Douglas Hickox and complemented by lots of good supporting performances it is also entertaining in patches.Chicago cop and allround hard man Jim Brannigan John Wayne is ordered to fly out to London England to bring back bailskipping gangster Ben Larkin John Vernon. But just as Brannigan arrives Larkin is abducted by a bunch of British crooks who plan to hold him for a hefty ransom. Aided by stifflipped Scotland Yard detective Charles Swann Richard Attenborough Brannigan attempts to track down the kidnappers so that he can get hold of his man.Wayne looks pretty old for this kind of energetic action stuff but he has a certain rugged charisma that allows him to moreorless get away with it. The supporting cast is generally very good  Attenborough registers well as the Scotland Yard detective Judy Geeson looks lovely and has a good role as the lady assigned to look after Brannigan during his stay Vernon adds another unpleasant bad guy to his villains' gallery and littleknown Daniel Pilon has the best scenes in the film as a genuinely evil hitman assigned to erase Brannigan. The music scored by Dominic Frontiere is hilariously '70s and is poured over the action with little consideration. There are also some unnecessary comic moments such as the needlessly farcical barroom brawl sequence which is out of tune with the rest of the film Maltin preposterously called the barroom brawl the high spot of the film but if anything it's the low point. At its worst Brannigan stoops pretty low but these low moments are gladly quite sporadic. For most of the way it's an entertaining  if never truly excellent  star vehicle and a genuinely different role for The Duke.".

All of them get their comeuppance in a script that has quite a few surprises and plot twists along the way. JUDY GEESON has a nice rapport with Wayne as the woman assigned to drive him around the city.Nicely photographed with good shots of the busy London area it's not one of Wayne's best films but it's a very satisfying one with a good plot and a fair amount of action.

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne is probably one of the best actors ever to star in a film acting in over 140 films. I'm glad this gem brings the duke to my home UK!Yes this is my review of 3rd last film Brinnigan The plot goes like this A US cop arrives in London on a mission to hunt down an American delinquent that escaped justice. Although he partners with Scotland yard and in required to follow British Laws Brannigan takes the law into his own hands occasionally putting himself and his colleagues at risk.This is John Wayne's second crime thriller. His first was a film called McQ which he acted in a year earlier. Although the film was great this film surpasses it in a number of levels.Firstly there is a lot more action. Most of them are great shootouts but there are 2 scenes that really stood out for me. The first would be a huge fistfight that starts in a tavern that will leave you aching with laughter. It's slapstick gold with chairs and people flying in all directions. The second scene that really stood out for me was the car chase. In this scene Brannian hijacks a public Vehicle and follows a criminal in hot pursuit. They speed pass traffic knocking cars everywhere and it ends with the car flying up tower bridge when it was still being raised! Adrelaline rushing stuff! It's Filmography is fantastic and shows you from the bonnet of the car which was a good twist. Best car chase ever? I think I can say yes!There isn't really any actors that are well known bar Richard Attenborough who acts brilliantly. He and Brannigan go like chalk and cheese and it's just hilarious to watch.John Wayne films are known to have jokes and funny oneliners but none have as much as this classic. Sometimes it feels like you are watching a comedy. One funny line is a conversation with Richard and John This is not Chicargo you know brannigan! thats right commander you can't get a decent hamburger anywhere!. Classic. If you don't like the film you will like the jokes.Finally the film's thriller side really succeeds it's intriguing and mind boggling. If you like mystery movies with a good plot look no further! Although it has a deep storyline you will find it easy to follow. The final act is action packed and has a really exciting climax I will not spoil it for you.The movie is rated 15 or R but it deserves a PG. there is very little that will upset younger viewers.A fantastic cop movie from the Duke himself. A hilarious crime triller that contains great mystery and the best car chase ever. Don't miss out on this Gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne plays the titular character in the 1975 cop film Brannigan and this film unfortunately is not one of the Duke's best. Now I do not detest Brannigan. I do not hate it I just don't think it's very good and it's not worth more than two or three views. John Wayne made a lot of great movies in his epic careerhe made a lot of masterpieces and gave some incredible performancesbut this movie does not rank with them. And Wayne himself said that he wasn't particularly fond of it either.Brannigan is an American police officer who is sent overseas to London to bring back a fugitive from justice who fled the country. He arrives to discover that the fugitive played by John Vernon has been kidnapped and held for ransom. Brannigan and the London police force led by Commander Swan Richard Attenborough must try to save him and dodge assassination attempts made by the enemy.This is a fine plot in a film that just doesn't quite work. Brannigan has slow pacing not much in the action category and it's quite clear that it's trying desperately to top off with the classic action cop movies like Dirty Harry 1971 even down to the music score which resembles Lalo Schifrin's score from the mentioned Clint Eastwood film. It has its moments but not nearly enough to make it recommendable. It's not a depressing movie but not an exhilarating one either. Wayne gives his usual good performance but even an icon like him can't save the movie.If you are a diehard John Wayne fan then you must naturally see Brannigan so that you can say you've seen all of your favorite actor's movies. If you're not then you might as well skip it over for it's really not that interesting to watch. See other better Wayne movies such as The Searchers 1956 True Grit 1969 El Dorado 1966 and In Harm's Way 1965.".

I do not hate it I just don't think it's very good and it's not worth more than two or three views. John Wayne made a lot of great movies in his epic careerhe made a lot of masterpieces and gave some incredible performancesbut this movie does not rank with them. And Wayne himself said that he wasn't particularly fond of it either.Brannigan is an American police officer who is sent overseas to London to bring back a fugitive from justice who fled the country.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched the reruns of two action movies McQ  Brannigan both starring John Wayne on cable TV. I had watched both of them in the theatres during the mid 70's or so.As a young boy I have always enjoyed watching John Wayne in so many westerns Stagecoach Rio Bravo True Grit...  in so many war movies Green Berets Sands of Iwo Jima The Longest Day....I believe that John Wayne was almost in his late 60'searly 70's when he starred in the above two movies. I also believe that these were the only two movies in which he had played a streetwise nononsense cop. That's 'Dirty Harry' style! In the first movie McQ he was Police DetectiveLieutenant Lon McQ in Seattle. He investigated the death of his partner  along the way uncovered some corrupt elements in his police department with shady connections to the mob. The signature mobster in the movie Manny Santiago was played by Al Lettieri.In the second movie Brannigan he was Police DetectiveLieutenant Jim Brannigan in Chicago. He was sent to London to bring back an American mobster on the run Ben Larkin played by John Vernon  along the way he got entangled with the conservative workstyle of Scotland Yard.Despite his age John Wayne was really remarkable in both roles. Having seen him in so many westerns  war movies it was refreshing to see him acting in contemporary settings. The hotpursuit action sequences car chases  shootouts were really good considering that era. In McQ the car chase along the beach with sea gulls fluttering away for cover was magnificantly choreographed. In Brannigan the car chase segment ending at the Tower Bridge was great too. There was even a largescale brawl at a London pub...reminiscent of John Wayne's innumerable westerns. The storyline in both movies was quite intriguing. In McQ he even got to show off his physical prowess with an unlicensed submachine gun. That was cool! The dialogue in both movies was witty too.In Brannigan one could see how big  tall John Wayne was when he was in London among the crowd. He really stood out like a sore thumb. His opposite was Commander Sir Charles Swann of Scotland Yard played by a very fine British actor Richard Attenborough. John Wayne even got a beautiful sidekick in the movie Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher played by Judy Geeson.In McQ I was very surprised to see John Wayne in an intimate scene involving a junkie informer played by a fine actress Colleen Dewhurst in an understated role. This was something which had never happened in any of his other movies as far as I know! On the whole both movies had a good mix of action drama  comedy coupled with witty dialogue throughout. I have enjoyed very much watching both of them again after so many years.".

	schema:reviewBody "In deference to John Wayne's legendary film career in Westerns Turner Classic Movies moderator Ben Mankiewicz stated that you could move Brannigan out West and it would work. Having seen a ton of Wayne's films I think it's pretty safe to say that this more closely resembled his Lone Star flicks from the Thirties like Texas Terror or The Lawless Frontier rather than say Rio Bravo or True Grit.I think a lot of it boils down to the writing there's a lot here that doesn't make sense. For starters how is it that Jim Brannigan's boss Moretti Ralph Meeker in Chicago hands him a passport among other things to go to London. You have to apply for a passport yourself and have your picture taken along with supplying a ton of identification. Then in London when he becomes aware that assassin Drexel is on the street below the apartment he's investigating he shouts out to him to stop!! Really? They teach you that in detective school? And how about the continuity lapse when Commander Swann Richard Attenborough tells Brannigan he's got a phone call Swann calls him 'Joe'.At least part of the story line was interesting though. The Larkin John Vernon kidnapping plot kept you guessing as to what was going to happen next and the hitman hired by the American mobster started out as a fairly creative fellow in his attempts to take out Wayne's character. But there again the final face off between Brannigan and Gorman Daniel Pilon was written far too clumsily. I can't imagine a professional assassin would be so reckless to put an end to his target that he'd pull out all the stops and try to run him over with his car giving Brannigan plenty enough time to just shoot him through the windshield. It felt like the writers just needed a quick way to get this thing over with.Through it all Brannigan's English partner Jennifer Thatcher Judy Geeson is easy on the eyes and gets in that cool line about Americans being 'overworked oversexed and over here'. After that quick peck on the cheek she gave Brannigan I groaned a bit thinking the film makers were heading in the wrong direction but unlike Wayne's early Westerns this is one film that ended where the Duke didn't get the girl. If that had happened the film makers would have really pulled a Murphy.".

	onyx:emotionText "In deference to John Wayne's legendary film career in Westerns Turner Classic Movies moderator Ben Mankiewicz stated that you could move Brannigan out West and it would work. Having seen a ton of Wayne's films I think it's pretty safe to say that this more closely resembled his Lone Star flicks from the Thirties like Texas Terror or The Lawless Frontier rather than say Rio Bravo or True Grit.I think a lot of it boils down to the writing there's a lot here that doesn't make sense.

I couldn't understand it why would Americans promote the very thing they fought against in the war? Then I was informed that they weren't fighting against racism or discrimination but against the Nazi regime and genocide. There is a large difference between one person's opinion and a government policy. I'm a teenager and the fact that Jews were still discriminated against was never mentioned to me. Maybe it should be better known. I am doing Modern History next year and we will be studying the Second World War and I'm very glad I saw this film despite its inaccuracies.Anyway  now to the plot. Phillip Green Gregory Peck is a writer who pretends to be Jewish to find out about antiSemitism. Through this he learns how much people discriminate against Jews and it affects him deeply and changes his life.I was never bored in this film. I am forever fascinated by Peck who I've always remembered as Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird 1962. This is only the second film I've seen with Peck in his younger days it's quite a pleasure watching him. Celeste Holm also is amazing and I love how she can laugh so easily  very realistic. The only thing I wasn't satisfied with is the romantic choices by Peck's character. I wish he would have chosen the happy blonde Anne instead of the sappy boring Kathy. Oh how I was hoping he would choose Anne! Perhaps Dorothy McGuire was miscast maybe someone else could have brought more energy to her character. John Garfield is fantastic as Green's Jewish friend.This was ground breaking at the time and I really respect the people who participated in this film for taking a risk. Despite being made almost 60 years ago I have not only learned from it but enjoyed it. Yes there are some inaccuracies and plot holes but I don't particularly care and it doesn't distract me. It's a great film go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard for today's audience to appreciate the impact of Gentlemen's Agreement in 1947. The Holocaust was not in textbooks then it was in newsreels showed in American theaters. The state of Israel was coming into being and there was debate about that with Harry Truman shortly overruling a lot of his own trusted advisers including his own Secretary of State George C. Marshall in giving recognition to the nascent Jewish state.During the course of the film names like Gerald L.K. Smith Theodore G. Bilbo and John E. Rankin are mentioned. The first was a Protestant evangelical minister who started out with Huey Long but then developed a line of antiSemitism in his sermons. He had a considerably large following back in the day though the Holocaust did a lot in killing his recruiting. Theodore G. Bilbo and John E. Rankin were a couple of Mississippi politicians who for their redneck constituency successfully linked antiSemitism and racism. They didn't like foreign born either and used a whole lot of ethnic slurs. But the antiSemitism that Gregory Peck takes on is not that of Bilbo Smith and Rankin. It's the genteel country club antiSemitism that manifests itself in restricted resorts quotas as to how many Jews will some white shoe law firm accept if any discrimination in hiring practices unspoken covenants gentlemen's agreements not to sell to Jews in certain areas all these we see in Gentlemen's Agreement. Peck is given an assignment to write about it and he hits on a novel approach. Just being hired by publisher Albert Dekker he gets Dekker's backing when he says he will pretend he's Jewish and see how he's being treated. He gets quite an experience in the bargain.Running parallel to Peck's masquerade is his courtship of Dorothy McGuire. She's a divorce he's a widower with a young son. The whole thing puts a strain on their relationship especially in dealing with her sister Jane Wyatt who lives in one of those restricted by Gentlemen's Agreement communities.Gentlemen's Agreement came up with several nominations and three Oscars for Best Picture Best Director to Elia Kazan and Best Supporting Actress to Celeste Holm as a tart tongued fashion writer at Peck's magazine who proves to be a friend. Peck himself was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Ronald Colman for A Double Life. Holm also beat out Anne Revere nominated for the same film probably helped by the fact that Revere had won a few years earlier for National Velvet.John Garfield who was Jewish took a small supporting role in the film as Peck's long time childhood friend who educates Peck into how a Jew deals with the rebuffs he's finding out about. Had he not been up also for Body and Soul as Best Actor he might well have earned a Supporting Actor nomination here.Also note Sam Jaffe as the fictional professor Lieberman which is a thinly veiled caricature of Albert Einstein probably the most noted figure in the world of Jewish background. Like Lieberman Einstein's a cultural Jew not religious in any sense of the word. Nevertheless he was a leading figure at the time in the Zionist movement having endured all that Peck endured in Germany and seeing what was coming with Hitler fled his native Germany for safe harbor in the USA.My favorite character in the film however has always been June Havoc as Peck's secretary. She changed her name to something ethnically neutral to get her job in the very magazine that will now crusade against antiSemitism. She's also become a self hater a phenomenon that other discriminated people also experience. GLBT activists are fully aware of what self hate has done not hardly unknown among other groups as Ms. Havoc demonstrates.Of course Gentlemen's Agreement is dated with its topical references to post World War II trends and events. Yet it still has a powerful message to deliver. It made Gregory Peck one of the great liberal icons of Hollywood and still should be seen by all as a great lesson in the pitfalls of unreasoning hate.".

Peck is supposed to be the moral spokesman but so many of the other actorsJohn Garfield Dorthy McGuire Dean Stockwell Celeste Holm Sam Jaffesuggest less priggishnesspuritanism and more humanitywarmth than he does. How can we think him morally superior when he comes across like a sulking browbeater? I wish a Spencer Tracy or even a James Stewart had played his role. Sometimes I feel like saying Lighten up Greg! Say did you ever here the one about the Rabbi and the three bellydancers? You'll love it.Nor is it just the casting. Many of Anne Revere's lines make me wince with their naivety and I think she has the most embarrassing role in the movie. However I really hate the scene when Peck berates his secretary June Havoc basically telling her that the only thing that differentiates a Jew from a Christian is just a wordas if cultural and ethnic differences didn't exist or matter.I could go on because I think I know this film's faults as well as any of its critics. However the movie's virtues obviously outweigh its shortcomings and dated moments. In fact after over sixty years not one other Hollywood film confronts bigotry as intelligently as this one. That's right not one. Why? Because every other one deals only with bigotry in the extremeand the result is they don't really attack bigotry they attack violence. Many bigots who keep their kids out of culturally diverse schools can watch MISSISSIPPI BURNING IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT CROSSFIRE etc. and can selfcongratulatingly say to themselves Well that's not me I know I'm not a racist. Of course violent prejudice is the worst form there is but in case you didn't know it is not violent prejudice that minorities confront on a daily basis. It is the unspoken insensitive attitudes that GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT is brave enough and unique enough to attack. Despite its dated moments it's no wonder this movie raises nervous hairs to this day. It makes one actually wonder is it wrong to tell a politically incorrect joke? Those who think the answer is simple please think again. Some have commented that they don't understand what the title refers to and it is significant. A gentleman's agreement is one made without writing or even speechan agreement that's understood or assumed to be understood. In regards to the film the term refers to those innumerable bigots who so unthinkingly assume that their prejudices are agreed upon. Speaking as a member of the U.S.'s privileged minority a white anglosaxon Protestant heterosexual male I can attest that all of the sexist racist comments I have had to hear have always been spoken by someone who silently assumed that I would agree with him making it a gentleman's agreement. The movie of course says it's time to break the agreement. A lot of people didn't like such a message when the film came out and a lot of them don't like it now.".

Speaking as a member of the U.S.'s privileged minority a white anglosaxon Protestant heterosexual male I can attest that all of the sexist racist comments I have had to hear have always been spoken by someone who silently assumed that I would agree with him making it a gentleman's agreement. The movie of course says it's time to break the agreement. A lot of people didn't like such a message when the film came out and a lot of them don't like it now.";

Few releases are more important than 1947's Academy Award winning Gentleman's Agreement a forthetimes daring expose of antiSemitism a prejudice rarely if ever before that year acknowledged in film.Laura Z. Hobson an accomplished novelist wrote the book of the same title and it sold well.  Hobson unveiled the socalled Gentleman's Agreement whereby Jews were excluded from professions clubs resorts and employment and residency opportunities as well as simple social associations by a silent compact by mainly white Christians to engage in exclusionary practices.  While discrimination against blacks was mandated by unambiguous law supported by inflexible government authority the relegation of Jews to often secondclass status in the dominant Christian community was by deception denial and deceit.A Christian Darryl F. Zanuck was one of the few true Hollywood moguls who wasn't Jewish. He was also intensely offended by bigotry of any kind. Hobson's novel of no interest to Jewish producers who preferred to live in their own world which consciously often aped the society from which they were barred was his to buy for the screen. He did so for 75000 and he set out to find a firstclass crew to make the film.Elia Kazan signed on to direct and to revise the screenplay after Moss Hart finished it.  Gregory Peck already a box office idol was chosen to play Philip Schuyler Green a widower with a young boy played by Dean Stockwell.  Dorothy McGuire is Green's troubling love interest Kathy Lacey.  John Garfield one of the many Hollywood denizens who changed their names to avoid being typed as Jewish is Army Corps of Engineers captain Dave Goldman.  Celeste Holm won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as Anne Dettrey.  Anne Revere soon to lose twenty years of productive life because of the Blacklist is Green's wise mom.  June Havoc is Green's secretary Elaine Wales who in the film changed her name to get work her real name being clearly Jewish.

Unfortunately he's a bit naive about what goes down in his own shop.This is a message film direct and uncompromising.  Agreeing to write a series exposing antiSemitism Green struggles to find a theme while falling in love with the divorced Kathy.  His brilliant concept is to pretend to be a Jew and to record how others respond to him a clearly welleducated socially competent man in that guise.  His childhood buddy Goldman tries to warn him off but Green is determined.Stridently polemical the movie traces the growing number of incidents where Green is slighted because of his announced religion.  From a building superintendent who doesn't allow a Jewish name on a lobby mailbox to a haughty resort manager of a restricted facility the code word of the time for exclusion of Jews and blacks Green gets a rapid course in the crude discrimination lurking behind most doors including the high society of his new beloved.Green's son told not to reveal that he and his dad aren't Jewish runs into his own cruel rejection by classmates.  Peck's Green lacks the depth of understanding of a child's vulnerability that his Atticus Finch later displays in To Kill a Mockingbird. The boy is basically told that the other kids are wrong we're right and that's that.  Too simplistic even for this movie. Green is adamantly and unwaveringly sure of himself and woe betide any who do not share his abhorrence at any manifestation of discrimination starting with Kathy.The romance between Green and Kathy is as backandforth as any Hollywood potboiler the difference being that their arguments and fallingouts revolve entirely over Kathy's inability to grasp the absolute righteousness of her fiance's crusade.  The dispute is artificial and wearying to some degree and I rooted for Celeste Holm's lovely witty and totally tolerant Anne a fashion editor with attitude as the top gal in the film. I would have married her in a New York minute!Younger audiences today may well dismiss A Gentleman's Agreement as formulaic and preachy but they do not understand the nature of the tragedy and that it was that afflicted America at the time.  The war had been won the Cold War was getting into high gear and Nazi criminals were on trial in various European courtrooms.  The reality of the concentration camps was known to all but already many had accepted the belief that only some Germans and their allies were actual murderers.  Holocaust studies had not begun.The period of A Gentleman's Agreement was a time in which many top colleges and universities that didn't ban Jews entirely had what are now acknowledged as Jew quotas.  Many Jewish doctors didn't enter that profession because that's what their moms wanted but due to the near blanket exclusion of Jews from engineering schools.  Architecture schools also had a low quota for Jews Louis Kahn's experiences are recounted in the current and outstanding documentary My Architect.  Whole communities lived by a sub rosa agreement never to admit Jews and blacks often solidifying their intent by restrictive covenants that courts enforced.  What added to the awfulness of the prejudice is that communities comprised of Jews usually excluded blacks and other nonwhites.  No Caucasian group whatever their religion deserves exoneration for the acts they practiced against minorities.  Blacks get no mention in this movie but lynchings were still in voguelet's not forget that.For many Americans harboring antiSemitic beliefs the bestiality of the Nazis was far more troubling than the fate of millions of their innocent victims Jewish or not.  Decrying Auschwitz in no way caused them to rethink less lethal but highly pervasive discrimination that they practiced or as the film shows disliked but nonetheless condoned without protest.In that sense A Gentleman's Agreement was Hollywood's actually Zanuck's wakeup call.  The politics of the producer director screenwriter and much of the cast aren't hidden.  Several references to Bilbo and Rankin two of the most evil racists and bigots ever to pollute Congress's halls are as direct and clear as the sharp DVD images.  And it's no surprise that virtually everyone associated with this film went on to be called by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee to be questioned about ties to communism John Garfield died at age 39 of a heart attack the night prior to a second command appearance before that runamuck committee.  That committee hunted communists publicly but pursued a barely hidden antiSemitic agenda and Hollywood provided plenty of potential victims.The special features on this disc include a short documentary on its genesis and the subsequent reaction to the film as well as interviews with several stars including the still imposing Celeste Holm.  Zanuck and Kazin deserved their Oscars as did Ms. Holm.  A Gentleman's Agreement wasn't the only film to highlight antiSemitism at that time. In fact it wasn't the first such film of 1947.  Released shortly earlier Crossfire starring Robert Ryan is a film noir capturing the violent bigotry of a thug who kills a Jewish victim for little better reason than his religion.  An exciting film in its own right its importance is secondary to Zanuck's which blew the lid  almost literally  off a brand of discrimination indulged in by educated and affluent Americans who would never commit assault or murder against anyone because of their race or religion.Hollywood's Jewish moguls must have been surprised at the success of Zanuck's movie which in a small but real way began rolling back the kind of antiAmerican bigotry that the congressional committee investigating Tinseltown not only didn't care about they shared it.1010 for its historical impact and lasting value".

Gregory Peck plays a journalist who decides to pretend to be Jewish so he can attain a reallife perspective on antisemitism. Peck's transformation from a determined writer looking for an edge to a crusader against prejudice is nothing short of profound. The twist of course is that Peck gets lost in the assignment starts seeing himself as a Jew and struggles to maintain his composure amid all the antisemitism he experiences.      Considering that it's a shame that the film's abilities to tell a story lag so far behind the movie's depth and boldness. There's a lot of emphasis on the romance between Peck and his editor's niece which is pretty overdone for a pair who has as little chemistry as McGuire and Peck. I think the worst part of that is hearing Gregory Peck referring to McGuire's character as my girl like he's in middle school especially considering I've always associated Peck with characters of tremendous maturity. Additional randomness comes from the fact that the film also focuses on Peck's relationship with his ailing mother which doesn't have much to do with the central plot at all.

I thought every principal actor succeeded with flying colors even when they have to deliver awful and obvious message speeches they almost always ended up making that writing sound a lot better than it was. Gregory Peck gives one of his very best performances. I'm glad to see him give this performance too after being stupefied by that wooden performance in the same year's The Paradine Case. The script does well with the character of Phil Green. When he begins his quest to discover the antisemitism around him he is involved very impersonally. It's a job a job he doesn't really want to do a job he doesn't even know how to do. And when he gets his big idea to pretend he's Jewish himself it seems almost arrogant. How dare he I thought. But through the film he does get personally involved so deeply involved that the insults and jokes and so forth become personal attacks. I doubt he ever expected that it would hurt so much. In comparison to the other film about antiSemitism in 1947 Crossfire also nominated for Best Picture Gentleman's Agreement certainly does not hold up in terms of filmmaking and artistry. However which film do you think had more of a chance to make a difference? Where Gentleman's Agreement succeeds and Crossfire fails is its ability to make the audience look inside themselves. Sure it has to hit its audience with a sledgehammer before they look inside themselves to find their own prejudices and shortcomings but I really think it works.".

	schema:headline " A controversial subject matter enhanced by skillful direction and understated performances";
	schema:reviewBody "A Gentleman's Agreement is the second motion picture of Elia Kazan that I have seen the first being On the Waterfront. When I saw the movie starring On the Waterfront about two years I had not much knowledge about Stanislavsky's method of acting to me as an Indian teenager more exposed to Bollywood films acting meant overdone expressions that indicated emotions of the character at the moment and blaring music in the background to suggest the mood. But after having read his works and being in contact with theater actors I have realized how tough and delicate 'true' acting is. It can be compared to a tightrope you tilt more to the side and you fall. Similarly if you overdo or underperform you fail  it is about developing yourself externally and internally to portray another person. And so have I begun to appreciate more welcomingly the works of great directors and actors I am able to sense more keenly whether the actor is 'feeling' or 'acting as if he is feels'. Elia Kazan as I read about him in Wikipedia has been proclaimed as an 'actor's director' for implementing his Method techniques in his film in a way that brings out the truest emotion within his actors. When Marlon Brando hails him as the best experience he has ever had with a director it means a lot. And Gentleman's Agreement has a lot to say about the director's way of handling his actors and the subject of the film. The film seems rather like a filmed play blackouts after every scene unelaborated production and specific focus on actors. And the actors never sob their eyes out or scream their lungs out their actions seem controlled and natural. There is scant music during the scenes and therefore we never are made to feel in a particular way everyone in the audience is entitled to feel hisher own way. And that's what made me astonished as I was expecting highvoltage drama with the message bombarded upon the viewers. Although there were some unneeded moments the impact that the film had on me was much more because all the actors collaborated so well without having any 'Movie Star' moment. The matter is contentious and provocative  in the 40s a reporter pretends to be a Jew for an article to directly be able to understand their feelings and presence in the white Christian dominated society. He is supported wholeheartedly by his openhearted mother and precocious son while equivocally by his fianc. His decision leads to many confrontations though most are not very serious and a newfound friendship. The film distinguishes the varying attitudes of people  some take the initiative for the better some for the worse while most sit on the fence. Here Gregory as Schuyler Green has been assigned to cover about antiSemitism which at that time was widely prevalent. He remains indecisive for a while but with the support of his family goes ahead and hits upon the idea of going undercover as a Jew. Gregory portrays him with immaculate sincerity though his character could have been written in a cleaner and riskier way. By this I mean his character does not experience to a fuller extent the discriminations among Jews because the radius his character chooses is limited to the upper caste society which remains more discreet in conveying its feelings. Also there was abundant focus on his relationship with Kathy his fiance which although was very interesting as it gave focus to her own views on racism but it neglected his interactions with other people. Yet to take up this matter in the 40s is very brave.Some viewers on IMDb denounce Kathy for being shallow but I have to say that most people even today are like her in some or the other way. We know that something is wrong yet we sit and do nothing. And Dorothy McGuire channels this feeling of 'shame of not doing something' to a tee. And regarding certain viewers' complaint regarding the ending of the film I say that basic human feelings such as love should not alter because of one incompatibility. I shall give a personal example here My grandmother is staunchly against a leader's administration and is quite vocal about it but she would always reprimand my grandfather whenever he would provide criticism about the reader in the newspaper. That does not mean my grandpa will divorce my grandma and go soul searching I was not disappointed by Schuyler's decision in the end.The supporting cast act like pillars in the film with not one misstep from the actors. Celeste Holm is simply amazing as the feisty fashion editor who believes in equality. And I felt she really had her feet on the ground unlike fireball Bette Davis in All about Eve whose character too has the similar zest but seems to spit ember and heat up all the scenes. Celeste is fun overthetop and believable she also wonderfully acts especially in her final scene. Anne Revere is equally brilliant and John Garfield and June Havoc give their best in their short roles. Garfield surprisingly didn't receive supporting actor nomination since he has some climatic scenes and dialogs. And what conviction does the young Dean Stockwell display!The ensemble is one of the best I have seen and under Elia's guidance deliver their best and most genuine. It may get dreary for those expecting swelling music and overthetop moments but anyone who can notice the director's courage for making this shall be greatly impressed. My Rating 9 out of 10".

It can be compared to a tightrope you tilt more to the side and you fall. Similarly if you overdo or underperform you fail  it is about developing yourself externally and internally to portray another person. And so have I begun to appreciate more welcomingly the works of great directors and actors I am able to sense more keenly whether the actor is 'feeling' or 'acting as if he is feels'. Elia Kazan as I read about him in Wikipedia has been proclaimed as an 'actor's director' for implementing his Method techniques in his film in a way that brings out the truest emotion within his actors. When Marlon Brando hails him as the best experience he has ever had with a director it means a lot. And Gentleman's Agreement has a lot to say about the director's way of handling his actors and the subject of the film. The film seems rather like a filmed play blackouts after every scene unelaborated production and specific focus on actors. And the actors never sob their eyes out or scream their lungs out their actions seem controlled and natural. There is scant music during the scenes and therefore we never are made to feel in a particular way everyone in the audience is entitled to feel hisher own way. And that's what made me astonished as I was expecting highvoltage drama with the message bombarded upon the viewers. Although there were some unneeded moments the impact that the film had on me was much more because all the actors collaborated so well without having any 'Movie Star' moment. The matter is contentious and provocative  in the 40s a reporter pretends to be a Jew for an article to directly be able to understand their feelings and presence in the white Christian dominated society. He is supported wholeheartedly by his openhearted mother and precocious son while equivocally by his fianc. His decision leads to many confrontations though most are not very serious and a newfound friendship. The film distinguishes the varying attitudes of people  some take the initiative for the better some for the worse while most sit on the fence. Here Gregory as Schuyler Green has been assigned to cover about antiSemitism which at that time was widely prevalent. He remains indecisive for a while but with the support of his family goes ahead and hits upon the idea of going undercover as a Jew. Gregory portrays him with immaculate sincerity though his character could have been written in a cleaner and riskier way. By this I mean his character does not experience to a fuller extent the discriminations among Jews because the radius his character chooses is limited to the upper caste society which remains more discreet in conveying its feelings. Also there was abundant focus on his relationship with Kathy his fiance which although was very interesting as it gave focus to her own views on racism but it neglected his interactions with other people. Yet to take up this matter in the 40s is very brave.Some viewers on IMDb denounce Kathy for being shallow but I have to say that most people even today are like her in some or the other way. We know that something is wrong yet we sit and do nothing. And Dorothy McGuire channels this feeling of 'shame of not doing something' to a tee. And regarding certain viewers' complaint regarding the ending of the film I say that basic human feelings such as love should not alter because of one incompatibility. I shall give a personal example here My grandmother is staunchly against a leader's administration and is quite vocal about it but she would always reprimand my grandfather whenever he would provide criticism about the reader in the newspaper. That does not mean my grandpa will divorce my grandma and go soul searching I was not disappointed by Schuyler's decision in the end.The supporting cast act like pillars in the film with not one misstep from the actors. Celeste Holm is simply amazing as the feisty fashion editor who believes in equality. And I felt she really had her feet on the ground unlike fireball Bette Davis in All about Eve whose character too has the similar zest but seems to spit ember and heat up all the scenes. Celeste is fun overthetop and believable she also wonderfully acts especially in her final scene. Anne Revere is equally brilliant and John Garfield and June Havoc give their best in their short roles. Garfield surprisingly didn't receive supporting actor nomination since he has some climatic scenes and dialogs. And what conviction does the young Dean Stockwell display!The ensemble is one of the best I have seen and under Elia's guidance deliver their best and most genuine. It may get dreary for those expecting swelling music and overthetop moments but anyone who can notice the director's courage for making this shall be greatly impressed. My Rating 9 out of 10";

He must take care of his young son and has his mother in New York to help him out. AntiSemitism hits a chord as WWII has just ended with news of the Holocaust just barely starting to sink into the national consciousness. The timing for release of this movie is obvious but it is carefully thought out as the director tries to convey the sinister and insidious way in which prejudice worms its way into the mainstream of everyday life. A well done film that works! A clever and intelligent portrayal that deserved the attention it received. Not an entertaining movie in the strictest sense but one where the audience must do the work of thinking their way through it. It is a film worth navigating however because the ugly mirror of prejudice is held up to us all who are watching. It makes you feel uncomfortable because most of us are guilty of witnessing prejudice but we end up doing nothing about it.I recommend this film but it won't be for everyone and many of us would rather just pass this one by. But we shouldn't even though it holds up this mirror making us feel guilty and uncomfortable. I should point out that the ending relating to the love interest in the story just doesn't work but then that is not the purpose of the film. Prejudice antiSemitism and discrimination are and these elements are worked out well. A disturbing but intelligent portrayal which is worth taking in for what it is worth.".

It pretty much rambles on the same dramatic level all throughout the picture dividing its time between love scenes and sermons most of which are indistinguishable from one another.In the end the important message and the overall entertainment value of the picture suffers from this redundancy.".

And there are characterisations that are absurd  the antiSemitic secretary for example.And yet  the film packs an emotional punch that has not lessened in the sixty years since it first came out. The most powerful moment in the entire film for me comes when Phil's young son returns from school to report that he had been at the receiving end of antiSemitic verbal abuse from other children. Phil's WASP girlfriend always ready with the wrong thing to say hugs him and reassures him that everything is OK because he's not really Jewish. From that moment on it seems that the relationship between the two leads is doomed as it should be.The most likable characters in the film are John Garfield and Celeste Holm the latter winning a welldeserved Oscar for her performance.The film succeeds in spite of its premise in spite of some silly characterisations and even in spite of the tackedon happy end Phil should wind up with Anne. It succeeds because it addresses the issue of antiSemitism with an extraordinary power and Gregory Peck demonstrates here as in To Kill A Mockingbird that when you need an actor to embody basic human decency he's your man.".

In other words Zanuck took the easy way out and made it into a soap opera instead. This is a shame as the actors were very capable of giving true and genuine performances. Gregory Peck as the man who passes himself off as Jewish seemed restrained and unable to bear down on the message of the plot. It was the writing that never gave him this opportunity. The durable Dorothy McGuire known for ENCHANTED COTTAGE TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN was wasted in an unsympathetic role as the girl friend who can't be understood. Their love scenes were stale. I did like the unsaid dinner scene where they couldn't look at each other or speak. Very well played. John Garfield the Jewish friend and a brilliant actor walked through this film where he could have done so much more. Celeste Holm in her Academy Award performance had a few moments but far from award winning performance. It seemed she too was restrained from being the babe out to get Peck for her own. Anne Revere again plays the mama with the words of wisdom. It seems to be her fate to play these roles. See her in NATIONAL VELVET SONG OF BERNADETTE and PLACE IN THE SUN. You never are quite sure what she's thinking. She walks around with a smug look on her face. Other roles played by June Havoc the bigoted secretary Albert Dekker the publishing boss who wanted the story Sam Jaffe wonderful in a small role Jane Wyatt wasted in a thankless role as McGuire's sister and young Dean Stockwell one of the better juvenile actors of the time as the son. All could have added great depth to this but the writing and I believe the studio's fear of offending prevented this from being a powerful message. DIARY OF ANNE FRANK captured this.

It is true enough that America had even today its share of leading citizens who openly practiced antisemitism.  However this film goes much further.  So far in fact as to highlight antiSemitism in people who did not have the requisite intent of being antiSemitic.  In other words the well meaning gentile Green denounces even jews who innocently regurgitate stereotypical statements about Jews.  This obviously enters the realm of Orwellian 'thought crimes.'  To Green the fraudulent gentile purporting to be Jewish one is guilty when private thoughts are merely spoken.  So much for freedom of speech.  Clearly this is the more dangerous poison than the one Green wished to snuff out.Its interesting that all of this 'hate crime' hunting predates Mao Tse Tung's Cultural Revolution by almost twenty years.  Thus one can conclude that the seeds of political correctness were taking root many decades ago in our own land.Even if all the above statements are ignored the film is a tortuous plodding mess.  Investigative successes and bold denunciations by the perfect Green are nullified by restatement piled upon one another.  After 30 minutes this film offers no more surprises.The audience unless in a stupor is apt to scream O.K. I get it antiSemitism is bad.  Unfortunately a film such as this takes hold of the audience and turns them hostage.  In other words you will accept this benevolent message or you are just as guilty as the pigs in this movie.This type of movie making is completely unfair.

She was a Jew who recognized antiSemitism in the mainstream business world yet overcame it.  Of course Kazan had to demonize even her and highlight her own antiSemitism something I truly doubt as authentic in one who understood first hand the perils of prejudice.Please don't take my word for it.

	schema:headline " Dates badly...preachy and artificial...should not have won the 1947 Oscar...";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood loves to give Oscars to films of social significance or British imports that have intellectual appeal. They had a chance in 1947 to award an Oscar to the Britishmade masterpiece Great Expectations from the Charles Dickens novel. Instead they opted to give their gold award to a preachy artificial film about antiSemitism that has me wincing when I watch it today.Some films improve with age like good wine but Gentleman's Agreement now seems bland and obvious not the effective earnest and gripping film it was meant to be. Gregory Peck gives an earnest performance but Dorothy McGuire's character seems naive and poorly defined. Celeste Holm gives an ingratiating witty performance but hardly one that seems Oscarcaliber. Martita Hunt who played Miss Havisham in 'Great Expectations' wasn't even nominated! Seen from the distance of time it's a film that dates badly in its attitudes and its attempt at giving us a strong viewpoint about the ills of antiSemitism. The only vital character is June Havoc as Peck's Jewish secretary. John Garfield is surprisingly bland in a supporting role.The whole film has a preachy attitude that never develops any real dramatic conflict. In addition to the bland script and leisurely pace of the film there is not even praise one can give to the ordinary black and white photography or set decoration. Productionwise it looks as if Zanuck was watching the budget not expecting the controversial film to be the hit it was at the time. Just shows you what time can do to a story of social significance.The award should definitely have gone to the more distinctive Great Expectations David Lean's British masterpiece. Hollywood gave many of its awards in the coming years and still does to great British films but surprisingly they shunned the David Lean film.Trivia note To give it a documentary feel there is almost no background music at all. Alfred Newman must have been busy that year working on his very dramatic score for The Snake Pit and opted to use almost no music for this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In his commentary for the DVD of Gentlemen's Agreement' critic Richard Schickel spends some of it criticizing the flaws in the movie something I wish more commentaries would do.  Mostly I disagreed with him especially about Dorothy McGuire's fine performance.  She has by far the toughest role in the picture as Gregory Peck's conflicted fiance whose complacent belief that she doesn't have an antisemitic bone in her body is severely tested when he decides to pretend to be Jewish for a newspaper article.  I often think of prejudice as the act of automatically assuming something is fact about someone we don't know based on stereotypical preconceived notions. Antisemitism is the reference point for the movie but what it really does is examine the subject of prejudice from many different angles from its most virulent to its most subtle forms.  It even explores the role played by Jewish selfhatred in exacerbating the problem.  The only time the film begins to resemble an After School Special' is in Ann Revere's preachy speech towards the end.  On balance however Agreement' is much more complex than it's been given credit for. I may be too late but in answer to the User Commenter who wanted to know the name of the main title theme it's an Alfred Newman original that is only heard that one time in the film. He developed it more extensively a couple of years later in Kazan's Pinky.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gentleman's Agreement 1947A gentleman's agreement is a euphemism for a polite unspoken act of racial bigotry. Yes a sort of wink to not allow blacks or hispanics or Jews into a certain resort or club or restaurant.That's the real point of the movie. Not hard core racism or prejudice but that subtle stuff the stuff that goes on every day even now. And ultimately it is aimed at the people who say I'm not prejudiced and yet who let other people wink and act like polite bigots.There is a lot of background to the movie in the making and acceptance of it in the industry and in the country in short Hollywood insiders avoided the idea and the public liked it. But the main point is how the movie works and plays out as a story then in our heads and now on the screen. The answer? Very well. Yes it's preachy of course. Of course! That's what a message movie does. But does it do it well? Yes but it does mean there is a lot of talking. The key talker and thinker is main character goy journalist Phil Green played by Gregory Peck. He struggles out loud through how to approach an article he has to do on antiSemitism with his mom and then struggles through the actual highly veiled antiSemitism of his potential wife played by Dorothy McGuire. We know they are made for each other but McGuire's character just can't quite get how her looking the other way or feeling outrage isn't enough.The real acting gem is by Celeste Holm who plays a sidekick another writer and someone who audiences probably want to see with Mr. Green because she has innate principles and the guts to show them. She won an Oscar too! John Garfield who was Jewish plays an openly Jewish character in a deliberately restrained role as a returning G.I. It's 1947 and the country that has helped to save the remaining Jews in concentration camps is now wondering how to save them at home from internal barriers.It might have been a mistake to set the movie in New York City which was over a quarter Jewish at the time and probably had more familiarity with assimilation and difference than the movie implies especially at the publisher's. But the scenes in stuff Connecticut make more sense. There is the love plot pushed on the whole thing and the weirdly perfect house that was built and decorated but never lived in as if that's the future waiting and ready. And yes there is all the talking and moralizing.But give director Elia Kazan credit for making this as fluid and involving as he has and cinematographer Arthur Miller's beautiful postWar visuals hold up that end of the experience really well. And you know what the lessons built into this kind of message film are worth sitting through because we all need reminders of how insidious our own prejudices can be and how we need to constantly address them openly.".

Its subject is antisemitism and the film handles the whole subject of prejudice with an all encompassing frankness though stylistically it could be argued that it's all a bit cosy and it's certainly far removed from the 'rawer' Kazan movies that were to follow. Still it is an immaculate example of hightoned seriousness with a script by Moss Hart and an all star cast lending their liberal credentials to the proceedings.Gregory Peck is the crusading journalist who poses as a Jew in order to expose antisemitism 'from the inside' finding it in some unusual places such as the doubting heart of his liberal fiance Dorothy McGuire whose idea it was to do the articles in the first place. It is interesting to compare Peck's performance here with the one that finally won him his Oscar since his role here is not dissimilar to Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird roles that ultimately set him up as the quintessential decent American. It was said that Peck could play anything  teak oak pine  but actually he is very good here better even than he was in Mockingbird and there are moments when his performance seems to have touched a nerve. Others involved include John Garfield as his best friend who happens to be Jewish Anne Revere superb as always as his mother whose mother in movies did Revere not play and Celeste Holm in an Oscarwinning turn as the fashion editor with the hots for Gregory.In hindsight perhaps the subject of antisemitism was less brave for Hollywood to tackle than say the plight of Native Americans or something as taboo as homosexuality in Crossfire the victim became a Jew rather than the homosexual he was in the novel particularly since many of the studios were run by people of the Jewish faith. Nevertheless antisemitism was still rife in the country and movies like Gentleman's Agreement which put the problem in the forefront of things are always welcome. Hollywood certainly thought so as it went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Critics have been less kind to it in the intervening years and sadly I think it remains very underrated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gentleman's Agreement is Elia Kazan's film from 1947 that stars Gregory Peck as a writer Green who pretends to be Jewish to find out about antisemitism. The concept is a good one but there are many serious flaws to this film. First there is Dorothy McGuire completely miscast as Green's fiance Kathy. And the idea of confronting relatively subtle antisemitism with no mention whatsoever of the Holocaust which ended just two years before the book and film is like ignoring the six million pound gorilla in the room. But that's not unique to this film the Holocaust was a taboo subject in film until relatively recently.The story is an interesting one but much of it is filled in with preachy dialogue which is overacted and hurts believability. Especially some of the speeches given by the characters such as when Green tells Ms. Wales June Havoc Feel my hand it's the same hand the only thing different is the word 'Christian'. Seems a heavyhanded overreaction to say the least. And an inconsistency here is that Ms. Wales is at first an ally with Green as she tells him about the antisemitic policies of the magazine they work for but then in the next scene she becomes the antisemite though she is Jewish. Also the fact that she did the same thing he did sent out two resumes one Jewish and one not seems more contrivance than coincidence.John Garfield is great as always as Green's Jewish army buddy. But there is a scene with he and Kathy where he tells her to hit back at antisemites. Discounting McGuire's mediocre performance Can I? Can I? the answer of hitting back is acceptable but the film treats it as a profound truth.Peck and Garfield are both great actors so the flaws aren't a reflection on them. The film seems to begin on a first rate level but goes downhill in dialogue quality. I like how Green tells the staff I'd feel the same way about this even if I wasn't Jewish myself and the Jewish guy's reaction just let us handle it in our own way. Green's son Tommy is played by Dean Stockwell who was later excellent in Long Day's Journey into Night. One flaw here is when Green tries to explain to Tommy what antisemitism is. He ends up defining Jewishness in the religious sense though that's contradicted later by Dr. Lieberman's speech since many Jews are not religious there is only such a thing as a Jewish TYPE. I tend to agree with Lieberman no relation to the right wing Senator thankfully on that.Green's mother is played by the great Anne Revere who was blacklisted under McCarthy ironically she's a direct descendant of Paul Revere. The final speech she gives is overly intense and rambling suddenly I want to live to be very old...it's not the Russian century or the American century...it's got to be soon...I don't know it doesn't work for me.Garfield was also blacklisted and some still don't forgive Kazan for cooperating with McCarthy. Anyway in spite of all this the film is worth seeing as a rare 1940s take on antisemitism.".

	schema:headline " Not every film made in a good cause is necessarily a good film";
	schema:reviewBody "Philip Schuyler Green is a journalist who is asked by a New York magazine publisher to write an article on antiSemitism in America. He is initially reluctant to accept the commission but eventually agrees and although he is a gentile decides to adopt a Jewish identity and to write about his own experiences. This is not difficult as he is not wellknown in the city having recently moved there from California. Green adopts the Jewishsounding name Phil Greenberg and is shocked by the prejudice he encounters. A doctor makes unprofessional remarks about a Jewish colleague he is refused admission to an upmarket restricted hotel and his son Tommy is subjected to antiSemitic bullying at school. To make matters worse Green discovers that antiJewish prejudice exists even at the supposedly liberal magazine he works for. His secretary Elaine Wales reveals that she is Jewish but was forced to adopt a gentilesounding pseudonym in order to get the job. When she applied under her real name Estelle Walovsky her application was rejected. Besides Green's professional work the film also deals with his personal life. He is a widower with a young son living with his mother. An important theme in the film is his romance with Kathy the niece of his publisher a romance which is placed under strain when he begins to suspect that Kathy's views on racial matters may be less liberal than his own. The title Gentleman's Agreement refers on one level to Kathy's home affluent town of Darien Connecticut whose residents have an unwritten agreement not to sell property to Jews. On a wider level however the title also refers to a gentlemen's agreement among American gentiles and indeed among some American Jews not to mention or to confront the problem of antiSemitism.It was a brave and controversial move for the studio 20th Century Fox to tackle this subject in 1947. Many Americans would have preferred to believe that antiSemitism was something alien associated with the evil Nazi regime which they had defeated two years earlier and did not want to hear that it was still a problem in their own country. The film was apparently a personal initiative by the studio's head Darryl F. Zanuck who held strong views about the issue. Zanuck in fact was one of the few Hollywood moguls of the era who were not Jewish and some influential Jewish figures in the industry tried to persuade him not to make it. The film's political theme drew it to the attention of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee which called Zanuck director Elia Kazan and some of its stars to testify before it. Zanuck was rewarded for his courage when the film was nominated for eight Oscars and won three including Best Picture and Best Director for Kazan. The third went to Celeste Holm as Best Supporting Actress. Yet in my view it is artistically speaking not a very good film. It is certainly not in the same class as Kazan's other Oscarwinner On the Waterfront. I have not seen all the films which were in contention for Best Picture in 1947 but one which definitely deserved the Oscar far more was David Lean's masterly version of Great Expectations. Another unsuccessful nomination Crossfire which I have not seen also dealt with the subject of antiSemitism. The film's artistic faults are twofold. Firstly it is overlong and static too dominated by talk with little in the way of action. Secondly the character of Green as played by Gregory Peck is an unattractive one the sort of liberal who is so convinced of the rightness of his views that he becomes a selfrighteous bore and even something of a bully prepared to harangue mercilessly not only those who disagree with him but also those whom he suspects of agreeing with him with insufficient fervour. I found his berating of Elaine particularly distasteful. Certainly some of Elaine's views do seem objectionable she is for example less than happy when the firm introduces a new explicitly nondiscriminatory recruitment policy because of her fears that the wrong sort of Jews will be attracted to the company. It did however seem presumptuous of the gentile Green on the basis of eight weeks pretending to be a Jew to lecture a Jewish woman on the best way to combat antiSemitism a problem she has presumably had to fight all her life. Whenever Green gets onto the subject of prejudice with Kathy he seems less like a man speaking to the woman he loves than a politician engaging in a heated debate with an opponent so much so that my sympathies were with Kathy when she stormed out on him. Hollywood could indeed make excellent films about racial prejudice and Peck was later to star in one of the greatest of these To Kill a Mockingbird. Another good one from the late forties is Clarence Brown's Intruder in the Dust. Gentleman's Agreement by contrast serves as a reminder that not every film made in support of a good cause is necessarily a good one. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that all those Oscar nominations were made more on account of the film's politics than on account of its artistic merits. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "After the defeat of nazism and the revelation of its horrors people in the Allied nations were suddenly compelled to talk about that racial prejudice that existed in their own backyards. It's an indicator of how fiercely the issue was beginning to burn that even cautiously commercial Hollywood was in on the act making a highclass production of Gentleman's Agreement.But unlike most of the movies on racism that were to follow in later years Gentleman's Agreement is not about persecution of black people but about antiSemitism. This is not to downplay antiSemitism but given the relative scale of the problem in the USA it does seem as if Hollywood is just taking baby steps in the field of race relations. Especially since the movie specifically defines Jewishness as a matter of faith not ethnicity. What's more Gentleman's Agreement only really attacks prejudice as it exists in upperclass society  being refused entry to a club or having people turn their noses up at a dinner party  a long way from the hatred and violence that makes up the thin end of bigotry's wedge.Given that it now seems such a weedy condemnation of prejudice perhaps better to view it simply as a drama. After all director Elia Kazan is ace at dramas. Kazan's style is marked by the confidence to keep his subjects further back within the shot. There's a bit where Celeste Holm calls Gregory Peck from within her office and their conversation follows with no change of angle no cut to a closeup of Holm. While there never are any actual closeups the layering within the frame can produce an intense feeling of closeness at times. When Peck and Dorothy McGuire have an argument after he is refused a room at the hotel they move from being near a set of double doors at the back of the room then they move to the foreground and the sudden gulf between them and the doors in the background make it feel like they have suddenly stepped into our personal space.And then of course we have a cast of top dramatic actors. Sadly lead man Peck's performance is rather a corny one. Watching his deliberation as he comes to the decision to pose as Jewish is almost painful. He's only good when he's being stern and forceful and it's later in the movie he starts to come into his own. The great performances in Gentleman's Agreement belong to its women. Dorothy McGuire is nicely understated her voice near to a husky whisper as she delivers her most pertinent lines. Celeste Holm is excellent for most of the movie a joyful and easygoing presence so carefree and likable that her steely outburst towards the end seems all the more stark and powerful. Anne Revere always a monument of dignity even in the grip of an angina attack proving herself one of the most effortlessly natural actresses of her generation. In her smaller role June Havoc is very good too.Unfortunately if we're going to take Gentleman's Agreement as a drama it starts to look a very flimsy movie indeed. The romantic angle is as bland as dayold kebab meat and the dialogue is corny and dull. It's a shame then that this was the first movie condemning racial prejudice to receive major plaudits not because the social evils it portrays weren't worth attacking but that there were other movies doing it far better. In the same year Crossfire also looked at antiSemitism in a much more dynamic story framework and with deeper eloquence and insight but it was a runner up to Gentleman's Agreement's Best Picture win. A few years later Pinky also directed by Kazan and No Way Out would address antiblack racism but while Pinky would receive a fair bit of attention the aheadofitstime No Way Out was practically relegated to Bmovie status. It's in a way remarkable that these other pictures existed at all but a pity they didn't get the credit they deserved.".

Never having read the Laura Z. Hobson's novel we can't opine whether this adaptation by Moss Hart and Elia Kazan is true to the book. Arthur Miller a distinguished writer dealt more or less with the same problem in his novel Focus which was made into a film a few years ago.As directed by Elia Kazan this film will probably look dated as most of the insidious prejudice in the American society seems to have vanished. Gentleman's Agreement as has been pointed by other contributors to IMDb seems preachy dealing with the subject matter antiSemitism.Phil Green the man at the center of the story seems to be a decent individual. He is hired by a New York magazine to write an expose about antiSemitism in the society of that era. In order to get down to the root of the evil he was to cover Phil makes himself pass as a Jew a fact that is revealed to all the editors of the magazine who turn a cool shoulder to him. The only one that became friendly is the fashion editor Anne Dettrey who seems to be the only one with an open mind in the whole place.Although the prejudice toward Green is not blatant it's ironic that he would encounter more opposition to his passing for a Jew from unexpected sources. The well intentioned Kathy Lacey the niece of his boss shows she is a decent woman. However she is not one to speak up about what she feels in her heart is wrong. Also Green's secretary Elaine Wales proves to be an insensitive Jewish woman who has assumed a new personality in order to get employment in the magazine.Gregory Peck makes a good appearance as Phil Green. This actor was a solid performer when he got decent direction as the one he got from Mr. Kazan in the movie. Mr. Peck is an imposing sight as the man that wants to expose the narrow mindedness of prejudice by impersonating to be Jewish himself.Dorothy McGuire as Kathy doesn't come out as well. In fact at times she proves to be an irritating woman because she wants to be upright but in fact she is a coward who never stands up to speak when she hears jokes or comments disparaging Jews.Celeste Holm makes a better impression as the woman who befriends Green and stays by him no matter what is going on around the office. June Havoc as Elaine Wales the secretary made the best out of the limitations of her character. John Garfield is seen as the childhood friend Dave Goldman who can't imagine why his friend Phil is doing what he is doing but stays by him. Anne Revere plays Mrs. Green the understanding mother.This is a curious film that made history at the time it came out because what it decided to tackle.".

Je t'aime moi non plus is a cult perverted romance that called the attention of Jane Birkin to the audiences in the 70's. This actress is used and abused along the shallow story and made the title song famous mainly because of her moaning and screams. This song has also become a synonym of love and eroticism. My vote is five.Title Brazil Paixo Selvagem Wild Passion".

She pursues the relationship but things don't work out too well. He only likes to have sex in a very uncomfortable manner for her and her pained cries get them thrown out of several motels and apartments. She also has to deal with the jealously of her lover's male friendcoworker and with her own domineering disgusting and flatulent older boss.French films and Hollywood films are very different but one thing they have in common is the tendency to have incredibly attractive actors unconvincingly slumming in unglamorous roles. Bisexual hustleractor Joe Dallesandro who was the Little Joe immortalized in Lou Reed's song Walk on the Wild Side is probably the bestlooking garbageman in the history of garbage. And Jane Birkin the reallife wifelover of musician Serg Gainsboug the director of this the couple dueted on a hit pop song Je'Taime Moi Non Plus from which this movie takes title is a stunning beauty who would NEVER be reduced to slinging hash in a crappy diner. The movie seems to be trying to trade on the androgyny of the couple. Birkin's character has a short haircut and is nicknamed Johnny. But despite her Acup breasts NOBODY is going to mistake Birkin for a boy at least with her clothes off. And Dallesandro may be pretty but he's much more of a muscular stud than an effeminate pretty boy Ironically the androgynous unisex sex thing was done much better fifteen years later in the Cement Garden which was directed by Jane's brother Andrew Birkin and featured the couple's grown daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg.This film is kind of interesting in that despite the perpetual nudity by the two uberattractive leads it doesn't go for the easy romantic or erotic angle unless you consider sodomy in the back of a garbage truck erotic or romantic. In some ways it's a fairly realistic and downbeat film. It's actually kind of like a Catherine Breillat film well maybe it's not quite THAT downbeat. Gerard Depardieu also shows in a small role as a homophobic thug. And of course the music is quite good. This might be worth seeing if you know what to expect.".

Instead of the inventive hip Serge of the 'sixties pulling musical influences from around the globe and spicing them up with naughty references he had become the jaded fatalist using shock value out of habit rather than effect.  It would also appear that he had been a bit too influenced by Godard's Weekend for his own good.  Long tracking shots of the protagonist's truck passing aimlessly through a barren landscape littered with wrecked cars are employed at least four times.  What this film and its actors really needed were a plot and some actual dialogue.  Birkin Dallesandro and the rest of the cast do credible jobs with what they've been given to work with but their doomed love triangle is bogstandard 1950s melodrama with a gay twist. Absolutely wasted here is Gerard Depardieu who turns in an awkward and unconvincing cameo as a homosexual beastialist.  Thankfully Gainsbourg still had talent in him as a composer and the film benefits from his soundtrack.  I suspect he was not encouraged to attempt more directorial efforts as after Je t'aime... he only did vanity films.".

As in My Life to Live or Alphaville or Pulp Fiction for that matter moments where the film has made you feel most alienated from the characters usually foray into uncommon abstract conversations. The answer to Johnny Jane Birkin when she tells her boyfriend I love you. Do you love me? is not I don't but rather an unenthusiastic somewhat incomplete yes. He explains that the way their bodies move in rhythm together is all love is and that it's rare.The scenes that will appeal to fans of French film are the ones where Johnny and her boyfriend are alone and where Johnny is not crying in agony. Her lover will utter something strange and surprising like that his work as a garbage man is important because moving things from one place to another is just like what happens to bodies after they die. Enthymemes incomplete logical statements abound in that character's statements. In this case he does not establish the importance of transporting corpses. Later he explains that sometimes he wishes he were crap because he used to dream about coalburning trains and they're electric now. He does not explain whether it's the look or the smell or the wastefulness of burning coal that appeals to him and why the new technology thus devastates him. At the end of the film he tells Johnny that he would not beat up his old boyfriend who had threatened her life with less than an explanation You want me to make his face into hamburger meat? What would that do? Indeed his rejection of her demand leads to his devastating inaction and their climactic fight.Serge's choice of such an unappealing gay protagonist makes this film feel homophobic. The mental inadequacies of the character do not stop at frail logic. His attempts to fool himself that Johnny is a boy make him seem as delusional as Scottie in Vertigo when Scottie dresses up a hat shop clerk named Judy Barton as a dead woman named Madeleine. His tolerance for Johnny's pain during anal intercourse paints him as an introverted and apathetic jerk a la Humbert Humbert. His flight from an angry woman makes him seem like any other craven character in a romance.Characters and plot are not everything in a movie. The camera work is original and the songs are inspired but FEW just three songs!! Why couldn't such a prolific musical mind at least work with leitmotifs within his three melodies?

The camera work is original and the songs are inspired but FEW just three songs!! Why couldn't such a prolific musical mind at least work with leitmotifs within his three melodies?

	schema:reviewBody "At last I got around to watching this film after all these years the one with the song by Serge Gainsbourg where Jane Birkin makes orgasmic noises and sighs 'Je t'aime je t'aime' to the music. And in the film she really does. But in that scene she is being buggered by a homosexual male during all of that sighing. She is not doing what people who have just heard the song all thought and certainly not with Serge Gainsbourg who as writer and director was behind the camera enjoying showing the world just how much he could degrade and exploit Jane on screen in fulfilment of his deeply sick fantasies. Of course Jane Birkin is entrancing she always is both on screen and off. But the film is odious badly made disgusting pornographic inauthentic exploitative demented psychotic and everything else. Jane spends more than half of her time on screen entirely naked but then she is not a shy person so presumably did not mind that. After all she stripped off in BLOWUP without a qualm when she was even younger. Jane's inherent physical androgyny is stressed in this weird and revolting film. Anyone watching will soon discover that Jane has never had much in the way of breasts. But that does not stop her from being intensely feminine. My wife and I have met all the Birkins Jane's mother Judy having been our close friend. They are all unusual let's put it that way. And unusual can mean just about anything. I found the most interesting of her three talented daughters to be Kate Barry whose tragic death occurred not long ago. It astounds me to what an extent Jane is such a celebrity in France that they behave as if she were a goddess. Perhaps she is. Certainly I have always been mesmerised by her whenever she has spoken anything at all. What is her secret? Ah that is the secret. But as for this film it is best forgotten and buried in the rubbish tip which features so prominently buzzing with flies in the action of the film if all that tedium can be called action.".

Take Christopher Nolan for example going from a psychological thriller where the storyline is paced backwards to an Oscarwinning blockbuster in which a world renowned superhero faces off his arch nemesis. Talk about a lack of consistency. A true writer gracefully keeps revisiting the same story over and over and OVER again and a great example for that kind of writer is Nicholas Sparks.If recycling is healthy for our environment it has to be with movies too right? Never before has this man forgotten to add a romantic scene at the beach of an Eastern Seaboard sunset where two lovers mutely stare at one another. And who else can gorgeously stir up a tearinducing ending as much as he? Forget 500 Days of Summer trying to explore the complexities of falling in love with a Hall and Oates dance sequence and an Expectations vs. Reality analysis. Instead he always remembers to kill off a protagonist at the end. M. Night Shyamalan calls HIMSELF the master of unpredictable twists? Puhlease! Mr. Sparks's death sequences are so surprising that you could almost say they're completely unrelated to the genre that the previous two hours were aiming to be.And when a movie like Precious thinks its portrayal of a teenage girl in emotional turmoil is accurate it's alarmingly mistaken. There the leading lady is impregnated by her own dad sadistically beaten down by her mother all while dealing with obesity and illiteracy on a daily basis. Ha! Like THAT happens in real life. It's really the Last Song's Ronnie who deserves our sympathy. I mean she has to spend the entire summer in an intimidatingly adorable Georgia beach house embrace the pressure of getting accepted into one of the country's most respected art schools and endure the creepy smile of her overly kind father. Now that's plausible drama  I only wish I had the guts to sullenly disregard MY dad whenever he greets me with genuine concern. This vision of teen angst fantastically brought to life by none other than Miley Cyrus.Now there are those jealous haters out there determined to bring her acting career down. But they don't understand the effort it takes from a performer to purse your lips and cross your arms for 90 of a film. Like me and my fellow Miley fans said  she's just playing herself. It's really those hacks like Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep who are destroying everything classic cinema stood for. Who do they think they are to disappear into the heart and soul of characters they don't relate to or resemble in reality? When I'm watching a character on screen I want to see the actor playing them. That's what made the most recent Valentine's Day so brilliant was that I could watch Jessica Alba being Jessica Alba the whole time yet grow blissfully unaware to her character's traits abilities...heck I couldn't even remember her name.And mad props go out to Greg Kinnear in the role of a lifetime as the antagonistic father. A previous family drama of his called Little Miss Sunshine featured too much family and likedrama. It acted like each member had their own ambition and obstacle to deal with at the same time. What a load! This movie knows better rather by making every other character's problems bow down to Ronnie's. In the Last Song he delivers this performance deserving the praise that Mo'Nique received playing Mary Jones. Never mind the fact Ronnie frequently shoplifts and snubs Julliard just to make a point. It's really him who's to blame for everything. How dare you fall out of love and pursue a career that makes you happy only to have the audacity to want to mend the wounds of your broken hearted family? I rooted throughout for Ronnie as she continuously tried to reconstruct the layers of guilt and avoidance upon his shoulders. That leads me to my one grievance of this movie a rebellious teenage girl visiting her estranged dad and blames one of her separated parents for breaking the family apart. Really Nick? That's all just too unfamiliar of a premise for me. At best the closest Ronnie ever came to resembling a character from one of your previous features was Diane Keaton's daughter from Nights in Rodanthe pauses Ohhh!".

Oh how wrong I was.I didn't believe Miley Cyrus for a second during the real pivotal scenes in the movie. Her tearscrying scenes were laughable. Her attitude problem phase was obnoxious. The only relationship I believed was the one between her and the guy and that's because they're dating off screen. Oh how difficult it must be to act like you're in love with you're real life boyfriend. I wouldn't even call her performance mediocre.And then comes the fact that this movie didn't even somewhat resemble the book. They took out the best scenes. They changed nearly EVERYTHING. They cut the preacher and the important backstory of her father. They didn't introduce the slightly similar sub plot with Scott very well at ALL. It was hinted at throughout the book but in the movie it was sudden and not very well done at all. Actually the majority of the scenes were done opposite of how they were done in the book making them really bad.Scott was more important in the book. Marcus was WAY more important in the book and he was one of those characters that was really kind of creepy.

	schema:reviewBody "Alright first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn't even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind.The acting in this movie was wonderful. On almost every account also. Greg Kinnear was amazing in the movie and the boy who played the son I was even impressed with. Miley Cyrus seemed to be the only exception. I hated her acting from the moment the movie began. As the movie went forth I started to change my mind at times. She had no problem changing it back though. She was so off and on through out the entire film. She looked confused at times and when she actually had to show emotion like anger it was as if she didn't know what to do. But enough of that.The story at times seemed rushed and misunderstood. Everything was predictable. The portions of the movie where I actually felt as though I was supposed to cry seemed to happen so fast that I felt like I didn't have time to understand how the characters felt. There were major holes in the plot that I still had questions about and it drove me nuts at times. There were a couple of times where I actually felt like I was enjoying it but they came and went quickly also. The whole movie and please remember that I absolutely knew nothing about this story before hand I felt like I had nothing to look forward to.In the end I would say that I wouldn't suggest paying to see this in theaters. I definitely wouldn't buy it on DVD and I probably wouldn't even recommend renting it later. If by some chance you get an opportunity to see it for free and you're curious then go for it. I'd also like to mention that from what I understand from my mother and my sister this movie completely differs from the book so don't expect what you've read and definitely don't get to excited for this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie today with a friend. Let me start off by saying I'm totally impartial toward Miley Cyrus bc I think a lot of bad reviews on this movie will only make a point of how bad she is. I really didn't find this to be the case. Honestly the problem with this movie lies in the story. It was very random from start to finish as my friend pointed out starting off slowly and then rushing sloppily to an end to try to tie things together and had very expected 'twists'. During the whole movie my friend and I kept predicting the next sequence of events. The perfect 'everyone'stogetherDadfinallyacceptedmyboyfriend' scene i turn to my friend someone's going to die. Dad gets up my friend says oh something's gonna happen to him the fact that Will ends up considering Columbia that they end up together etc. etc. Also this was full of clichs the fact that Ronnie believed whatever the stupid blonde girl told her and then got all angry with Will for it on a dime the separated couple gets back together a child is resentful and rebellious over her parents' divorce there's a character who's filthy rich but still has problems in his lifeall big shocks And so many random parts of the plot. For instance Will lost his brother. We can already tell from his mother that his familylife isn't perfect. Why did they even need that? I mean his father only mentions that brother once during dinner with Ronnie I think. It was very useless to me. And the way that Will was actually connected to the church fire thing through his friend and that's why the stainedglass window is so important and also what eventually causes Ronnie to reject Will was SO sloppily done. It was as if everything was supposed to be connected but it just came out jumbled and messy. THEN we have Ronnie and the acting. I don't blame Miley Cyrus. I don't blame any of the actors. Their lines were horrible and awkward. Their emotional ranges were so random I couldn't get in tune with any of the characters. The actors were so close to fitting the molds of their characters but then something would happen and it would get awkward again. And the way they had Ronnie transition from 'rebellious' to softened was choppy and strange. The actors did what they could with their dialogue and characters but in my opinion this was just badly written. I did cry at the end bc they really do pull at your emotions what with the song and the light and closeups of the brother crying it was hard to watch. But the whole time I was thinking this really is a bad movie. And that's how I left. Feeling that I had just seen a bad movie. What I will say is that I at least appreciated the acting making due with those choppy scenes and a few transition techniques of some scenery shots which were actually quite beautiful and artistic. The highlights were definitely just the settings and scenery as well as Cyrus' piano playing. But not a movie I'd recommend. Just skip it.".

The only saving grace of this movie is Greg Kinnear as the father. Cause lets all just face it it doesn't matter what role Mr. Kinnear is playing he is fabulous. Also as a pleasant surprise was Bobby Coleman as Jonah Miller. The kid is an outstanding actor who made his pain joy and adorably little brother incredibly believe able.

But there's only one reason why this movie doesn't get it right is Miley Cyrus. If your going to try to provoke the audience to feel something to move them do not cast Miley Cyrus. She's a gimmick and she has no acting talent whatsoever. Her antics are laughable and her ways to try to act are just so funny. The rest of the cast was a bit of a joke too. Who casts two horrible lead actors? I mean are they really trying to approach nonsense? Are they really trying to make this a serious movie? Because nothing is done in a professional way. The movie looks as if it was produced my a bunch of whiny teenagers who were such BIG fans of the novel. This was directing by a firsttimer but that doesn't give it any excuse for trying to get past the clichs. Did I forget to mention? If your going to attempt to move the audience creating something the audience has already seen is not going to do anything. Quite frankly it's going to make the audience cringe. This movie will only appeal to your teenage daughter. It's a chick flick that consists of being as formulaic as most everything today. And that sucks because maybe the movie had potential. But potential that would never be savored. If you like horriblyacted chick flicks with no depth or emotion here it is. If you like movies in general avoid at all costs. 110.".

Miley Cyrus and her younger brother are spirited off to their father's beach house for the summer where she is reluctant to reconnect. Director Julie Anne Robinson is backed with fine photography but the screenplay is a clich ridden romantic farce. Cyrus will go through a predicted up and down relationship with some meathead surfer will mend things with dad and save sea turtles. None of this is very interesting and it only serves as an opportunity to cash in on Cyrus's young fan base. Liam Hemsworth has the thankless role of pearly whites boyfriend who goes through a xeroxed jerk around relationship that contains all the passion of a punch to the testicles. Greg Kinnear has the one decent role as a father is is blamed for the burning of a Church. He will die of course but he at least has the one bit of dignity in the entire film. Bobby Coleman plays younger brother who does his best but the role is more or less a temporary companion for the Kinnear character while Cyrus is turtle sitting and nearly getting laid. Kelly Preston plays the mother who spends most of the film off screen likely trying to contact her agent and find out why her career has come down to this. The Cyrus fan base will love this film until either the fame dies down or they realize what candy coated manipulative bullshit this truly is. Hopefully the last time we'll see or hear of a Last Song screenplay but that is probably wishful thinking. Score 3   10".

All those who have read the book should be able to appreciate what I am talking about. Julie Anne Robinson has tried to use her creativity and tweak the story here and there but all she has managed to do is to ruin the whole plot. Some things are just better left untouched is the lesson she should learn out of it. Miley Cyrus is a huge disappointment and it seems she wasn't a good choice in the first place. She failed miserably to do what Mandy Moore did to A Walk To Remember. On the whole the movie gives the impression that they have just somehow managed to narrate the whole story in the 108 minutes given to them without really worrying about retaining the emotionally charged plot Nicholas Sparks had created. Thumbs down all the way ".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non supportive parents from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story with some help from Jeff Van Wie into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.For a brief outline of the scant story begin with a divorced family  Ronnie Miley Cyrus and her younger brother Jonah Bobby Coleman are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve Greg Kinnear in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia. Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee Liam Hemsworth and beginning to fall in love Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is. Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in the town who claim Will is a Lothario overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs pop in some fatherson meaningful contact and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus  and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well. The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks familiar story if that is to your liking you will like this. If not then pass. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Amazingly awful";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I am a pretty big book worm so when I found out that this was being made into a movie I made an effort to read the book. I'd already read a few of Nicholas Sparks' books and their adaptations were typical  missing plot lines etc.  but surprisingly good. But this book was incredible. The plot lines showed major attention to detail and the twists and turns that this writer takes you on are so convincing.But enough about the amazing book. Let's just say my positivity basically ends there. Because the movie was horrible. I was pretty convinced when it began that it would turn out to be a good movie but as soon as Miley Cyrus appears on the screen it turns for the worst.Miley Cyrus just doesn't fit the part. She doesn't actually make an effort to fit into the shoes of Ronnie Miller. Ronnie in the book is hardly Miss. Princess and neither is the character that Miley chooses to play but there is a huge difference between the two. But overall I just don't think that she's actually capable of playing a character as deep as Ronnie. And it looks as though she hasn't actually tried.I give positive reviews for the brother Jonah and the father. Jonah was quirky and funny without being too dumb. He was funny at the right times and serious at the right times. I thought that the father definitely portrayed the character in the book to a really good standard. In both the book and the movie these two have a really good bond and I'm glad to see that this has been maintained.Now Marcus and his crew are hardly featured in the movie which is a real letdown. In the book Marcus basically stalks Ronnie but in the movie he is barely even featured. Blaze is pretty good but they definitely could have involved her more.Will played by Liam Hemsworth was pretty good I found. I'm probably a bit biased seeing that I'm an Aussie myself but as soon as he spoke I was a bit sad. Most Aussie actors these days ditch their rightful accent and the only time where I noticed his was when he tried to sing. I suppose you can't keep it out all the time. The way he played Will was... alright. Not brilliant but probably better than his gf.Overall this movie lacked the feeling of the book as it left out major scenes and plots. It was a real letdown because I walked into the cinema expecting an experience true to the book and if it had been it would have been absolutely amazing.But without a doubt this was amazingly awful. My only advice  sit down and read the book instead of wasting your money on a ticket and the unnecessary popcorn.".

And it wasn't just one element of the movie that was horrible it wasn't just the acting directing or writing. It was a combination of all those factors. The screenplay was clichd from the start. Ronnie more of a brat than a troubled teen reluctantly arrives at her dad's house along with her overenthusiastic little brother. Their divorced parents talk We hurt them you know. Ronnie walks down to the beach with a pout on her face My dad made me come down here for the summer  not like I wanna be here. She runs into a hot local guy who for some strange reason takes an interest in her despite her attitude. It's already something any 15 yearold who wanted to write a book or a screenplay could think of on their own. Then of course there are little subplots. The baby turtles  I left the theater to go get a snack that scene was getting too dumb  the friend who doesn't want to put up with domestic violence but has nowhere else to stay the return to piano playing. Besides all of this we have a girl who decides she's in love with a sweet rich boy who's too ideal for real life  he helps the environment works as a mechanic is a volleyball star lives in a huge mansion accepted to Columbia but bound for Vanderbilt in the tradition of his family. Of course Ronnie decides she's in love with Will after only a week of dating him. The next twist in the story comes when the dad Greg Kinnear was the best actor in the movie collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Ronnie bitch that she is becomes angry at her dad for lying about his disease rather than supporting him. But she reconciles with him soon enough. Now this is a complete 180 from where the girl was at the beginning of the summer. Of course a person completely changes in one summer  classic story.This movie has two plot formulas two family members who are half a step from estranged becoming gradually closer and a girl meeting a boy hating him liking him getting angry at him breaking up with him and getting back with him. Two formulas mixed together. All right so this is a very formulaic movie you get it. But as I said before that's not the only thing wrong with it. Miley Cyrus is very disappointing as an actress. Not that I think she's so talented to begin with but I thought she might have stepped it up a bit now that she's leaving behind Disney stuff for serious movies. I was so wrong. She acted like her character in Hannah Montana a brat with a sarcastic sense of humor. Her expressions during her dad's death horrible scene anyway and funeral made the saddest scenes amusing. She really has to take her acting to the next level if she wants to be taken seriously  or maybe she doesn't have the potential. Either way her acting was barely mediocre in most parts of this movie. But if you don't care about the bad acting inexperienced directing or clich screenplay by all means watch it.".

The next twist in the story comes when the dad Greg Kinnear was the best actor in the movie collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Ronnie bitch that she is becomes angry at her dad for lying about his disease rather than supporting him. But she reconciles with him soon enough. Now this is a complete 180 from where the girl was at the beginning of the summer. Of course a person completely changes in one summer  classic story.This movie has two plot formulas two family members who are half a step from estranged becoming gradually closer and a girl meeting a boy hating him liking him getting angry at him breaking up with him and getting back with him. Two formulas mixed together. All right so this is a very formulaic movie you get it. But as I said before that's not the only thing wrong with it. Miley Cyrus is very disappointing as an actress. Not that I think she's so talented to begin with but I thought she might have stepped it up a bit now that she's leaving behind Disney stuff for serious movies. I was so wrong. She acted like her character in Hannah Montana a brat with a sarcastic sense of humor. Her expressions during her dad's death horrible scene anyway and funeral made the saddest scenes amusing. She really has to take her acting to the next level if she wants to be taken seriously  or maybe she doesn't have the potential. Either way her acting was barely mediocre in most parts of this movie. But if you don't care about the bad acting inexperienced directing or clich screenplay by all means watch it.";

Now that is something Miley is simply not able to achieve!Her acting is really bad and sometimes you just want to pause the movie and start doing anything else. Anything that might distract you from what she thinks is acting.I almost did that a few times but I surprisingly managed till the end. If you liked the book I wouldn't recommend you to watch it.

The screen play was written before the book so I thought that Nicolas Sparks would have used more of what is in the book for the movie but I was really wrong. The two main characters in the movie need to learn how to act. It was so obvious that Miley Cyrus has never experienced real life or the loss of someone very dear to her. Also it seemed like the guy who played Will was only interested in the kissing in the movie. Another disappointment was how the character of Marcus was portrayed. It could have been so much better and more like the book where he pretty much stalked Ronnie. The actors that played Jonah and his dad were awesome. In short the movie could have been so much better if Mr. Sparks had taken some of what he had written in the book and put it into the movie.".

I'll actually give it to her she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker not as tweenbased character. There is always room for improvement however as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all I did find her likable for the most part.At the end of the day I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways...

	schema:reviewBody "A fitting quote that speaks volumes of The Last Song The pieces all fit together yet everything was falling apart expresses the opinions of the watchers of the movie. The Last Song another installation in the line of Nicholas Sparks' novelsturnedmovies centers on a teenage girl her summer romance and her relationship with her father. The movie features big names in acting like Greg Kinnear and Kelly Preston while spotlighting new faces in acting for example Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus. Although Cyrus is not a new celebrity name The Last Song is her first silver screen acting role. Cyrus is a big name among tween girls for her role as Hannah Montana and her singing career is starting to take off. However acting in semiserious roles or in movies at all might not be in her future. While Miley Cyrus does have a popular fan base to support her endeavors The Last Song proves that Cyrus does not have the chops to be a great or even good actress as expressed through her demeanor on screen as well as through the reviews on her acting. To illustrate the subpar acting of Cyrus the audience should pay close attention to how she acts. Even though the character of Ronnie was already a teen with a bad attitude Cyrus adds the element of bad acting. In a review for the New York Times writer A.O. Scott claims that Cyrus Most of the time she seems to be playacting rather than exploring the motives and feelings of her character. Scott is absolutely true. Cyrus mopes around on screen not really having much emotion or when she does it is sometimes exaggerated. For example when Cyrus and Hemsworth guard the turtle eggs overnight she does not really delve deeply into the emotions of her character but rather just seems to be reading the lines. Claudia Puig a reporter for USA Today reports that Cyrus sulks and sneers her way through her first dramatic role and that she has shaky dramatic bets. To counter the harsh reviews Roger Ebert a renowned movie critic believes that Cyrus seems sincere and Her acting is unaffected she can play serious. Cyrus may have some parts of the movie where she is serious like when she and Kinnear finish the song and Kinnear's funeral but most of the time she is not attached to her character. For most of The Last Song Cyrus demonstrates how unexperienced her acting truly is. An example would be when she and Hemsworth have a fight around the middle of the movie. Cyrus explains to Hemsworth why she is mad at him but Cyrus seems to not actually mean what she is saying like she is just saying it to say it. Another scene in the movie that displays her lessthan stellar acting is another scene with Hemsworth. Again she seems to be saying the lines but not meaning them or having an ounce of conviction when the lines are spoken. Whenever Cyrus and Hemsworth have a scene together which is almost every scene in the movie Cyrus never gives the impression that she feels a romantic connection between her character and Hemsworth's character. The lack of chemistry could be a result from Cyrus's unemotional acting.".

	schema:headline " A romantic comedy doesn't get better than this";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the original Sabrina before ever seeing the remake. I adored Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies and this was not an exception. Her comedic timing was perfect. She was completely believable as a young ingenue and of course she would not be Audrey Hepburn if she weren't absolutely breakthtaking on screen. But while I enjoyed the original I have seen it only once whereas I have seen the remake so many times I have lost count! The 1995 Sabrina is a gem of a film. I keep hearing myself describe it as funny but sometimes I wonder if that's even the right word. That's because except for that rather unexpected burst of laughter from Linus' secretary which cracks me up EVERY time I get to that part I have never found myself laughing aloud while watching this movie. But the humor is so cleverly written it is impossible to ignore just how charming and comical this movie is.The script is wonderfully brought to life by the outstanding cast. Harrison Ford is superb as Linus Larrabee. He plays Linus as a serious and almost ruthless businessman and yet gains our sympathy as he gradually shows a tender and vulnerable side to Linus' cool exterior. Greg Kinnear is wellcast as Linus' dish of a younger brother David. True David is selfcentered careless and carefree. But Greg Kinnear plays him with utter charm that we understand why Sabrina and women in general are so taken with him. And what of Julia Ormond? Well I think she was absolutely perfect as Sabrina. If she had felt any trepidation essaying the role that had been so closely identified with an icon like Audrey Hepburn none of her nerves translated on to the screen. She IS Sabrina. I think it's a wonderful combination of her beauty and acting skills that helped her succeed in this role. The sincerity of her performance makes Sabrina so appealing and completely lovable.The performances of the three leads are complemented by a fine supporting cast made up of John Wood Nancy Marchand Dana Ivey Richard Crenna and Angie Dickinson. Some of the film's funniest moments involve their characters. And then there is the exquisite soundtrack composed by John Williams. The score is at once dreamy and intoxicating. Two songs that were written for the movie In the Moonlight and How Can I Remember? are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies and I think Sabrina ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous marvelous film!".

To understand the true magic of Sydney Pollack's masterpiece read the Samuel A. Taylor play both films were based on. While I'm sure the play was a great evening out at the theater between martinis in the 1950s it's somewhat incredible that two film versions so profoundly translated this lightweight romantic comedy each in its own time.In 1954 Billy Wilder used an incredible cast to entertain. No Bogart should never have been cast. Cary Grant might have created the dynamic relationship with Audrey Hepburn we fortunately got to see later in Charade but if Bogart had not been cast would the film hold its classic status? Hepburn transfixed an audience and brought to the world La Vie en Rose. William Holden is period eye candy and the film will always be fun.Forty years later however Pollack made an important film. Taylor's play is after all just a fairy tale and this film fully realizes it. Ormond is enchanting. Kinnear ripens the always empty David. Fanny Ardant brings a french cinema quality to the film's Paris episodes. Marchand's I didn't teach you this culminates what may be one of the best written scenes in American film. You can watch this scene over and over and each time gain a better understanding of how great acting can define a relationship this one between mother and son for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford's tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack's mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman.It was a lie then it was a dream.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn Humphrey Bogart and William Holden directed by one of the greats of American cinema Billy Wilder is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack They Shoot Horses Don't They? 1969 Tootsie 1982 Out of Africa 1985 etc. decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.And let's just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond who was given Miss Hepburn's title role seemed nothing far removed from ordinary and Greg Kinnear who played the playboy David Larrabee seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford I told myself is another story since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman and a fine accomplished leading man. He would be I suspected the lone bright spot. In the original Humphrey Bogart a little past his prime and in not exactly the best of moods and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.He did but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur's daughter than what transpires here.Quickly here's the premise of this celluloid fairy taleromance Pretty but ordinary Sabrina born of working class parents her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers David who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age she goes away to Paris apparently to work for a fashion magazine in the original Sabrina she goes to a cooking school in Paris picks up confidence and a new kind of eyepopping sophistication comes back and...well gets noticed.The basic skeleton of this the story from the first Sabrina 1954 which is dreamily romantic enough and then some is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina's character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow's end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script trading emails perhaps They want romance they want woman's fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We've give 'em romance we'll give 'em dreams come true! And they do. Not only that but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment and they do that very cleverly.Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Fordat his best by the wayand Julia Ormond a hardworking and talented actress I recall her from Smilla's Sense of Snow 1997 who knows how to be cute without fawning supported by Greg Kinnear Nancy Marchand John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding she gets to deliver this let them eat cake line We thought we'd use recycled paper for the wedding invitations.The script is full of similar witticisms some verbal some like eye candy. For example when Sabrina removes her glasses the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan after gaining sophistication in Paris she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein America is my country and Paris is my home. Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris Texasbut that is another film and besides I digress...I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris wouldbe lover who kisses her andnoticing that she is not as engaged as she might meobserves with perfect decorum I'm embarrassed that you're somewhere else.Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way he has a number of good lines and he delivers them well.I especially liked it when he sadly confessed I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself. It is probably better if you haven't seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder's 1954 film from the play by Samuel Taylor is a little like comparing Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber's.Bottom line see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the businessfirst character of the only surviving heart donor very well and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Judge it on it's own merits and you'll come up with a winner. The interaction between the players is seamless. The dialog is witty intelligent at times touching and always believable.This Sabrina is a delight. A truly classic romantic comedy in the finest sense of the word. Harrison Ford portrays Linus Larrabee perfectly blending ruthless billionaire and socially awkward male. Flawless in business matters he's out of his element and totally unprepared for the consequences of what he originally deems a simple matter turning Sabrina Fairchild's interest to himself instead of brother David Greg Kinnear thereby saving both an impending marriage and lucrative corporate merger.Julia Ormond's Sabrina is just the right mixture of sophistication and innocence. Daughter of the Larrabee's chauffeur she's grown up on the family estate yet outside of their social circle of course. Passionately in love with youngest son David Larrabee we see her in the movie's opening moments hard at her favorite pastime spying on David and fantasizing that she is the girl he's currently schmoozing at mother Maude's annual birthday bash. Her father Thomas Fairchild John Wood in an effort to broaden her horizons and get her past this obsession with David arranges with Maude Nancy Marchand to send Sabrina to Paris for a year. He hopes she will learn about life and independence while working in the Paris offices of Vogue.While Sabrina is away David meets beautiful Elizabeth Tyson Lauren Holly up and coming pediatrician. Coincidentally she is the daughter of Patrick Tyson Richard Crenna owner of Tyson Electronics a high technology firm that Linus has had his eye on for some time. As his brother's relationship blossoms Linus quietly begins buying up Tyson stock.To Linus everything seems to be proceeding as it should be. David and Elizabeth have finally set a date. He and Patrick Tyson are in serious merger negotiations. Maude and Ingrid Tyson Angie Dickenson are planning their children's monster wedding. All is about to change however. A year has passed. Once again Maude's birthday party approaches. It's also time for Sabrina to come home.Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job mixing just the right recipe of romance and comedy throughout. We the audience are just as stunned as the movie's characters at the new Sabrina. With a Parisian haircut in chic black with enormous sunglasses she is nearly as unrecognizable to us as she obviously is to David. In town to pick up a gift for his mother David ever the playboy offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it's Sabrina and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery David invites her to his house for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove NY whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus who never misses much also sees trouble. Big trouble judging by the smitten look on his brother's face. Thomas Fairchild in turn watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude's party doesn't like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude's party arrives complete with a live band perfect weather It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee's wouldn't have allowed it... and this time as an invited guest Sabrina.Admittedly there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word beautiful is but a pale description. Even so I would put Ormand's Sabrina on the party's walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is literally breathtaking. And David to the panicked concern of his mother and brother is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That's enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You'll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond Nancy Marchand's Maude is acerbically intelligent blending wealthy arrogance Can't we SEND somebody? and human compassion for Sabrina with a deep love and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly's Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack Linus' watchdog assistant But he PAYS me to tell him.... Some of the movie's best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant's kitchen particularly those with Rosa Miriam Colon.So in conclusion I emphatically urge you to rent or better still buy this film. Though the BogartHepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion I'm sure you'll find it entertaining heartwarming and absolutely leisure time well spent!".

In town to pick up a gift for his mother David ever the playboy offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it's Sabrina and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery David invites her to his house for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove NY whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus who never misses much also sees trouble. Big trouble judging by the smitten look on his brother's face. Thomas Fairchild in turn watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude's party doesn't like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude's party arrives complete with a live band perfect weather It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee's wouldn't have allowed it... and this time as an invited guest Sabrina.Admittedly there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word beautiful is but a pale description. Even so I would put Ormand's Sabrina on the party's walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is literally breathtaking. And David to the panicked concern of his mother and brother is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That's enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You'll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond Nancy Marchand's Maude is acerbically intelligent blending wealthy arrogance Can't we SEND somebody? and human compassion for Sabrina with a deep love and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly's Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack Linus' watchdog assistant But he PAYS me to tell him.... Some of the movie's best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant's kitchen particularly those with Rosa Miriam Colon.So in conclusion I emphatically urge you to rent or better still buy this film. Though the BogartHepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion I'm sure you'll find it entertaining heartwarming and absolutely leisure time well spent!";

However having said all that when such a seemingly familiar film is as well made and as beautifully scripted and acted as Sabrina it's hard not to be swept along with it and to enjoy every minute.

Ormond makes an extremely engaging leading lady perfect for the role of Sabrina. I particularly enjoyed Sabrina's mirthful reaction to seeing Linus put on the baseball cap while he's trying to win her affection. Also very funny was Linus' effortless recognition of the newlook Sabrina thus revealing her identity to a confused David. John Willliams also contributes a nice score. This is a classy romantic comedy well worth watching.".

Absolutely nothing works for Pollack or new screenwriters Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel. This sort of film just does not suit the style that so complimented the likes of While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle. There are so many things wrong with this pic I could go on forever about what has no effect.Harrison Ford is no Bogart. Though I consider him to be a fine actor Sabrina is proof he is not a romantic lead. Ford is unable to make any impact as hardnosed business man Linus Larrabee and everything he tries fails including all his comic moments and any intimate scenes with Julia Ormond who by the way is no Audrey Hepburn. Miss Ormond is no more Sabrina than Danny De Vito is Conan. She cannot even begin to do anything with this character if only because hers and every other character are all so out of place in the nineties. In fact this is one of the biggest mistakes that Benedek and Rayfiel have made in setting this definitive 50's romance in the modern era. Big miscalculation. That is what the whole show turns out to be.Ford and Ormond create zero chemistry and he looks old enough to be her aging father at least 30 years older. You just can't believe him feel sorry for her or buy into any aspect of their relationship. Flick struggles to be funny throughout and none of the cast is able to rescue resurrect or otherwise resuscitate this floundering very lost film. What did Pollack think he was doing? Surely he of all people should have known to leave this doomed remake well alone.Entire cast struggle to communicate character motivation and little else including Paris scenery can help this misplaced poorly judged dead weight. One of the most disappointing remakes I have ever seen.Saturday February 17 1996  Greater Union Melbourne".

If they wanted to convey that he was old then it would have been better to have had him dressed in three piece suits waistcoat as well as jacket with a tie not that stupid bow tie business. That was far too old for the character. He also could have been wearing bifocal glasses which would have made him older. I don't know why they killed off the father perhaps because they couldn't find someone who would intimidate Ford.I did think that the film shouldn't have ended where it did you should have been given a glimpse of the life that Linus and Sabrina had in Europe.

I've seen the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn Humphrey Bogart and William Holden and I have to say that this version does not at all compare. In fact this version has me wondering if the filmmakers even saw the original.SPOILERSThe movie has so many flaws that I can point out more than just a few. In the original Sabrina goes to Paris to study cooking and the night before she leaves she tries to kill herself. In the hideous remake she goes to Paris to work for Vogue I know the story had to be slightly updated but this is ridiculous and there is no suicide attempt. Also in the original Audrey Hepburn portrays Sabrina with a certain confidence and certainty while Julia Ormond's performance makes Sabrina more neurotic and overanxious than ever. The filmmakers also thought it fit to destroy the character of Mr. Larrabee and to make his wife now a widow a representative of the company. Lastly while the ending in the original leaves much to the imagination ending just as Sabrina and Linus meet on the boat the remake decided to take it a step further and create about 10 minutes of dialogue between the two actors. I cannot stress enough the dismay I felt while viewing this cinematic disgrace. If you want the real story stick to the black and white classic because a remake is not always better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harrison Ford takes on the Humphrey Bogart role in the Sidney Pollack remake of Billy Wilder's 1954 SABRINA. Greg Kinnear plays his younger brother and Julia Ormond plays Sabrina the freespirited daughter of the chauffeur for the massive estate run by Ford and his mommy Nancy Marchand. Sabrina comes home from a long stay in Paris at an awkward moment for the wealthy family and it is up to the stuffy aloof Ford to persuade her to return to Paris. Ford is much too old for his role although he is very convincing in his portrayal of an obsessed business tycoon. You'd almost think he was appearing in another movie something involving say a murder or kidnaping. Ormond is not nearly appealing as Audrey Hepburn from the original and in fact she is less appealing than her costar Lauren Holly who plays a doctor soon to marry Kinnear. So I don't buy that Ford eventually falls for Ormond at all. I also didn't give a hoot about the details of the family business. Kinnear who is actually pretty funny as Harrison's kid brother is inexplicably left out of the entire middle of the movie so that it can focus on Ford wooing the confused Sabrina who thinks she loves Kinnear but then decides she loves Ford. Yuck. Imagine kissing the wrinklyfaced Ford. I would have some fun with Ormond's lackluster performance and undistinguished appearance right about here but instead let it be said that it simply was a bad idea to remake this film. SABRINA 1995 was not Ormond's fault.".

Likewise as effective as Greg Kinnear is in the role of David he's up against Bill Holden being Bill Holden seducing the camera as effectively as he did Miss Hepburn in real life.I suppose it's controversial to favorably compare Harrison Ford with Bogie but so be it Ford wins the Linus Larrabee contest and Lauren Holly gets more out of the small role of Elizabeth Tyson than Martha ever dreamed. She gives more insight into the personality of the bridetobe with an arched eyebrow than Miss Hyer could have with another 100 words of dialogue.John Williams wins a close photo finish against John Wood in the Tom Fairchild 'Stakes while on the same card Dana Ivey delivers a ten length rout over Ellen Corby as Linus' assistant Miss McCardle Mack.

Walter Hampden's performance as Oliver Larrabee could very well be unimpeachable so the 1995 production eliminated his part entirely and built up Nella Walker's part as Maude Larrabee and cast Nancy Marchand in the role. She's absolutely wonderful! As much as Holden was playing an all too familiar role Marchand may have just redonned the old shoes she wore for 114 episodes as Margaret Pynchon. No matter she's right on the money as the matriarch of the Larrabee clan. Her ability to portray a woman who comfortably wear the mantle of power has in my mind never been in question. Even when Marchand was losing her final battle with cancer Livia Soprano the puppeteer was still exercising control over the members of her family. We lost a great character actor when she died. Final score? 1954  8 1995  10. A wonderful film.".

I suggest that the state of moviemaking has in fact declined as the art form has given way to popular sentiment overthetop portrayals of characters and remakes which attempt to market themselves on previous successful attempts.  To say that someone who repainted a Michaelangelo has made it somewhat made it better because painting has evolved is equally as stupid as saying any remake improves. And while Audrey Hepburn is not the world's finest actress she has a unique cinematic quality which cannot be imitated or reproduced much like her costars in this film.

But the biggest anachronism for me is how Sabrina's value and happiness Is portrayed as resting solely in her looks and poise. I mean the poor girl seems to have no identity in her own right.

Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep as the assistant photographer. In the original it is not deep or detailed either but at least it is done in a fun lighthearted way at the cooking school.the dialogsthey were painful dull and the selfawareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father.I felt sad for Harrison Ford because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place.I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing?  In the old times they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today we over explain. An example. In the old version when we are first introduced to the Larabees we see a painting of the family on the wall then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride the arrogance of a rich family the annoyed expression of Bogart the delighted smile of his brother the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version we have a painfully long explanation of who is who showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending where Linus gets on the boat asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads.I could go on and on scene by scene from the chauffeur to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.".

Maybe the determination of our sex at conception is as arbitrary as whether the zoo was open or not. What we do know is that in the beginning all humans start out being women.Kakera A Piece of our Life is an emotionallycharged independent film about the budding relationship between two women. Haru Mitsushima Hikari of Love Exposure fame is a quiet oddball college student dealing with a boyfriend who is with another woman and only uses Haru for sex. Riko Nakamura Eriko is an enthusiastic excitable prostheticist who prefers women because they are soft and cuddly as she states in one scene. They meet quite randomlyin a coffee shop Haru is drinking her mocha and ends up with a cute chocolate mustache. Riko is immediately smitten.I must begin with the performances. Both actresses are absolutely phenomenal. Mitsushima Hikari is great as usual playing an offbeat yet quiet character. This is a departure for her as she is usually the loud one. As director Ando Momoko has stated Mitsushima was willing to do anything she asked even excitedly growing out her facial and underarm hair. Mitsushima's character Haru is portrayed as the opposite of attractiveshown going the bathroom wearing strange clothes with facial and armpit hair etc. This obviously upset her fan club as the heads of it attended the first screening and according to Ando came up to her furious about how Mitsushima was portrayed she used to be of the pure cute cuddly idoltype. I give major props to Mitsushima for courageously committing to her characters and her acting career.Nakamura Eriko is impressive as well. I had previously seen her in the film Shikyu no Kioku 2007 where she played a quiet cute young college student in a small role. She like Mitsushima reversed her typical charactertype in Kakera playing the tough loud enthusiastic Riko. I don't know if I've ever seen a performance quite like Nakamura's she makes you feel her happiness her excitement along with her. There is also a haunting brilliant short performance by Katase Rino as a depressed lonely older woman in need of a prosthetic breast.Kakera is Ando Momoko's first film and she is definitely a young talent to watch out for. The daughter of Okuda Eiji and sister of Ando Sakura cinema is definitely a family affairthough she prefers to do things her own way. Her camera is varied delivering many important still shots slow tracking shots extreme close ups of faces and an intimate styling when needed. It ends up as a refreshing experience. The visuals are deliberately dull and monotone with certain colors popping out for special effect. James Iha of Smashing Pumpkins contributes to the score and delivers fitting quiet atmospheric and progressive music that highlights the light bouncy and uplifting yet sometimes sad though never dark quality of the film.There are both some extremely powerful and totally irrelevant scenes included in the film. One scene in particular is striking in its use of background imagery to deliver an emotionally tied message. Haru had decided to tell her boyfriend that they were over but after delivering the message falls over and lands facefirst on the floor. She rolls over and says I'm done then lays there and allows the guy to have his way with her as she hums mindlessly to herself. Meanwhile a war documentary is playing in the background guns firing and bombs exploding. This emphasizes the turmoil and chaos both in Haru's mind and in the scene as a whole. Another scene where a thrown bottle transforms into a twoheaded pigeon is completely irrelevant and removes the viewer from the reality of the filmespecially with the cheap CG used.Kakera is a deeply engrossing and thoughtprovoking film that seeks to show that gender doesn't matter when it comes to love it's about finding yourself and looking at the person inside. Haru and Riko's relationship is a normal one they experience things that any normal couple would experience. Just as Riko fills up prosthetic pieces she also fills up Haru's heart and helps her move through her rocky relationship with her boyfriend however they are not immune to typical relationship woes. The actresses had fun making this movieyou can tell because they infect you as well causing wide smiles to magically appear on your face.I'll leave you with a little quote of wisdom from the film Favorite foods are better eaten a little at a time. Remember it.".

Haru's dead end relationship with a guy however doesn't immediately make her succumb to Riko's charms which I think is probably the best thing about the film. Its a wonder not more films explore the nature of uncertainty in love and affection like this one. That the film has no intentions of being preachy or politically correct is also a minor revelation.

	schema:reviewBody "In the Making of documentary on the Love Exposure DVD director Sono Sion says to Hikari Mitsushima You're an actress. You're supposed to move us. Move us you idiot! She must have taken it to heart. She was great in Love Exposure and she's the main reason I like this film. She doesn't have a lot of dialog in A Piece of Our Life but she is constantly communicating through body language and projecting her internals. That's something good actors do.A Piece of Our Life is a story about two very different young women who end up spending time together. It's not a lesbian story per se. There are no makeout scenes or naked bodies entwined in soft focus. No politics. The two protagonists just happen to be women. That's a healthy notion and could have made for a much better movie if one of the women didn't actually have to tell us that. It's not about if you're a man or a woman. You should have someone who you think feels good might sound like words of wisdom but to me they sound like words from a director who is afraid her audience won't get it unless she spells it out.There are many subtle and wonderful details in A Piece of Our Life such as when Riko Eriko Nakamura the aggressive and confident one asks Haru Hikari Mitsushima if she liked their kiss for friendship and Haru says No and the scene cuts away. Haru's response isn't one of objection or disgust. It's just simple and honest even if born a bit from surprise. But there are also a few details that are just plain wrong such as why does the quiet woman who's probably never imagined dating another woman before have to start out being in a relationship with an jerkball a guy with terrible table manners who uses her only for sex while he openly has another girlfriend on the side? That seems like a cheap and lazy juxtaposition against Riko's declaration that she likes women because they're soft and cuddly and they smell nice. It snuggles up to close to the tired idea that women only choose other women after they've become thoroughly disgusted by disgusting men.I also think Riko's character was a lot smarter than the way she acts every time the couple interacts with a third party when Haru's exboyfriend comes over when a man approaches Haru in the nightclub when Riko shows up at Haru's university party. Riko acts childish and jealous. This seems at odds with the maturity Riko shows when dealing with her other girlfriend I can't fulfill the hollow you have in your heart. There are a lot of things to like about this film. It's got a simple honest and wonderful vision which it explores with some effectiveness and the two lead performances are outstanding. But it could have been a really really great film instead of just a really good one if it would have practiced what it preaches and left out more of the stuff we've seen heard and grown tired of before. Momoko Ando is a young director to keep an eye on. A Piece of Our Life is one of the best and brightest films I've seen recently. My criticisms are born of a frustration that the director came just short of making an otherworldly masterpiece by adding in elements she just wanted to make a point of rather than letting the world of the film dictate the boundaries.".

From Forsyth's first and probably best book written in less than 5 weeks this film contains nothing that does not drive the story forward. The character of the Jackal is brilliantly finely drawn. He doesn't contain any of the cliches that you would expect to see in a film written in the last twenty years he doesn't display mental instability or have flashbacks to some event in his past. He never tries to justify his pernicious occupation to anyone yet strangely doesn't come across as an evil man. Simply as a professional doing his job. The French police inspector is wonderfully underplayed and is as far away from the hebreakstherulesbuthegetsthejobdone cliche as you can possibly imagine. He is first seen attending to his pigeons and upon being told he is being put on the case simply says Oh God.......Zimmemann's direction is great and the scenes are beautifully photographed  particularly in Paris.This is an alltime great film. Definitely in my top ten. I suppose I must put something in negative so it makes for a balanced review so errr.... I think the French minister is wearing a very bad wig. Beyond that marvelous.".

He is first seen attending to his pigeons and upon being told he is being put on the case simply says Oh God.......Zimmemann's direction is great and the scenes are beautifully photographed  particularly in Paris.This is an alltime great film. Definitely in my top ten. I suppose I must put something in negative so it makes for a balanced review so errr.... I think the French minister is wearing a very bad wig. Beyond that marvelous.";

	schema:headline " Suspenseful Wonderfully Straightforward Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "1963 France. French President Charles De Gaulle Adrien CaylaLegrand has decided after a popular referendum to allow the North African nation of Algeria independence from France. This action leads to the death of hundreds of French residence in Algeria and bloody conflict which extends to Europe as disgruntled French army officers form the OAS a terrorist group which strives to assassinate De Gaulle. After a failed attempt on the President's life the leaders of the OAS are tried and executed and the organization is in tatters. The surviving leaders of the OAS hire a professional assassin Edward Fox codenamed the Jackal to assassinate De Gaulle. Using a bewildering array of disguises false passports and other tricks the Jackal works his way through Europe being tracked by a frantic French bureaucracy led by milquetoast Police Commissioner Lebel Michael Lonsdale. It's up to Lebel to find and stop the Jackal before August 25th Liberation Day when the assassin will make his move.Based on the gripping if very long novel by Frederick Forsyth Fred Zinneman's Day of the Jackal is one of the best of its genre. It succeeds largely because as Roger Ebert said it knows exactly what it's talking about. Though fictional the film's look and feel gives it an air of authenticity that few if any other thrillers could hope to match. The film has an almost documentary air about it which is one of the major reasons it is so successful.Much of the credit is due to director Fred Zinneman. Despite having a lengthy career making such classics as High Noon From Here to Eternity and A Man for All Seasons Zinneman is generally overlooked when it comes to great directors. Certainly it's understandable why. Zinneman's films typically do not contain much in the way of flair or flash at least when it comes to photography. Zinneman's direction is straightforward unpretentious with no fancy camera angles he allows the script sets actors and action on screen to do the work. This might not be the accomplished method of film making but it works wonders in Zinneman's best films particularly here. The lack of stylization creates the aforementioned feel that this story could happen in real life.Other elements contribute to the film's success. The lengthy indepth and almost labyrinthine source novel is reduced by screenwriter Kenneth Ross into succinct economic dialog which conveys as much information with as little verbiage as possible. Georges Delerue's score functions much the same as his work in Zinneman's A Man for All Seasons. There is little actual music other than diegetic music from marching bands or street musicians which adds immeasurably the look and feel of the movie.What makes or breaks the film however is the cast and this film is truly unique in its acting. The film recruits a huge very talented cast of actors from both sides of the English Channel and every performance is wonderfully understated free of histrionics or theatricality which makes the film all the more believable.Edward Fox is marvelous in the title role. He plays the assassin as the ultimate detached professional unconcerned about politics or individuals he simply does his job and does it well. He can be counted on for results. He is neither arrogant nor cocky just an expert who knows what he's doing and will go any length to achieve it. Fox is completely utterly and chillingly believable as the Jackal and one is torn between rooting for him to succeed or for him to get caught.Also fantastic is the Jackal's nemesis Commissioner Lebel who is played in an equally understated performance by Michael Lonsdale. Lebel is not an action hero nor particularly exciting he is a nofrills straightforward police inspector who uses his brains intuition skill and more than a bit of luck to track down the Jackal. Lonsdale and Fox give two of the most utterly believable performances ever captured on film a testament to both actors.The rest of the cast follows suit although few of the other characters have as much screen time. Cyril Cusack plays the charming gunsmith who builds the Jackal's perfect weapon Delphine Seyrig is a middleaged Frenchwoman who begins an illadvised affair with the assassin Derek Jacobi is Lebel's dedicated assistant Tony Britton as the crusty Scotland Yard investigator who gives Lebel his first break in the case Jean Martin and Eric Porter play the desperate OAS members forced to hire an outsider to do their dirty work. These are just a few of the many fine performers in the film and all give wellrounded believable performances.The Day of the Jackal is a brilliant thriller that still holds up well almost 35 years later. By capturing the essence of 1960's France and by creating a completely believable atmosphere Zinneman draws the viewer into the film. It is unlikely that the viewer will be able to lose interest as the plot moves along. A brilliant thriller and a masterpiece for all time.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Zinneman the director has put out some pretty low brow stuff like High Noon but it's all done with craftsmanship. This one is just about the opposite of High Noon a thriller in which not a moment is wasted. Everything that happens is relevant to the plot and concise. Not only is the movie built around direct cuts from one scene to another distant one the cuts are made on actions sometimes actions that are only half completed. You have to keep your eyes open. If you blink at the wrong time for instance you're liable to miss the way Edward Fox gets hold of Per Lindquist's Danish passport.It's a battle of wits between the hired coldblooded assassin Fox who is out to kill Charles DeGaulle and the team of French detectives and generals who are out to stop him. Fox eludes them with invention and foresight but detective in charge Lonsdale doggedly track him down. I don't suppose it's giving much away to reveal that Fox does not succeed in assassinating DeGaulle since all interested parties must already know that DeGaulle died of a heart attack. The headlines of the Philadelphia Examiner were unforgettable  DeGaulle Keels Over later amended to DeGaulle Drops Dead. The movie spells out the details by which Fox acquires his different identities and how and why he changes them. If you don't know how to get a false passport watch this and find out. There are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of locations but not once are we confused about what's happening or why. It's a splendid script. The acting is professional all around. David Hardwicke is tucked away in a small part. Michael Lonsdale as the detective has the proper proletarian face and modest demeanor. Fox has the necessary Saville Row certainty. And what a life he leads! Driving around the Riviera and the Maritime Alps in his sporty Alfa Romeo convertible lodging in the finest hotels boffing the elegant but foolish Delphine Seyrig earning a cool half million for one job  and this in the days when the dollar was worth something murdering anyone who gets in his way. The kind of life any normal person would give an arm and a leg to lead.And it all goes down as smoothly as a draught of Pepto Bismol. There is only one brief exchange of gunfire at the end. There are no fist fights or assaults. Fox kills a couple of people in the course of his journey but they're all over quickly sometimes off screen or in shadows. Nobody loses his or her temper. No one shouts at anyone else. The humor and there ARE a few amusing moments is subdued.If I were teaching a class in film appreciation I would show Zinneman's version back to back with the more recent The Jackal with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis. The final exam would consist of one question. Which did you prefer? Then I would flunk everybody who chose the later version.Bruce Willis changes his identity in a whimsical way. In every scene he seems to wear a different wig or something. Fox assumes only three false identities an English tourist a Danish schoolteacher and a French veteran. And we understand precisely why he MUST change identities. Fox's murder weapon is a cleverly constructed .22 caliber rifle a stark miniature. Willis's murder weapon is a gigantic cannon that looks capable of taking out a tank or maybe a battleship. Everything in the later film is both overblown and sloppy a Gongoristic mess. Compared to the WillisGere film Zinneman's High Noon was an exercise in sophistication. My God what's happening to us?".

The humor and there ARE a few amusing moments is subdued.If I were teaching a class in film appreciation I would show Zinneman's version back to back with the more recent The Jackal with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis. The final exam would consist of one question. Which did you prefer? Then I would flunk everybody who chose the later version.Bruce Willis changes his identity in a whimsical way. In every scene he seems to wear a different wig or something. Fox assumes only three false identities an English tourist a Danish schoolteacher and a French veteran. And we understand precisely why he MUST change identities. Fox's murder weapon is a cleverly constructed .22 caliber rifle a stark miniature. Willis's murder weapon is a gigantic cannon that looks capable of taking out a tank or maybe a battleship. Everything in the later film is both overblown and sloppy a Gongoristic mess. Compared to the WillisGere film Zinneman's High Noon was an exercise in sophistication. My God what's happening to us?";

	schema:reviewBody "With the growing impatience of the modern filmgoer it's no wonder people can't watch this film today. It's long. There's no music. People don't talk enough. The violence isn't bloody. The photography is very boring. The ending sucked. These were just a few of the complaints that I received upon screening this to about 50 high school students at a recent film club meeting. It was my week to show a movie and I wondered how people might respond to this. Well we started with 50 and by the end there were about 7 kids left. Allow me to explain.This film has a very specific look and feel for its time. Set in the early sixties we follow a fictionalized account of an assassination attempt on the life of Charles De Gaul. The OAR a conservative underground movement angry about De Gaul's ending of the war in Algeria decides they must take back power. Ultimately almost all of their attempts have failed so in desperation the OAS decides to hire an outside assassin to eliminate De Gaul. At the time this scared viewers the thought of controlling and altering government through illegal action. In a way it's comparable to Grisham's Runaway Jury in the sense that the law has few boundaries when change is wanted. The OAS hires the Jackal played with dry cool by Edward Fox an amazing underground assassin with a reputation preceding him even if he isn't supposed to exist. Now in accordance with the IMDb's rules concerning spoilers and revealing the ending I won't divulge much in the ways of plot but I must say this is an excellently crafted piece of political thriller. From the novel by Frederick Forsyth and scripted by Kenneth Ross the script merely acts as a smart guideline for the action. Fred Zinnemann directing his first film in several years observes the actions of The Jackal and the French Secret Service's attempts to capture the Jackal with a carefully detached eye. He pays close attention to detail much like the Jackal leaving little room for error. Several people complained that the direction was boring but really it's very smart in its simplicity. Zinnemann allows for his actors and action to play out in very realistic manner giving the film an engaging sense of time making its viewers engaged in what's happening. The straight no nonsense photography and lack of music add to that feel giving this film much more credibility. Oh and the settings utilized incredibly well too. The only noticeable style in this film is the editing in its creation of clever transitions like cutting shots while using the previous soundtrack. Michael Lonsdale plays the head detective for the French Secret Service with collected calm. Highly aware and patient he creates a smart and understated hero for the film. Meanwhile on the other side of the political scandal we have Edward Fox's Jackal a super cool highly resourceful and highly aware individual. He too practices the art of patience and at any set back he's able to resourcefully able to work his out of it. But don't try to negotiate with Mr. Jackal because if he must come to it he has no qualms about hurting someone in order to protect himself. A very amoral if not fascinating antihero for this film.The film was released in July of 1973 as an action thriller for Universal labeled as dime a dozen action flick by publications such as the New York Times. Yet its gained longevity because of it's it tight plotting nuanced performances realistic action and dark and unusual humor this film will live far beyond its years. This film transcends the typical Hollywood action genre by being smarter than the average thriller and by patiently waiting for the Jackal's next move it's hard not to finish this movie. Some might speak of Michael CatonJones 1997 remake favorably but the only reason people may think it's any good at all is because of impaired judgment from excessive repeat viewings on USA network... But seriously while the remake is violent stylized and dull the original is engaging smart and thoughtful. My only complaint is the ending's similarities to the original Manchurian Candidate's finale. But even so this film has a satisfying conclusion.To those who think that is long and boring try sitting through this with an open mind. Unfortunately modern audiences have tricked into thinking that good filmmaking consists if gritty realistic violence like Gladiator or irritatingly hyperactive style and pace like The Matrix. This is film of great substance and intrigue. I'm 18 and in high school and even I was willing to give this a chance and it's one of my favorite films because of that. It's movie making in the true sense of the word because it shows you a story. So please forget about your MTV or Jerry Bruckheimer produced material and try something thoughtful and interesting. This may be long by today's standards but it's well worth the wait in the end. Blake Goble film watcher maker and addict".

Nevertheless they hire the best detective in all of France Commissioner Claude Lebel Michael Lonsdale to discover the identify of the killer before he kills the president. Derek Jacobi plays Caron his assistant and both men have the impossible task of finding a nearly invisible man. While the police are informed of his task they do not know much else and therefore allow the Jackal to find a perfect location for the deed. Once in place the assassin waits for his target who is precisely on time and only a few seconds separates the two cops from their quarry. The entire film is well paced as is the storyline. The acting is superb and contains some well known actors like Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith Alan Badel Tony Britton Adrien CaylaLegrand as The President and Maurice Denham as General Colbert. It is easy to recommend this film and the selection of Edward Fox was a stroke of genius. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie turned up on TCM last night and I found it to be outstanding. The movie has a very handsome look with terrific shots of Paris and Italy. The lead actors Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale are actors that are rarely seen by American audiences which I thought helped the viewer really get into the suspense of the film.  This is unquestionably Edward Fox's most memorable performance.The movie is extremely suspenseful even though the viewer knows that the Jackel will not be able to assassinate Charles de Gaulle.  While there were several assassination attempts against de Gaulle he survived them all so you know the Jackel will fail.  Even though you know that it is fascinating to see the Jackel assemble his false identities his weapon his forged papers as he methodically and dispassionately goes about his trade as the world's finest assassin.  Michael Lonsdale is also outstanding as the premier French detective who is given carte blanche by the government to hunt down the Jackel by any means necessary.  The movie is set in 1963 and so it is a bit jarring to listen to the cops talk about how they will be getting a copy of the Jackel's fake passport that evening as it is flown to them from Britainhow did they get along without faxes and computers?  Given the tenor of our times with every sensible nation turning things upside down to find terrorists it is interesting to see how authorities try to stop an assassin forty years ago. Throughout the movie the Jackel remains an enigma.  Other than getting a ton of money we have no idea why he's an assassin.  The Jackel also takes some extraordinary riskstaking time to seduce a Frenchwoman while he knows the cops are hot on his trail and then going back to her only to murder her after she reveals to him that the cops have already approached her about him.  Then even though he has half the fee already in the bank the Jackel continues on with the assignment even though he could easily back out of it. Knowing that the police are searching every hotel in Paris he brilliantly goes to ground by going to a gay bathhouse and spending the night at a man's apartment.  Is the Jackel bisexual gay or is he simply doing what is necessary to stay out of sight?  This is a terrific movie all around and very superior to more recent suspense movies.".

OAS was a terrorist group formed by French vets of the War of Argelia and committing terrorist acts preferentially after its independence Evian1962. The Minister Alan Badel assigns the mission to locate Jackal  being appointed his best investigator named Lebel Michael Lonsdale and assisted by his helper Derek Jacobi. The film develops the preparation of the assassination including identity forge weapons purchase among others.This is an interesting thriller lavishly produced by John Woolf who after that he made Odessa file also by Frederick Forsyth. It's full of action tense high intrigue and is very entertaining. From the beginning to the end the tension and suspense is continued . In spite of the fact that the runtime is overlong is neither tiring  nor dull  but thrilling . Cool performance by Edward Fox as elegant and cunning murderer. All star cast formed by prestigious secondary actors as French  Michael Lonsdale Michel Auclair Alan Badel and British  Cryil Cusack Maurice Denham Eric Porter Timothy WestRonald Pickup Donald Sinden and others uncredited almost extras Edward Hardwicke  Andrea Ferreol Feodor Atkine and Howard Vernon. And marvelous secondary actresses as Olga GeorgesPicot and Delphyne Seyrig and including some of nudism. Beautifully photographed by expert cameraman Jean Tourneir. Suspenseful and atmospheric musical score by George Delerue.The motion picture is stunningly directed by Fred Zinnemann who had a lot of experience from his formers classic films as High Noon From here to eternity Man for all seasons  among them. Rating  Very Good  better than average. It was such fine movie that had a great success at the box office. It's remade in 1997 by Michael CatonJones with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis as Jackal but is inferior version and bears only slight resemblance to the original movie.".

From an virtual unknown in the title role and unmodulated if implicit scenes of homosexuality to daring to run for over 2 hours largely without music this is another exhilarating winner from this richest of movie years.I think what I like most about the film is its pace. The economy with which Zinneman tells the story is stripped right down. There is no patronising voiceover or scriptembedded exposition. Consequently those moments where we're not entirely sure what's happening act as moments of suspense not so much twists as notches in the grain of the plot. It's a wonderful organic piece of thrillernarrative filmmaking.Edward Fox is as horribly calculating and driven as Zinneman could possibly have hoped really compounding the cad of The GoBetween that hastened his casting. Michael Lonsdale's pursuing detective Lebel is brilliantly understated as his humble doppelganger. It amuses me to think what Lebel would have made of his extrovert contemporary Jimmy Doyle in the second French Connection film! The smattering of ohso familiar British acting talent also invest the long list of tropes with real character  there is a super unobtrusive sense of ennui pride professionalism and mordant humour even in the briefest of exchanges. No doubt the naturalism of location and nonacting extras rubbed off on the pros. I also feel inclined to mention the marvellous performance of Delphine Seyrig managing function beauty and pathos in her 2 12 short scenes as Madame de Montpellier.For all that the cast understand the nature of the film and inhabit it so fluently it's Zinneman's attention to all the detail that's so satisfying. There are more wonderful location views than in any Bond film but shot with a marvellous photographer's sense of their innate value  they are not presented for the viewer like trophies. I cannot imagine that Paul Greengrass our contemporaneous master of shakycam actionthriller realism cannot have absorbed the wellexecuted 'verit' of this film as an early initiation of his own art. I also admire one or two of the stunts. Above all I simply love the Liberation Day set piece which is almost symphonic in its editing construction crescending masterfully into the longawaiting climax of this fantastic film. 910".

Casting Edward Fox as the assassin codenamed Jackal is probably one of the best decision in film history.

The film turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse when the French authorities learn of the plot but not wanting to create a panic only one man Comissioner Lebel Michael Lonsdale is given permission to find him. Lebel in many ways is similar to the Jackal he doesn't look like your average cop but he is incredibly professional and diligent.The film sticks faithfully to the early 1960s and is shot very stylishly going to the real locations from Genoa the French Rivieria and Paris. Zinneman's direction is also very precise everything you see on screen has a meaning nothing is superfluous and although it's fairly long the film builds gradually to a climax rather than jumping in.Please don't even consider the terrible 1997 remake stick with the original and enjoy".

In the film the OAS tries again this time using a simpler plan one involving a lone gunman a professional killer who calls himself ... the jackal Edward Fox. The jackal is the archetype of the modern political sniper. The screenplay and Fox's performance present him as suave sophisticated intelligent resourceful and methodical. He is a risk taker. All of which makes him extremely dangerous because he has no moral scruples.We watch the jackal as he prepares meticulously for his assignment. As the clock ticks toward the moment of kill the plot alternates between the jackal's daily logistics and the frantic efforts of Detective Lebel Michael Lonsdale hot on the jackal's trail but always one step behind him. Kenneth Ross' efficient screenplay and Fred Zinnemann's expert direction create a film with steadily building suspense.In lieu of unnecessary background music sound effects engender a sense of realism and immediacy. The ticking of a clock the sound of footsteps or doors opening and closing help to place the viewer in the scene as a silent partner. The use of echoes further heightens the already elevated suspense. And adroit cinematography creates menacing visuals characterized by dark backgrounds creepy overhead lights and noirish shadows. Augmenting all of this the film's minimal dialogue attention to detail in production design and costumes the excellent acting and the brilliant editing seal the film's deserved reputation as a film of unusually high technical quality. The overall result for the viewer is a truly suspenseful and realistic story not easily forgotten.My only significant complaint is the film's strange climax. I personally found it to be elliptically counterintuitive. Notwithstanding this The Day Of The Jackal deserves a very high recommendation for viewers wanting to see a political thriller along the lines of Three Days Of The Condor or The Parallax View.".

The guy even wears an ascot for god's sake! Most people today don't even know what an ascot is. He carefully plots his moves and is methodical in his precision. He kills with cool detachment. If he had Willis' assignment he would have gotten it done.But he had to deal with the European versions of the CIAFBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations. With just a thread the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey. It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time.That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully.If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects then this is the film for you.".

The guy even wears an ascot for god's sake! Most people today don't even know what an ascot is. He carefully plots his moves and is methodical in his precision. He kills with cool detachment. If he had Willis' assignment he would have gotten it done.But he had to deal with the European versions of the CIAFBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations. With just a thread the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey. It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time.That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully.If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects then this is the film for you.";

	schema:headline " Coldly efficient like it's central character";
	schema:reviewBody "Much like the novel from which it was based on The Day of the Jackal is a detailed compelling and cold thriller. Frederick Forsyth has never been an author who imbues his characters with much humanity or depth he is much more adept with presenting technical and political aspects in fine detail. This served him very well in the case of The Day of the Jackal a novel that not only was detailed in these ways but also was primarily about a cold calculated professional killer whose lack of depth or real identity was actually a positive for the story. In other words this story was perfectly suited to Forsyth's style.For those who don't know the film is set in 1963 and is about a French rightwing political group who want president Chares de Gaulle assassinated because of his decision to grant Algeria independence. They hire a professional killer with no ties to them to carry out the difficult task.Edward Fox plays the titular character with the requisite cold efficiency required. He is very much an antihero as while he does murder some innocent people he is also the only figure in the film to really get behind. The French authorities are shown to not be slow to use brutal methods on their enemies themselves while the two policemen assigned to the case are so lacking in charisma that it's just very hard to get behind them in their pursuit of the villain. If there is a fault with the film it must surely be that we as viewers are drawn to the Jackal and his againstallodds mission  I think most people want him to succeed  and I'm not entirely sure this is what the filmmakers actually intended.The period detail and French locations are lovely so cinematically this is a very attractive looking film. It's wellpaced and direct with no wastage. We never get into the Jackal character's head ourselves as viewers there is a definite distance and we don't always immediately know why he does certain things. This only adds to the compelling voyeurism of watching him on his deadly mission. Despite the genre there is a definite restraint shown in the depictions of violence. It's often implied or shown just offscreen. The focus of the film is very much on the way in which the assassin navigates through his mission via different methods of subterfuge. The film could not be further away in style from the laughable 90's remake The Jackal a film that seems to do everything in an opposite way.The Day of the Jackal is overall an excellent political thriller that combines intelligence with a gripping narrative. It shows how this kind of material should be presented on screen where less can absolutely be more. The way that it always stays within the realm of the plausible is one of its strongest suits too. All this combined with its enigmatic central villain make it a superlative film.".

With near excruciating detail the two and ahalf hour narrative follows out a plot to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle by disgruntled Algerian colonialists who hire a professional hit man known as the Jackal.Now you might think 140minutes would provide plenty of critical material to write about. But in my little book the sumtotal doesn't. Instead the screenplay consists entirely of following out the tactics of police pursuit and criminal evasion producing results that are nevertheless riveting as heck. That's mainly because the screenplay shows the Jackal's painstaking preparation though much is done in silence such that we don't know why he's doing what he's doing. We find out however as the chase unfolds and he puts those preparations into practice allowing him to stay onestep ahead of the police pursuers. It amounts to an exquisite game of cat and mouse and is about as well played as any thriller I've seen. But you have to stay alert since the Jackal operates mainly in silence.If there's a downside it's probably some seemingly pointless interludes where police functionaries walk along corridors to somewhere. I'm guessing these were included to give us a taste of the richly ornate interiors of high government offices since the walking itself doesn't advance the singleminded plot. Still these scenes along with the many sunny outdoor shots do lend an eyecatching background to all the maneuvering.Anyway between the expert screenplay fine acting and colorful European locales the movie is richly deserving of its firstrate reputation.".

You get swept up in the film's good vibes. You care about what happens to Hawke and his son. Most of the credit for this has to go to Sylvester Stallone. He plays the part of a truck driver coping with the new experience of getting to know his twelveyearold son for the first time quite well. You care because you sense how much HE cares. it is conveyed by a sure delivery from Stallone. His character never seems too slight or well too Over the top. There is a bond that slowly forms between him and his son. And the movie has a great training montage complete with great song that will remind you of what was so good about the Rocky films. David Mendenhall agreeably plays the part of Mike with the combination of distrust arrogance and vulnerability you would expect from someone his age who went thru what he did.. No he's not Haley Joel Osmont. We won't leave the movie shaking our heads at his incredibleprecocious talent. That doesn't mean he didn't acquit himself nicely in the film. Robert Loggia's role could have been fleshed out a little more. He seems to much like a comicstrip villain. The film could have delved more into his reasons for hating Hawke. that part could have been beefed up a bit. I enjoyed the Armwrestling backdrop. It was a refreshing change for movies of that era that boasted big stars like Stallone. Usually movies that were sportspecific other than the trad football baseball or boxing stories tended to use people who were less known Gotcha Gleaning the CubeA good film. warm funny exciting.

Their might be some things in this movie that are stupid but it is the kind of stupid you laugh at.  Also the names in this movie are great also and it is just like a Stallone movie to have great names but Lincoln Hawk is a great name.  Underdog movies like this are great to watch and no one does them better than Stallone.  The names and the one liners definetly make this movie worth watching. When I turn the hat around its like a switch.".

My grandpa has his own TractorTrailer and I always went with him on road trips so I instantly fell in love with this movie when I saw the truck. Even though it's an old beaten up disgusting truck I would have to say it looks pretty sweet. Lincoln Hawk played by Sylvester Stallone is a independent trucker just trying to put his life back together. He realized he made mistakes and tries to reconcile with his son that he abandoned years earlier. When the boy's grandfather offers Hawk the offer of a life time and Hawk refuses....it's very clear to him that he has no other choice but to win and the determination really shows. Sly acts a bit uninterested in this movie...you can see it in his eyes. Every now and then you can catch his wandering off and not paying attention. If you watch closely some of the extras often keep there eyes on the camera and Sly will look at them. Pretty good movie could have been better but it's a for sure movie to watch.".

Add to that the fact that this is a Stallone movie  having to do with the sport of arm wrestling  you have a winner in my book. Yes I will admit that you know ahead of time what is going to happen in the end but to me that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this film atleast for myself It also has very touching moments thru out the movie. When Mike's MotherStallones x wife in the movie is found to have passed away wile Lincoln HawkStallone  his son Mike were on the way to see her still gives me moist eyes every time as well as other situations during the film. Plus the very cool classic Stallone lines that stick in my head to this day.... The world meets nobody halfway Mike... You've gotta do what's best for you.... the I'm thru talking response to Mr. Cutler's body guard just to name a few. Yes the movie has the same concept as the Rocky films  the Rambo films with the underdog winning in the end but come on now who want's to go to the movies  see the hero of the film come up just short in the end. The movie has a good soundtrack as well with Kenny Loggins doing a few of them...Over all it is a simple movie but a great movie I am looking for it on DVD".

I don't understand how someone can watch this movie and fail to be entertained by the compelling plot and characters.As a movie from the 80s Over the Top pretty much represents everything good about the decade. Other than perhaps Rocky IV this is definitely Stallone's best work. The man is unquestionably a genius. The only part of the movie that is a little farfetched is when Stallone plows through his fatherinlaw's gates in a moment of pure manpassion. The unrealistic quality of this scene is obviously the lack of explosion when Stallone's truck hits the gates. This is also an anomaly of the 80s I think Stallone was going for something unique in a decade of decadence but I can only hope to comprehend the motives behind any of his films.I would highly recommend Over the Top for anyone who enjoys classy film.".

He certainly is no Shakespeare actor but there is that deep honesty he represents in all his flicks and it works. When he first walks into that military school building to fetch his son after cleaning his truck and trying to make himself look his Sunday best  I can't help it it is just great.Yes it is strange to see a well educated kid by a military school being transformed into a regular guy by his own father. But in this film that is only a metaphor. The real meaning is it's the heart that counts not the social position. Now that's a message which can't be dismissed as junk that easily. I love the portraits and short interviews of the arm wrestling contestants. Brilliant. Probably the best scene is when the always wonderful Robert Loggia finally accepts the fact that his grandson loves his dad. The villain hasn't been beaten. No even better he has been convinced and transformed.Over the Top works on two levels as popcorn entertainment Blue collar hero beats the odds and as good old fashioned almost Frank Capra like cinema good will always win in the end. Bottom line as with many a Sly flick any film Sylvester Stallone agrees to participate in or where he actually did the writing directing etc.we have to work our way through a popcorn flick to find a deeper meaning.

All the characters are fantastic and the ending was just awesome! plus Stallone is simply amazing in this!. This has to be one of the most underrated movies ever and i can't believe it only has a 4. 1 rating as it should be way higher! plus i thought Stallone's acting was fantastic!. Stallone and David Mendenhall had wonderful chemistry together and it has quite a few tear jerker moments! plus the scene where Stallone drive his truck right into the Manson was awesome! and i thought the arm wrestling sequences were very exciting! plus it's quite funny at times as well!. The opening is rather tense and made me feel a bit uncomfortable but in a a good way and the scene where Stallone is teaching his son Michael to drive his big truck was just awesome! plus it's really awesome on how they bonded so quickly!. This is a wonderful film about a father and son relationship that's quite emotional and very moving with an amazing performance from Stallone! and i say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Menahem Golan does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work great angles and keeping the film full of surprises and at an extremely fast pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is incredibly likable witty had wonderful chemistry with David Mendenhall is intense at times did excellent in his emotional scenes and showed a ton determination to keep his son i loved that! and this is one of his best performances! and as always had tons of charisma! Stallone Rules!!!!!!!. David Mendenhall is fantastic as the Son! he was a little annoying at 1st but i totally understood why as he was really likable and very energetic throughout! he also had a special bond and wonderful chemistry with Stallone! where he is now? he was awesome!. Robert Loggia does what he has to do extremely well as the prick of a Grandfather i hated him he is a wonderful actor!. Susan Blakely is decent with what she had to do i rather liked her. Rick Zumwalt is not an actor he just grunts his way and looks tough throughout!. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it now! it's one of the most underrated films out there!.  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Nice is the word. Over the Top is a good example of Sylvester Stallone stepping away from the trappings of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo and trying to create a movie the whole family can enjoy. Sure the whole family may have enjoyed the Rocky movies but the violence of those films at best is toned down to mute here. Unlike the Rocky series with Boxing Over The Top doesn't square its attention solely on this movies sport Arm wrestling. So there is plenty of room for deep rooted character developement. Unfortunately Over The Top doesn't present us with this and what we have is a Cannon Pictures knock off version of The Champ 1979 with Stallone and Sterling Silliphant's screenplay spreading on the sentimentality very thickly. We are presented with a screenplay remeniscent of the sentimental moments from the bulk of Slys career. And for the majority of the time it works remarkably well. Sly proves that he can act making Lincoln Hawk a typically mach named Stallone character a likeable funny and sincere character so that you dont for one minute doubt the values of Hawk and the good man he is. The hard work Stallone puts into Hawk is completely obliterated by a terrible cliched performance by David Mendenhall as Hawks long lost son Mike. A typical spoilt bratt you wish Sly would beat the life out of Mendenhall ala Rocky VS Drago in the closing moments of Rocky IV at one or two times during the movie. Mendenhall has NO redeaming features and compliments the movie zero. It would have perhaps been better had someone like Sean Astin or Macauly Culkin played the part of Hawk's son. The sentimentality comes in the form of Susan Blakely as Hawk's estranged and dying wife and this once again is a burden to the movie because the scenes handled with too much syrup by director Menahem Golan go too far over the top no pun to try and reach your tear ducts. Despite this everything pays off. The Arm wrestling scenes are handled efficiently by Golan and come close to the heart pumping heroics of the Rocky movies and Georgio Moroders 80's Rock score is as good and dated as anything Vince Di Cola and Survivor did for Messers Balboa and Drago. And i would defy even the most ardent of cynics not to root for Hawk in the movies macho encrusted arm wrestling finale. An efficient fammilyadventure movie that is good to pass the time with but for sheer class watch the Rocky movies.610".

	schema:reviewBody "The effects of personal want need love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty clever and ohsoBritish comedy of love romance and finding that special someone Four Weddings and a Funeral' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of longtime friends all single who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar.  Of them all Charles Grant seems the most likely and at the same time the least likely to be next.  Young handsome and charismatic Charles has no problem developing a relationship he's had a number in fact as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp.  Until at the wedding of one of his friends he meets Carrie MacDowell an American and she quickly enchants him.  It is not the end of the story however for Charles Carrie and the audience it's only as they say the beginning.Set in contemporary England one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented. Refreshingly subtle there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it a matter of manners mores and innuendo taking precedence over grossout inyourface shock schlock humor.  And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension without having to actually go too deep.  He never lets you forget that first and foremost this is a comedy.  There's some insight provided but this is not an indepth commentary on human nature though there are some overtones and implications in that direction Charles is always late to the weddings for example perhaps a subconscious denial of the impending nuptials?.  Most importantly the characterizations are rich and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.  Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film striving for that definitive portrayal.  W.C. Fields played the henpecked husband in a number of films finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in It's A Gift.'  For Hugh Grant it's the retiring somewhat selfconscious and stammering eyelid fluttering charmer of which he's done a variation in such films as Sense and Sensibility' The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain' Notting Hill' and Mickey Blue Eyes.'  But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable. It's a good bit of work by Grant and definitely one of his most memorable performances.Andie MacDowell meanwhile gives a rather composed performance as Carrie the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles. MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her.  It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity.In a part that has to be an actor's dream Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends. More than just an effervescent character Gareth is something of the conscience of the film laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day fleshandblood Spirit of Christmas Present. It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film and he's wonderfully played by Callow.Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew Kristin Scott Thomas who is quite alluring as Fiona James Fleet as Tom a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series The Vicar of Dibley' and very effective here Charlotte Coleman memorable in the role of Scarlett and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald.Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower David Timothy Walker Angus Sara Crowe Laura Anna Chancellor Henrietta Simon Kunz John David Haig Bernard Sophie Thompson Lydia Jane and Corin Redgrave Hamish.  There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable including one scene near the end that initially seems so meanspirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying Oh NO!' But not to worry Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot. Entertaining pleasant and funny Four Weddings and a Funeral' makes for a satisfying feelgood cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:headline " A British Romantic Comedy as Good as Hollywood at its Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Richard Curtis's films have sometimes been criticised for giving a too cosy conservative view of British society. Four Weddings and a Funeral seems to take place in an England of eternal summer a land which consists almost entirely of green and pleasant countryside and the more exclusive districts of London and which is populated solely by members of the upper and uppermiddle classes. The script does cross the border into an equally idealised Scotland of mists tartans and Highland flings but even these scenes were actually shot in Surrey. Such criticism contains an element of truth but is largely irrelevant when it comes to assessing the merits of the film because it ignores the fact that most romantic comedies in other media as well as in the cinema are set against a relatively narrow background in terms of social class often enabling the writer to satirise the manners of that class. Jane Austin for example the most successful writer of romantic comedy in nineteenthcentury England set all her works among the wealthy landed gentry or prosperous bourgeoisie of the day.Most of the action of the film takes place either at or immediately before or after one of the four church services mentioned in the title. The main character Charles is a welltodo young man probably educated at public school and clearly a member of the professional classes although we never actually discover what his job is. The film starts with a wedding at which Charles is best man to Angus one of his old friends and at which he meets Carrie an attractive young American woman. The film then traces the ups and downs of the relationship of Charles and Carrie via two more weddings the second of which is Carrie's own after she and Charles have split up the funeral of Gareth another friend of Charles who suffers a heart attack while dancing at Carrie's wedding and one final marriage ceremony.Hugh Grant as Charles gives a very good performance. Grant has a relatively narrow range as an actor but he is capable of some excellent work within that range. There are some subtle differences between Charles and William the character Grant played in Notting Hill another romantic comedy written by Curtis. William is a shy young man who uses ironic selfdeprecating humour as a cover for his shyness and lack of selfconfidence. He is very much in love with Anna that film's heroine but is afraid to declare his love because he cannot believe that a beautiful and successful film star would take any interest in the owner of a small bookshop. Charles by contrast is less shy than William and enjoys more success with women. His humour is also ironic but for a different reason. He is afraid of his emotions and of commitment and uses irony as a means of distancing himself from life and of avoiding having to commit himself.The film can be seen as the story of Charles's journey to emotional maturity. He has had a number of brief affairs all of which have petered out precisely because he is afraid of his emotions. His relationship with Carrie initially goes the same way and she marries a richer and older man. The change in Charles's character is partly due to the fact that he sees his carefree bachelor world disappearing as most of his friends get married but the event which seems to have the greatest effect on him is Gareth's funeral at which a moving eulogy is read by Matthew Gareth's gay partner touchingly played by John Hannah. Charles realises the strength of the love that Gareth and Matthew shared for one another and comes to appreciate that such a relationship is something to be valued.Grant does well to make Charles a sympathetic figure despite his having many failings quite apart from his ironic distancing of himself from the world. He is clumsy accidentprone he manages to lose the ring at Angus's wedding much given to profane language and can be appallingly tactless especially about his former girlfriends. The other main character Carrie can perhaps be seen as a female Charles someone who is on the same journey as him but who has travelled slightly further. It is significant that her name is short for Caroline the feminine equivalent of the name Charles. She freely admits to having had over thirty previous lovers but she is the first to want to bring emotional commitment to their relationship. Am I incidentally the only one to have liked Andie MacDowell's performance? she has come in for a lot of criticism in my view undeserved on this board.The film is however more than simply a study of relationships it is also very funny with some superb lines. Hugh Grant can be very amusing and there was a great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling nervous trainee priest who keeps fluffing his lines during one of the weddings. Awful wedded wife or Holy Goat for Holy Ghost. I also liked David Bower as Charles's deaf brother David the late Charlotte Coleman as his impudent younger sister Scarlett and Anna Chancellor as his exgirlfriend Henrietta also known as Duckface whose embarrassing emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth loud extrovert and excessively hearty like most characters Callow plays.To sum up this was a very good film indeed proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 810".

	schema:headline " Quirky Characters Shine in Touching Funny Romantic Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The lead character in this film Charles says at one point that while  his friends were busily obsessed with marriage two members of their  group were for all intents and purposes married to each other. In  those days before Britain had a civil partnership law he was referring  to Gareth and Matthew played by Simon Callow and John Hannah. Four  Weddings and a Funeral was among the first major films to feature a  gay couple without any comment moralizing or stereotyping.  Considering all of the absurd controversy generated by Brokeback  Mountain this English comedy may be considered subversive in some  quarters because it portrays the union between the two men to be as  loving and enduring as any between the men and a women in the same  film.  The two gay men are among a circle of idiosyncratic friends that orbit  around Charles who suffers from relationship avoidance. Played  engagingly by Hugh Grant Charles attends the weddings of others  but manages to avoid any commitment of his own. One of the film's  funniest scenes involves Charles at a wedding reception where he has  been seated at a table with several of his exgirlfriends. With that  one scene screenwriter Richard Curtis wittily fleshes out Charles's  character as each woman remarks on her past experience.  The episodic comedy is broken down literally into the five events of  the title and the core characters attend these events as spectators  who each hope for a wedding of their own. Many of the lines and  situations are extremely funny. Rowan Atkinson steals his brief time as  a novice preacher who blesses a couple in the name of the Father the  Son and the holy goat. Although Hugh Grant plays Charles as well  Hugh Grant several other actors create some fine comic turns. The  ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas is touching as the lonely Fiona and her  timing is impeccable when she recovers from an indelicate question with  a snappy comeback. Of course why anyone as beautiful as Kristin Scott  Thomas should be unwillingly single is a minor casting flaw in the  film. Unfortunately Andie MacDowell plays the American Carrie and  although she looks great in a hat she fails to generate the necessary  charisma to convincingly be Charles's object of desire.  However the low wattage generated by the two leads does little to  dampen the hilarity or the pathos of this excellent film. While at  nearly two hours the movie is long for a comedy the structure and  quirky characters easily sustain interest throughout. With Four  Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell has made one of the best  romantic comedies and the film holds up to repeated viewings.".

In  those days before Britain had a civil partnership law he was referring  to Gareth and Matthew played by Simon Callow and John Hannah.

I actually feel sorry for MacDowell when I hear criticisms of this film. Whilst it is an awful performance by her it should not be seen as a regular occurance. Whilst she is dire in this film in Groundhog Day with Bill Murray she holds her own and demonstrates potential. It is just a shame that she is so useless in this piece.When talking about this film the script and the group of friends make this film what it is. Grant and company make this film amazing.

The next wedding is Carries and this goes well enough right up until Charles's friend Gareth collapses and dies. After the funeral it is time for another wedding this time Charles is getting married the question is who is his bride and is he over Carrie?The plot of this film is fairly simple but none the less effective. The four weddings and the funeral of the title provide lots of laughs some enjoyable romance and more than a few tears. Hugh Grant is great as Charles it is the sort of role he was made to play and Andie MacDowell is likable as Carrie although we don't really get to know her character as well as we might. The strength of the film is maintained by an excellent supporting cast Simon Callow does a fine job as the exuberant Gareth and John Hannah is equally good as Gareth's boyfriend Matthew it is nice to see this gay couple being shown as ordinary people rather than camp clichs. It was also good to see that Charles's deaf brother David was portrayed by deaf actor David Bower. The late Charlotte Coleman is utterly delightful as Scarlett. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Overall this is a great rom com that has stood the test of time well worth watching or rewatching.".

	schema:headline " OK but not worth the reputation it has surprisingly held with it over the past decade";
	schema:reviewBody "Charles' habit of being late to pretty much everything he does and attends doesn't stop him being best man at a friend's wedding. While there he meets and beds the delightful American Carrie and finds himself quite attracted to her and regrets that she flies back to America the same day. At another wedding he meets her again but finds that she has gotten engaged to a rather rich Scottish man and is off the market  although that doesn't stop her sleeping with Charles again. As her wedding approaches Charles begins to realise that his marrying days are fast passing him by and the woman that he loves may never be his.Despite this film the best British film ever it has been many years since I last saw it so I decided to watch it again. With a simple plot a lot rests on the central romance and the characters and for me it doesn't totally work on this level. The group of friends are reasonably well written but they are very much a public school crowd that are rather aloof and therefore failed to engage me  it spoke volumes to me that Scarlet was the only one I liked partly perhaps because she was just a down to earth character. Without this emotional hook in the people I never got that into it and just let it wash over me as a comedy. However on this level it didn't set the world on fire sure it was amusing and had some very funny moments but not enough to be worth the reputation it has gained over the years.The lack of characters are helped by what I consider to be two rather uninspiring performances from the lead. Grant does his usual bumbling Englishman stuff and back in 1994 it seemed fresh now it appears to be pretty much all he has done and this cannot fail to colour it looking back. He isn't helped by a total lack of chemistry with MacDowell who lets be honest is pretty insipid and poor for most of the film. Her lines sound unnatural and I just didn't like her at all. The support characters are colourful enough Callow is great value Hannah is the only one that manages to bring some real feeling into the film Coleman is cool and the others are nice. Smaller roles are also good from Walker Bower and a funny cameo from Atkinson. None of them can really consistently lift the material but they are pretty good  the problems are not with the support it is with the leads.Overall this is an OK film but it is certainly nothing more than that. The comedy is sporadic and it produces a few laughs but not enough often enough. The romance falls flat because the dialogue is clunky and the two leads have little chemistry  a fact not helped by MacDowell's roundly poor performance. Worth a look if the genre appeals to you but not really worth the reputation that the media hype and shock of a profitable English film earned it at the time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Charles' habit of being late to pretty much everything he does and attends doesn't stop him being best man at a friend's wedding. While there he meets and beds the delightful American Carrie and finds himself quite attracted to her and regrets that she flies back to America the same day. At another wedding he meets her again but finds that she has gotten engaged to a rather rich Scottish man and is off the market  although that doesn't stop her sleeping with Charles again. As her wedding approaches Charles begins to realise that his marrying days are fast passing him by and the woman that he loves may never be his.Despite this film the best British film ever it has been many years since I last saw it so I decided to watch it again. With a simple plot a lot rests on the central romance and the characters and for me it doesn't totally work on this level. The group of friends are reasonably well written but they are very much a public school crowd that are rather aloof and therefore failed to engage me  it spoke volumes to me that Scarlet was the only one I liked partly perhaps because she was just a down to earth character. Without this emotional hook in the people I never got that into it and just let it wash over me as a comedy. However on this level it didn't set the world on fire sure it was amusing and had some very funny moments but not enough to be worth the reputation it has gained over the years.The lack of characters are helped by what I consider to be two rather uninspiring performances from the lead. Grant does his usual bumbling Englishman stuff and back in 1994 it seemed fresh now it appears to be pretty much all he has done and this cannot fail to colour it looking back. He isn't helped by a total lack of chemistry with MacDowell who lets be honest is pretty insipid and poor for most of the film. Her lines sound unnatural and I just didn't like her at all.

	schema:reviewBody "So let me get this straight. There's this British bloke who sleeps with this American gal. Just once mind you. But despite this he falls hopelessly in love. However she leaves and doesn't call him back. Then when they see each other again she's engaged. But for some reason she sleeps with him again. Oh and then she takes him out shopping with her. As if that isn't torture enough she's shopping for a wedding dress and makes him watch as she tries on various gowns. What kind of woman is this? And why should I give a damn about her? And how the hell can the filmmakers expect me to be happy when these two imbeciles end up getting married? But then again this a Working Title picture and a film scripted by Richard Curtis. Drivel is their forte.What I hate most about Four Weddings and a Funeral is how mechanical it is. There's not one genuine moment or one piece of sincerity. Its whole purpose is to manipulate in the name of entertainment. Just take the ludicrous sequence of events listed above. It isn't done because it echoes genuine human behaviour. It's done so that the screenplay can move from Point A to Point B. And that's how I really see the film. I see it as plot points. Charles and Carrie have to meet so that the wheel can start turning. Then they have to sleep together so that they Charles can fall in love. But then Carrie has to leave to keep the tension going. However Carrie has to come back to keep up the interest. But she has to be engaged to provide an obstacle. But then they have to sleep together again to keep the promise of romance later in the film spluttering along. But then she has to leave again to tighten the tension. Then she has to get married to wind the tension even tighter. But then someone has to die so that Charles can come to the conclusion that life is only meaningful if you're married. This of course then means that Charles has to decide to marry someone awful so that we can be jolly pleased when he decides not to and when he decides to marry his true love who has suddenly miraculously even recently separated  a woman let me remind you again who jerks him about and who rubs her engagement to another man in his face. It's a load of rubbish.It's not very funny either. I think I laughed three times. The first laugh was at the drunk man in the pub the second was at the awful best man's speech and the third was at the sex scene. Aside from that though I didn't even crack a smile. Most of the humour fell flat. Just take Rowan Atkinson's cameo. You can see the jokes coming a mile away. Then there's the 'hilarious' swearing. I tell you Richard Curtis just cannot do swearing. He tries his best in every screenplay he writes but it's so selfconscious that it's cringe worthy. And I'm someone who loves profanity. I mean it kills me that I can't swear in these reviews it really does. But Richard Curtis is no Peter Cook no Ricky Gervais and no Chris Morris. He's just a middle class twit feeding America's preconceptions about Britain  that we're uncomfortable with sex that we're all loveably quirky and that in every corner there are dancing homosexuals.But the worst thing in the film is actually the American or Andie MacDowell as she is otherwise known. I've already talked about her ridiculous character but her acting is astoundingly bad. She can't deliver a line. The worst example is Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed. The line in itself is awful enough but when it's expressed in a monotone drawl it's unbearable. And then there's the scene where she plays a joke on Charles. He doesn't know that it's a joke but when he does realise he laughs with relief. Pretty standard stuff. Only Andie MacDowell's laugh is so feeble that she does actually look like the bunny killer stereotype that Charles is laughing at. She doesn't look like she's joking at all. She looks dead serious.But the established actors aren't much better. Simon Callow in particular is hideously bad. I mean he's a good actor but in this film like everyone he tires too damn hard. He's a gay stereotype turned up to 11. I was actually quite thankful when he died so that he could give me a break. But at least Curtis had the good sense to ensure that he didn't die of AIDS. At least he didn't play that clich.However the death of Callow's character leads to the terrible funeral scene. It's not moving. It's not emotional. It's just a cynical way to play the audience and to get Charles to the next plot point. He has to see that monogamy is the way to true happiness and that you're a no one if you don't have someone crying at your funeral. What tosh! Then there's the ending. If everything else is just bad then the ending is offensive. What happens? Why everyone gets married of course! Oh but not the gay man you understand. Although he does find a new 'special friend'. Bloody hell. It's bad in the sense that all the loose ends are tied neatly together but it's even worse in the sense that it sells conformity and belief in an archaic institution as the only road to happiness. How terribly middle class.Oh and if the film had a brain and if Charles had a brain too he would have dumped the American for Kristin Scott Thomas. But we can't have that can we? That would have killed the transatlantic appeal.".

Hugh Grant leads the way as the charming Charles who finds it hard to settle down. Whilst Grant is superb he is by no means the only one with plenty of pitch perfect performances from the likes of Simon Callow John Hannah and Kristin Scott Thomas. The only real weak link is Andie MacDowell but even though she has been slated for her performance it's not the worst in the world. This is a film full of genuinely funny moments but also some sad ones. The funeral is genuinely touching and uses the poem 'Funeral Blues' to great effect.

	schema:reviewBody "Four Weddings has achieved iconic status as a British film and for good reasons. It comes under the category of a romantic comedy but I would argue that it is in fact far more than that. It is a film about love in all its myriad and astonishing aspects  love between man and woman or between 2 men love between mother and child and longstanding friendship which can be much more important than sexual love. You would need a heart of stone not to cry at the funeral scene. The film is beautiful to look at with the contrasting weddings and gorgeous costumes. It is directed with a very light touch and interweaves the main characters in an ingenious way. The acting is generally superb and without a doubt it is Hugh Grant's greatest role  before he became middle aged and cynical. My only objection is that Andie McDowell was a very odd choice for the role not very beautiful and not a serious actress. Apart from that the film is perfect in every respect and I could watch it forever.".

It is a film about love in all its myriad and astonishing aspects  love between man and woman or between 2 men love between mother and child and longstanding friendship which can be much more important than sexual love. You would need a heart of stone not to cry at the funeral scene. The film is beautiful to look at with the contrasting weddings and gorgeous costumes. It is directed with a very light touch and interweaves the main characters in an ingenious way. The acting is generally superb and without a doubt it is Hugh Grant's greatest role  before he became middle aged and cynical. My only objection is that Andie McDowell was a very odd choice for the role not very beautiful and not a serious actress. Apart from that the film is perfect in every respect and I could watch it forever.";

Then he meets an American woman Carrie at one of the weddings and it seems like his luck has changed. However things are not so simple. As with almost everyone in his group of friends it appears that the Right One is out there but never available.Wonderfully funny warm and emotional  the perfect romanticcomedy. Written by Richard Curtis of Blackadder fame and directed by Mike Newell this movie works on so many levels. As a comedy it is superb  very funny and intelligently so. Then there's the friends aspect which creates a great warmth and engagement and a feeling of camaraderie. Characters have depth and complement each other well.Lastly it works very well as a romantic drama too. Not your usual schmaltzy formulaic romance but an intelligent examination of the subject.Hugh Grant is great as Charles. The role pretty much locked in his character in future roles  the shy hesitant stammering yet charming type. He has played that in about every role since.The group of friends are well cast and give spoton performances John Hannah as Matthew James Fleet Tom. Kristen Scott Thomas Fiona Simon Callow Gareth and Charlotte Coleman Scarlett. Rowan Atkinson has a minor part but is responsible for possibly the funniest scene in the movie.The only negative thing about the movie is the performance of Andie McDowell as Carrie. Not terrible just a flat aloof delivery and thus quite unengaging. This is made more obvious by the fact that the other characters exude such warmth and vibrancy making her seem quite cold. She doesn't wreck the movie but it would have been even better with a better actress in that role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many romantic comedies end with the two leads finally reuniting for the final kiss and realizing that they're meant to live together. Though it doesn't necessarily imply that the following step is marriage but we can bet on a longterm commitment.Basically Four Weddings and a Funeral stands above all the 'romantic comedy' genre because it doesn't take its very essence for granted and turns into a delightful social commentary about the meaning of marital commitment even questioning its compatibility with real love. Can love last for life? If not definite answers the film provides some hints through four martial experiences and one funeral which is an occasion to think about life and death. Mike Newell finds the perfect balance between humor slapstick and intelligence all of them in a typically British flavor.And one thing for sure the film's title doesn't lie about the content since the five titular events and their direct aftermaths occupy almost 95 of the screen time. And as viewers we're literally invited to follow the adventures of one joyful bunch of friends. On the top of them there's Hugh Grant as Charles a handsome thirty something bachelor whose penetrating blue eyes betray a vulnerable sensitivity that doesn't fit his look. There is the tiny exuberant Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett a gay couple Matthew John Hannah and Garrett played by the scenestealing Simon Callow. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona hiding in a sophisticated composure the grief of never having conquered Charles' heart and last but not least there's Tom Jack Fleet as the goofiest and clumsiest of the bunch which is saying a lot.We never know exactly what these people do for a living but it doesn't matter actually. Besides we know them enough to understand the way they feel behave or approach life and important matters so the rest would only fill the script with unnecessary details. Have you noticed by the way that in most romcoms the jobs of the two lead hardly play a role one is an architect and another is a cook so what? And have you also noticed that many romantic comedies only rely on the believability of its lead couple and some supporting characters Four Weddings and a Funeral is an ensemble cast movie and even more effective because it doesn't depend on a multilinear plot the solidarity the complicity between the friends is the story's heart and greatest source for gags and amusement.I insist on the ensemble cast because truth is if Hugh Grant was perfect for the role that put him in America's showbiz map and earned him a Golden Globe the same can hardly be said about Andie McDowell. As much as I respect and appreciate the actress it's hard to see the same sweetheart who turned Phil Connor's heart in Groundhog Day. She doesn't deliver a bad performance per se but a Razzie nomination that thankfully the film was spared of wouldn't have surprised me. It was hard to believe that Charles would be so infatuated in a woman who doesn't seem quite sure either about love let alone marriage. Some would think this is what united them since they would be involved in the two weddings that didn't end. But something in Carrie suggested that she was more of a golddigger type while Charles is more a victim of his own idealism.Unsuccessful marriages end up being more insightful than the others if only because they do 'end up' and one of the merit of Four Weddings and a Funeral is to put the notion of commitment into perspective to revalue the meaning of living and loving someone for life. In a way the subtext is that we are never 100 sure to love someone then marriage is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness OR if we really love one person then marriage would be totally meaningless. That's the idea conveyed by Gareth and Matthew's who'd be shown as the most solid and sincere couple without any ceremony to 'validate' their union. The death of Gareth invites for these questions and works as a great dramatic relief in a relatively screwball comedy thanks to Matthew's powerful eulogy simple but realistically heartbreaking.But I guess I was a bit too serious in my review and beyond the whole introspective facade Four Weddings and a Funeral is also a cheerful celebration of the most special day of anyone's life the day we have to say 'yes' this magical moment that sets a before and an after in our lives that starts with solemnity and ends up with fun alcohol and maybe a few years later regrets. It also allows other people to meet their match soulmates or onenight hits. Weddings are the premise of countless jokes a nice twist on the forgettherings gag embarrassing best man's speeches some acts of pure desperation and a wonderfully comic moment with Rowan Atkinson as a priest in his first wedding. His five minutes are funnier than the whole 'Mr. Bean' film in fact the film reminds us that the world needs marriage if only to have a great moment of fun and joy.Four Weddings and one Funeral was one of the biggest hits of the glorious 1994 earning two nominations for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. The material is so fresh and new on the field of romantic comedies that it's hard to tolerate such conventional moments like a declaration of love under the rain and a cheesy line delivered by youknowwho and it's only forgivable because the film immediately redeems itself through the great ending credits sequence and Elton John's version of Chapel of Love the credits sequences perfectly captures the positive optimistic mood of the film and even its nottobetakensoseriously quality.And it does fit the general message of the film that after all maybe wedding just like life is not to be taken so seriously and maybe that's the best way to make it work.".

The regular wedding guest characters are fun and likable. Hugh Grant is pretty good. Andie McDowell is okay but she is overshadowed by the entire cast. Kristin Scott Thomas is the scene stealer.

I didn't like the way it abruptly ended with the two leads suddenly deciding on a livein relationship rather than a marriage. What was the motivation behind such a decision?

He was almost TOO good in this role. Aidan Quinn however has proved himself once again to be a fine actor worthy of much more acclaim than he has received. He's not an Alister by any means but he has an art an impeccably developed craft. He blew me away in Two Of Us and...well if I wore a hat i'd take it off to you.";

It tackles the tough and difficulttofilm subject of child abuse and manages to uplift your emotions before devestating and dashing them. All the performances particularly those from Iain Glen as the sadist priest Brother John and from John Travers as the lead boy Mercier are outstanding and achieving widespread recognition and many people think this is Aidan Quinn's best role ever. Skillfully and humanely handled by director Aisling Walsh the film has more conviction than others in its family of films such as The Magdalene Sisters or Conspiracy of Silence and deserves to be seen anywhere it hasn't yet received a distribution. Anyone still interested in honest highly moving drama or anyone whose youth was not a bed of roses will appreciate this film. An unusual film in that just possibly men may cry at it.".

Shocking painful cruel realistic to the core  I can go on like this for a long time. The fact that Song for a raggy boy is based on a true story contributes to the powerful effect this movie has on its viewers.The acting is quite good as well  so good that I felt like I knew some of the characters in person. The young actors were really convincing and I felt Delaney and Mercier almost like my friends. But let me tell you a bit more about the movie  it is set in a reformatory school run by the catholic church  as it often happens the boys who are send there find anything  but help and support  instead they are beaten and abused mentally and physically  some even sexually  from the priests. One of them Brother John is in charge of discipline  here is the line with which he tells the new teacher for the kind of job he is expected to do The creatures you are going to teach are not to be confused with intelligent human beings. Only this line itself was enough for me to imagine the horrible manner in which the boys are treated. The new teacher however tried to change all that  and as the story unfolds I began to really like him  he was strict but at the same time caring with the boys he taught. Brother John becomes his enemy almost from the very beginning and after failing to persuade the superior at the institution to dismiss the new teacher he directs his anger to the school pupils. You will have to watch the movie to find out how it all ends  This movie gets 10 out of 10 for me  since it is sure one of the best ones I have ever watched.Similar movies Sleepers Dead Poets Society".

Well it is sad that something like that was happening. We can be lucky that we live in this time. GREAT MOVIE director! ".

It touches on the awful side of Irish Catholic reform schools and the brutality and abuse depicted here is authentic and true based on accounts and evidence which has come to light in recent years. It is emotional at times and hard to take but this is a superb film and its comparisons with films such as Dead Poet's are justified. 9 out of 10 not quite perfect but very close. The acting is brilliant and Iain Glenn and Aidann Quinn stand out as do the two main boys in the story.

The Spanish Civil War did not only cause an almost 40 year dictatorship of Franco but also an agreement with the Vatican. The results of this type of agreement 'Concordat' could be seen in this film. A human being like the Prefecto Brother John would  in normal circumstances  be judged as a straightforward criminal. The soft way in which Liam Mercier tried to learn a bit from his teacher what 'love' means belongs to the best parts of this film.The strong and dangerous hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church  based on the Hitlerian 'Befehl ist Befehl'  has seldom been shown so clearly as in this masterpiece movie. The best teacher fought in the Spanish Civil War and did not hesitate to call the cruel murdering of Liam Mercier as a crime and nothing else. When he decided to leave this 'Reformatorio' his own pupils stopped him from doing it in a way he had taught them to love good poetry. Het only got real help from the director of the school an honest man who had to live under horrible circumstances and had already stopped the laymanteacher once. 'We need you here' were his words.I passed with my SpanishCatalan wife an eyeopening evening and have learned more than in any film about the danger of Catholic dualism.The movie deserves a 10 and I hope many people are going to see the movie.

	schema:headline " Overly simplistic history lesson of Roman Catholic atrocity";
	schema:reviewBody "Another RomanCatholic bashing film that comes hot on the heels of The Magdalene Sisters and in a very similar tone. Young adolescent boys that have got into trouble are incarcerated in a 1930s Irish Reformatory School. There they receive fascist style floggings and rape at the hands of the priests. All based on a true story and quite horrific to watch  one scene of two boys being flogged almost to death is remarkably similar to the same scene in Passion of Christ where 'Jesus' is tortured before crucifixion. Whether the film makes any significant contribution is another matter. Even in an age when courts worldwide seem embattled over paedophile Roman Catholic priests most people are now aware of the moral paucity of that religious order without ever questioning it. Forgiveness is handed out like a rosary pointing to the good works the church does. Even a Michael Moore might have gone a little bit further and made some comment on what has been done to prevent similar abuses in the present day and the future or raised awareness about other catastrophes waiting to happen. Or perhaps list in the closing credits some statistics good and bad. Even Capturing the Friedmans puts forward a real moral dilemma inasmuch as the perpetrators of abuse are also people who have done much good. Song for a Raggy Boy does none of this and so together with the rather cheesy clichs about the 'good teacher' standing up to the evil of the Roman Catholic Church perhaps suggests to a sated audience that the horrors portrayed might be inspired by gratuitous or commercial interest rather than documentarian passion and the fight for human rights  goodness. The simplistic approach undermines what could have been a powerful statement. Failure to distinguish and contrast the Church hierarchy its dominance false sanctity and the way its main players are protected on the one hand with the decency of the many ordinary catholics on the other may not only rob the film of its true potential but cause people to feel embittered at being lumped together in the same religion. That the Roman Catholic Church has been capable of so much evil through its history should not cause us to hate the millions of people born into that religion just as we should not associate modern fundamentalist Islam and its terrorist offspring with the millions of loving Muslims. A fleeting reference to Catholic atrocity in the Spanish Civil War is again portrayed in black and white terms without hard historical facts that could have been appended or any context  leaving the viewer to either be aware of the politics and religious links to fascism or dismiss them as overembroidery. Ultimately films such as Raggy Boy need to go more accurately to the root of the psychological dynamics that allow such evil to flourish.".

	schema:reviewBody "A genre that seems only to work coming out of Japan. The magical fantasy is better known in the US thru Miyazaki's animations such as My Neighbor Totoro or Sprited Away. The subject is usually ordinary people encountering wondrous happenings that have a deeper spiritual meaning. This film is a live action entry in the genre and it succeeds for the most part. American equivalents are films like Magnolia or Big Fish.In a small town dead people start to reappear just as they were right before they died minus any disfigurement that may have been a result of the circumstances of their death. A young bureaucrat is sent to investigate. By coincidence he grew up in the town and he meets his childhood friend a woman who married his best male friend. Several families who have dead loved ones return are featured in the drama. The actors are almost all very good and they put across the emotional turmoil caused by the reappearance of their loved ones. The movie moves forward in a deliberate yet sometimes nonlinear manner. The photography is excellent and very natural. I would have given the movie 9 stars if not for something that ruined the mood for me. For such a well written and sincere film I wonder who came up with the idea of creating a pop group for the film and centering the climax around a concert. Nothing in the film has anything to do with a concert. As soon as the concert starts the drama film turns into a concert film. One song was passable two songs is an understandable mistake three songs ruined it for me. The excuse for having the group in the film is flimsy at best. If you like JPop perhaps your opinion will be different I just wished I could have seen a version of this film without the concert.Excellent fantasy heed my warning about the concert but watch it anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought the DVD of Yomigaeri entirely because of Takeuchi Yuko Be with you Heaven's bookstore whose smile is guaranteed to brighten up any miserable day. I then discovered that the director is Shiota Akihiko who made the controversial but most interesting Moonlight Whisper. Yomigaeri is not in the least controversial but equally interesting.The title Resurrection tells a little but not everything about the movie  a scary ghost tale? a clever hoax? a science fiction yarn? Interesting that the genre in which IMDb placed this movie is Fantasy. If I were to choose I would say romance.The movie starts with a bit of a red herring with the first two resurrection scenes the pop musician couple and the little boy looking like the beginning of scary ghost stories. The mood soon shifts to science fiction with an investigation team showing up and cases becoming commonplace. Before we get to the middle of the movie however we realize that the focus is really on the human stories with human dramas unfolding.The resurrections are on deaths ranging from a long time ago to very recent. On the one hand we see the little kid coming back to a mother who is now over 80 a mother coming back to a daughter who is now about her own age i.e. when she died of childbirth and a teenager coming back to an adult younger brother. On the other hand we have a husband who died only three years ago and even a high school student walking right into his own funeral.As we follow these various stories we see that it is not all rejoices as people both those coming back from death and their beloved ones and friends find it awkward and even painful to cope with the change. There is also a clever twist about two third into the movie which you would recognize as soon as you see it.The movie is beautifully shot both in the literal visual sense and in its being tender and touching. The premises are interesting and quite well tackled even though not in great depth. As there are quite a few stories and many characters the stars Takeuchi Yuko and Kusanagi Tsuyoshi of SMAP Japan's most popular boyband do not get the screen time all to themselves. Still we see a reasonable amount of them and they are beautiful individually as well as together.".

	onyx:emotionText "I bought the DVD of Yomigaeri entirely because of Takeuchi Yuko Be with you Heaven's bookstore whose smile is guaranteed to brighten up any miserable day. I then discovered that the director is Shiota Akihiko who made the controversial but most interesting Moonlight Whisper. Yomigaeri is not in the least controversial but equally interesting.The title Resurrection tells a little but not everything about the movie  a scary ghost tale? a clever hoax? a science fiction yarn? Interesting that the genre in which IMDb placed this movie is Fantasy. If I were to choose I would say romance.The movie starts with a bit of a red herring with the first two resurrection scenes the pop musician couple and the little boy looking like the beginning of scary ghost stories. The mood soon shifts to science fiction with an investigation team showing up and cases becoming commonplace. Before we get to the middle of the movie however we realize that the focus is really on the human stories with human dramas unfolding.The resurrections are on deaths ranging from a long time ago to very recent. On the one hand we see the little kid coming back to a mother who is now over 80 a mother coming back to a daughter who is now about her own age i.e. when she died of childbirth and a teenager coming back to an adult younger brother. On the other hand we have a husband who died only three years ago and even a high school student walking right into his own funeral.As we follow these various stories we see that it is not all rejoices as people both those coming back from death and their beloved ones and friends find it awkward and even painful to cope with the change. There is also a clever twist about two third into the movie which you would recognize as soon as you see it.The movie is beautifully shot both in the literal visual sense and in its being tender and touching. The premises are interesting and quite well tackled even though not in great depth. As there are quite a few stories and many characters the stars Takeuchi Yuko and Kusanagi Tsuyoshi of SMAP Japan's most popular boyband do not get the screen time all to themselves. Still we see a reasonable amount of them and they are beautiful individually as well as together.";

For the younger ones you will be rooting for the sweet Ivy Chen Hear Me and Amber Kuo Au Revoir Taipei as two best friends who fall out after Chen gets becomes pregnant thanks to Kuo's confused boyfriend.Female viewers are treated with eye candy in the form of Ethan Ruan Monga as a stuttering neighbourhood boy who is wiser than he looks Mark Chao Monga as a successful businessman who doesn't believe in commitment and Eddie Peng as a filmmaker wannabe who has a lot to learn about responsibility in a relationship.

With its 125 minute runtime the filmmakers seem to be more concerned about making its stars look good on screen after all it's Mark Lee of In the Mood for Love fame who is calling the shots behind the cinematography department than engaging its audience in a emotional journey. Sure there are some poignant moments in the movie which may tug at your heartstrings but unfortunately it feels more like a touch and go affair. Also probably due to the challenge to tell a few stories in one movie the unsatisfying conclusion feels somewhat underwhelming.However the pretty to look at movie is still recommended for its contemporary take on love seriously what would you do if your best friend is carrying your boyfriend's baby? and considering the cast's decent performances you can be sure that your date won't be complaining after the credits begin rolling. www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This year's Valentine's Day has come and gone but arguably the best film for the season was saved for last making its premiere this week. Taiwanese films are on a roll these days with greater awareness brought about by the success of You Are The Apple of My Eye that made more people sit up and take notice of its stories but I thought that the filmmakers had upped their game with superb storytelling and technique these days that it's just hard to ignore film offerings that come our way.Love belongs to that genre of romantic films that boasts of a stellar ensemble cast playing characters within their respective six and likely a less degrees of separation with their carefully crafted ties all laid out to complicate matters yet provide interesting individual perspectives. Doze Niu helms this effort and also plays one of the roles as a rich entertainment industry tycoon Lu whose relationship with Zoe Fang Shu Qi is heading for the rocks. Zoe lives a life leaching off rich men but deep down desires that degree of independence if only she can find the courage to break out of her comfort zone. From these two characters the branches extend to Lu's daughter Ni Amber Kuo who finds out that her filmmaker wannabe boyfriend Kai Eddie Pang had impregnated her best friend Yijia Ivy Chen the latter whose brother Kuan Ethan Juan turns out to be sharing an innocent relationship with Zoe at the rooftop of his home where she can hang out and just be herself. Zoe's ex Mark Mark Chao who is also Lu's friend yeah the character of Zoe flits from one rich man to another travels to find his roots in Beijing and sets off on the wrong foot with real estate agent Xiao Ye Vicky Zhao a single mom who links through an implied dotted line back to one of the mentioned characters That about lays out the skeleton of relationships that this story by Doze Tseng LiTing and Qian Wang develops upon covering a whole wide spectrum on its titular emotion put under the spotlight but not without the usual ups and downs of hurt and of satisfaction of regrets and that whimsical feeling that everything will turn out just fine despite the odds. I suppose love or being in love with force some of the most positive feelings out of you while those that fall out of favour will naturally find life quite miserable with the constant probing lying and the doing of despicable things amongst the desperate. And it's not just romantic love on display here but that between siblings best friends parent and child too providing that holistic view of the emotion that at times get quite incomprehensible to grasp with some relationships being complicated or even so simple that you'd start to worry.Technically this film grabs you by the collar from the get go with a remarkable and unforgettable continuous tracking shot for the entire opening credits where we get introduced to key characters as they get choreographed to get into one another's way. It's a logistical nightmare although I do suspect that some editing cheats were being employed but it came off its blocks really nicely to introduce us to its bevy of stars and teasing their respective fans of their idol's guaranteed appearance in the film. Director of Photography Lee Ping Bin is also one of the best in the business capturing the stars at their best angles and making them look absolutely gorgeous.But that aside Love has its sprawling story to thank being simple enough to follow despite its concurrent multiple narratives that weave in and out of each other keeping pace and tempo at pitch perfectness and gelling everything into one complete satisfying package. There's plenty of drama and comedy that spring up at unsuspecting moments to keep things light and moving along and is done so naturally that they don't seem too forced nor trying too hard nor artificial. And the cast of veterans such as Doze himself Vicky Zhao and Shu Qi were balanced by the relative newcomers who hold their own against their more experienced costars never making some of their pair ups a sore discussion point despite their obvious age gaps. There were plenty of lovely moments in the film that regularly punctuates the narrative throughout and some of my personal favourites involve the Ethan JuanShu Qi story arc and that caustic interaction that's all too familiar amongst parents who bicker on the outside but deep down inside containing some steadfast emotions built upon bedrock. One of the best romantic films to be released in recent years Love truly epitomizes its namesake containing stories that are strong in its individual arcs as well as the sum of its parts blessed with a powerhouse of who's who from both sides of the Chinese straits in delivering credible performances all round bringing to life some of the best written characters for what's usually a fluffy film meant for a typical date outing. This film shows how quality can be injected into usually throwaway romantic comedies but Love is definitely for keeps and is highly recommended. Don't miss it!".

This lowbudget film spins the curse subgenre of Japanese horror in different ways. First of all the structure of the storyline is broken into three diary entries which portray the perspectives of the two main characters some very interesting monologue and dialogue to enjoy here. There is ample use of narration which develops both the protagonist and antagonist very nicely. Second the method of killing straddles the boundary between pure psychological manipulation and supernatural ability which is very unique for a film of this kind. There is a tempered creepiness but no onryo ghosts at all. Deliberately paced but this has quality acting and is memorable despite touching upon genre clichs. On a side note the runtime is only 85 minutes and almost all of the scary moments occur during the daytime. The ending message by the actresses is amusing.Worth a look.".

I will sometimes read in or out or play video games while watching. With Gomennasai I was totally glued to the screen. Although the first assumption may be that I have to watch the screen because then I can read the subtitles I actually speak Japanese so I didn't have to do that.This movie presents a plot that revolves around the power of words to kill. Recently I had the pleasure of watching the movie Pontypool which showed the power that words had to change people into zombie like creatures. In Gomennasai no such thing happens. But the words of a certain school girl have the power to curse and to kill.Kurohane is a very unpopular girl likely due to her dark and somewhat morbid appearance. Completely rejected by her family she is also hated by her schoolmates. In a way to antagonize her the girls in the school decide to torment her by having her write a script for a school production. Kurohane is actually very open to do this because it allows her to experiment with the power of words to kill people.Gomennasai is definitely a movie that has to be right for you in order to enjoy it. The budget was obviously very small and it is a very short movie. However it thrives on the strength of the screenplay and the actors in the movie. I had no idea where this movie was taking me as I watched it but it turned out to be a place I was happy to go. Very seldomly does a movie exhibit any originality in today's age. But this film does. It has an ending that ties things together in a way you likely will not see coming. An excellent film that should be enjoyed.".

If you are not too familiar with the Asian Horror Cinema Ring Of Curse might seem like a breath of fresh air but if you are you'll pick up the signs in no time.So without spoiling it too much I don't wanna influence your decision in no way whatsoever this movie will get a 5 from me.

He dreams of sparing Junnosuke the struggles that he has faced as a writer. The family continues to rely upon Hiromi's income from her bar. Meanwhile a rival story The Virus by a new writer has appeared in the periodical that has been publishing his stories Boy's Adventure Book and he fears the new competition.

This third film brings us to the time of the Tokyo Olympics of 1964 and the kids are growing up. Roku likes a doctor and looks for ways to meet him the most substantive side story of this film. Otherwise most of the characters have barely changed they are the same people they were in the other two films. In some series this could pose a problem but in this it is welcome. There is still a mix of over the top comedy Suzukisan especially pathos overt sentimentality and somewhat skewed family values. While not quite on the echelon of the first two films it carries the story forward and that is appreciated. You have to watch the first two before watching this which will introduce you to the characters but its well worth your time.".

I had a really hard time understanding whether he was supposed to resemble a retard or a tree either way he did a fine job since it all seemed perfectly natural. For him that is. The character Hercules is anyway the most testosteronefilled man caught on camera. This guy has a constant urge of ripping off his shirt everytime he either has to do something or everytime he's bored. He even has the great ability of killing actors dressed as bears by lifting them up in the air and throwing them around destroying cabs because he's angry and impressing ladies by ripping off his shirt in front of them. Now that's at least three dimensions! In one character! Kudos to the excellent scriptwriters who managed to write this amazing piece of art during their parttime job at Dairy Queen! Long live the underdog!Then we have main supporting character Arnold Stang an actor which has exactly two different looks one of utter confusion probably because he's wondering about what the hell he's doing in the movie in the first place and one look of not so utter confusion which he often uses when Hercules flexes his muscles for him. Besides these two main actors we have Zeus played by someone named Ernest Graves a man who does a great job of looking mad in every scene. Zeus meets a woman and becomes mad. Zeus talks to Hercules and gets... mad! Zeus get to know something about sabotage and he get's wait I got it on my tongue. Oh yeah now I know it mad!Then we have lots of characters played by actors I have no reason whatsoever of giving away the names of. But as far as characters go the goddess of beauty is a really pugugly womandoggorilla with a stuffed bra and all Pluto has the incredible ability of turning out  all the lights in a plastic version of New York Atlas and Samson helps Hercules by throwing punches a few meters in front of bad guys probably to stun them with their utter uselessness or possibly showing off their godly talents that doesn't even require them to hit people to hurt them. The old fool Samson is a part for himself since he doesn't even seem understand he's from the Bible and has nothing to do with Greek mythology. But then again I have a feeling many people involved in this movie weren't quite sure of what they were doing.Other intriguing parts here are that some of the scenes are so incredibly badly done and edited you actually can't understand what's happening. The fight in the stairs really had me puzzled about what was going on. After I saw it ten times in repeat I understood that there actually was a hidden door somewhere and that it actually made sense in a surreal Hercules in New York kind of way.Then we have Olympus not only home of the Gods but also home of the big evil city traffic you can hear cars driving by and honking every second. This is maybe one of the director's more intriguing ideas were he want's to show us that time doesn't stand still even in Olympus and that they actually have cars there. Wait a minute that doesn't make any sense. OK maybe it's supposed to be there just because noone ever even thought about editing the sound and that reality works that way what you don't alter is most likely to stay the way it is. Yeah thats more like it.I have only listed a few of the errors in this movie here since I won't spend the entire day of writing this review but I think the fact that Arnold Scwarzenegger actually managed to not only have a movie career but also got elected as a senator has to rate as the biggest of the lot. Only in America folks. Only in America.Be sure to watch this even if it may be on of the worst movies made. If there ever was a movie so bad it's funny it has to be this one.110".

There are just so many little things in this movie little details in every single aspect of this movie that make this so extremely funny and entertaining. It just ignores even the most basic of things needed for a good movie and it is exactly that what makes this so good. Watch this movie you won't be able to say that it is average that's for sure.

But he gets into trouble and has moments of revelation and regret. Hercules' simplicity and godlike physique as well as Monstro the Magnificent's lopsided hair cut symbolize the yin and yang of life and death bigness and smallness truth and the GOP.The frequent unfocusing of the shot shows that mankind's mind is frequently unfocused and Arnold's partially literate accent represents the garbled marbles we often use to express the inner desires of our hearts. On a daily basis we are tempted by godlike greatness but frequently fall short of the world's expectations for our bulbous necks and mountainous pecs. Hubris is a 1000lb barbell and it kills.

Arnold also fights a group of sailors with a plank and throws them in the sea the sound effects and horrible choreography in that scene is hilarious. I've got the version of this movie with Arnies real voice and just hearing that makes this movie worth getting. But Arnold is not the worst actor in this movie his partner Arnold Stang is much worse. The Mafia is even this movie well three guys...played by actors who probably auditioned for The Godfather but didn't make it.

	schema:headline " The funniest movie of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "Arnold Schwarzenegger. Way before he was Governor of California. Way before he was the Terminator. Before Conan. And yes even before Pumping Iron. As a matter of fact this was even before Arnold won a single Mr. Olympia and was still only Mr. Universe. Arnold age 23 is Hercules. In fact he isn't credited as Arnold Schwarzenegger but as Arnold Strong. This movie intentional or not is one of the funniest if not THE funniest movie of all time. The movie is extremely low budget has horrendous acting mindblowingly subpar special effects even by the standards of 1970 and an overlyredundant soundtrack. Let's take a closer look.Hercules is bored with life on Mt. Olympus. The movie starts off with Hercules complaining to Zeus and telling him that he wants to leave. After a few minutes of back and forth arguing Zeus gets angry enough at Hercules to throw one of his lightning bolts which look like they were welded together in a junkyard at him and in a puff of smoke cheap special effects he disappears. Turns out he has fallen to earth somewhere in the middle of the ocean. On his way down he passes by an airplane on which an extremely crazy lady with a funny voice and an even funnier hat sees him as she looks out the window and has a fit.Here he is picked up by a freighter and tells the captain that no man is superior to Hercules. He spends the rest of the voyage picking fights with the crew for no apparent reason. It is during this scene that John Candy makes his first ever uncredited appearance in his movie career. When the ship reaches New York Hercules goes ashore and is attacked by a group of hobos who he takes care of with a wooden plank. This is where he meets Pretzi played by Arnold Stang. They hitch a cab ride only to find out that Hercules has no money because Hercules needs no money. The cabbie tries to beat up Herc who yells the hilarious line of HOW DARE YOU TOUCH HERCULES! throws him in the bushes and flips over his taxi.Herc and Pretzi run off and somehow end up in a playing field with college students training in discus javelin and far jump. Herc says Zoze men don't ssrow it faaar enuff and proceeds to humiliate the college students in all events. One hilarious part is when he takes his shirt off and does a tittydance before throwing the javelin.After this Herc and Pretzi are invited to a college professor's house and are sitting in the living room with his smokinghot daughter Deborah Loomis. At this point her friend comes in and after an exchange of words he punches Herc in the gut to which he replies YOU have strucked Hercules! and hoists the young man into the air.Hercules and the hottie end up dating. It is during their first date that they encounter an escaped bear from the zoo which is actually quite conspicuously a man in a bear costume. Herc pounds the bear into submission with his girlfriend screaming in the background. This scene has to be one of the funniest in cinematic history. During one of their outings Herc sees a poster of a Hercules movie and in his outrage rips off his shirt in the middle of the street starts posing and demands to know who gave zees imperzonator permission to imitate Herkooles! Before long Herc becomes a wrestler. Long story short Pretzi is threatened by the mob to sign Herc over to them and he does as he is told. Eventually Herc goes up against Monstro the Magnificent in a weightlifting match which he loses because Juno took away his powers. He gets jumped by the mob and then its Atlas and Samson yes the biblical Samson to the rescue. In the end Herc goes back to Mt. Olympus.For one to fully appreciate this movie it must be watched with Arnold's real voice although the dubbed version is great for laughs too. This movie is an absolute jewel. It is so horrible that it's great. It has an innocent charm to it as well and one can't help but love it. Arnold's acting is virtually nonexistent and he exhibits less emotion than when he played the Terminator. This is balanced out by Arnold Stang's constant overacting. Deborah Loomis is smokinghot but her acting skills are below average. Hell everyone's acting in this movie is belowaverage. This movie contains literally dozens of hilarious oneliners by Arnold. The Mt. Olympus scenes are all filmed in Central Park and traffic can be heard in the background. You know what? I'm just going to stop here. There are too many hilarious things to list. Go watch it!".

The fact that anybody invested as much as a nickel in a script that one monkey working for one hour could easily have done better is what really blows my mind. The premise is painfully stupid and the execution of it is as heavyhanded and amateurish as anything you're likely to see. Most porn movies are produced with more consideration for plot.I recommend Hercules in New York to anyone who likes to go to the dentist or enjoys a hard punch in the nose.

The funny thing about that is that history proved that wrong Arnold actually turned out to be an extraordinary actor with a successful career. See thats surprising when you watch this movie! And back to that god forbidden bear scene. I must say that from the moment I saw the bear I cried with laughter. I really can't see how anyone anyone of any time can be so thickheaded that they actually make such a costume and even worse uses it for the movie. And well there is a lot of other unbelievable details in this movie in fact the entire movie is a huge surprise I mean Zeus' thunderbolts are actually made of steel bars normally used for supporting concrete structures and it is obvious if you look at them. Well I could go on with these excuse me hopeless and stupid details  as well as the entire main plot but I guess there is nothing more to say a very very bad movie beyond words. I encourage ANYONE with my heart and soul to watch it. Better laughs are rarely found and besides it is a suitable tribute to Arnold to watch this one from start to finish a never forgotten movie in history and it really sucks! Though it is indeed supreme if you need one and a half hours of cheep laughs i rate it 1 because it is technically the worst movie i have seen. 110".

At first I thought the nicknames  Pretzy for instance of some of the characters plus Zeus' fake lightnings would make me laugh but no. Not even. It's so bad you can not laugh. Oh yes sorry ! there is the scene where our hero Arnold himself beats a wild bear in Central Park. It's night but no actually it's day most of the time they just forgot to shoot some parts of it so it's day and Hercules has to save a precious young lady from a wild bear that escaped from the zoo...the only problem is that the thing never looks like a real bear. It is just so bad it's no funny at all. A clumsy man probably forgot to dig the holes for the eyes in the material wearing brown pajamas and pretending to be a bear is attacking Mr. World...Great. I can't wait to see the sequel. Thanks again Mr. Arthur Seidelman for this wonderful piece of s. I almost cried at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gonzalo Pelayo Llus Homar's dream has always been to go to win at a great casino . Unhealthy Gonzalo is a veteran man but has a marvelous dream to decipher a legal way to win and become a winner person . Gonzalo comes up with a way to chose number to win at the Casinos and he convinces his son Ivn Daniel Brhl  a highly intelligent young  who strives to succeed and they  then  reunite their particular family . As various Spanish guys supported by an ill old man create a code in legal method to win money at the casinos . As Ivn gets together fishmonger Baln Vicente Romero and his quirky cousins Marcos Oriol Villa and Alfredo Miguel ngel Silvestre  alias El Duke and both of whom they arrange to break the bank of casino by means of winning in roulettes gambles . All of them form a small but secretive club and are being trained by Gonzalo to the skill of win at the roulette wheel in international Casinos . Using their skills of code and hand signals  the bettors have made hundreds of thousands of Euros and dollars in wagers  winning at casino after casino  changing the game forever . They broke the banks at casinos across five continents  msterdam  Las Vegas  Australia  Paris  Madrid  Vienna  Macao  Hong Kong . . . But their arrogance at winning put on the radar of a tough casino security enforcer  Eduard Fernndez  who is working on his own personal agenda  as he holds a mutual grudge of some kind against Gonzalo which threatens to undo everything the members have learned and earned . Ultimately greed  pride  ego  desperation and reckoning all play a role in how involvement in this group affects Gonzalo's life plan . An impressively crafted  wellplayed flick  founded on a perfectly calibrated screenplay whose emotional grip tightens as it proceeds . There takes place a thrilling cat and mouse game  as well as an intense battle of wits between a wise but sickly veteran excellently played by Luis Homar and a cerebral  stubborn security controller  magnetically performed by Eduard Fernndez . Being inspired by real events in with a group of bettings were able to win hundreds of thousands of dollars at roulette tables around the world as their incredible achievements became legendary  and not only in the small casinos . This The Pelayos bears remarkable resemblance to 21 BlackJack 2008 by Robert Luketic  also starred by a gang of freaks who defy a twofisted agent  being played by Jim Sturgess  Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey . The protagonist of this great success results to be Daniel Bhrul who was born in Barcelona and brought up in a fully multilingual home  as he speaks fluent German  English Portuguese  Spanish  French and Catalan  displaying a successful national and international career with a lot of hits as Eva  Intruders Krabat Good bye Lenin  The Fifth Estate and Rush. Luis Homar is simply awesome  he steals the show as an old  illnessstricken but superintelligent gambler . Agreeable support cast gives nice acting as Miguel ngel Silvestre  Oriol Vila  Vicente Romero  Blanca Surez as gorgeous crupier  Marina Salas and special mention for the astute and revengeful Casino chief masterfully played by Eduard Fernndez . The picture deservedly had several prizes  it Won Gaud Award Best Production Manager  Eduard Valls  Gaud Award Best Film not in the Catalan Language and Nominated best art design and cinematography . Besides  Mlaga Spanish Film Festival 2012  Won Silver Biznaga Best Film Editing . In addition  it displays a colorful photography in juicy atmosphere  being filmed by David Omedes  deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen  who has shot successes as Salvador To Hell with the Ugly Special's chef  My mothers likes women and A night at old Mexico . Being filmed on location in Barcelona Catalonia Lloret de Mar Girona  Palma Mallorca  Balearic Islands  Gran Casino Mallorca . Lively and atmospheric musical score by Micka Luna . Well and lavishly produced by Loris Omedes  Julio Piedra and Gonzalo e Ivan Garcia Pelayo . The motion picture was professionally directed by Eduard Cortes . Here Corts  also writer  was inspired by the true events of a band who were trained to become experts in bets and subsequently took many casinos for millions in winnings . His film Nobody's life with Jose Coronado  was very nicely received  being debut director Eduard Corts  from the world of television  where he has extensive experience as a director of TV3 regional channel . He has realized several TV episodes for known series and subsequently shooting other films as Ingrid  Otros Dias Vendran  La Caverna Atraco and this The Pelayos . The motion picture will appeal to quartet protagonist fans  Daniel Bhrul  Luis Homar  Miguel Angel Silvestre  Blanca Suarez  all of them make an excellent work .

THE PELAYOS is a film full of adventure which shows how ingenuity can transform 'insignificant' people into people capable of bringing down powerful companies. It is a film about lust for life about taking on the world when you're 20 years old.

	schema:reviewBody "Lost and Delirious is one of those movies that you may catch while flipping through channels late at night and end up loving.  That is exactly what happened to me when I first saw this film.  On the cover I thought this would be another one of those feminist or lesbian type of movies but it isn't.  It's actually a beautiful but tragic love story. Lost and Delirious stars Piper Perabo Jessica Pare and Mischa Barton as three teenage girls at an allgirl prep school.  Barton is Mary Bradford a new girl to the school.  She doesn't have much trouble fitting in as she makes quick friends with her two roommates Paulie Oster Perabo and Tori Miller Pare.  One night Mary who can't sleep walks over to her window and sees Paulie and Tori kissing.  At first she doesn't think much of it but as she continues watching she begins to see that Paulie and Tori may be more than just close friends.This is truly a one of a kind film.  I'm not real familiar with any of the three leading actresses past films except for Piper Perabo who I saw in 1999's Whiteboyz.  She gives the best performance out of the three.  I'm also not real familiar with director Lea Pool's past films either but I must say that her direction here is first rate.Lost and Delirious is a beautiful film no doubt.  I've never seen a movie that has ever been more honest in carefully displaying its intentions which is showing two people in love.  Throughout the course of the film we see Paulie and Tori's romance blossom but keep in mind that they are not lesbians they are simply two people in love that just so happen to be girls.  Towards the middle of the film we see their love for each other slowly begin to fade when they are both caught in bed by Tori's little sister after making love the night before.  It is at this point that Tori decides to call it quits to their relationship.  Paulie torn that the only person she ever loved doesn't return the same feelings soon begins to descend into jealousy lust and violence.  This is where the movie really starts to get depressing and the ending shows how far a person will go just to show their love for someone.Lost and Delirious is a very lovely film in deed but is also very sad at the same time.  This is definitely a film that's not for everyone and I give it a ten out of ten.".

	schema:headline " A moving story of first love";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie Lost and Delirious was without a doubt one of the best depictions of young love to hit the screen yet. This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever been in love. The story of two girls in love and the social pressures that surround them in an all girl boarding school. Most people would say Why do we want to know this story? I say because it is heartfelt and a true telling of the emotions swirling around same sex relationships. As individuals we all long to belong somewhere to know that someone loves us despite the horrors around us everyday. To Paulie this is who Tory is to her. She knows that as long as she feels Tory's love for her life is worth living. Their love is secret of course because so many don't understand what it means to just love. Into the secrecy of their relationship comes Mary B. or Mouse who befriends them both and cares for them each as a friend despite knowing that they are a little more than friendly. Adding to the confusion of emotions Tory's little sister Alley bursts in one morning to find her sister in a precarious position...in bed with Paulie. From here out the relationship between the two girls is strained.Tory feels the pressure of her parents's dreams and expectations for her and is unable to acknowledge her love for Paulie fearing that her family will no longer love her and she will be forced to be seen as not normal by all her classmates. So in essence Tory chooses to shut out Paulie to avoid speculation and in doing so unwittingly causes Paulie to slowly descend into madness. Paulie of course takes the situation to heart after all they are in love and that should be enough to overcome anything. But instead she finds herself alone...well except for Mary B. her loyal friend.I love how the story is so real especially in the connections of the schoolgirls. Let's face it we all went to high school private or not and it's brutal. Mary B. is loyal. She sticks with Paulie even though the other girls begin to talk about her as if she is one of them. The classic scene is at the mail boxes she responds with Paulie is my friend so I guess it doesn't matter what everyone else says! However she does witness Paulie falling apart and is torn with how to help. You see how hard it is for Tory to step away from Paulie but the real heart breaker is in how Paulie deals with the rejection of her first real love. She feels as if the world has ended and the sun will no longer shine if there is no more Tory. She tries to win her back but only causes embarrassment to Tory through her wooing.If you have ever loved someone and for whatever reason others saw that love as wrong your heart will break when you see this movie and you will weep. Sadly Paulie is unable to cope with the rejection of Tory and Tory is not able to step beyond her own insecurities and prejudices of others to comfort Paulie. So Paulie gives into the madness...the overwhelming grief she feels from the loss leads to her undoing. In the end it is Tory who is left to deal with the love they once shared and all that could have been. Mary B. learns through Paulies' folly how to pull herself out of the madness that can swallow us all if we aren't careful. This movie is moving your heart will not escape the pain but perhaps it will teach you too how to pull out of the madness around us all and in turn show us how to love one another. For love just is.".

	schema:headline " Three Kinds of Misery";
	schema:reviewBody "It could be called THE THREE FACES OF ANGST.Watching LOST AND DELIRIOUS zaps you into the utter miseries of adolescent anguish and even those who haven't been to boarding school will relate. Moreover each lead teen exemplifies a different type of misery although all have identity issues. Take the narrator Mouse is her dad's pet name for her. Mary Bedford also known as Mary B. gets the label 'B for Brave' by her older dashing dorm mate Paulie. But afraid to take on the Brave mantle Mary calls tells the Indian landscaper she's 'In Transition' a fitting name for a pubescent teenager. Mary represents the anguish of detachment leaving home for the first time though only about fourteen. Her mother died of cancer three years earlier and stepmom is envious of the bond between Mouse and her father. Hence she arrives at school and awkward outsider. Not only does Mary exude the New Girl vibe but she soon finds herself witness to an extremely passionate relationship between her roommates the adopted Paulie short for Pauline and the religious Victoria. After awhile Mary finds their mutual cooing comfortable evidence of their confidence in her as a trusted friend. The girls also bond through imaginary letters written to their parents which purge their repressed feelings. For instance Tory airwrites to her mother whom she both despises and idolizes. Unlike Mary and Paulie Tory has both an older brother in a nearby boy's academy and a younger sister here at Perkins. When the sister discovers Tory in bed naked with Paulie Tory starts a campaign of disavowing her love. Yet this is no ordinary crush soon blown over. Tory who initiated lesbian sex acts several times continues to room with and unintentionally tease the despairing Pauline. Both girls are homophobic in both speech and attitude. They do not consider themselves gay at all but sharing in a special unity. However to squelch rumors of their homosexual behaviors Tory starts dating Jake her brother's friend and bragging about it blaming Paulie as the unclear unrequited lover. Her misery stems from selfdenial and deepseated fear of being gossiped about and labeled. Anyone who has come out of the political or sexual closet knows how labels stick. Above all she fears being disowned by her family.Paulie has no such fear because her birth mother wishes to remain unfound and her adopted mom has emptiness behind her smiling eyes. Even the teachers can see Paulie's torment. Her affection for Tory soars beyond all teenage crush. This is a pure passion which exceeds rationality. Reading Shakespeare and cavalier poetry turns Paulie into a knight of yore and she challenges Jake to a duel for the love of her lady. Despite this and her other tomboy tendencies she cannot accept the lesbian label either but she's willing to put up with whatever others say as long as she can continue the fleeting bliss known alltoobriefly. In Pauline we see the ultimate misery of desire denied. With the firm confidence of youth Pauline cannot imagine ever loving so deeply so freely again. A realism pervades the strong performances of LOST AND DELIRIOUS that echoes the depressing state of adolescent anguish. The clear delineation of separate but joined misery by the three young leads make this film not a downer but a celebration of truthand filmmaking at its most intimate and revelatory.".

It was a far deeper film than I expected it to be and I will need to watch it several times to appreciate its full impact. I never manage to fully appreciate a film first time round!The clever parallels drawn between Paulie's character and the bird of prey's plight are cleverly handled although I thought it was made a little too obvious when she began to refer to herself as 'the raptor'. I felt this was unnecessary the viewer should have been left to make that link for him or herself. The increasing tension which draws the viewer inexorably towards the climax of the film is almost unbearable. I felt myself starting to dread the end of the film fearing its almost inevitable end. IMHO this is a masterful piece of moviemaking. Miss it and miss out!".

	schema:reviewBody "Lost and Delirious is an awkward but strikingly earnest film. The story deals with a love affair between two girls at an exclusive prep school as witnessed by their roommate. Mischa Barton plays Mary the new girl at school who quickly realizes that the two girls she shares a room with are a good deal more than just friends. Paulie Perabo is an outspoken girl with a troubled past and Tori is a privileged girl from a more traditional family.The first time Mary catches Paulie and Tori kissing on a rooftop in the middle of the night she assumes they are only practicing for future encounters with boys. Soon enough the two are sharing a bed in the nude and the sounds they are making through the night leave little doubt as to what is going on. Mary accepts their relationship and the three seem on their way to being good friends. Things take a turn for the worst when Tori's younger sister walks in the room one morning and catches Tori in the nude with Paulie. It's absolutely astonishing to see how fast Tori pushes Paulie away from that moment on. Tori explains that her parents would basically disown her if they found out. She spreads the word around campus that Paulie is actually a sexual predator who crawls in bed with her from time to time.Tori ends up being a rather unlikeable character as the film progresses. She immediately hooks up with a boy from a nearby school and openly flaunts the fact that Paulie means nothing to her. We know this isn't true from the start however. Notice the agony on her face after she walks away from explaining to her little sister how there's nothing between herself and Paulie. She even goes as far as telling Paulie that she'll never love anyone else as much. All this after dumping and ridiculing her! Is this supposed to make Paulie feel better about being dumped? Anyway enough about Tori...Piper Perabo steals the show as Paulie. Her character would best be described as dangerously romantic and obsessive. She loves Tori more than could easily be explained here. Her constant public displays of devotion leave nothing to the imagination about how she feels. At one point she even challenges Tori's new boyfriend to a duel in the nearby woods. There is nothing anyone can do to console Paulie or curb her obsession. At one point even Mary is taken under her spell until loving memories of her late mother seem to bring her back to reality. Paulie has nothing like that to fall back on. Once she sees that she will never be with Tori it can only end tragically for her. Piper Perabo needs to be in better films like this one. No more Cheaper by the Dozens or Coyote Uglys please! This is not your typical film about teen love to say the least. Although this film has a few flaws you will not soon forget it after seeing it. To see such devotion for one person from another is rare even in movies. There are sex scenes and they are handled honestly and tastefully. The film will no doubt remind all of its viewers about their most painful crushes regardless of whom they may have been for. There are a few minor side plots that may not seem to fit with the central theme of this film but overall you will likely find it a rewarding experience. And you have been warned this film will probably depress you.8 of 10 stars.The Hound".

Every camera angle tape speed background audio effects...everything...in this movie is absolutely perfect. I've never seen anything like it. The only other picture I can remember of this same artistic caliber would be John Duigan's 1998 film Lawn Dogs.  However even it does not leave you with the emotional sting that Lost and Delirious does. The bottom line is do NOT rule out this film because of the basis of it's storyline. It is not all about the sexual relations  lesbian activity. It is very much a deep look into the human spirit.".

She successfully portraits a teen suffering the pain from losing her true love and feeling abandoned by everyone else in the whole world. Although I disagree with how she handled the situation at the end she is absolutely stunning a very talented actress. Paulie is very passionate crazy in love with Tori her schoolmate and roommate and not afraid of showing it in public whereas Tori is the exactly opposite. When their relationship is discovered Tori runs away from her true love into another guy's arm. Tori is afraid of her parents' reactions. She then purposely shows off her new relationship in front of Paulie so she won't be taken as a lesbian by her friends. I can't help wonder if Tori does truly love Paulie how could she have the heart to torment hurt Paulie like this?! If Tori really wants to break off with Paulie she should have let Paulie down gently. No wonder Paulie goes nuts at the end and takes an extreme measure to herself. After all Paulie is willing to go all the way for love but I am not sure if Tori deserves it.Overall the acting is great. Pearbo gave a superior performance to deep emotion that Paulie has. You can feel the joy and pain that Paulie goes thru. She really touches your heart. It is a very emotional and intense movie worth of seeing it.".

Because you see almost everybody sometimes in their life get through a period like these girls are going. Who hasn't been completely shattered by a relationship that's going nowhere or simply doesn't lift up? Funny parts too especially those with the gardener offering some words of advice to Mouse.

	schema:reviewBody "Piper Perabo is absolutely moving in this film which centers around Paulie Perabo and Tori's brief love tale as told through the eyes of Mouse Mischa Barton a neglected young lady who is placed in boarding school by her father at the suggestion of her step mother. However like many lesbian movies made before the Dykefication of mainly Californian American society this is one that has no happy ending despite the mainly Canadian cast.Mouse obviously feels estranged from her family since the passing of her mother and finds quick acceptance and camaraderie in her roommates Paulie and Torie. Paulie is adopted and feels like she has no real family and is obviously devoid of any spiritual connections with many people in her life save for Tori. Tori on the other hand is very sheltered by her conservative parents but like Paulie she also feels like her family isn't entirely who she is.We then discover that Paulie and Tori are lovers and often make love while Mouse is supposedly asleep thereby lacking the decency to slip a Nyquil into Mouse's bedtime milk so she can peacefully sleep through it all. However one morning Paulie forgets to crawl back to her bed !!! and the pair are caught by Tori's little sister and her posse.Tori thinking of how her parents and family might abandon and disown her is quick to denounce what her sister saw and chalks it all up to Paulie's emotional imbalance. This has got to be the most infuriating and gutwrenching scene of the movie when the perpetually closeted girl seals herself into her gilded wardrobe with a perky and halfconvincing I'm boy crazy! This drove me insane because it almost seemed as though lil sis was about to say If you are I'll eventually think about starting on reaccepting you as my family out of love. Meanwhile her bratty little sister not only spreads the rumor around the school that Paulie is lesbian but that she is after her very straight sister. Tori even begins a relationship with a boy from a nearby boarding school to assert her heterosexuality. This is because we all know the sure cure for homosexuality is a big obnoxious frat boy penis.Mouse watches all this and remains friends with Paulie despite the rumors people are spreading. Although she tries to help her friend even Mouse can't stop Paulie's near psychotic downward spiral into torturous emotional HELL. My heart just went out to Perabo's acting as I had to endure ever more unbearable uncomfortable scenes of Paulie absolutely losing it in class at the dining commons at the fatherdaughter dance and right before the climax. Going back to the obnoxious frat boy stereotype I was kind of disappointed that Paulie didn't clock the moron's chin after he proclaims that he played Laertes in Hamlet. His face was so schmucky I really wished Paulie would hit him in principle.Anywho the ending is for your viewing pleasuredisgust. There are also some juxtapositions with the hawk and Paulie but quite honestly that parallel was lost on me... I was Lost for the most part because I couldn't understand why Paulie someone who held herself together despite her fragility would completely lose it for a closeted girl... and Delirious because despite the former statement Perabo really did do a good job with the insane material she was given.However this is why I couldn't give the movie a better grade... it made me too uncomfortable. I felt absolutely embarrassed for Paulie and just hoped HOPED she could just get over herself and Tori. So many scenes are just downright uncomfortable to watch and I really believe that it's because Perabo got the pain of Paulie down perfectly. While I don't want to dismiss this movie because of the lesbian movie tragedy stereotype I wanted to put it out there in case you're expecting a heartwarming Saving Faceish love comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I rented this movie for the wrong reason being a post adolescent male Piper Perabo and lesbian seemed to go well together. However it turned out to be a really good flick which was really well done on all levels. Technically the 3 main actresses portrayed their parts really well.  The cinematography was excellent including some really well done shots that seem to stick with you after the movie.  Piper Perabo on the roof with the eagle for one. Storywise this movie is also excellent.  As another reviewer said it's poetry.  It talks not only of love but of love lost and no longer requited. It talks of change and the extents to which a person will go to get that special someone back. All in all I'd give this movie 4 stars out of 5 and recommend renting it to anyone looking to fill a couple hours with a good movie.".

This is a theme that has been done again and again and AGAIN in film but something that viewersif one uses this voting forum as a clue cannot seem to get enough of.Every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. The lead characters say it all the crazy abandoned genius rebel lesbian tough girl well they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough her up but it didn't stick much seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. Watching them every step of the way is character 3 a dopey wellmeaning wideeyed good girl observer. I say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest most inane monologues.Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well... talk. Hearing them make love with their noises was um you know like well... okay! she says about her 2 wanton roommates who roll around in the bed next to her.Later she asks Graham Greene the accomplished native American actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener ! Is it wrong to care what people think?Sorry but is she a teenager or is she age 7?Granted Piper Perabo as Polly the tortured dyke  others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. She would do well in a decent project so this is in no way a criticism of the acting.But this story is SHAMELESS in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character. They couldn't stop with her Polly being an angry crazypassionate secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbing.That's a word THEY males use against US women! she says stomping out of the classroom.Is this ALL the writer could come up with? Or maybe we should ask Why stop there? Poole and co. went on and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods.Cue the slow motion scifi Xena atmosphere!Then we have her writing to her birth mother... most lesbians are lovestarved orphans in case you were in the dark.Then we have two teachers one uptight one a zany type with loose neck ties who hover around all of the action the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers... and give dark child seductressbird girl tense looks. Hmmmm. I wonder if something well you know... um FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS??????There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. Heartbreak happens but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock.I cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end but if you are not laughing I can only guess you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean the wimpy make out scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen La Pool's wonderful 1998 comingofage film Set Me Free I was excited to check out this new film of hers. How disappointing to find that the charm character and sincerity of that film is completely missing here.The plot It doesn't take Mary the mousy new girl at an all girl's school very long to figure out that her two roommates Pauline rebellious and tough and Victoria more traditional are lovers. But when some other girls discover them in bed together Victoria starts pretending to be straight. This makes the rebellious Pauline go nuts so she takes up bird training and pretending that she's living in the 14th Century while the mousy girl runs around looking distressed.When the film begins the three female leads are ridiculously bouncy and hyper causing me to wonder if they might be the same actors I saw on Barney about six years ago. Then when the girls turn serious they sound like they're reading their lines from a drugstore romance novel Have you ever been really thirsty so you take a big drink of milk right out of the carton  only it's gone sour? That's what's happening to me. Inside. Forever. How can this line be taken seriously?One of the few things worse than the film's dialogue is the overbearing grabbag of a soundtrack. The music leaps from inspirational Native American Rain Forest Muzak for the bird training scenes to mid'80s horror film synthesizers for the dramatic moments like the shattering mirror and then on to the gutwrenching love ballad that plays during a 5minute closeup of Pauline's twisted face as she writhes in pain from suffering and despair. Good grief.Jackie Burroughs the incredible actress who plays the school's elderly headmistress is more beautiful sexy dynamic exciting genuine and fascinating than all of the other characters in the film combined. She delivers the film's only genuinely moving scenes but her outstanding and brief performance only makes the rest of the film seem that much more banal.This film may have been revolutionary had it been made in 1961 but it's set in 2001 so the girls' selfhatred and repression seem outdated and unnecessarily melodramatic. I just wanted to slap them.If you're interested in cinema that deals intelligently and realistically with the difficulties and confusion  as well as the pleasure and joy  of young women coming to terms with their attraction to each other I would recommend The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In Love and Show Me Love.".

The scene where the three main characters are reciting letters to their mothers is particularly bad the first has written hers ahead of time but the other two spontaneously create drivel that some scriptwriter must think is particularly deep and intriguing.The second problem is that we're never really shown what's so so great about the love between Tori and Paulie that Paulie will go through the lengths she does for it. I'm sure fans of this movie will claim that it's true love! but the film leaves us to infer this instead of making us truly believe it.There are various notes that ring emotionally false. One that stands out is Mary's reaction to her two roommates having sex in their room while she's there she appears to have no problem with it. I can just hear the thought process of the writer of the original novel or of the screenwriter if this wasn't in the original Mary has to be absolutely okay with everything or else she'll look homophobic. You find me a high school girl who's completely comfortable with two people of either gender having sex in the room while she's there I'll show you a high school girl who's either a voyeur or is trying too hard to seem cool.The actors try hard to sell this story but the script is so bad that it can't be done. As the film progresses Paulie begins to look more and more like a head case and the awkward Shakespearean quotes get worse. Don't waste your time watching this. 210".

I don't want to hand out any spoiler but I'll say that it truly sticks to the title and parts of it are disturbing. I did not like how the film was treated because had it not been for the music and Piper Perabo's acting it would have felt like a TV movie. At times the pace is painfully slow and some scenes seem pointless. Piper Perabo steals the show with her terrific portrayal of the emotionally tortured and abandoned Paulie. Mischa Barton looks uncomfortable and she needs to eat but does okay in a few scenes. The soundtrack is quite unusual. There is something captivating about it. I also liked the sequences with Paulie and the raptor that symbolized liberty. It is not an easy film to watch but tells an interesting story of rejected love.".

Yes it's also bad the way Victoria treated Paulie but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life? Or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children? Secondly when Mary's father didn't show up for the dinner and Paulie helped Mary release her anger that Mary even said she wished he were dead... Somehow I don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lost and Delirious is about three girls who attend a private boarding school. As is common with such films the girls feel alienated from their parents and at odds with the adult world in general.As in real life the characters sometimes turn to rebellion to voice or act out their dissatisfactions. They break all the rules and isolated as they are in the selfcontained world of the allgirls school they create their own world which they liken to Peter Pan's world of the Lost Boys.This is a coming of age story. But it is more than that. It is a love story that may be uniquely about teens or may be universal for all ages. Paulie played by Piper Perabo is a young woman with great passions. When she reads Shakespeare she doesn't just read the lines she relates to the desperation of the characters especially after her roommate Victoria rejects her love. She admires raptors because they live a simple life and are compelled by nature to hunt and obtain what they need. Paulie wishes to become more raptorlike as she suffers the pain of rejection and the pain of loving. Piper Perabo plays the part tremendously. I enjoyed watching her in this role in part because I watch Covert Affairs and I enjoyed seeing her earlier in her career.Victoria is played by Jessica Pare. The other roommate Mary is played by Mischa Barton. Both play their roles convincingly with passion.The headmistress is played by Jackie Burroughs. She is inspired in her portrayal. One feels that so many levels of her character lie behind her words and actions. In a small role Graham Greene is notable as usual.The film captures the disappointment of young people who are torn between loving and hating their parents. It explores the edge between childhood and adulthood where roles in society are defined sometimes painfully. And it celebrates the passion of allencompassing love especially by young people who burn so brightly.I enjoyed the soundtrack of this film. The direction was well done bringing the viewer into the world of the girls. The only choice that bothered me was the ending. Not that it was horrible but I found it distracting. I feel the same symbolism could have been achieved without the confusing move into surrealism.".

	schema:reviewBody "20th Century Fox's THE BRAVADOS 1958 is another fine fifties Cinemascope western from the studio's vaults. Coming near the end of the decade it was produced with the usual Fox widescreen expertise that was displayed so well previously with such gems as Garden Of Evil 1954 Broken Lance '54The Tall Men '55 and the beautiful The Last Wagon 1956. Solidly directed by the ever reliable Henry King it was stunningly photographed by the great Leon Shamroy in lovely Mexican locations and the splendid screenplay derived from the novel by Frank O'Rourke. Also the initial setting of a border town is remarkably attractive thanks to the splendid Art Direction of Lyle Wheeler and MarkLee Kirk.A brooding unsmiling Gregory Peck is Jim Douglas who arrives in the small town of Rio Arriba after a long ride to attend the hanging of four outlaws you rode over a 100 miles just to see a hanging? the Sheriff asks.. Douglas believes the four are responsible for the rape and murder of his wife and is here to bear witness to their execution. But when they escape from the local jail  taking a young female hostage Kathleen Gallant with them  Douglas sets out after them in a relentless pursuit I've been after them for six months  I'm not going to lose them now and eventually arbitrarily kills each of them one by one except for the last who proves to him that the four could not have murdered his wife after all. Peck is superb! He gives one of his strongest ever performances. The fury in his eyes and the all consuming hatred and desire for vengeance is powerfully palpable in his gritted teeth portrayal. Others in the cast are good too. The illfated Stephen Boyd as the leader of the four I have a weakness for women the also illfated Albert Salmi every man is entitled to one weakness  mine's cards the nervous halfbreed perfectly played by Lee Van Cleef please don't kill me! I done some bad things but I never murdered anyone and a young Henry Silva as the Indian who knows instinctively that Douglas isn't far behind He has the eyes of a hunter. Herbert Rudley too gives a good turn as the Sheriff and in the female lead is British actress Joan Collins who really doesn't have very much to do except look gorgeous. Curiously she plays an unmarried Mexican rancher by the name of Josefa Valarde but her accent is straight out of London's Park Lane. Hmmm!Nevertheless the whole thing also is perfectly punctuated by a terrific score by Alfred Newman and Hugo Friedhofer. Newman's main theme is a driving and pulsating march theme first heard under the titles over a medium tracking shot of Peck on horseback at full gallop against the night sky. The music splendidly points up and instantly establishes the determination and resolve of the protagonist. Newman also wrote a lovely gentle Mexican guitar cue for the Collins character Josefa which gets a ravishing full orchestral rendition for the finale. Friedhofer contributed to the dramatic scenes the musical supervision was by Alfred's younger brother Lionel and the orchestra was conducted in Germany by Bernard Kaun.THE BRAVADOS is an all round enjoyable western and is a favourite among cultists. Not as good as Peck's best western ten years later  The Stalking Moon but still a good story of revenge and retribution in a beautiful looking well written well acted and well scored Cinemascope production. Another Fox winner!".

	schema:headline " Very good Western about a merciless avenger who seeks vengeance against four men who murdered his wife";
	schema:reviewBody "Pleasant classic Western with magnificent Gregory Peck who steals the show as a merciless revenger gunfighter . He is relentless in his vengeance  deadly in his violence but he learns that he has become no better than those he hunts . A Hollywood production full of action  exaggerated characters  shootouts and lots of violence . For revenge he doesn't care why he kills or how  ... . An errant Jim Douglas Gregory Peck sees the atrocity over his family and executes a singlehandedly revenge as he ravages and murders each person involved in his vendetta . Douglas has been relentlessly pursuing the four outlaws Albert Salmi  Henry Silva  Stephen Boyd and Lee Van Cleef who killed his wife but finds them in prison about to be hanged . But the prisoners escape and villagers enlist Douglas' aid to capture them . The conflict is a simple one between avenger Douglas and oppressors nasties bandits commanded by cruel Bill Zachary Stephen Boyd . Douglas along with a posse set out in pursuit the outlaws and he faces the vicious bandits.It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Gregory Peck against four heartless bandits . In the film premiere attained success  nowadays is well valued and I think it turns out to be a good classic Western. The picture is fleshed out with a marvelous cast as Gregory Peck who is excellent as a good father turned revenger . Nice too is Henry Silva as the brash Mexican young gun and Andrew Duggan as the amiable Padre . Joan Collins gives a good performance as Jim's former girlfriend  she does a well measured portrayal of a woman who still loves her previous sweetheart and who promises to leave with him which ultimately can never be . Stephen Boyd as a cruelly baddie role also is terrific . The film packs violence  gunplay  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shootouts or stunts every few minutes . This is a dark downbeat story of an avenger gunfighter perfectly performed by Gregory Peck told with genuine realism and honesty . Stylishly written by prestigious by Philip YordanJohnny Guitar  the screenplay was based on an original story by Frank O'Rourke. The movie was directed with a positive flair by Henry King . There are many fine technicians and nice assistants as Lyle Wheeler and Walter Scott in charge of Art Direction and Set Direction respectively . Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors dirty and rocky landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets on the Mexican landscapes . The musician Lionel Newman composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted  being helped by the maestros Hugo Friedhofer and Alfred Newman  tough uncredited  it's full of agreeable sounds and a haunting musical leitmotif . Sharply photographed with striking cinematography by Leon Shamroy in Technicolor Techniscope with negative well processed and outdoor sequences filmed in Jalisco Mexico Morelia MichoacnSt Jose Perua mountains Mexico.Henry King 's direction is well crafted  here he's less thoughtprovoking and broody and more inclined toward violence and too much action  because he's a expert on compelling AdventureWestern genre . Henry King directed other classic Western as  Jesse James1939and The gunfighter1950 with Peck again . Koster was specialist on Adventure genre as proved in Untamed  Captain King  Captain of Castilla  Black Swan  Stanley and Livingstone and many others . Rating  Better than average . Worthwhile watching .".

But the prisoners escape and villagers enlist Douglas' aid to capture them . The conflict is a simple one between avenger Douglas and oppressors nasties bandits commanded by cruel Bill Zachary Stephen Boyd . Douglas along with a posse set out in pursuit the outlaws and he faces the vicious bandits.It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Gregory Peck against four heartless bandits . In the film premiere attained success  nowadays is well valued and I think it turns out to be a good classic Western. The picture is fleshed out with a marvelous cast as Gregory Peck who is excellent as a good father turned revenger . Nice too is Henry Silva as the brash Mexican young gun and Andrew Duggan as the amiable Padre . Joan Collins gives a good performance as Jim's former girlfriend  she does a well measured portrayal of a woman who still loves her previous sweetheart and who promises to leave with him which ultimately can never be . Stephen Boyd as a cruelly baddie role also is terrific . The film packs violence  gunplay  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shootouts or stunts every few minutes . This is a dark downbeat story of an avenger gunfighter perfectly performed by Gregory Peck told with genuine realism and honesty . Stylishly written by prestigious by Philip YordanJohnny Guitar  the screenplay was based on an original story by Frank O'Rourke. The movie was directed with a positive flair by Henry King . There are many fine technicians and nice assistants as Lyle Wheeler and Walter Scott in charge of Art Direction and Set Direction respectively . Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors dirty and rocky landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets on the Mexican landscapes . The musician Lionel Newman composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted  being helped by the maestros Hugo Friedhofer and Alfred Newman  tough uncredited  it's full of agreeable sounds and a haunting musical leitmotif . Sharply photographed with striking cinematography by Leon Shamroy in Technicolor Techniscope with negative well processed and outdoor sequences filmed in Jalisco Mexico Morelia MichoacnSt Jose Perua mountains Mexico.Henry King 's direction is well crafted  here he's less thoughtprovoking and broody and more inclined toward violence and too much action  because he's a expert on compelling AdventureWestern genre . Henry King directed other classic Western as  Jesse James1939and The gunfighter1950 with Peck again . Koster was specialist on Adventure genre as proved in Untamed  Captain King  Captain of Castilla  Black Swan  Stanley and Livingstone and many others . Rating  Better than average . Worthwhile watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne's Ethan Edwards Jimmy Stewart's Howard Kemp or any number of roles Kirk Douglas has played have nothing of the intensity of Gregory Peck's Jim Douglas in The Bravados. Peck is perfect casting for the part because he's playing against type. If Atticus Finch's wife had been a homicide victim I think this is how we would see him. Totally lose a moral compass and become a relentless stalker. It's what makes The Bravados work because we identify Gregory Peck with an innate decency.Peck's house was robbed and his wife raped and murdered by intruders. Peck has a line on them they're four killers who've been caught and scheduled to hang for a bank robbery in a town several miles away where a bank teller has been killed. But they escape with the help of the hangman Joe DeReda soon to become a stooge. These are a quartet of the nastiest villains ever Stephen Boyd Albert Salmi Lee Van Cleef and Henry Silva all of whom have played villains with relish on the big screen. One of them Boyd in fact is a rapist they take young Kathleen Gallant the daughter of the town's dry goods merchant along as a hostage.Charles Bronson never executed bad guys with as much relish as Peck did. They are convicted murderers who've escaped there's no law to answer to. Peck may be doing some public service homicides but there's a higher law he must answer to for the preservation of his own soul. In fact the ending brings quite a twist to the tale.The Bravados is one of six films directed by long time 20th Century Fox director Henry King who is most known for doing nine films there with Tyrone Power. In fact the first couple that Peck did were probably properties that were meant for Power but Darryl Zanuck switched them for his new up and coming leading man.This one however is all Gregory Peck's film I'm not sure Power could have done a better job. Peck gets some able support from the villainous quartet and from Joan Collins as an old flame he finds that has settled in the town the four have savaged.Special mention should go to Andrew Duggan as the priest in the town where apparently everyone is Catholic. Duggan does a good job as the padre who gives just the right spiritual advice and counsel to a troubled soul.Themes like rape were not exactly subject matter for westerns before the Fifties. The Bravadoes succeeds both as Saturday matine shooting and as serious adult drama. It shouldn't be missed when broadcast.".

	schema:headline " This serious adult Western focuses on one man's fanatical pursuit of vengeance and played to nearperfection by Gregory Peck.";
	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Peck is the show in The Bravados.  His performance reminds me of John Wayne in The Searchers.  In both cases the eyes tell the story. Wayne's were full of hate for the Comanches that defiled his niece. Peck's intense eyes are equally important to this film.  In the words of one character Peck has the eyes of the hunter.Like Wayne in The Searchers Peck is a man with a quest.  Jim Douglas is out for revenge against the murderers of his wife.  This singleminded mission brings him to the town of Santa Rita where the four men he has been chasing are scheduled to hang for another killing.  The men escape with a hostage and the chase resumes.  Nothing will stop Douglas this time.  In his mind the four men deserve no pity and they get none.  The law failed to hang them and now it's his turn.The casting in this film is interesting.  The four low lifes pursued by Peck include three pretty good actors Stephen Boyd Henry Silva and Lee Van Cleef.  Of the three Henry Silva's character is the most interesting.  He plays Lujan an Indian.  Lujan and Peck share something.  They lock eyes at the beginning when Peck visits the four men in jail.  It is he who sees the eyes of the hunter.  He may not know why Peck hunts them but he recognizes him as a hunter.Ultimately Peck becomes a hero to the citizens of Santa Rita but heroism comes with a price.  In this case Peck sacrifices his humanity.  In their end there is potential salvation for Peck from a surprising source.Except for Lujan the film provides little reason to sympathize with the four badmen.  They have been sentenced to be hanged for a murder in Santa Rita.  Steven Boyd ruthlessly shoots an old prospector.  Later he rapes their hostage.  Even Joan Collins' character who earlier in the film has urged Peck to give up his relentless quest now urges him to track the surviving killers down and kill them.There is no question about the morality in this film.  There is something incomplete in Peck's character.  He is empty inside because the chase seems to be over.  The law has apparently done his job for him.  He has little to say to anyone when he arrives in Santa Rita including his old friend Josefa Collins.  His eyes are full of hate but otherwise he is hardly alive. He tells Josefa that he loved his wife.  I still do he says.  He has left his little girl behind to chase the killers.  Near the end when he sees the little girl she hides behind her nanny.  She hardly knows her father.  The jail break and the ensuing chase seem to temporarily energize him.  He becomes the leader of the possee.  Ultimately he rides off alone to extract his revenge.  The energy is misleading.  Peck knows what he must do and he does it without emotion.  He has sacrificed his humanity at the altar of revenge.This film is not for everyone.  It is a bit intense and Peck's character isn't very warm and fuzzy.  The Bravados is a humorless film about a serious subject.  Revenge isn't pretty and the price is too high.  Peck really delivers with a great performance and the plot is definitely creative.  The often told story of the man seeking revenge has seldom been told so well.".

	schema:reviewBody "After almost 50 years of first watching The Bravados I could not help thinking this time that this is a Catholic western. When I saw it as a kid while studying at a Catholic school ruled by Augustine priests I enjoyed it very much maybe because it was a reflection of what we were taught in classrooms as opposed to what we saw in the real world. I enjoyed the film today as much as I did the first time although then I was unaware of a few realistic contradictory and intriguing elements of the story the whole population of Ro Arriba except the sheriff a hangman and four outlaws attends piously to mass at night? as a sort of preliminary rite before hanging the outlaws but turns in seconds into an angry mob Joan Collins asks Gregory Peck to go into the church and have a talk with a certain lady Virgin Mary and then begs him to kill kill kill the outlaws in a poorly staged dramatic moment showing her limited acting range or the priest tells Peck after a little preaching that people think that prayer helps... not him. On the other hand it has moments of true honesty as when Peck confesses his guilt to the priest or the compassionate way the Mexican outlaw Lujn treats Peck in his home. This makes the film more fascinating while one follows Peck in an obsessive hunt for the four men who raped and killed his wife. Henry Silva shines as Lujn giving perhaps the finest performance in the film  one already knows Peck's style so Silva stands out as a fresh face and an original performer in his interpretation of the Mexican thief. It seems Henry King was aware of Silva's talent and features because he only gives us closeups of Silva and Stephen Boyd when Peck visits the outlaws in jail. The movie was shot in Mxico and most of the times King portrays the Mexican characters as real human beings especially the women Lujn's wife played by Alicia del Lago one of the stars of the Mexican classic Races the talkative peasant showing Peck the way to San Cristbal very convincing in her descriptions if you know Spanish or Parral's mother seen in a brief appearance played by a then young Ada Carrasco who put the finishing touch to her career as Nacha the old Indian passing the recipes of her gastronomic delights to the heroine of Laura Esquivel's Como agua para chocolate Like Water for Chocolate. A very good film.".

I agree with a couple of reviews that the very end seemed sweetened up somewhat but I went through a period in my 20's and 30's when I had grown overly cynical and didn't like 'unrealistic' endings. I have changed somewhat. I can enjoy both 'types' of movies and endings now I believe. I am more discerningly cynical now I hope. Where something really smells like manipulation for the wrong reasons or for greed I trust my doubts and cynicism to kick in. 'The Bravados' deserves your trust simply because it shows a universal human weakness among terrible heartwrenching circumstances in a somewhat 'realistic' setting.

	schema:reviewBody "Gregory Peck frequently picked westerns that were not the usual shoot'emups for a Saturday matine. He is Luke McCanless the amoral antihero of DUEL IN THE SUN. He is the title character THE GUNFIGHTER trying to settle down but finding his fast draw reputation a deadly one no matter what. He is eastern sea captain stuck in the midst of a ridiculous range war in THE BIG COUNTRY. He is the western trapperhunter who is pursued by a revenge crazed Native American in THE STALKING MOON. Oddly enough the last role is a mirror image of sorts to his role in THE BRAVADOS.Peck rides into a small border town in a southwestern territory of the west. He is quiet laconic  and surly. This is not the normal Peck second only to Henry Fonda or Jimmy Steward in playing Joe Good Guy characters. This is one of the roles that showed the real depths of Peck as an actor.It turns out that he has been following four men Steven Boyd Albert Salmi Lee Van Cleef and Henry Silva  and I have chosen that listing order for a reason who he was told raped and murdered his wife six months earlier. The four are in a jail awaiting hanging for a bank robbery and murder of a teller. Due to their notoriety everyone in town is a little edgy and wants to see them dangling  but are suspicious of strangers. Peck's attitude does not sit well with them although they soon learn he has come to see the hanging. His interest in seeing this as well as a request to see the men in their prison cell disgusts the local sheriff Herbert Rudley.Others in the town know Peck. The local padre Andrew Duggan does as does a wealthy land owner Joan Collins who once was his girlfriend. But he remains quiet about his motives for being in the town.Thanks to an ally future Three Stooges member Joe DeRita in a nicely handled part the gang nearly kills Rudley and escapes shooting a deputy in the process. They also kidnap the daughter of the local general store owner. The townspeople form a posse which Peck joins the following day he insists on getting a good night sleep first. Soon he is leading the posse quite well. As one of the four desperadoes the Bravados of the title Henry Silva says earlier  Peck looks like a hunter and is one to be feared.None of the Bravados recognize Peck. But as he corners them one by one he reveals his motivation to kill them and each denies knowing anything about what he is talking about. But the script is written to keep the viewers guessing until the conclusion about whether these men were guilty or not. The behavior of one of them Boyd certainly makes one feel Peck is on the right trail.The four Bravados are of interest too. Boyd and Salmi are not very likable types oddly enough they feel they could make a good duo once the gang splits up after a successful escape. Van Cleef is also deadly but in his case there are certain circumstances that are never fully explained he won't see his mother before the hanging nor speak to Duggan and later  under really tragic circumstances  he speaks of his own wife and child to an unrelenting Peck. But curiously all three speak disparagingly of Silva a Mexican Indian who one senses was their scout and probably not responsible for the killings they've committed. Silva turns out not only to be the smartest of the four but also with the help of his wife the only one to force Peck to rethink everything.The conclusion is a hideous mental agony for Peck  which even Duggan and Collins may never totally erase for him. In the end he requests the prayers of the townspeople as he leaves the scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a well made revenge yarn starring Gregory Peck as a small Arizona cattle rancher out to avenge the rape and murder of his wife. The bulk of the movie follows him as he leads a posse tracking four suspects attempting to escape to Mexico. This was a well done and compelling drama. I gave it six stars out of 10 in IMDb. It scored 14 points in my IMDb ranking. Both are good scores. Here were its better points The four villains are played by very good actors Stephen Boyd Albert Salmi Lee Van Cleef and Henry Silva. More importantly their characters are very well developed. The script manages to create sympathy for them even though they have few redeeming qualities. Stephen Boyd is excellent and carries the movie on his back. The bulk of this movie was filmed on location in a very attractive mountainous area of northern Mexcio. The exciting manhunt takes place against stunning vistas and is accompanied by one of the better musical scores I can remember. I particularly enjoyed the horns including some intense passages by the orchestra's trombone section. I'm not a big Gregory Peck fan but he was well cast and credible in this role. The movie is thematically interesting and complex. I'd rather not discuss in detail as it would probably give too much of the movie away. There were very well developed Mexican themes. This included Mexicans who can actually speak Spanish if you can believe it. It reminded me of the extended French dialogue among the trappers in Howard Hawk's The Big Sky. Here's what kept the movie from being better Joan Collins comes close to sinking the whole ship as the gratuitous romantic lead. Boyd's character should have had more screen time. I would like to have seen the outlaw group limited to just Silva and Boyd. His malevolent charisma was great counterpoint to Peck's grim emotionally repressed assassin. Peck is a cattle rancher. They should have explained why he is such an effective and experienced manhunter. I found the presence of a 100 Catholic town in 1880's Arizona to be inaccurate. The majority of white settlers at this time were biblical Protestants who wouldn't have been caught dead attending a Catholic mass. Certainly the town could have had an old Spanish mission and many Catholic Mexican residents who attended it but I didn't see any Mexicans in the town. The congregants all appeared to be white. This was probably just Hollywood once again displaying its total ignorance of Christianity. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!!There were a number of other plot holes. For example Peck's character lives too close to town to appear as a mysterious stranger. Surely rapemurders weren't so common in the area that the death of his wife hadn't been big news six months earlier. Same thing with the hangman whom someone should have been able to recognize. At one point Joan Collins teleports over 100 miles of rough country. And finally what is the justification for letting Henry Silva's character go free at the end? He was an accessory to two on screen murders and an the attempted murder of a sheriff. And let's not forget he had already been convicted and sentenced to hang for crimes committed before the movie began. Since the movie is supposedly a celebration of doing the right thing this must just be an idiotic mistake.Production code rapes were really weird. This one was very similar to the one in Rancho Notorious. The rapist makes sexually suggestive advances to the victim the camera cuts away from them there are a couple of screams from the woman then the rapist almost immediately runs back on camera. The rape seemingly takes place in about 15 seconds of live time. This isn't a criticism just an observation.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Jim Douglas rides into the town of Rio Arriba he is told they don't want any strangers in town till after four criminals are hanged he states that he has come to see them die and after surrendering his guns he enters town anyway. The sheriff asks him why he wants to see the men hang but receives no answer and when Douglas goes into the jail to see the men none of them recognise him. That night while the town is in church the men are broken out of jail and flee with a young woman as hostage the sheriff is wounded so his deputy leads a posse after the escapees. In the morning Douglas joins the posse and they track the men as they head for the Mexican border. As they go Douglas manages to corner the bandits one by one and each time shows his captive a picture of a woman they all claim not to have seen her but he doesn't believe them. Back in town a friend of his who he hasn't seen for five years learns his story from the town priest one day Douglas had returned home to find his wife had been raped and murdered the gang had been identified by a neighbour and Douglas had been after them ever since. When Douglas finally corners the last of the escapees he learns a shocking truth one that will affect him for the rest of his days.I've always associated Gregory Peck with the mild mannered lawyer Atticus Finch from 'To Kill a Mockingbird' so it came as a shock to see him playing a character hell bent on seeing four men die perhaps it is that surprise that made his performance seem so powerful. While Peck's performance carried the film the supporting cast which included Joan Collins and Lee Van Cleef did a fine job. The story of a man seeking revenge might be one of the oldest but that doesn't mean it is always clich the ending added an excellent twist that I'm sure would have taken me totally by surprise if it hadn't been hinted at on the blurb on the back of the DVD case. With many classic westerns the setting is almost as important as the story and this is no exception the locations are stunning in a way that makes the action believable. When I sat down to watch this I expected something fairly average but was gripped from start to finish I'm surprised this film isn't better known as it is a fine example of the genre... if you like Westerns this is a must see.".

The movie is too sympathetic for the four lowlifes notwithstanding the film's denouement. Henry Desilva was interesting but it's his wife that packs a punch. Anybody think that Clint Eastwood made about five movies based on this flick? Andrew Duggan needed a shot of something to liven him up otherwise how can he minister folks?

He came from far village to see the execution of these four men by the law but these were able to get away from the justice. At this point skilled Jim Douglas Peck decided to go behind them to make justice by himself. He first killed merciless two of them organizing tricky ambushes and the third one in the Mexican territory. In all cases Douglas showed the photo of his wife and the bandits always denied they knew her or did anything wrong against her. When these bandits were running away they arrived in a house of a miner who was the neighbor of Douglas. This miner tried to escape with his belongings money but was killed by one of the bandit. The money of the miner was taken by the fourth member of the gang a Mexican Indian Henry Sylva who ran away to meet her wife and son. Douglas went behind him but could not kill the Indian because of the help of the Indian's wife. When Douglas recovered the Indian once again told him that he did not know Douglas' wife but in the meantime Douglas saw his bag the one taken from the minerwith the money and asked the Indian how he could deny all this when his bag of money was stolen at that night and was there. The Indian quietly replied that he took it from the miner killed by one of the bandits. Interesting that Douglas when he previously noticed that the miner was killed he asserted that the miner never did anything wrong against anyone in his life. The film showed that nobody has right to make justice alone one should know the facts before doing something against people that may not be really guilty. Douglas was ashamed of what he did and when he came back to the town the first thing he did was to go to the church for praying and apologizing for killing people who never did what he thought they did.".

Now that I'm  older  and  can  better  judge the artistic merits of the movie I can understand why critics were less than thrilled with THE BRAVADOS.First the  good  points  Peck  is  excellent  at  playing  an  obsessed protagonist  SPELLBOUND  12  O'CLOCK  HIGH I WALK THE LINE and this rank among  his  best  work.   Peck  works  very  well  with  Henry  King  THE GUNFIGHTER and  King's  assured  direction  draws  a  surprisingly  fine performance  from  Henry  Silva  and  Joe  DeRita  Curly  Joe of The Three Stoodges.  The  music is haunting the cinematography is beautiful DeLuxe Color  and  CinemaScope  never looked bett sound and editing are both top notch.WARNING  POTENTIAL SPOILERSBut  now  for  the bad points.  The script by the usually reliable Phillip Yordan is as nonsensical as some of the worst spaghetti  westerns.  A great deal is made of Peck being a mystery man at the  beginning  of the movie yet a few minutes later he is recognized by an  old flame Joan Collins struggling to hide her English accent and a priest  ludicrously  played by Andrew Duggan. Duggan is so unconvincing he  cannot even correctly cross himself! one would believe he must be of some  other  religion  than  Catholic. Yet the HUGE church could have been nothing else given  its location in this small southwest town a hundred miles from the Mexican border.  Now we find out Peck used to LIVE in this small town three to five years back!  HELLO!  You have people in this town who have lived here  AT  LEAST 25 years so says the owner of the general store yet they don't know Peck?It  gets worse. Collins joins the posse pursuing the escaped convicts. Peck shows up near the end of the next day to find the posse being held off by a single  outlaw. Collins apparently returns to town with some of the wounded posse  members  while  Peck  and  the  rest of the posse track the escaped convicts for several days.  Collins finds out what is eating  Peck and rides to Peck's ranch 100 MILES AWAY just in time for Peck to show up and find his neighbor Gene Evans shot. I 'd swear I saw Evans in the town earlier in the movie. He sure goes a LONG way to get his groceries!If you can get past all this implausibility you should enjoy this movie. It's exciting powerful and packs an effective twist ending.  Why then did it have to be so stupid?".

	schema:headline " Compromised";
	schema:reviewBody "There's an unusual twist here for a 1950's movie. Has Jim Douglass Peck committed an immoral act and crime by killing three men for an act raping  murdering his wife they in fact did not commit. True the men have committed a capital crime of their own and so do deserve punishment. But punishment should connect with the crime. Here however it doesn't connect. The men are innocent of killing Peck's wife and tell him so but he kills them anyway. However in a broader sense the books do balance because the men are murderers and would have been lawfully executed had they not escaped jail. So in this broader sense Peck has simply administered the punishment the law has failed to deliver. But he did kill them for a crime they did not commit. There's a conflict here that involves the basic nature of justice and one the audience should think about. Too bad the film buries this dilemma in a contrived anticlimax that finesses away what was thought provoking. It's a typical Hollywood ending for the time and may send the audience home feeling good but does so only by cheating. The final several scenes appear to say Never mind the justice dilemma because the town an implausibly staged scene and the church have settled the matter and now Douglass and Josefa Collins can live happily ever after. I suspect it's this insistence on a conventional ending that accounts for why the film has been largely forgotten while the more uncompromising The Oxbow Incident 1943 dealing with a similar theme retains impact and is still remembered.The movie itself is generally scenic entertaining and includes some interesting characters. The four outlaws are all colorfully cast making each a distinctive individual. Note however we're never told what happens to Lujan Silva even though he presumably has the same debt to justice as the other three. I guess we're to assume he's redeemed by being a good family man with a handsome wife and child. Nonetheless in my book this is another instance of the film burying an important issue. Note too how the sheriff is brought back to life in the final scene even though he appears deadasheck in the jailbreak scene. But then had he stayed dead Lujan would be an onscreen accomplice to murder and convention wouldn't allow his fate to be finessed in the way it is. Speaking of jailbreaks what a great burst of inspiration to cast the pudgy harmless looking Joe DeRita as the misleading hangman. Wish I could say the same for Peck whose whole performance consists of a tiresomely onenote appearance of lockjawed determination. I realize Douglass is supposed to be grimly obsessed but without an additional dimension of depth from actor Peck how do we know the needed element of humanity lurks beneath. Unfortunately it is a demanding role that calls for more than a frozen pose. Too bad that Randolph Scott veteran of similar revengethemed Westerns didn't have the role. Then too there's Joan Collins doing a typical Hollywood glamour turn as a Spanish lady. Her only asset is as a marquee name and a chance for Peck to ride into the sunset with something more than his horse.I know I've likely angered fans of the film and Peck by finding fault with them. But it is a movie of substance with several surprises and thus deserves to be taken seriously. As a piece of entertainment it mainly succeeds. Nonetheless the screenplay also betrays its deeper themes in what amounts to typical Hollywood compromises of the day. Too bad because the basic idea has real thoughtprovoking potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine example of the 50s 'adult' Western. It's in the 'trackdown' category Gregory Peck plays a glum single minded blindly revengeful rancher tracking down the four villains who raped and killed his wife. It's a character driven Western with a good script and a key performance by Peck with minor ones by Henry Silva Lee Van Cleef Stephen Boyd Albert Salmi and Andrew Duggan. It's a big scale production filmed entirely in the outdoors and the mountains of Mexico with sumptuous Cinemascope photography awesome Deluxe color a sometimes stirring musical score and even a couple of scenes entirely in Spanish with no subtitles. Great! Supposedly an antiMcCarythism film the screen play was by Philip Yordan who acted as a front for other screen writers who were blacklisted during the 50s and 60s. Although seemingly in the mode of 'statute' like stoic actors Rod Cameron Gary Cooper and Randolph Scott come to mind Gregory Peck does a masterful job in silently expressing the feelings and attitudes of his character rancher Jim Douglass. Watch carefully or you'll miss it his discomfort at being in a church in an early scene his flaring eyes and heaving chest as he kills Van Cleef and Boyd his confusion and guilt when he realizes he has killed three men for the wrong reason and his confession to the priest Andrew Duggan at the end. This is not Gregory Peck playing Ahab in 'Moby Dick' 1956 all over again! Oh if only McCarthy had been conscience stricken for trying to destroy the innocent and the wrongfully accused! The only disappointment in this film comes after Douglass's painful heart wrenching guilt ridden confession in the church when he is and we are too jarringly greeted by the entire town applauding and cheering his actions he does not deliver a severe rebuke to them for their own blind retribution and lack of Christian feeling. The other bit of oddness is having British accented Joan Collins supposedly playing a lily white faced Latina 'Josefa'.Therefore I'll only give it an 8. This is the kind of movie you watch color Westerns for one of the best in the modern era of adult Westerns.Note For fun check out some of these performances by some of the cast members. Henry Silva showing his impressive strengths as an actor in 'The Outer Limits' episode 'The Mice' 1964 and 'A Hatful of Rain' 1957. Albert Salmi as the psychic Peter Horkos in the twopart 'The Peter Hurkos Story' in 'One Step Beyond' 1961 and of course his three great episodes of the original 'Twilight Zone' 19601963. While Lee Van Cleef is immortalized as 'Angel Eyes' in 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' 1966 and in 'The Big Gundown' 1968 not to be missed is his starring role as an altruistic scientist who out of misplaced idealism becomes the Ultimate Collaborationist by delivering humanity over to an alien invasion in the amazing 'It! Conquered the World' 1956.Gregory Peck has a well known and vast body of work but let's focus on the films besides this one where he was making a strong personal statement 'Gentlemen's Agreement' 1948 'The Gunfighters' 1950 'On the Beach' 1959 'The Guns of Navarone' 1961 and of course his mythic characterization in 'To Kill a Mockingbird' 1962.".

	schema:headline " Brutal Grim Revenge Western!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bravados directed by veteran Henry King gives us a portrait of a man so consumed by hate and revenge that he abandons all of his principles.A grim looking man Jim Douglass rides into the town of Rio Reba I think that's right to watch the hanging of four men he believes are responsible for his wife's brutal rape and murder. The men Bill Zachary Stephen Boyd Ed Taylor Albert Salmi Alfonso Parral Lee Van Cleef and the Indian Lujan Henry Silva are locked up in Sheriff Sanchez'Hebert Rudley jail awaiting their fate.As luck would have it Jim runs into Josefa Velarde Joan Collins with whom he has had a past relationship. The town Padre Andrew Duggan and Douglass also have had a past relationship one that is not made clear.Mr. Simms the hangman Joe De Rita comes to town to perform his service for the community. Simms however turns out to be in league with the outlaws and helps them to escape while the townsfolk are at church but gets himself killed in the process.The outlaws take Emma Steimmetz Kathleen Gallant the daughter of storekeeper Gus Steimmetz George Vuskovic as hostage. Deputy Sheriff Primo Ken Scott organizes a posse that includes Emma's fianc Tom Barry Coe to go after the men. Douglass joins them in the pursuit. Douglass manages to separate himself from the posse and kills Parral and Taylor in separate brutal actions.The outlaws come to the cabin of miner John Butler Gene Evans looking for food and fresh horses. Zachary kills Butler as he is trying to run away and then brutally rapes off screen the helpless Emma.The remaining outlaws make it over the border to Mexico. The posse stops at the border but Douglass carries on. Douglass tracks them to a Mexican cantina but Lujan escapes. Later Douglass comes to a grim realization and.....................Director Henry King gives us a largely unsympathetic Gregory Peck in that he becomes a cold hearted killer who brutally murders the men he pursues. They had worked together in the 1950 classic The Gunfighter in which Peck was also a killer. Peck is quite convincing as the unfeeling man of revenge. Even the beautiful Joan Collins who was never lovelier can't deter him from his task. His killing of the Van Cleef and Salmi characters is particularly brutal for the time even though we don't actually see the final acts.Boyd Salmi Van Cleef and Silva make nasty outlaws.

	onyx:emotionText "The Bravados directed by veteran Henry King gives us a portrait of a man so consumed by hate and revenge that he abandons all of his principles.A grim looking man Jim Douglass rides into the town of Rio Reba I think that's right to watch the hanging of four men he believes are responsible for his wife's brutal rape and murder. The men Bill Zachary Stephen Boyd Ed Taylor Albert Salmi Alfonso Parral Lee Van Cleef and the Indian Lujan Henry Silva are locked up in Sheriff Sanchez'Hebert Rudley jail awaiting their fate.As luck would have it Jim runs into Josefa Velarde Joan Collins with whom he has had a past relationship. The town Padre Andrew Duggan and Douglass also have had a past relationship one that is not made clear.Mr. Simms the hangman Joe De Rita comes to town to perform his service for the community. Simms however turns out to be in league with the outlaws and helps them to escape while the townsfolk are at church but gets himself killed in the process.The outlaws take Emma Steimmetz Kathleen Gallant the daughter of storekeeper Gus Steimmetz George Vuskovic as hostage. Deputy Sheriff Primo Ken Scott organizes a posse that includes Emma's fianc Tom Barry Coe to go after the men. Douglass joins them in the pursuit. Douglass manages to separate himself from the posse and kills Parral and Taylor in separate brutal actions.The outlaws come to the cabin of miner John Butler Gene Evans looking for food and fresh horses. Zachary kills Butler as he is trying to run away and then brutally rapes off screen the helpless Emma.The remaining outlaws make it over the border to Mexico. The posse stops at the border but Douglass carries on. Douglass tracks them to a Mexican cantina but Lujan escapes. Later Douglass comes to a grim realization and.....................Director Henry King gives us a largely unsympathetic Gregory Peck in that he becomes a cold hearted killer who brutally murders the men he pursues. They had worked together in the 1950 classic The Gunfighter in which Peck was also a killer. Peck is quite convincing as the unfeeling man of revenge. Even the beautiful Joan Collins who was never lovelier can't deter him from his task. His killing of the Van Cleef and Salmi characters is particularly brutal for the time even though we don't actually see the final acts.Boyd Salmi Van Cleef and Silva make nasty outlaws. The rape scene though happening for the most part off screen to appease the censors leaves little to the imagination.Joe De Rita would go on to appear as Curley Joe as part of The Three Stooges in the 1960s.In spite of the Hollywood ending this film remains as one of the best westerns of the 1950s.";

Gregory Peck is excellent as usual in a role where the character is a bit mean and hardhearted at times but probably realistic for the Old West.The supporting cast is excellent including veterans like Stephen Boyd Lee Van Cleef Henry Silva Albert Salmi and a very beautiful and young Joan Collins.A good story line with some neat twists and above average cinematography including some wellfilmed nightime scenes and of course breathtaking scenery. Highly recommended.".

She gets really into character and pulls you in in a way that makes you think that that is her true personality. She was lively boisterous and sweet in this role and it fit her perfectly. I've never heard of Luke Treadaway before but his acting seemed to be on par for me and he seemed really natural with his costar. I thought that actually filming the movie at and during the T in the Park festival was ingenious. They got so much production value out of it real true things that you can't duplicate even with the most experienced set designer and director. Overall the movie is a real good time you have fun watching it wanting to go out and party afterwords. I don't have anything bad to say about this movie and I give it a 6.0 because its just a fun film nothing too serious but not so unserious.".

Undeniably sweet magical and occasionally funny at times this rock and roll gem will surprise you from start to finish. It's also the kind of movie you can watch on a rainy day and you can still have a good time. Luke Treadaway from the Clash of the Titans remake and Attack the Block stars as Adam onehalf of the American rock band The Make. His day is not starting to go well. He's supposed to perform at the T in the Park music festival in Scotland. While that happens he happens to be handcuffed thanks to a scheming minister with Morello Natalia Tena Nymphadora Tonks from the Harry Potter film series the band leader for the British female rock group The Dirty Pinks who also have to perform at the festival after some bitter arguments. All of this takes place at that festival and throughout the movie Adam and Morello has to find a way to break out of those cuffs play their gigs andpossiblymake a magical connection that might find themselves in love. I know you think that this is another one of those groaninducing romcoms but trust me this is much different than that. Clocking in a rather fast time of 80 minutes Tonight You're Mine has a heart that pulsates with energy and a soul that rollicks with a staggering sweetness. It's hard to believe that Treadaway with a very solid American accent and Tena are very talented Singing and playing guitarkeyboard on and offscreen. But they are and they accomplished that in spades. Their chemistry together is incredible. The music in the film is amazing. It's like listening to a mix tape that you made before but never listened to it until now and it happens to be a very eclectic mix tape filled with many different sounds. One of the standouts of that mix tape is Adam and Morello performing Tainted Love on stage. I give director David Mackenzie of the sexually charged Young Adam the Ashton Kutcher disaster Spread and the mindboggling Perfect Sense credit for taking us inside the actual T in the Park festival. It must have been very difficult to shoot in the festival for 45 days bringing a lot of pressure on the actors. But it feels very authentic real and organic. What also works is that Mackenzie and screenwriter Thomas Leveritt gives the characters a lot of humanity including Adam's model girlfriend Ruta Gedmintas Morello's onagain offagain boyfriend Alastair Mackenzie the director's brother Adam's other half Tyko Mathew Baynton and the sleazy manager Gavin Mitchell who nearly hits on women when he's drunk. Yes there are no surprises. But there's nothing to be surprised about anyway except for a couple of them. That's why Tonight You're Mine is really magical in many ways possible. You won't be disappointed. Give this film a go.".

Up to their knees in mud at times and performing amongst a genuine crowd of revellers from start to finish. Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena are more than convincing as frontmen of their respective bands largely helped by Tena's burgeoning career as a musician with her group Molotov Jukebox.You Instead takes brilliant advantage of an environment where the rules of daily life no longer apply. The result is a film populated with larger than life characters in a world we rarely get a glimpse of and it's a great fun place to spend an hour and a half.".

	schema:reviewBody "If musicians can't get along what hope we got? After Morello Tena shakes Adam's Treadway car in order to make him stop playing guitar they start to fight. When a security guard drives by and sees them he decides the only way to make them get along is to handcuff them together. That sounds bad enough but they are at a music festival and are both scheduled to play and no one knows where the key is. For those that have been following my reviews you may have noticed that I am not a fan of cheesy predictable unoriginal movies. This movie is an exception to that rule. Five minutes in the two are handcuffed together and after about 6 minutes you know how it will end. That said it is still very entertaining and really fun to watch. The music is actually really good as well and the song where the sample Tainted Love is great. This is nothing more then a cheesy predictable love story but even so I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Overall nothing new and won't keep you guessing but this is still very much worth seeing. I really liked it. I give it an B.".

The events follow the inevitable logic of a fairytale leavening everyone happy and where they have to be in life. But make no mistake it doesn't cause the story to be ant less interesting because what you want in this movie is to soak into the atmosphere of the music festivals the great music in itself if you are into this indie kind of stuff and of course the boymeetgirlthanbothgethandcuffed love story. It was so imaginary and so real at the same time that I completely fell head over heals for it. I always liked Natalia and Luke being two of the most peculiar unforgettable faces in cinema today. They delivered great performances with very believable chemistry.That topped with Luke's singing in the beginning made all this music fairy land so organic and tangible pretty impossible to look away. Also I very much appreciated how the romance was sprinkled with few good laughs that totally kept the presumed mushiness aside. Great film to enjoy excellent hangover antidote.".

In the hands of a good director this would not necessarily be a bad thing if the ensuing action was engaging funny or persuasive. Sadly none of it is  'Somewhere' this is not. Indeed it has all the hallmarks of a film that started shooting without a fully realised script and has relied on improvisation and hasty rewrites to get by  ie. a lack of narrative drive which is further hobbled by stilted dialogue devoid of the sparkle or wit that you need if you're basic premise is as flimsy as You Instead's is. I sense that there was an attempt to construct some sort of episodic structure to make up for this lack of cohesive plot but none of it knits together satisfyingly or otherwise. The filmmakers will probably claim that it's meant to capture the spirit of T in the Park and that it's aimed at a young audience. But that cannot excuse this long ribbon of tripe which would be only slightly more convincing if it was presented as the product of a student project.

The rock crowd helps give a docudrama feel to the enterprise. Two rock stars meet and have an argument. A security guy puts them in handcuffs to quiet them down.

They don't reproduce a set of Hollywood idealized plots and they don't make sequels or prequels as if they're life depended on it. What they do is even better  they make something original. And originality and quality is what we have with Tonight You're Mine  its quirky its British and its bloody good.It tells the story of two feuding rock stars who are handcuffed together for 24 hours at TinthePark where they are both due to perform. Obviously a whole host of random drunken debauchery ensues and we see how in the midst of the madness of brilliant music and classic British weather their relationship develops from one of feuding and bickering to friendship and romance. Maybe not love because come on we British aren't deluded you don't fall in love with someone in 24 hours but you can fall 'in'. Big difference.

	schema:reviewBody "David Wozniack has quite the problem. As a man who doesn't have many responsibilities aside from driving his dad's delivery truck for the butcher shop he's the father of 533 children. He's got commitment issues with his girlfriend and gets ragged on for not being dependable enough. So how did this happen?All the children were conceived thanks to his donations to the fertility clinic registered under 'Starbuck'  and it's twenty years later  142 of the kids want to know his identity. Class action lawsuit time!I heard about this premise from a friend and it sounded absolutely hilarious. What would anyone even do in this situation? It's absurd! I went in expecting plenty of laughs but walked out with a genuine love for this film. It's a wonderful surprise. What could have been a mere gimmick for comedy turned out to be a starting point for something much more. When we first see David he isn't doing well. Nothing is expected of him he seems to be a disappointment with everyone he knows except for his best friend and the news of this children can only be a headache. However he decides to take a more active approach and gets to know his children as scary as the idea seems. One step at a time one child at a time. The result is an effective mix of silly and sweet some great lines and genuine emotion. I don't think this film will get a wide a distribution as it deserves which is a real shame. I suspect the fact that it being in French will deter some audience members from the film. Personally I saw it with subs and it wasn't hard to follow. It's well worth the effort to do a bit of reading. Starbuck has piqued my interest to see more Canadian films in hopes of more gems like this one. All I can do is spread the word and hopefully the word of mouth will help it along. This film is a crowdpleaser and I was caught between laughing and crying during some parts I can't praise it enough. Give it a chance if it happens to be playing your local theatre  it might just blow you away!A very refreshing film. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing it again in theatres.".

But it's far more genuine than it portends. It's funny and warm. It's clever. It's improbable and impossible sure but that's part of the joyous fantasy of this weirdly feelgood film.The premise starts pretty simplyan eager sperm donor for money finds out his sperm was used a lot. And with great success. Hundreds of babies were conceived. And now a group of over a hundred have banded together as a class action group to demand his identity be released.Because of the suit he finds all this out and is shocked. Then because the court has all the plaintiffs listed in detail he is able to find the people one by one. And so it goes. He meets. He does good deeds. He keeps his mouth shut. And in the process he begins to see the situation from the point of view of these 20 year old kids.In this country you could picture Ben Stiller or similar comic actor taking the role. Here it is Patrick Huard a Canadian Frenchspeaking actor. And it turned into a hit the most popular film in Quebec in 2011. Huard makes his character compelling even as all these ridiculous things are happening around him. Watch it for his performance alone.Or watch it for the warm and fuzzy aspects that are really a surprise given the comic plot. Fun and well done!".

	schema:headline " Schmaltzy and Slight but Still a FeelGood Movie to be Rivaled";
	schema:reviewBody "The feelgood movie is somewhat of an enigma when it comes to the end result. Collectively so many share the same exact elements ample schmaltz the odd contrivance and an ending born straight out of a Disney cartoon. Yet while some work remarkably well others simply come off as manipulative pandering tripe. Thankfully in the case of Starbuck its earnest nature winning performances and wry humour assemble in a hugely palatable way which helps it to become one of the more charming films I've seen in recent memory.The title Starbuck comes from a pseudonym used by 40something slacker David Wozniak Patrick Huard. However it just so happens that this particular alias was constructed for purposes of the professional self pleasuring variety. That is to say it's the name he put down on the paperwork at the sperm donor clinic. Years after his sordid activities broke and expecting a child he learns that he may in fact already have some offspring. In fact he may have 533 spawn 142 of whom have just filed a class action lawsuit against him to find their father's true identity. Though he sprints to his friend and lawyer Avocat Antoine Bertrand in an attempt to quash the suit he foolishly peaks inside the folder containing the identity of his children and a redemptive journey begins.Starbuck successfully encompasses a number of tropes found in films of this nature though thanks to its unique if silly premise it makes them feel new again. For instance the guardian angel device where a recently deceased character rights wrongs from beyond the grave becomes David stealthily interacting with a number of his kids when they need a helping hand. Likewise the film as a whole could be considered a romantic comedy with the brood replacing the male or female love interest that is commonly found. However the kinks that are ultimately thrown between David revealing himself to his extended family are both more potentially lifealtering and grounded in some semblance of reality.Much of Starbuck's success can be attributed to the lead performance from Huard who strikes the perfect balance between goodnatured loser sarcastic rouge and eventually a troubled man trying to do the right thing. His delivery and mannerisms fit the somewhat sardonic material immensely well and simply put he's just damn charming. Even more cynical and ironic is the Avocat character who is the film's purest form of comic relief not that it really needed it. Every scene with him and David works wonderfully and a final climactic scene which finds him in a moment of short lived triumph will have you in stitches.Unfortunately as is the case with most schmaltzy material Starbuck indulges in clichs occasional bloat and contrivance. A subplot involving David owing 80000 to some unscrupulous folks is utterly unnecessary and is resolved with very little bearing on the overarching story. The film also hammers home our protagonist's slacker status a tad too heavily early on and it's thanks mainly to Huard's talents that we believe his ultimate transformation.Then there are his children who are comparative and thinly written angels when put up against their father and even those who fall into bad habits are set on the right path by their guardian by the next scene. Or perhaps I'm mistaken and a heroin addiction actually can be kicked overnight.It's the earnest nature and winning humour that ultimately make Starbuck work though as even when it descends into sentimentality the film keeps its wits and maintains its credibility. Take for instance a late scene where David's many offshoots show up for the birth of his baby  that is to say their sister  and indulge in a group hug. Cheesy to the hilt yes but writerdirector Ken Scott has the good sense to toss in the line that was weird immediately following.Those generally uninterested in a subtitled French Canadian lark won't have long to wait as an American remake called Delivery Man has already been completed with Vince Vaughan taking on the David role and Chris Pratt that of Avocat. I actually cringe at the thought of this venture. Starbuck itself walked a thin line between charm and mauldlinism and with the removal of Huard and the French style of humour I can't see it being duplicated with much success. The only ray of hope is that Scott will return as scribe and director so perhaps he sees the potential. But I digress and will simply say check out this original before the remake lands.All of the sincerity on display in this comedy is certainly infectious and while not groundbreaking by any means it's constructed with enough of an identity to stand apart. With appealing leads and some scenes that will tug at the heartstrings and poke at the tear ducts often in a surprisingly nonmanipulative manner it's hard to imagine most audiences leaving Starbuck without a grin.".

The movie is about a middleaged man who hasn't had much luck in his life. In his 20's he lived above a sperm clinic and was a frequent donor which comes back to haunt him 20 years later. The story revolves around the children fathered by the anonymous donor named Starbuck and their wish to find who the anonymous donor is. Starbuck is my favourite comedy of the year and probably one of my favourite films. The premise of the movie is very unique and heart warming and the actors are wonderfully casted.

I did not regret it.For a movie that began with the uncomfortable scene of a guy donating sperm in a sperm bank. From such an inauspicious beginning what unfolds is actually a heartwarming story of David Wozniak Patrick Huard a middleaged man whose life of noncommitment changes radically when he discovers that he had actually fathered more than 500 kids via his multiple sperm donations done when he was a young man. When 143 of these kids file a class suit against the anonymous donor Starbuck will David reveal his secret identity? If he does how will he face all of these newlyarisen paternal responsibilities?Of course there are scenes which may look cheesy for some but viewed with the proper attitude without cynicism these scenes are actually quite nice and even touching. Since David's kids are all young adults already with individual personalities and problems his approach to each one would have to be different based on the situation each kid is in. The public controversy and discussion that arose when the news of the Starbuck case hit the tabloids is also very thoughtprovoking.This film was an unexpected delight. It was good to know afterward that this movie actually received multiple nominations and even won awards at the Genie and various film festivals. I am glad I caught it before the American version.

	schema:reviewBody "Starbuck was a crowd favorite over the weekend at the Sonoma International Film Festival. I hope you get a chance to see it.Very funny script wellplayed by a fine cast. David Wozniack earned the titled El Masterbator by making 693 sperm donations to a clinic next door to his home 20 years ago. Today he is the worst meat delivery man in Quebec. He is irresponsible and he owes a lot of money to some thugs who regularly nearly drown him. There is very little in his life going right. Then he learns he is being sued by 145 of the 533 children who were conceived from his donations. The children want the sperm bank to release the identity of their father. His longsuffering girlfriend breaks the news that she is pregnant with his 534th child. She knows nothing about David's other children.His friend probably the worst attorney in Quebec is all the lawyer David can afford. There is a subtext of a case going to trial. David is presented through the plaintiffs' attorney a package of profiles of the 145 children. Curiosity get the better of him and he picks out one profile. To his surprise his offspring is a great football player and a sports hero. He goes to the soccer match and admires his son. Encouraged by the excellence of his progeny he begins to look into the lives of more of his offspring becoming a guardian angel to some of them. There is a beautiful humanity in this part of the film.This is a very funny film. It is also a very poignant film. The more we learn about David the more we realize that he is a loving man and beloved by his family. His defects of character fade as we begin to love this guy.I'm not sure if Starbuck will ever get a distribution deal but I hope it does. It is a winner. See it if you can.".

Because of a screwup at a fertility clinic he is actually the biological father of hundreds of children. There are so many of them they have organised to find out the identity of Starbuck their common father. This diverse interesting group of young people have formed a rather large club that socialises together. After all they have the same father.The plot of the movie has two threads based on David's attempts to cope with this situation David getting caught up secretly in the world of these children but at the same time David trying to hide his identity from them Valrie and the world. I was drawn into this scenario and was curious to see where it would go.The movie had a lot of fast dialogue in French but it was easy to follow because of the English subtitles. The film is filled with gentle humour. The interesting world of the Wozniak family was portrayed realistically. Montreal life is the quiet backdrop to this movie. However you have to wonder where the snow was! One thing that wasn't really explained was how these spermdonor children all found each other. Clearly there was a massive problem with the clinic but this aspect is not dwelt on in the film.Final word a good movie.".

Be aware that the only really adult scene if you want to call it that is right at the beginning. Let's call that scene the shot that made everything happen it's more than one shot of course.There was actually a man in the news last year who did father quite a lot of children. This news came out in America in 2012 and was received like a big shock. Of course the man who did donate his sperm is not entirely to blame here. Pretty sure he needed the money and if he could get it by doing nothing that he wouldn't do anyways ...So here we have a case of a comedy that has a lot of heart and meat but not story wise but lacks a bit on the big drama. And some other minor failings. Overall a more than decent effort that probably will be remade in America sometime soon".

This film stars Patrick Huard as David Wozniak aka Starbuck. When David was in his early 20s he became a professional sperm donor. In fact he made 655 donations collected nearly 25000 in fees and sired 533 children. Hence the movie's theme. David now in his early 40s works as a delivery man in his father's butcher shop. Always tardy but a terrifically likable fellow. 142 of his children band together and launch a class action lawsuit to force David to reveal his identity. Along with the summons and complaint the sperm collection agency receives a packet that contains a onesheet from each of the 142. A onesheet is a onepager that contains the person's picture and a brief bio. Professional speakers create these for their sales pitch. Curious David meets a few of his children in his quest to find meaning and make a contribution. He helps three or four of them. So the debate begins. Should he reveal his identity? What does he owe these now 20something people? What are his privacy rights? Do children put up for adoption have the right to meet their natural parents? Lots of social issues presented in a truly endearing and entertaining way. . .David's close friend Avocat played by Antoine Bertrand is his aspiring lawyer. Oh and David's girlfriend Valerie played by Julie LeBreton is pregnant so he contends with that too. One ding though. The folks that made the movie put the English subtitles in white font and a number of the backgrounds are light colors. So some of the text is difficult to read. Boo! But...Without revealing any more details because that might spoil the movie see Starbuck  a Delightfully Wonderful Movie. Loaded with great stuff!

It's not giving too much away to say he faces up to those questions and answers them.And it's not just a movie about parenting its a movie about families what it means to be part of a family and what is it that a family actually is. It's a movie that redefines the family unit. Julie leBreton is excellent as David's longsuffering girl friend. The movie is beautifully shot and a visual feast. The colors of the movie start in blues and greens and become richer as the central character becomes changed by the situation he finds himself in.

	schema:reviewBody "If there's a crazy plot that is wonderfully brought to a movie is this one. Starbuck starts with a suspicious story that most of us won't find convincing. A man fathering 533 children?! Is that even scientifically possible? This was my question at the beginning of the movie and I confess I almost give up watching because it just didn't seem like a reasonable story for me to watch. I imagined that eventually it would be just the stupidity of a man and then his regret being shown all in a shallow way that some Hollywood movies have gotten us accustomed to. But as the movie went along my opinion completely change.We see a decent man with a terrible luck and some bad decisions in the mix but by looking at him we see the ordinary man he is and how despite foolish his actions are innocent. The big point of the picture the 533 kids is the turning pointwhich happens still in the beginning being enough for us to understand who Starbuck is but not extending too much on himand after that we get to meet the real man behind Starbuck and the way how is going to deal with the whole situation. Quickly Starbuck will transform from El masturbador the irresponsible kid losing all his money into father of the year. For the almost 2 hours we get to observe how the love between a father and his kids is amazing and surprising. There is a change on Starbucks reaction to the big 533 but the best in this is that the change is due to the person that he already was. There was not a major personality change who lead him to act different but a change on his life that brought out is personality.Yes this is a love story because no matter who they are and what they do our fathers have a major part in our lives and sometimes even if they really screw up we can't stop ourselves from loving them. So it's a love story worth seeing and I risk by saying you will not find it tacky because there is no forced love demonstrations only some that looked to me very genuine! A father is a father no matter what and this story shows perfectly that the two people who give life to us are insanely important for us but in no less way so are we in they're.For endings a note that there are two versions of this story a french and an American one. They are both produced by Ken Scott but for sure there is a different perspective on them. I only saw the french version and I was very satisfied so I don't think the American will bring anything refreshing to it. Still we never know..".

	schema:reviewBody "The FrenchCanadian comedy 'Starbuck' though at times faltering to ageold conventions and slow pacing is undeniably a feelgood movie with no lack of charm or geniality.When the audience first meets David Wozniak Patrick Huard a 42yearold man living in Montreal we witness his uncanny capacity to screw up just about everything in his life his simple job as a delivery driver for his father's butcher shop his relationship with his long time girlfriend Julie Le Breton and most of all his personal finances. Amidst all of these troubles David is further informed that due to his constant presence at a fertility clinic during his 20's he is now an unsuspecting father to several children. 533 to be exact. And now as 142 of his children file a classaction suit in the hope that he will shed his anonymity David must decide how best to approach his unexpected role in these young people's lives.Director and writer Ken Scott constructs the plot from a premise that is as ridiculous as it is promisingly original. When this is combined with the affable charm that leading man Patrick Huard exudes so effortlessly the movie works itself into a sweetspot that comedies rarely land on indeed not many comedies aim for it to start with while the scenarios are farfetched and distant enough to elicit laughter from the audience the human connection is nevertheless always present as we tirelessly root for the lovable slacker David Wozniak in whatever quirky situation he finds himself in. This attribute is most apparent in the middle section of the film as we see David's various encounters with several of his newfound children in what may be arguably the most enjoyable sequence in the movie.However as the plot attempts to work itself towards some coherent resolution later on the movie becomes slower and borrows heavily and predictably from formula at times. Despite this the movie does not at any point relinquish the viewer's interest. If you are not particularly averse to a hearty dose of sentimentality and if you are up for a good laugh then 'Starbuck' should be at the top of your list.".

While in intense rehab he grabs the attention of Harper a man who works for the CIA and who would like Jack to finish his studies get a job on Wall Street and seek out terrorist plots through their financial transactions. Ten years pass. Jack finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin and thinks he should go to Russia to check out what's going on. He's told not to tell anyone who he is including his girlfriend Cathy which makes her doubt him when she catches him in some lies. In Russia Cherevin assigns someone to assist Jack but when the two are alone the man tries to kill Jack instead so Jack kills him. Obviously Cherevin is hiding something.

So before I do that let me just quickly summarize Chris Pine proves himself as a good maybe even great action lead but the story is so barebones and straightforward and at times stupid that Pine's performance is really the only justifiable reason to watch this. Shaky cameras during fight scenes DO NOT help the cause either. Seriously this is such a pet peeve when it comes to action movies why do we still deal with this? Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit scores a 2.5 out of 5 on The BDBOS. Now take this as your warning BEYOND THIS POINT WILL BE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.Show of hands...how many of you guys out there have seen the trailer for this movie? The trailer hints at  and by hints at I mean beats you over the head with  the idea that no one can be trusted. Specifically the trailer shows Keira Knightley's character Jack Ryan's love interest apparently betraying Jack. The trailer also shows Kevin Costner's character Jack's mentor and superior aiming at Jack through the scope of a sniper rifle. Even the movie poster has the tag line Trust No One. So you'd figure going in that you're in for some serious doublecrossing and not knowing who's on Jack's side right?No.Literally there is NO DOUBLECROSSING WHATSOEVER in this movie. The good guys from the beginning stay good the whole way through. Same with the bad guys. As a matter of fact there are way more people in this movie you CAN TRUST than there are of the opposite. Apparently the trust no one warning was meant for the villain since he's the only one that gets deceived in any way. The line should have been Trust no one...if you're a terrorist.Still not sure who to trust? There's another easy way to figure out who's good and bad in this movie and all you need is this simple equation Americangood. Not Americanbad. Again a better tag line would have been Trust no one...unless they speak perfect English without any foreign accent.Now some questions...If you're an assassin and you're only job is to kill this guy...shouldn't you be killing the guy at your first opportunity? Or your second? Or third? And not HOURS LATER after the guy learns that you're carrying a gun? If you're a different assassin and you've already used your trademark knife to kill a few other people...where was your knife when you had to fight the hero? Who was UNARMED during the fight???If you've had severe spinal surgery and went through months of intense rehab just to be able to walk again...and for argument's sake you're on a speeding motorcycle that SLAMS into the side of a van...how are you then able to get up walk away and continue to chase the bad guy???Will they let ANYONE into your hotel room if they simply claim to be your wife? Without ANY sort of proof??Is Jack Ryan the SMARTEST PERSON EVER??? Because everyone else in the CIA seem like morons.How many people did they send to Moscow for this mission??? It seemed like there were 47 people on the street that were all in on the operation and yet the inexperienced financial officer who had reconstructive spinal surgery and never killed anyone is the guy they send in for ALL the dirty work. Listen with action movies you're often asked to suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment but Shadow Recruit took too many liberties for my liking. And after all the promotion for the film I left the theater wondering if I saw the right movie. Trust no one...except everyone.Chris Pine this wasn't your fault. 2.5 out of 5. Pass on it.Hey guys thanks for checking out my review. If you enjoyed it  or even a tiny bit of it  then perhaps you'd enjoy checking out my little page over at facebook.comTheBDBOS.

The good guys from the beginning stay good the whole way through. Same with the bad guys. As a matter of fact there are way more people in this movie you CAN TRUST than there are of the opposite. Apparently the trust no one warning was meant for the villain since he's the only one that gets deceived in any way. The line should have been Trust no one...if you're a terrorist.Still not sure who to trust? There's another easy way to figure out who's good and bad in this movie and all you need is this simple equation Americangood. Not Americanbad. Again a better tag line would have been Trust no one...unless they speak perfect English without any foreign accent.Now some questions...If you're an assassin and you're only job is to kill this guy...shouldn't you be killing the guy at your first opportunity? Or your second? Or third? And not HOURS LATER after the guy learns that you're carrying a gun? If you're a different assassin and you've already used your trademark knife to kill a few other people...where was your knife when you had to fight the hero? Who was UNARMED during the fight???If you've had severe spinal surgery and went through months of intense rehab just to be able to walk again...and for argument's sake you're on a speeding motorcycle that SLAMS into the side of a van...how are you then able to get up walk away and continue to chase the bad guy???Will they let ANYONE into your hotel room if they simply claim to be your wife? Without ANY sort of proof??Is Jack Ryan the SMARTEST PERSON EVER??? Because everyone else in the CIA seem like morons.How many people did they send to Moscow for this mission??? It seemed like there were 47 people on the street that were all in on the operation and yet the inexperienced financial officer who had reconstructive spinal surgery and never killed anyone is the guy they send in for ALL the dirty work. Listen with action movies you're often asked to suspend disbelief for the sake of enjoyment but Shadow Recruit took too many liberties for my liking. And after all the promotion for the film I left the theater wondering if I saw the right movie. Trust no one...except everyone.Chris Pine this wasn't your fault. 2.5 out of 5.

Not to mention the entire premise of the film relies on layers and layers of coincidences that all depend on Jack Ryan's life following an exact script in order to find out the terror plan the perpetrators and save the day. 11 The Russian villain suddenly realizes Jack Ryan is a history buff simply because Jack Ryan knows the name of a painting? Come on now. Where were the exchanges in Russian to show his linguistic skills? Just OH you know the name of this painting therefore audience this guy is a historian.

	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that Jack Ryan is part of the title for this one because this is the furthest from the character that any of the films have been. Beyond a some what similar backstory the doctor soon to be wife and that he works for the CIA Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him more into a spyfield agent than the brainy analyst that he's meant to be. As a result there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest of it's genre. It's just another spy movie with an over the top villain that's plotting world domination. It's predictable and generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. I'm not saying that the movie didn't work as some BondBourneMission Impossible wannabe with bits and pieces slapped together from every spy thriller ever made. It captured successful elements from those films pretty well. It's just a shame that they relied on recycling tired and over used narrative when there is still a bunch of great Ryan books that they have yet to adapt. There should be no reason to slap together this films story when a much more talented writer like Clancy still has more stories to draw from. I agree with Peter Travers comment It's a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision.Despite following a predictable formula very closely instead of the source material the movie still works as entertainment. Chris Pine is great despite the writers failing him and he really carries the movie. He could be a great Jack Ryan if they actually wrote the character correctly. Branagh delivers a pretty good villain even though he's more suited for a Bond film. There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. It's just not a Jack Ryan movie. It seems that they only used Jack Ryan for the brand name rather than faithfully trying to tell a story about him.".

Who is the villain? Who is behind the plot? What is the plot? The answers to these questions are all handed to us on a silver platter. I was left with other questions addressing the gaping plot holes. Why did the King of Qarth try killing Jack Ryan? How did the bad guys already know he was after them? Why didn't they send more people when he didn't return? How did the FBI already know about a sleeper agent? Why wasn't the plot uncovered earlier if Chris Pine Kiera Knightly and Kevin Costner can piece it together in 5 minutes on a plane? Why didn't the Sleeper agent stab Chris Pine when he had the chance...twice? I am glad I didn't have to pay to see this. Don't waste your money.

The action has no pulse the plot is straight out of 1980 and there's no thriller element to keep you guessing as the Trust No One tagline on the poster would suggest which is all a shock when you consider Kenneth Branagh was at the helm and his last effort Thor was such a gleefully entertaining motion picture. It also doesn't help that the latest incarnation of Jack Ryan as portrayed by Chris Pine has about as much charisma as a tree. Keira Knightley Kevin Costner and Branagh are serviceable as love interest mentor and villain respectively however there's little any of them can do to boost the excitement levels.

	schema:headline " Lack of Depth Doesn't Feel Like Jack Ryan";
	schema:reviewBody "This reboot feels like a knockoff similar to A Good Day To Die Hard. Both have chase scenes in Moscow and both were made relatively cheaply well this one even more so. What disappointed me most was the attention to detail that Clancy was always famous for. A great deal is smoothed over to forward the plot in it's brisk pace. Previous Ryan films were capable of bringing depth to the peril and stakes as the players made their moves. Where previous Ryan films had large political stakes that brought real tension the stakes here seem to be more economic than fear for great loss and limb although the third act implies some mayhem. In general you can't really compare this cheap knockoff to a minor tent pole film that has a big enough budget to have a larger scope and sexier action scenes. The car chase is too generic in jump camera shots etc. to feel much tension. But other spy thriller moments do thrill so I will give this film enough credit to deliver on some of the goods. Another unflattering comparison is the Bourne Legacy reboot. It also suffered from lack of budget for a decent action punch.Pine as Ryan is less inspired for me. Perhaps because his face has been seen quite a bit lately or his characterisation has less depth. Same goes for the mentor character played by Kevin Costner. There is too little meat to chew on. A better move would have added a few more wrinkles not necessarily plot twists such as more than just a few shots of the terrorism plot brewing in the United States. I would support a sequel to this reboot if a better budget with some more meat pieces and a story that is fleshed out better. I believe director Branagh is a capable but not exceptional director and some scenes slightly miss the mark. The overall slick look that is also a trademark to Ryan films is missing here although the production design is not lacking. My final analysis is that this is a film not based on a Tom Clancy novel that is an average of 900 pages of background substance and real drama. That lack of depth makes this thriller too transparent.".

Acting was wooden across the board and the selection of Keira Knightly as Dr. Cathy Ryan was abysmally bad2. Plot contrary to some of the views I read was nonexistent and farcical. Unlike a good Clancy novel no basis in reality3. There is one scene that is particularly ridiculous. All I will ask an intelligent viewer do you ever think a Russian oligarch worth billions would seriously consider going out to dinner with a compliance officer. I would seriously not bother going to see this film or even bother it renting it. In short even if someone gave me free tickets with dinner included I would now pass on the opportunity.".

	schema:headline " It works for the most part";
	schema:reviewBody "From what I read in the credits this is based on the characters created by Clancy and it seems to have the right idea and a very talented writer to set the basis for it. Chris Pine has done great work as Kirk in the Star Trek' newest reincarnation and I was a bit hesitant to accept him in this new role. Then I thought if Harrison Ford had managed to embody three or four of cinema's most interesting action characters Pine had at least a good chance. Pine does very well in live interviews and is a decent actor very charismatic. Ford is great on screen even though he's not the most exciting interviewee. The premise might work.Then I saw that Brannagh would helm the picture and costar in it with a little help from another interesting actor Costner. He started as the doublespy in No Way Out and did well. There's a dark side to him so I figured he would do well as CIA operative. The film seemed to be moving well.Shadow Recruit has Pine working as financial CIA agent who discovers some rather covert manipulations of the market. He knows he has to travel to Moscow in order to set things straight. Somehow it was never explained to him that he might have to face bullets race cars and endanger his life. After a brief introduction which lets us know how he is recruited and gives us a bit of moral background Pine is off and running all over Moscow facing the film's archenemy his fianc and some really bad traffic in Moscow.The film has good pacing and the effects are pretty decent. Yet there is a bit missing the target. It might be the underdeveloped villain and the whole complicated situation which combines the financial maneuvering with the possibility of very lethal damage to a big metropolis. It works best when our hero tries to avoid elimination or he's trying to stop someone from hurting him or his wife.It's a January film so there might not have been much expected from it and if it develops into its own franchise it has a strong likelihood it will succeed. Pine has very good chemistry with his costar. I hope they come back.".

Forget the books ignore the timeline disengage the brain abandon reason slice the pizza sip the beer and settle down for a mindless romp. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is predictable fun with barely a toe in the world of reality but it is fun just as long as you forget to think.Jack Ryan Pine is a student at the London School of Economics when terrorists fly two aeroplanes into the World Trade Centre towers. 911 prompts Ryan to make a career aboutturn and join the Marines. Fast forward a few years and Ryan is undergoing intense rehab in a military hospital having barely survived after a chopper he was aboard was shot down in Afghanistan. Ryan is firstly observed and then recruited by the shadowy Thomas Harper Kevin Costner as a deskbound CIA analyst but a trip to Russia to investigate the nefarious financial dealings of Viktor Cheverin Kenneth Branagh elevates Ryan very swiftly to role of field agent and an action man is reborn.Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is neither as loud nor as brainless as last year's WhiteHouseunderattack double act of White House Down and Olympus Has Fallen but it is about as much fun and has at least as many plot holes. The entire finale comes about as a result of a catalogue of unrealistically simple contrivances and there is no reason to have Ryan's girlfriend Cathy Muller Keira Knightly anywhere near Moscow other than to sex up the film and redress the situation of the underused Anne Archer from the Harrison Ford years.There are no prizes for acting here. Pine may have found franchise work for the next few years but Costner Knightly and Branagh are here for the light relief and the easy pay cheques. Let's just hope that for each of them this is merely a short break from the superior work of which they are all capable.Branagh on double duties as actordirector will have done himself a lot of favours here with the money men at the studios and it further cements his position as a gun for hire in Hollywood but all these popcorn flicks he's turning out for the studios take him further away from shooting another series of Wallander for the BBC. And I for one am not happy about that.It must be possible to make a thriller that is exciting suspenseful vaguely realistic and intelligent but Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit isn't it. 'Fun' is fine but it isn't memorable or satisfying. Less a case of 'could do better' more a case of 'has been better.'

Jack Ryan does not have many action scenes as he uses more of his intellect than his fists. The exposition parts of the story are at times boring but when Jack Ryan is doing his mission it doesn't feel rushed and it manages to constantly keep you in suspense. Even with not much action scenes there were quite a few action scenes that come as a surprise. The director of the movie who was also the villain was pretty menacing with his Russian accent. Chris Pine was good too. If you like spy movies go into this movie not expecting much and this film will probably be better than expected and it will constantly keep you off the edge of your seat.".

For the most part dull and claustrophobic Shadow Recruit suffers from a lack of credibility from the getgo.

Even more outrageous is his girlfriend Keira Knightely a nurse who not five minutes after she learns her boyfriend of three years is a secret agent is smoothtalking a dangerous bad guy Kenneth Branaugh with a full Russian accent in a way that would put Mata Hari to shame in the femme fatale department.If Hollywood is truly serious about sustaining this legacy franchise without Mr. Clancy himself being around to keep feeding them fresh material they're going to have to do a whole lot better than this.".

	schema:headline " Awful movie with a beyond terrible script";
	schema:reviewBody "The reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise not based on any particular book but starring the character invented by the recently deceased Tom Clancy is utterly disappointing. As the movie starts we are in 2001 and Jack Ryan a wooden Chris Pine is studying economics in the London School of Economics. News of the terrorist attack of 911 prompts him to enlist as a marine. Next we see him he is fighting in Afghanistan where his helicopter is blown off surviving miraculously. The CIA becomes aware of both his academic smarts and his courage in the military field so they bring Kevin Costner to enlist him for the agency in a unit fighting financial terrorism. To do that he is asked to work undercover in a Wall Street firm. There he learns perhaps a few years later that one Russian oligarch named Victor Cherevin Kenneth Branagh who also directed the film is involved in some shady dealings so he has to go to Moscow to investigate. As it turns out warning spoilers ahead Cherevin fought in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s and is still resentful that at that time the US supported the Afghan Mujahedin which eventually defeated the Soviets. His plan for payback to the US buy really huge sums of dollars in the market and sell them when a terrorist attack hits the US. This would cause according to Ryan a collapse of the dollar and the second great depression. Russia however will be fine since it has all the oil Ryan has apparently never heard of the shale oil revolution that has enormously boosted US oil production. You don't have to be a Ph.d. in Economics to realize that such scenario is utterly ridiculous the US economy is six times larger than that of Russia and the notion that a Russian oligarch has so much money he can corner all the dollars in the world is beyond laughable.Branagh is fine as the villain and shows some flair directing action sequences but there is only so much he can do with such an execrable script. By the way this is probably the first Hollywood movie to show the Russians as villains since Rambo III from 1988. Keira Knightley is pretty as Ryan's witless wife. Mikhail Baryshnikov has an uncredited cameo as a sort of Russian bureaucrat in cahoots with Cherevin for those with memories during the 1980s he starred in a Cold War drama called White Nights that was about as awful as this movie.".

	schema:headline " ReviewJack Ryan Shadow Recruit Night Film Reviews";
	schema:reviewBody "January is my least favourite month for new movies. By this time of  year Hollywood studios are focusing much of their attention on the  Sundance Film Festival looking to acquire hidden gems potential  blockbusters and and marvelous new indies. These films are generally  purchased for next to nothing and then marketed and released  throughout the summer and fall months with the hope that they might  land a huge profit. With that being said while Hollywood runs around  securing their paychecks for the upcoming year the rest of their  unwanted formulaic and clichd roster is leftover for audiences in  January. Now let me be the first to tell you Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit  is no exception to this formula. Using the starpower of Chris Pine's  Stark Trek franchise charm to faded out female leads like Kiera  Knightley and exMarvel super director Kenneth Branagh Thor Ryan  becomes a shady old and tiresome relic of the glorified days of the  once cool Tom Clancy character. This was one film project we wish  stayed in the deep dark corners of Hollywood's unproduced films but  like much of the industry's obsession with rehashing established  characters and modernizing them for current audiences the film is a  complete decomposed mush of ideas. Shadow Recruit is an overlyflashy  glossed over disaster. Failing to recruit any kind of originality in  it's storytelling and script it becomes a nonoperational feature with  actors who are clearly cashing in to a well established iconic  Hollywood character.  The Jack Ryan character made famous previously by Alec Baldwin in The  Hunt for Red October Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and  Present Danger and Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears came out well  before all the Ethan Hunt's and Jason Bourne's of its time. What  differentiated Ryan from all the superhuman covert agents was his  ability to be the closest thing to an average everyday superhero. Mind  you in his newest entry in the film world Ryan seems to have his fare  share of dumb luck a lot of the timeall the time actually.  The film was supposed to be released on Christmas Day 2013 instead  due to an overcrowded array of blockbusters and lateentry Oscar  caliber films Shadow Recruit opted for an early 2014 slot where it  seems to fit in much better.  Pine plays Jack Ryan who we first see attending the London School of  Economics in England. After a fateful September day in New York City  I'm sure you can guess which day I'm referring to especially since  all terrorist inspired spyplots these days revolve around if not hint  at this historic day Ryan pursues a career as a United States Marine.  Wounded in action Ryan oddly gains the attention of CIA agent Thomas  Harper Kevin Costner. Ryan's intellectual expertise and Marine  instincts along with Harper's experience in the agency the two team  up to bring down an elaborate economic scheme that will leave the  United States in a Second Great Depression. Plunged into the world of  Wall Street as an analyst Ryan unnoticeably navigates the corrupt  underworld of financial markets which inevitably leads him on a place  to Russia and faceto face with Victor Cherevin Kenneth Branagh.  Between navigating the Russian crime world a life of espionage and the  annoying and overbearing requests of his girlfriend Kathy Muller  Knightley Jack is tested physically and mentally as he is left with  the fate of the US economy resting on his shoulders.  Throughout the course of his mission time and again Ryan begin to lose  faith in his ability to come through a hero and frankly so do we. The  blame can't all be put on Pine who really does his best with material  that seems D.O.A once it hits the screen. Unfortunately Ryan doesn't  actually accept his mission and take on the bad guys until his female  love interest is put in the mix and inevitably endangered which let's  be honest makes for a cowardly and unmotivated superspy.  The film tries its best to round out a cast that is engaging  meticulous and somewhat ironic to the overall Jack Ryan canon. Costner  who mentors Pine as the current Ryan was first offered the role of  Ryan back the late 80s but declined to star in Dances With Wolves  which earned him two Oscars. Knightley who seems to be floating under  the radar rather than on the it these days clearly took the role to  get her face back in the mainstream spotlight especially since her  descent into independent feature film fame has not planned out as well  as she would have liked since her blockbuster days in the Pirates of  the Caribbean franchise. Branagh who couldn't resist adding another  cultural character reference to his filmography offers a typical  Russian villain with a laughable accent and unintentionally uproarious  oneliners. Either way you look at it from the lazy onesheet with the  exhausted catchphrase Trust No One to the overused blackorange  colour scheme on the theatrical poster Shadow Recruit doesn't seem to  have much faith in itself much like the character Pine plays.".

	schema:headline " Pine Branagh steal show in spy thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "AN international spy thriller with a characterdriven narrative and a plot relevant to our modern day are the crucial elements to give this wellbalanced blockbuster the backbone for some decent viewing. In Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit the genesis of Tom Clancy's much adored creation makes its way to the big screen with Chris Pine taking control of yet another one of Hollywood's big characters. Kenneth Branagh  director of Thor and known for his performances in and direction of Shakespeare plays on both screen and stage  directs a stellar cast in the first screenplay not to be based on a Clancy novel. Jack Ryan is an undercover CIA agent working on Wall Street and it is his job to monitor irregularities in international money trading that could eventually lead to terrorist funding. When he notices an anomaly happening with a Russiabased company he is sent on a mission to Moscow to uncover a potential threat against the United States economy. In the past the character of Jack Ryan has been depicted by Hollywood oldtimer Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin and an attempt to reboot the character in the 2002 Sum of all Fears with Ben Affleck was neither a hit nor a miss. Hopefully Mr Affleck can put in a star performance in 2016 when he dons the cape and cowl. After giving a commanding rendition as Captain Kirk in Star Trek into Darkness last year Pine once again puts in a solid performance of carrying a welleducated Jack Ryan throughout the film. His character is damaged untrusting and fragile and puts his country before anything. One scene that really leaves audiences with discomfort is when Jack Ryan makes his first kill. It is brutal effective and realistic  reminding me of the cold opener in Casino Royale. Kevin Costner gets a large chunk of screen time acting as Jack Ryan's mentor while the beautiful Keira Knightley shines as the girlfriend  but is sometimes annoying with her fake American accent. And then we have Branagh who plays the good oldfashioned Russian tough guy antagonist. Putting it quite simply Branagh is brilliant. This is not an action film. It is an espionage spy thriller with a few action scenes. So if you are expecting a film with more explosions than dialogue you might be disappointed  it is directed by Kenneth Branagh after all. Just like Skyfall the action scenes aren't anything new or breathtaking but the tension and intensity built up on screen will keep audiences content. If the Dishfire reports are getting too real for you head down to your local theatre and watch Jack Ryan take on the international villains instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "6.6 average? Is this some sort of joke? I genuinely had to look away and look back make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Who in God's name would rate this film any higher than a 3? Where they on drugs when they watched it? Where they watching something else and got confused and ratedreviewed the wrong film? I am stumped absolutely baffled.I ignorantly don't care for opinion on this one normally you can say well that's your opinion but i have no option but to instead say your opinion is invalid. This film is complete garbage. Not one shred of originality in the plot. It's more rehashed bile that Hollywood continues to spew out to the forgiving public. How could you possibly enjoy this film. It was almost like a spoof at points scenes where so ridiculous that i had no choice but to laugh Dialogue so dense and without any depth that i felt my blood boil. Chris Pine is unquestionably great in Star Trek but that's it and i'm sure there are the terror team of Trekkies who probably despise him but as someone who is not compelled to dress up and do the little hand gesture he is good in it. But everything else EVERYTHING ELSE he is terrible. At the start of the film there is a helicopter crash not a spoiler but when he's being wheeled to the medics looking like a train wreck. The Doctor nonchalantly says he pulled the other guys out the helicopter....with a broken back!!!!! Since when was this a superhero film? There is one line which is in the trailer where the cheeseball Mr Ryan says something along the lines of i was under the impression this was an office job and then the kronic Kevin Costner replies along the lines of well you're in the field now and then this completely unnecessary score blasts out in the background. Entirely unwelcome in any way. And this happens throughout. Stupid comments followed by a burst of over the top background music. We'll split the bill....then the roar of the orchestra. Unbelievable. And the same old stereotyping. Anyone who is not American is a terrorist and Americans are all heroes. Nothing new there. Keira Knightley is seemingly on some sort of happy pills mushrooms or something. Like she's about to hit the giggles at any moment. Maybe it was because how atrocious Chris Pine is i don't know.With this being the 5th Jack Ryan Epic hahahaha.....i am quietly confident that it may well be the last due to the horrific nature of this one. Well done Pine you've just destroyed a legendary character. Noone will ever take the Jack Ryan character seriously ever again. Of course apart from the loonballs who decided to rate it higher than a 3.I have no faith in anyone who rates this any higher than a 3 i really don't i couldn't possibly. Go watch Bourne and then come back and give it that rating it deserves. Be sensible this film is balls.".

Who in God's name would rate this film any higher than a 3? Where they on drugs when they watched it? Where they watching something else and got confused and ratedreviewed the wrong film? I am stumped absolutely baffled.I ignorantly don't care for opinion on this one normally you can say well that's your opinion but i have no option but to instead say your opinion is invalid. This film is complete garbage. Not one shred of originality in the plot. It's more rehashed bile that Hollywood continues to spew out to the forgiving public. How could you possibly enjoy this film. It was almost like a spoof at points scenes where so ridiculous that i had no choice but to laugh Dialogue so dense and without any depth that i felt my blood boil. Chris Pine is unquestionably great in Star Trek but that's it and i'm sure there are the terror team of Trekkies who probably despise him but as someone who is not compelled to dress up and do the little hand gesture he is good in it. But everything else EVERYTHING ELSE he is terrible. At the start of the film there is a helicopter crash not a spoiler but when he's being wheeled to the medics looking like a train wreck. The Doctor nonchalantly says he pulled the other guys out the helicopter....with a broken back!!!!! Since when was this a superhero film? There is one line which is in the trailer where the cheeseball Mr Ryan says something along the lines of i was under the impression this was an office job and then the kronic Kevin Costner replies along the lines of well you're in the field now and then this completely unnecessary score blasts out in the background. Entirely unwelcome in any way. And this happens throughout. Stupid comments followed by a burst of over the top background music. We'll split the bill....then the roar of the orchestra. Unbelievable. And the same old stereotyping. Anyone who is not American is a terrorist and Americans are all heroes. Nothing new there. Keira Knightley is seemingly on some sort of happy pills mushrooms or something. Like she's about to hit the giggles at any moment.

	schema:headline " Densely plotted period thriller both gripping and unexpectedly poignant and a mustsee if only for Chow YunFat's portrait of pure magnificence";
	schema:reviewBody "Not content to be left out of the 'Three Kingdoms' after falling out from what became the phenomenal success of 'Red Cliff' Chow YunFat returns to the era to play Cao Cao. Often cast too simplistically in most adaptations as the powerhungry villain whom noble strategists Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang as well as nobler warriors Lu Bei and Guan Yu plot to overthrow coscreenwriter director Zhao Lin Shan's 'The Assassins' thankfully does not resort to the same narrative conventions.Instead Zhao paints a much more intricate portrait of the astute warlord in telling a very specific story of his planned assassination by various factions on a night when the four elemental stars align. That phenomenon signals according to an ancient prophecy the dawn of a new dynasty and Cao Cao's enemies have seized upon that sign to coordinate an attack on him within the imposing structure of his known as the 'Bronze Sparrow Tower'. The titular tower of the movie's Chinese name that lofty structure is despised by his enemies as a symbol of his ego as well as his thirst for power.And to the reigning Emperor Xian Alec Su it is also a frustrating reminder of how his minister Cao Cao's authority has grown relegating his monarchy even more ineffectual as the latter grows increasingly popular amongst the people. Xian will be one of those who take advantage of that purported opportune time to hatch a plot to kill Cao Cao even though Cao Cao snatches the element of surprise from him by inviting him to a hunting game on that very day.A popular Chinese saying goes something like this  'a wary heart is critical' and Cao Cao's wariness is all the more heightened following an earlier assassination plot by the empress Annie Yi and her father a powerful Han official named Fu Wan Ni Dahong  of which his very son Cao Pi Terry Chiu was even complicit to. Yet perhaps the most eminent danger to Cao Cao's life is Lingju Liu Yifei whom Cao Cao takes in as his lover. Not only were her parents slain by Cao Cao when she was young the fair beauty was also subsequently trained under imprisonment with but one mission to kill Cao Cao.Besides bringing out the softer aspects of Cao Cao during their private interactions together Lingju also serves as the narrator of the movie adding the element of a tragic love story in the midst of the palace intrigue. Her only wish is to run away with Mu Shun Tamaki Hiroshi a fellow assassin like her who has infiltrated Cao Cao's army  though you can pretty much guess how their fates will end up. Instead of distracting from the main plot their romance lends a surprisingly human touch illustrating with poignancy the price of vengeance on something as pure and beautiful as love itself.Zhao exhibits the same flair throughout the film and even though a plethora of supporting characters are at play their motivations for plotting against Cao Cao never left ambiguous. Particularly well played out is the very first elaborate assassination depicted in the film  of which Fu Wan is mastermind  both in how Cao Cao confronts the perpetrators in front of Emperor Xian as well as how he subsequently deals with the betrayal by his very own flesh and blood Cao Pi. Bear with the slow pacing at the start as Zhao develops the intertwining plot threads and you'll appreciate the genius in Zhao's plotting later on. For a firsttime filmmaker too Zhao is a master at tension and suspense keeping his audience at the edge of their seats as Cao Cao's life hangs in the balance.The same can be said of Chow Yun Fat's peerless performance. This is without a doubt his best in recent memory surpassing that in which he played Confucius if we might add with the veteran clearly relishing one of his meatiest roles of late. Yes Chow clearly understands the demands and complexities of his character conveying conviction intellect and even empathy at different points. This is Cao Cao in his twilight years who remains firmly a believer in his mission of unification but who has come to recognise the bloodshed and strife it has brought and is therefore no longer the tyrant he may have been in his younger days. Chow is sheer magnetism in the role and it is we dare say one of the best performances we have seen this year.Next to Chow the other actors unfortunately pale in comparison. Worthy of mention however is Liu Yifei who in the span of a few years has come to hold her own nicely as an actress worth her weight. The role calls for her to be the symbol of humanity and she registers a tender and heartfelt performance as her character grows to understand and even respect Cao Cao more over the course of the film. Evocative too are Yee Chung Man's costume and production design as well as Shigeru Umebayashi's score combining to accentuate the film's alternately tense and tragic mood.Indeed at a time when every new period war epic tries to outdo the last with grander spectacle Zhao should be applauded for adopting essentially a characterdriven approach to the material. There is depth and deftness to the storytelling especially how he slowly reverses his audience's preconceptions of Cao Cao and casts the oftmisunderstood character in an entirely different light. But of course the movie wouldn't be what it is were it not for Chow YunFat's commanding performance which even without grand battle sequences turns this period thriller into an epic in its own right.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a beautifully produced movie both from the story and production stand point. A production that's second only to the Red Cliff which is another story that puts Cao Cao at the focus of the story. China's production of historic movies in recent years are very high quality and this movie is no exception.I wonder if China these days are following the Hollywood style casting that casts compatible astrological sun sign actors in the leading role. This method seems to ensure good chemistry between male and the female lead. In this movie three earth sign actors plays the lead Chow Yun Fat  Taurus Yifei Liu  Virgo and Hiroshi Tamaki  Capricorn. This is an unusual story that explores the inner life of Cao Cao the main antagonist in the first half of the story of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Why is it unusual ? It's because although many stories about Cao Cao as a tactician has been mentioned hardly any mention of his private life has been written. This is the first story I've ever seen that attempts to shed light on the private life of one of the greatest tactician China has ever produced perhaps only second to Kon Min who've conquered Northern China with his military might and posthumously been promoted to the rank of an emperor after his sons usurped the Han dynasty.The story of course is fictional but the weight of the character Cao Cao makes this an interesting story. For a long time I'm sure many people have wondered what would Cao Cao have done in this situation and that situation. The movie takes an artistic license to showcase his actions in many different situations that in some ways answers to the age long questions people had about Cao Cao. What is intriguing about Cao Cao in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms is that he has style even as a villain and also shows romantic side not to women but in the way he writes poems makes decisions and regrets few things he's done. A shadow of his such personality is shown in this movieYifei Liu plays the part of the assassin who's mother is hinted to be one of the four great beauties in Chinese history Diaochan . Perhaps one movie is too small of a space to tell the story of Cao Cao and although this is a very good movie it still leaves a huge blank area that's not covered about one of the best and the worst hero China has ever produced. Yifei Liu has matured enough as an actor to play the romantic partner of Chow Yun Fat. She did a really convincing act in her role. Although incomplete the movie deserves an A for its effort to put Cao Cao on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that tries to incorporate a good story with emotions but comes out less than mediocre. It's a watchable movie but it just lacked in a lot of areas and just isn't as effective as it tries to be. It's just poor film making done by amateur writing. I liked how it didn't have flashy kungfu stuff to add to the realism but everything else just lacked the substance it tried to achieve. And it might have worked sorta but felt like a mix of other movies. Like it's a combination of Russian Coffee and The Concubine. But not as dark or humanistic. The tragic romance elements just isn't needed in this movie and felt it just there to have Crystal Liu Yi Fei's pretty face on screen. Maybe it's to bring out a bit of the human side to Cao Cao but overall it just wasn't needed. This is basically about the last days of Cao Cao going in a what if direction. The main thing that stands out about this flick is Chow YunFat. He can play a strong and domineering leader exterior wise and interior wise. And he did a great job of playing Cao Cao. Cao Cao is portrayed in this as a strong and domineering character that is forceful and yet has a bit of wisdom and a gentle side to him. And Cho YunFat can really pull off those kinds of presence. Overall it's a watchable movie but isn't a powerful of a movie it tries to be.510".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Assassins";
	schema:reviewBody "Just when I thought films based on the the Three Kingdoms era had gone out of fashion here comes a lavishly produced movie from China that stars one of Asian's most well known actors in the lead role of Cao Cao the defacto ruler of the Wu Kingdom toward the tail end of his rulership. But first things first for a film like this don't expect too accurate a historical lesson because dramatic license is there for the taking to spice a film up. We've seen how John Woo's Red Cliff went from what should be an attempt to make it accurate to lapsing into his trademarks in an all out battle fashioned out of the imagination in the finale. This one doesn't try too hard to reference from historical records but didn't go too much into the fantastical like how Daniel Lee's Resurrection of the Dragon film did.Often depicted as a cunning schemer and the villain amongst the three kingdoms debut director Zhao Linshan's film seemed to be take on a neutral stand in being none too judgmental on what Cao Cao did and more often than not the man is seen to react to his plotters' plans to rid him of power rather than to be on the warpath to persecute his enemies. It's also something of a reminder for ruthless leaders that it makes it all the more attractive to depose one from power and the inevitable twilight in one's years are just natural opportunities to do so. We get introduced to such attempts early on in the film but as the movie progressed we get a different perspective of the man especially on his unwavering principle of not usurping the throne for himself which he can but won't much to the detriment of his power hungry and ambitious son Cao Pi Qiu Xinzhi.And Chow Yun Fat's charisma meant his portrayal of Cao Cao was what would be the most interesting of the lot in the film. His presence swallows up the screen and effortlessly steals the thunder away from his costars. However this is a role that he's played a number of times before with the latest being the Emperor in Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower which may bring some sense of dejavu as a ruthless leader on whom assassination attempts have become a dime a dozen. In fact his charisma meant we remember more of his scenes than the titular assassins' and this film could have been named Cao Cao which is a more accurate depiction of the movie or should go by the Mandarin title which refers to a watchtower of sorts in Cao's fortress which of course was built for a reason.The assassins here referred to a pair of lovers in Ling Ju Liu Yifei and Mu Shun Hiroshi Tamaki who have been trained with countless of others since young to build that natural killer instinct in them before sent to infiltrate Cao's camp and to wait for a signal that will trigger their Manchurian Candidate like characteristics. Mu Shun drew the shorter end of the stick and became a eunuch thus physically ending any hope of intimacy with Ling Ju while she becomes a concubine and a very emotional one at that to Cao. There's a reason for all these of course and credit has to go to the scriptwriters to pay attention to detail in order to enrich this Three Kingdoms story. Liu did what she does best in her recent period outings playing that virtuous at times token beauty while Tamaki as Mu Shun was totally wasted in the film doing little and at best a guest star who can lament at being left out of the fun and critical junctures.What I liked about this movie even if it's centered primarily around Cao Cao is how it so easily brings in other elements and characters from the Three Kingdoms era into the narrative. We only get glimpses or mention of others but that is sufficient to enhance the scope of this epic wannabe. While there's evergreen characters like Guan Yu even earlier ones like Dong Zhuo Lu Bu and Diao Chan got mentioned since it's about that timeline when Cao's influence grew and to have this film broach the topics made it a little more expansive. And you can tell how the storytellers decided from the onset to do so rather than haphazardly thrown in as an afterthought in the final act.Then there's Alec Su's portrayal as the puppet Emperor Xian which provides some light hearted moments against the heavier politicking backdrop where ministers and generals of the court have to face up to their failed attempts to rid Cao of his influence amongst them. The central part of the film had a gripping and intense court session that allowed Chow's Cao to show just how influential and cruel he can be and the amount of power wielded despite not wanting to seize the throne for himself. And Alec Su was always in the thick of such action and probably playing against Chow had also made him raise the level of the game in his character's interaction with Chow.The Assassins provided more of a character study instead of lapsing into action sequences for the sake of. There's a distinct lack of war scenes and blood being shed if compared to the previous Three Kingdom related movies but it is the power of the mind the complexity of the primary scheme which took years of gestation and its execution in the climax that makes this movie an engaging watch. For those weaned on the earlier film interpretations you probably won't see Cao Cao in the same light again.".

It's an expensive expansive Chinese historical drama featuring the great Chow YunFat in a role which must be a given for him he's playing the ruthless general Cao Cao a guy who engaged in and won plenty of battles in the famous Three Kingdoms period. And yet the film chooses a moment at the end of his life to tell a sluggish and rather dull story of a love triangle and hidden romance.The film looks lavish for sure and YunFat gives a solid turn as always. The costumes and sets bring to mind the sumptuous nature of Zhang Yimou's CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER but there the similarities end. The problem is that THE ASSASSINS isn't really about assassins at all because these characters achieve very little in the storyline. The main character played by Liu Yi Fei is completely dull and goes around moping and crying all the while as she falls in love with YunFat's character. Come the end you realise she's made no impact to the storyline and could easily have been excised with no ill effect.In a bid to counter all this sentimentality the filmmakers throw in a handful of decent action sequences in which the heroic general fends off various attacks by his rivals including the Emperor. These moments mean that the film isn't bad as a whole but it's a far cry from what it could have been with a script rewrite. There are also some ludicrous scenes which drag it down such as the one where a horse happily jumps off a cliff.".

He has always brought a presence with him to every role that delivers something special. His latest film The Assassins continues with these period pieces to attempt to deliver something new.The Assassins follows the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history and focuses on the warlord Cao Cao in his old age and the relationship between him and his son while planning to take the throne and avoid assassins. Visually this movie much like the others that come from this film market is beautiful to look at. The performances are all great with Chow YunFat in top form but nothing that really stands out to take this film to the next level. With the focus of these young people being trained as assassins and the amount of corruption showcased in this film you would expect a decent amount of action but sadly that's not the case. Everything from the box art the synopsis and the look screams action but is a bit misleading. This movie focuses more on the political side of things and the family drama leaving a fairly uneventful film. It's not boring or anything just tends to creep along with little to nothing really happening. There are a couple of characters that are rather annoying but it's hard to tell if it is the actor's performance of the dubbed voice.This isn't a horrible movie it just didn't deliver much as a whole. If you go into it ready for a dialogue driven political drama then you will not be disappointed but just know that it does get a bit convoluted at times. Fans of Chow YunFat will want to give it a view as he is the best part of this whole film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review This us another one of those confusing Oriental movies that are hard to follow but the main concept is quite simple everyone wants to murder Cao Cao Chow YunFat. There's also a love story running throughout the movie which is pretty straight forward but the rest of the storyline went straight over my head. When the true reason why Cao Cao is so evil is revealed I honestly didn't understand what the movie was truly about but it scores top marks for authenticity and cinematography like many of the other Oriental movies I have watched lately. The costumes are truly amazing especially Cao Cao's detailed armour and I'm happy to say that the DVD carries a dubbed version so you don't have to worry about annoying subtitles. The action scenes were also impressive because they seemed real for that day and age but I really don't know why the director had to over complicate the storyline. Anyway it's a watchable film mainly for the great performance from YunFat and the fear that he put in the people around him but the ending was a right mess. Watchable!RoundUp This is the only movie directed by Linshan Zhao so it's hard to compare her other projects to this one but the writer Bin Wang also wrote House of Flying Daggers and Hero with Jet Li. I'm beginning to realise that a lot of these Oriental directors certainly like to over complicate there movies with pointless detail which is usually unnecessary. Maybe it's because I'm used to basic concepts from the Western market why I'm finding it hard to get to grips with the these detailed story lines and I must admit my mind does switch off once I have to read subtitles and try and keep up with movies. Anyway I was expecting this to be an action movie with a name like the Assassin's but it turned out to be an intense drama which I'm am in two minds about.I recommend this movie to people who are into their historydrama starring Chow YunFat Yifei Liu Xinyi Zhang and Hiroshi Tamaki. 510".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Nightfall";
	schema:reviewBody "Once bitten and could have been twice shy but lessons learnt from that experience will prove rewarding. WriterDirector Roy Chow's first foray into the Hong Kong crime thriller genre with the film Murderer could have been an impressive debut boasting Aaron Kwok as a leading man after his stellar outing in C Detective but alas was let down by what would be a dbutant's relatively naive handling of the big reveal in a mystery that's set up for a big wow but only to fall flat and too hard against the required suspension of disbelief. But in his second attempt with cowriter Christine To they had come up with a better story and while no instant classic had all the right ingredients put in for a taut pacey thriller from start to finish.Nick Cheung is going places albeit going dangerously close to repeating himself at times. The film opens with a gritty prison bathroom fight where his buffed and mute Wang goes up against a group of bullying goons. This prologue doesn't tie in too closely with the film proper and stands out by itself but nobody's complaining for the hard hitting fight scenes here where Cheung gets into a close quartered survival battle if only to cement his character's reputation as a mean machine. He's released from prison after 20 years for a crime he claimed to have not committed but admitted guilty to anyway involving the horrific rape and murder of his lover Eva Janice Man at her family home. He soon finds himself stalking a teenage pianist Zoe also played by Janice Man who bears uncanny semblance to Eva and discovers that her dad is none other than Eva's dad the acclaimed pianist Han Tsui Michael Wong.Han Tsui is soon discovered murdered in most gruesome fashion  burnt drowned void of prints  near his mansion and the film proper gets underway where two murders under the same family tree gets investigated by detective Lam Simon Yam who reopens Wang's 20 year old case while investigating into the current one. You'll know that they're related in some way but the journey this film takes is to understand the Whys and the Hows which both Roy Chow and Christine To managed to pull off yet another surprise and twist in their story but one that is more palatable direct and handled with a certain finese when compared against their clunky first time endeavour that drew more laughter instead. Things are kept suspenseful with Chow pulling off atmospheric moments though at times lapsing into horror film territory with overzealous jump cuts.But he is slowly showing his ability in crafting action sequences from the bathroom brawl the opened the film to the highlight which is the cable car rumble at Ngong Ping which had noticeable CG involvement a pity that the landmark is now closed for an indefinite period of time for servicing. Foot chases scenes were also handled deftly with Japanese composer Shigeru Umebayashi chiming in with a punchy score heavy on the drum beats to accentuate that systematic cat and mouse game played out and relentless pursuit by cops with escape at the nick of time episodes. I would even go out to say if not for Umebayashi's score this film would have felt robbed of a key element And of course they now have two acclaimed actors to thank for this as well hooking you in with their charisma and engaging screen presence. Simon Yam bears a grungy bearded look that fits in with an experienced tired cop who's facing problems with his teenage daughter and carries an emotional baggage that's relatively unexplored with the death of his wife if only for this to serve as fuel for his desire to dive deep into the unsolved cases at hand. Gordon Liu also pops out for a cameo as an excop there to jog Lam's memory of a series of events that ties both Lam and Wang even closer than imagined to the 20 year old case which will unravel itself from fuzzy still photo shots in the opening credits to full blown revelation as time goes on.Nick Cheung has his character's vocal chords taken away from him for his role here and has to rely on everything else especially on his facial expression to bring you to his cause and keeping you wondering just how involved or guilty his character is being the number one creepy stalker who sneaks into everyone's home and leave you wondering just what his game is in his deliberate leaving behind of clues or blatant attacks against cops. Needless to say his limited face off scenes opposite Simon Yam were the most delicious to watch. He's a relatively late bloomer in the industry but is now growing in stature and fast becoming one of my favourite actors from the territory.The film's theme deals with family relationships especially that between fathers and daughters that is central to the entire plot in having no less than three prime case studies put on display. Michael Wong chips in as the hypocritical man you'll grow to love to hate and the Cantonese version here I can imagine how awfully dubbed he is going to sound in the Singapore Chinese dubbed print plays up to that hypocrisy very well. To lighten things up at times in this sombre film Kay Tse plays a token female cop opposite Simon Yam's Lam who clearly develops feelings for the widower but got spurned at every turn so stay tuned when the end credits roll for that little bit of closure here.Roy Chow may not bear the pedigree of other crime thriller filmmakers in Hong Kong yet but he's slowly and surely getting there. If this doesn't become an instant box office success already released commercially in Hong Kong it has definite legs to become a cult classic with time. Recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Once bitten and could have been twice shy but lessons learnt from that experience will prove rewarding. WriterDirector Roy Chow's first foray into the Hong Kong crime thriller genre with the film Murderer could have been an impressive debut boasting Aaron Kwok as a leading man after his stellar outing in C Detective but alas was let down by what would be a dbutant's relatively naive handling of the big reveal in a mystery that's set up for a big wow but only to fall flat and too hard against the required suspension of disbelief. But in his second attempt with cowriter Christine To they had come up with a better story and while no instant classic had all the right ingredients put in for a taut pacey thriller from start to finish.Nick Cheung is going places albeit going dangerously close to repeating himself at times. The film opens with a gritty prison bathroom fight where his buffed and mute Wang goes up against a group of bullying goons. This prologue doesn't tie in too closely with the film proper and stands out by itself but nobody's complaining for the hard hitting fight scenes here where Cheung gets into a close quartered survival battle if only to cement his character's reputation as a mean machine. He's released from prison after 20 years for a crime he claimed to have not committed but admitted guilty to anyway involving the horrific rape and murder of his lover Eva Janice Man at her family home. He soon finds himself stalking a teenage pianist Zoe also played by Janice Man who bears uncanny semblance to Eva and discovers that her dad is none other than Eva's dad the acclaimed pianist Han Tsui Michael Wong.Han Tsui is soon discovered murdered in most gruesome fashion  burnt drowned void of prints  near his mansion and the film proper gets underway where two murders under the same family tree gets investigated by detective Lam Simon Yam who reopens Wang's 20 year old case while investigating into the current one. You'll know that they're related in some way but the journey this film takes is to understand the Whys and the Hows which both Roy Chow and Christine To managed to pull off yet another surprise and twist in their story but one that is more palatable direct and handled with a certain finese when compared against their clunky first time endeavour that drew more laughter instead.

	schema:headline " Despite an Alist lead cast of Nick Cheung and Simon Yam this procedural thriller wallows too firmly in its own mediocrity and selfseriousness for its own good";
	schema:reviewBody "Not often do you get two of Hong Kong's best actors together on the big screen so the pairing of Nick Cheung and Simon Yam alone should interest you in the mystery thriller 'Nightfall'. Alas if you're looking for this latest Roy Chow HinYeung film to be as gritty and compelling as Dante Lam's 'Beast Stalker' or 'The Stool Pigeon' you're likely to be quite disappointed because both actors are essentially wasted in a movie that is too caught up in its own selfseriousness for its own good.To be fair we probably should have kept our hopes low knowing that Chow is once again teaming up with his directorial debut 'Murderer's' screenwriter Christine To. Anyone who's seen the latter film will know that it was quite simply one of the worst movies of that year with an infuriating twist ending that all but turned its heavyhanded proceedings into unintentional comedy. Thankfully To avoids that mistake this time opting for a far more straightforward mystery that nevertheless still requires a significant suspension of disbelief on the part of her audience.As formula would have it the film starts off with two seemingly unrelated murder cases that grow increasingly intertwined as the story progresses. On one hand is a gruesome murder committed twenty years ago of a young teenage girl named Eva Janice Man whose convicted murderer was her boyfriend Wang Nick Cheung. Shortly after Wang's release from prison Eva's father the acclaimed classical tenor Han Tsui Michael Wong is found brutally murdered and dumped into the sea near his sprawling mansion up in the mountains.Investigating the case is the disillusioned veteran Lam Simon Yam who obsesses over previously closed cases of death by suicide convinced that like the death of his wife five years ago they weren't accidents. Lam sees a connection between Han Tsui's death and Wang after recognising a striking resemblance between Han's daughter Zoe also played by Man and Eva. Of course we know as much from the scenes of Wang stalking Zoe in her residence going so far as to acquire a village hut opposite Zoe's house and using a telescope to observe what goes on in the house.Any hope that the film lives up to the promise of the trailer of an intriguing whodunit is quickly dashed when one realises that the movie only revolves around these few players as well as Eva's distressed mother. You'll probably guess right at the start that it isn't simply a crime of vengeance though Han as the domineering parent had disapproved of Wang's relationship with Eva all those years back. Indeed what transpires comes closer to a Greek tragedy made no less subtle by blatant overacting and an overly zealous score from Japanese composer Shigeru Umebayashi.Guilty of the Aaron Kwok brand of overacting in 'Murderer' this time is Michael Wong whose violent outbursts at what he perceives as his daughter's disobedience comes off histrionic and ultimately contrived. There is too little subtlety in his overthetop performance and not enough motivation for us to believe in his character's propensities. The fault isn't entirely Wong's since his character despite being a key supporting player in the scheme of things is thinly drawn.The same can be said of almost all of the characters within the movie. Other than being a doppelganger for Eva Zoe is cast too simply as the meek goodytwoshoes living in fear of her father's temperament. Yam is shortchanged with the clichd role of a troubled veteran police officer as To's script does little to elaborate his own traumatic past or attempt to link it to the investigation. Probably the meatiest role here is Cheung's which the actor rewards with a searing intensity that also came with months of working out not that his character is particularly welldrawn but compared to the rest at least his comes off the most rounded and realistic.There's however too little realism in the movie in particular Wang's amazing ability at evading an entire team of police officers several times and his just as outstanding powers of infiltrating what is supposed to be a heavily guarded residence after Han's death. Most perplexing is why Lam would confront Wang on an Ngong Ping cable car no less other than for the fact that it must have seemed exciting to watch. Every step of the way Chow's hamfisted direction is all too apparent trying too hard to emphasise the tragedy within the story and in the process draining too much momentum from what is really a standard police procedural.Its mediocrity would have been fine if it didn't have both Simon Yam and Nick Cheung as its lead cast both actors worthy of much less pedestrian material than what 'Nightfall' has to offer. Certainly it is a definite stepup from the appallingly bad 'Murderer' but don't go in expecting the same kind of compelling thriller as 'Beast Stalker' or 'The Stool Pigeon'. And yes we know this is the second time we're comparing this movie to the latter two simply because though it aims to be of the same pedigree 'Nightfall' simply falls short and what is left is a plodding and generic thriller that barely raises a pulse.www.moviexclusive.com".

Nightfall is a good drama  thriller which can be tightened. The plot and the atmosphere are firstrate. The editing and the overall storytelling though fall short. I watched it with this fluctuating feelings of high and low. Some parts are so gripping I can't take my eyes off. Some parts are so visually cut off of the rest of the film. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a case of walkout and the walker would be definitely at a loss. The Simon Yam character is believable as a seasoned but sometimes wearyoflife police officer. His emotional final scene with him receiving a phone message from the dead is a good sumup of the entire film. The Eugene Wang character though while physically convincing in every way misses some good opportunities to give the film its deserving depth. I would have contrasted his hard face all through the film with the other serene and fulfilled one on his way down as he has fulfilled every obligation as a man and a father. HIs slowmotion fall should have revealed to us an immeasurable love of a parent to his or her child. It will suit well with the girl's innocent question to the inspector who is this man protector of mine? Anyway this film will not fail to entertain you. Just like me try asking all these silly questions after the end.".

	schema:headline " CASEY'S MOVIE MANIA Nightfall 2012 review";
	schema:reviewBody "Two years ago Roy Chow's highlyanticipated directorial debut in MURDERER 2009 was a serious trainwreck of a movie which featured terribly absurd plot and especially a ridiculously overthetop performance by Aaron Kwok. And now he's back with another psychological thriller. At the first glance his new movie entitled NIGHTFALL is simply hard not to miss. After all it features two of among most topnotch Hong Kong actors working today  Nick Cheung and Simon Yam. Coupled with an intense trailer and the infamous wanted by police poster which has attracted mass popularity among the public there's no doubt that the marketing campaign so far has done a truly effective job to lure the viewers into seeing the movie. Unfortunately the movie itself is a polar opposite. Instead of what could have been a strong thriller turns out to be a complete copout. I'm sad to say that like MURDERER NIGHTFALL is yet another cinematic embarrassment that totally wasted the talents of Nick Cheung and Simon Yam.The movie opens intensely with a vicious prison fight involving Eugene Wong Nick Cheung being assaulted by a number of other inmates in the shower room but he manages to retaliate by killing them all with his bare hands and a metal drain cover. Then we later learn he is released after serving 20 years in prison. The first thing he does is spying on Zoe Tsui Janice Man a piano student whose father Han Michael Wong is a celebrity opera singer. So he ends up renting a shack directly across from Tsuis' country mansion and uses bugging devices to eavesdrop every conversation as well as telescope to monitor every movements. He discovers that Han is an abusive father who is particularly dislikes Zoe to befriend with any guys at all because he thinks all men out there are monsters.Enter Inspector George Lam Simon Yam a burnedout cop who has a murky past involving his suicidal wife. He is called upon an investigation when Han is found murdered in a gruesome manner. With the way Han is killed he immediately suspects Eugene as the main culprit. However the case turns out to be more complicated than it seems as Lam digs further into the Tsui family history and discovers there's something fishy going on behind all the murder.Clocking at 107 min NIGHTFALL is certainly a buttnumbing experience that feels like forever. On paper Christine To's script sounds like a potential winner but the execution itself is such a bloated mess. Again she and Roy Chow can't resist the temptation of toying the viewers with a number of misdirections and twists for the sake to spice things up. Unfortunately a lot of things doesn't make a lick of sense because they just lay out the surface but they don't even bother to elaborate them further. Coupled with an awfully slow pace this movie is simply an uninvolving thriller that doesn't recover at all as the story progresses further.For example When Wang is first released from prison we see him wandering around the streets of Hong Kong eating ice cream while ogling young women. Then he begins stalking on Zoe which strongly suggests him as a pervert. But what comes later is entirely different story altogether. Let's just say Wang isn't exactly a perverted or psychotic type  but actually a victim of circumstances who simply doing this because he wants to prove something to the cops. And seriously his sudden change of character from what we see earlier and subsequent scene is simply preposterous. Then there's Simon Yam's character as George Lam. Earlier we learn he still can't get over his wife's suicidal death and convinced that she's actually being murdered by someone. Unfortunately that subplot isn't explored further and not even mention again as the movie moves on. I could go on and on with plenty more flaws surrounding this awful movie but you just have to watch it yourself to see what I mean here.As for the cast I really admired how Nick Cheung has worked very hard to pull off a convincing act as a convict with mental problem. But despite his impressive tonedup muscles and method acting in which he performs entirely with body language because his character depicts as a mute person it's too bad that his role is underwritten to make him worthwhile. Same goes to Simon Yam in which he is wasted here as well. The rest of the supporting actors are equally disappointing as well with Michael Wong overacts as an abusive father and Janice Man sleepwalks through her dual role as Zoe and Eva.Another glaring problem here is Chow's lackluster direction to keep things as suspenseful as possible. Often in times he simply stops cold with lots of talky expositions rather than presenting them in an engaging visual manner. If anything only the minor scene involving the exciting manoamano fight between Wang and Lam in the Ngong Ping cable car even that alone served more as an excuse for no reason whatsoever.But none of the problems come worst than the climactic thirdact. From here onward both Roy Chow and Christine To has gone overboard by laying out all the expository revelation of the actual goingon. The good news is the ending has none of the shockingly outofnowhere twist like MURDERER but even so the twist here is so heavily convoluted that you will be scratching your head in disbelief once you piece out every puzzle altogether.NIGHTFALL is a huge disappointment and particularly a wasted opportunity to utilize Nick Cheung and Simon Yam in a satisfying manner. One of the most disappointing Hong Kong movies of the year.".

I can't really tell you line but this one stayed behind the line for me.Yes the opening sequence of the fight is a bit over. But maybe because it kind of calm down after that. It got the action out of the way. The mystery is not that mysterious and is well lay out for audience to catchon. The performances are up to par. Likely because the pacing is not in a hurry.There are complaints. The washroom sequence of different levels is an old trick I don't like to see. It's dumb down to trickery. And near the end a bit more flash back and tidying up then probably needed be  we get it. And I wonder why they didn't close up the cop's daughter relationship instead.".

If you have some exposure to Japan and Japanese culture it is all the more hilarious.The first two reviews really cover this movie extremely well so I will not say much more. I too watched it on an Air Canada flight YYZNRT in my case on June 30th. I am sure that I was disturbing the neighbouring passengers with my outbursts of laughter. Unfortunately it is not on the play list for my return to Canada. I'm hoping that a subtitled version will show up in Canada or I may eventually have to purchase the extremely expensive 75CDN BluRay version which releases August 3 here in Japan.As in most Japanese comedies I have seen the characters are exaggerated but in this case not beyond the reasonable preserving a real human touch. It was especially refreshing to have an elderly man as the main character. Someone that family and others don't quite take seriously not really paying attention to what he says. One of my favourite tiny moments is when he tries to give away what he is doing  that short scene is so true to life. I still chuckle when I think of it. I started telling my wife and son about this movie and they wanted to hear more and more about it laughing all the time as I remembered more and more scenes.Highly recommended  a great laughoutloud comedy with some heart.".

	schema:headline " Hilarious Robot Story from Japan";
	schema:reviewBody "Ota Kobayashi and Nagai are three workers at an electrical company which normally makes vacuum cleaners and the like their boss assigns them to make a robot to enter into a robotics show more as an advertisement for his company than anything else. The hapless workers are able to come up with a roboticlooking suit but can't make it do anything and with less than a week to go they're in despair when after spilling a soft drink on the computer keyboard the suit goes haywire and leaps out of a window shattering into its component parts and nothing more. The three have no choice really but to advertise for an actor to wear the suit the primary requirement being that the person have the proper measurements to fit the suit. Their first choice unfortunately turns out to be allergic to metal and so they turn to their second pick the elderly Suzuki Shinjiro Igarashi aka Mickey Curtis a onetime reallife rock star who has recently retired and has nothing to do. Suzuki's family tunes him out the caregivers and other clients at a senior centre think he's getting senile and this onetimeonly gig will give him something to do. But while at the exhibition he dazzles the crowd with his antics and when he saves a spectator from a falling pole well he's a hero and everybody wants him. But how long can our three researchers keep up the pretence and how much can they control the increasingly undependable Suzuki particularly since the young woman he saved has become increasingly enthusiastic about this new robot? This is a very funny film that manages to skewer geekdom while celebrating it. One of the best scenes has our trio giving a lecture to some college students in which various kids ask how they managed to get the robot to be able to do this and that they cleverly turn the question around asking what the students think they did and busily take notes as the students proceed to explain how to build a robot  that scene alone is priceless! There are no real bad guys here and nothing terrible happens to anybody but the sheer premise of the film sets the audience to laughing from almost the first minute and as for the ending well let's just say it was unexpected! Good fun and worth looking for!".

	schema:reviewBody "Kimura Elctrical Company is a consumer electronics firm that developed an interest in autonomous robotics and gave its three man research department  Oata Chan Kawai Kobayashi Gaku Hamada and Nagai Junya Kawashima  some 3 months to create something miraculous. It's about 1 week to go live and demonstrate their newest robot product at the robotics expo but within the first five minutes of the story all their hard work went up in smoke and out the window literally. To salvage the company and their careers the trio hatch a desperate plot and that's to get a human person dress up as their New Shiokaze creation so that they can get through what was thought to be a onetime demo to buy time while they create another prototype. Think of it like Iron Man but without the bells and whistles weaponry.In a departure from the usual Shinobu Yaguchi film the central protagonist is not a young adult but a senior citizen. Suzuki Mickey Curtis is a retiree and finds it extremely boring to be doing precisely nothing in a routine he would like to break out of. Coupled with the desire to be the centre of attraction amongst his peers and family he responds to a classifieds looking for anyone willing to get into a mascot suit with a handsome paycheck for effort provided they turn up for auditions and fit precisely into the physical measurements provided. A hilarious Yaguchiish comedic sequence ensues and it's not before long our elderly gentleman hard of hearing would be selected through a comedy of errors.The story moves at breakneck speed with Suzuki breathing life into New Shiokaze and to the horror of its creators decided to take things into his own hand to give New Shiokaze unbelievable qualities very much like a human which the expo crowd and media herald as Kimura Electrical's breakthrough in the field of robotics. Fame and popularity soon follow much to the headache of Oata Kobayashi and Nagai when their robotSuzuki saves Sasaki Yoko Yuriko Yoshitaka at the expo from a falling beam propelling the robot into overnight stardom with multiple requests for more appearances country wide that Kimura Electric's CEO Takehiko Ono is adamant that they follow through. So Suzuki gets on the payroll on the sly known only to its 3 creators as the deceit becomes bigger with more cover up and the spinning of bigger and more lies to cover up the previous especially when Suzuki begins to make demands and finds a new career of sorts.An expanded role goes to Yuriko Yoshitaka's Sasaki as the girl who coincidentally is a robotic freak being one of the brightest prospects in her school and given her new found fame made it sure that New Shiokaze makes it to her school for a presentation. Here's where Shinobu Yaguchi's theme of youth shines especially when it's that inevitable pointed message that the young almost always have that spark of creativity and innovation that stuffy corporations should choose to listen to rather than to shut them out entirely with the three engineers finding enlightenment amongst the discussion to shore up their own shortcomings and to help accelerate a replacement with Suzuki behaving more and more erratic though lending good humour for any audience with his zany antics when in costume.And Shinobu Yaguchi found a perfect balance in keeping the focus on both the young with the 3 engineers being cast in the classical perfect mold of zero to hero and that about the elderly and retirement where there are always some who are not yet ready to lead an inactive life feeling bored being cooped up all the time doing nothing and with no aim and are constantly seeking anything to prove their usefulness and obtain at least some form of attention. This constant tussle between the two groups with comedy thrown in made Robo G a lot more than just another robot film and provides for plenty of humanity and even philosophical leanings about man and machine if you so decide to dig deeper.With a premise built on deceit it opens up tense moments where a nosey parker reporter Tomoko Tabata is always on the brink of exposing the entire plot and bring down everyone involved in the game with some serious repercussions. The last act centered around a press conference brings everything together one full circle and again the writerdirector shows his knack for creating feel good films that are never saccharine sweet but just treated just right to provide that satisfying feel of an entertaining film that's planned to perfection. It's like a jigsaw with everything tightly fitting and falling into place without a hitch although during the post screening QA he had categorically stated that there will be no follow up film to this.Stay tuned during the end credits roll because the theme song Mr Roboto whose music and lyrics are by Dennis De Young is extremely catchy and will grow into a earworm. In fact I like this film so much I just had to rewatch it again at the HKIFF media centre because I'm not sure when the next opportunity will be at least for months before the DVD will be out. So wherever you are if RoboG comes visiting be sure you make a beeline and head out to get tickets for this Shinobu Yaguchi crowd pleaser and be prepared to laugh and be touched by the excellent filmmaking and storytelling. Definitely highly recommended and one of my favourites of the year thus far! Domo Arigato Mr Roboto!".

This 'RoboG' was a brilliantly written and directed movie. There was no compromise in movie quality. Why I am saying that mean it was not the movie that highly depended on computer graphics in fact I saw none CGI works in the movie. Most importantly it is not even a science fiction but related to that theme.The owner of the Kimura electrical appliance is keen to participate in upcoming Robo expo. Three of his employees are busy creating a humanoid but there is insufficient time to finish it. One week to go they decide to put a man inside a robot costume and finish the event smoothly. Then the 70 yearold Suzuki comes across who was disappointed for his unrecognition by his friend from the recently concluded cultural program. So he decides to join them three and everything ends as planned. But the real problem arises when an enthusiastic college student shows interest to doing project on the national sensation robot called new Shiokaze.The movie fulfilled my expectations. I found it a kinda part of a fresh idea. When I read about the movie I was not sure that it will work but after a watch I came to know that I was wrong before. Wherever it has came from Hollywood Bollywood Eurowood K movies or Jmovies it will be a treat for movie fanatics like me. I love robot themes I consider it is one of my most expected from scifi themes. This movie brought plenty of laughs in me. I felt that it was quite a lengthy movie though the pace was steady and holds the audience without much unwanted scenes. The end twist was good it was a good solution that what I had curiosity about all the way. And an another scene in the end which leaves a sign that indicates sequel is in due. I will be happy if they make another 'RoboG' movie.810".

	schema:headline " Certainly a different kind of robot";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the chance to watch the brand new Japanese comedy movie Robo G on an Air Canada flight a couple of days ago and I quite enjoyed this movie. Let's cite the negative things first as there aren't too many. The movie has a couple of lengths towards the middle of the film. Some jokes work very well while other ones seem a little bit too generic to get a laugh. Another bad point is the rather predictable story that offers nothing truly interesting.The strong points of the movie are its sympathetic and humorous moments in many hilarious slapstick situations when the brand new robot suddenly reveals a couple of weird abilities that put a lot of pressure on the untalented and somewhat lazy creators who have many challenges to hide their biggest secret and make the world believe that their robot is a real one and not only a disguised human. This scenario is nothing original but keeps the entertainment on a high until the very end.Another big point is the good good acting. The young Japanese star Yuriko Yoshitaka is not only charming and beautiful but also a charismatic actress that plays the role of a somewhat hyperactive and naive but also very smart student. The Japanese actor Mickey Curtis plays a rather unusual and stubborn senior movie hero who slips into the costume of a robot and suddenly gets a star out of his boring and lonesome life as. Next to many superhero movies with young actors and many computer simulations or special effects his acting is quite refreshing and gives the whole thing a very human and authentic touch. This idea is an interesting alternative to other very human robot movies such as Short Circuit or WallE and quite innovating from that point of view even if the mentioned movies are still more philosophical and touching.The movie also shows some subtle criticism concerning the Japanese society by portraying an old and lonely man left by his wife who is not quite appreciated and sometimes even ignored by his old friends and his family. His story is touching and quite sad as he tries a lot to get not popular on television but especially within his very own family that doesn't care much about his emotions his energy and his great acting skills. This side story of the old masked hero creates many funny but also sad moments all along this flick.In the end this is a very different kind of your usual robot movie that convinces with a solid acting and a couple of good ideas. On the other side many lengths and the rather predictable ending rate down this flick that could have hit harder and have been even more innovating at some points. It's certainly a good watch once one DVD or even in your local movie theatre but I would not directly recommend a purchase of this movie.".

The director's approach is oldline and it leaves a mark of this movie. Positive thing what the cameramen did as they shot the film settings but the soundtrack is uncritical. A few songs were sang by the actors  anyway they are actors not singers so the whole thing is a mess from the beginning to the end. This movie shows the present state of the small hungarian cinematography. There are films like Kontroll which are so good that nonhungarian people can enjoy too but for this..this is a tall order.

Commander CombsJames Russodecides to send in Captain John WilletsLance Henriksen and his team of Black Ops soldiers to see why the ship hasn't reported in the last several days. What Willets finds is a slaughtered crew with only his son ColinGary Stretch the engineer SlabRobert Pike Daniel and what is presumed to be a Muslim terroristLee Majdoub. What the Black Ops team soon discovers is what is exactly behind the bloody rampage the spirit of a Nazi killing machine Gunther NeumannGrant Mathiswhose power is fused with the ship a concentrated energy which can possess humans using their bodies as a vessel of destruction. So Willets and his men have quite a battle on their hands to say the least. They also must halt the ship from entering Iranian territorial waters by any means necessary. Along with the Black Ops team are a duo of paranormal investigators and we later learn of why they are on board their mission is to capture Neumann's essence to use it as a weapon in the field! Look I could pick apart the plot contrivances along with the gaping holes of the script but when it comes down to it the movie is about soldiers combating a supernatural force throughout the darkened corridors of a 60 year old warship. Black Ops soldiers consider their mission rather routine boarding the ship in a goal to find and destroy the enemy which is in their mind a terrorist. The whole Gunther Neumann storyline I admit is preposterous and really is a bit hard to swallow. But the idea of a vengeful spirit attacking members of an elite squad seems entertaining enough but when the details are revealed behind who it is and how he's able to move about it's hard to take it seriously. I disagree with others regarding Henriksen just cashing a check with some nonperformance..I felt he was quite well cast even at an older age as a strong authoritative figure who competently guides his men through a very troubling situation which grows more and more implausible by the minute.The hurled insults about the lighting I also disagree with. You are watching men marching deep into the bowels of a ship and I thought there was enough light to see characters clearly. I think in the case of Black Ops that the use of handheld cameras works because there's a freeflowing nature adopted by director Roel Rein and he's able to capture the action within confined claustrophobic spaces and areas where movement would be difficult otherwise. The violence itself isn't too graphic and this could be used against Black Ops as most of the attacks aren't visibly shown in elaborative detail. The production history behind this movie is rather interesting how the filmmakers put together a quick story were allowed to shoot on a ship similar..but not quiteto what the Navy has in their arsenal. For a cheap jack production it works rather well. I for one thought it had some spooky suspenseful moments here and there before the Gunther Neumann revelation rather sucks the wind out of the sails of the movie. The Body Snatchers plot element is worked into the plot and seems to take away from what could've been a rather intriguing actioner shrouded within a ghost story.".

To compensate for this obvious budget shortcoming the DEADWATER group make a couple ghostbusters a ludicrous encumbrance to the SEAL squad led by Capt. John Willets Lance Henriksen.

A gun tub with a 20 mm cannon or a flack gun on the bow does not make even a warship. Then the rank of Lance and other naval dudes keep changing colonel captain general admiral. Do you need R Lee Ermey to keep the ranks realistic too? Then the ultimate lack of imagination was to make the nemesis a hold your breath cause this is supposed to be set in our times NAZI SS genetically altered superman from WW ll! Is he a ghost or some emag presence or or just some true superman is hard to figure out. But one scene towards the end has him in his little hideaway listening to some 1940's vintage radio covered with cobwebs. You mean after 60 plus years no one caught him in his little home away from home on a naval vessel? He has fantastic powers of dismemberment he did most of the original crew in by tearing them apart then displays some sort of mind control and body jumping skills too at the end. Like they were filming the scene and what ever cheap sci fi  supernatural trick they could come up was used in that scene. After the first 15 minute everything was done in dark in below deck. About the only thing I can admire about them was that they did get a real transport for a at least a couple live action scenes.They also through some scenes in the beginning where our guys were brutally torturing some Iraqi terrorists who of course is well educated in our colleges and speaks great English too. So there is supposed to be parallelism between our bad boys behavior and this super Aryan spook. This gives one of our good guys some naval rating a chance to confront the badder of our guys to show that real Americans have heart. This rating is supposed to be Lance's son who Lance and his SEAL? team are sent onto the ship to rescue. But in another scene both Lance and his son are punching out some ghost hunter CIA? dude who knows more than he's letting on I guess. They are punching him out in a room full of model ships and displays like the type kids and vets build to show in the mall. What dreck In spite of all this the movie's ending is still confusing and I couldn't give it away because it was just too lame. Do not I mean do not go 1 out of your way to watch this direct to DVD mess!".

	schema:reviewBody "Deadwater starts in Saudi Arabia where the USS battleship Nimitz is docked Colonel John Willets Lance Henriksen arrives onboard  meets up with Commander Combs to receive his orders. Willets is only six months away from retirement but is needed for one last mission Combs explains that a ship commissioned by the CIA for black ops interrogation has fallen out of contact with no word from the crew or the terrorist they were holding. Willets  his team of SEALs find the ship in the Persian Gulf near Iranian waters they board they ship  find the entire crew seemingly slaughtered except for Willets son Colin Gary Stretch who has no idea what happened why the rest of the crew is dead or why he is still alive. With no sign of the terrorist Willets assumes that he was responsible but it soon becomes clear that dark forces at work on the ship dark supernatural wartime forces that have stayed hidden for decades but has been woken by brutal violence...Photographed cowritten coproduced  directed by Roel Rein this is also known under the titles Black Ops  here in the UK it's called Nazi Dawn on DVD whatever name you watch it under this really isn't that good. The script uses the haunted ship idea also seen in the likes of Death Ship 1980  Ghost Ship 2002 but manages to be worse that both the script takes itself very seriously  there's not much fun to be had here at all. The mixing of horror thriller supernatural  Nazi themes are handled with dull aplomb. The only thing I can really remember about Deadwater is that there are lots of scenes of people walking around very dark corridors which gets very repetitive  very boring very quickly. The script tries to throw in some nonsense about Nazi's  them creating some ultimate weapon  has a confusing twist ending that is both underwhelming  relies on seemingly random flashbacks  soundbites from earlier in the film that made no great sense to me  while I sort of understand what happened there's not much logic behind it  it could have been explained better. At 90 odd minutes Deadwater feels longer  I got quite bored it's just people wandering around an extremely dark ship with a fairly mundane supernatural mystery element that never interested me or drew me into the story. I just thought Deadwater was a routine low budget supernatural horror thriller with a weak script that could have been half decent but it's all so forgettable  dull.I assume this was filmed on a real ship as the locations look good even if it's often so dark it's hard to make out any real detail. There's some blood splatter a few dead bodies are seen  a few severed limbs but all of the gore is after the fact with no on screen kills that I can remember at all. There's nothing that creepy or scary here  the supernatural force has no great reason behind it why possess that guy at the end? Why not just kill all the black ops like the previous crew? Why didn't that terrorist guy reveal the major plot twist if he was there at the start  saw everything?With a supposed budget of about 1000000 Deadwater looks slick enough I suppose  is well made apparently filmed aboard the S.S. Lane Victory in San Pedro in Los Angeles. The acting is alright from a fairly bland cast veteran actor Lance Henriksen as usual manages to turn in a better performance that the material deserves.Deadwater is a forgettable haunted ship supernatural horror thriller that I didn't think was much good a muddled plot that tries to be mysterious  a lack of any memorable moments sink it. Watch Death Ship or Ghost Ship again instead.".

At 90 odd minutes Deadwater feels longer  I got quite bored it's just people wandering around an extremely dark ship with a fairly mundane supernatural mystery element that never interested me or drew me into the story. I just thought Deadwater was a routine low budget supernatural horror thriller with a weak script that could have been half decent but it's all so forgettable  dull.I assume this was filmed on a real ship as the locations look good even if it's often so dark it's hard to make out any real detail. There's some blood splatter a few dead bodies are seen  a few severed limbs but all of the gore is after the fact with no on screen kills that I can remember at all. There's nothing that creepy or scary here  the supernatural force has no great reason behind it why possess that guy at the end? Why not just kill all the black ops like the previous crew? Why didn't that terrorist guy reveal the major plot twist if he was there at the start  saw everything?With a supposed budget of about 1000000 Deadwater looks slick enough I suppose  is well made apparently filmed aboard the S.S. Lane Victory in San Pedro in Los Angeles. The acting is alright from a fairly bland cast veteran actor Lance Henriksen as usual manages to turn in a better performance that the material deserves.Deadwater is a forgettable haunted ship supernatural horror thriller that I didn't think was much good a muddled plot that tries to be mysterious  a lack of any memorable moments sink it. Watch Death Ship or Ghost Ship again instead.";

As horror or anything else it fails. Even the gore was hilariously inept such as someone with a freshly stabbed eyesocket that looks like rubber with dried blood on it.

From the darkly comic to the heart wrenching.Location is some undefined large city. The urban landscape is modern and sterile eerily devoid of people and crowds. The state apparatus and its authorities nowhere to be seen and only implied from dialogue. The film traffics only in the dealer the junkies that he supplies and a few friends and relatives. The issue of drug addiction primarily heroin is dealt in a levelheaded fashion almost matteroffact. Nonetheless the burden of addiction on the individual friends and relatives is not hidden.The primary technique used throughout is circular tracking. The camera circles around characters often a few times in a single take. Combined with a heavy use of closeups the overall experience is claustrophobic. The siege of the camera on the characters enhances the feeling they are prisoners of their unfortunate conditions.The visual texture is that of a noir though the dominant hue is blue dark blue. Reds and greens are rarely seen. This color choice overlaid on a modernistic architecture and a spartan decor give the story a futuristic feel a sort of postindustrial dysfunctional society where seeing a person smash a car's windshield on the highway or the presence of a dead man's body on a bridge with no police in sight does not seem to raise much of an eyebrow from passersby.All of this is enveloped by a deep echo chamber meditative music. The events of the day keep piling up into a general sense of pointlessness. There is no promise of anything better for next day's aurora only another cycle of the same.

It is definitely not for the shallow thinkers or someone seeking light entertainment. To anyone who has walked in the shoes this film portrays either via a family member or personally the genius of this film will be readily apparent and chill you to the bone. The actors mainly 1st timers were all superb. Shot in Buda and Pest Hungary should be proud of this one. It is a very sadly magnificent film.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not terribly familiar with contemporary Hungarian cinema but from what I gather Dealer appears to be the work of one of its most promising figures. Cinematography rhythm to some extent nuances symbolism Fliegauf seems to have a grasp of all of these. Dealer isn't a masterpiece in my mind though. The acting is far from impeccable at parts. For example when the dealer's female friend is talking to her boyfriend on the phone you don't even get the impression that someone else is on the other line. You sense that the actor is more concerned with her English than playing her part. And even though the dealer's emasculate voice reflects a person not much less fragile than those he provides drugs to I'm still not sure if the actor possesses all the brooding characteristics required for the role. The parts with his father and supposed child work to a tee however. As for the film being too long or too slow I disagree. Still a few more rhythmic changeups would've been welcome. The dialogue reminded me a bit of Kaurismki with its subtle humor and focus on only what's essential. The Tarkovski comparisons aren't farfetched either with the ending striking up images of Solaris. Another Tarkovskilike trait the director has is his willingness to let things take their time. These precious moments when nothing happens allow the viewer to reflect on what he's seen and what's yet to come. The ambiance the colors the streets of the city the dealer travels by bike and the way the director explores his theme all of these assure that Dealer will stay with me for a while. Extra points for the song that closes the film.".

I appreciated hist last piece Rengeteg I liked it's sketchbased structure the amateur freshness of acting and especially the language which is farther to the artistic created language of the Hungarian cinema in the last couple of decades than anything I've seen for a long time. Now in Dealer all this are present but they rather work against the movie. The actors are terribly incredibly bad consider Barbara or the mathematician girl. If this is conscious than it is simply BAD. The language is terribly artificial  and there is no meaning for this at all. They usually quote that Dealer is slow and beautiful. I think you have to be a very good director to be able to direct a slow film that works. For me this wasn't slow but boring. I reckon I understand why he wanted to make it so slow but then there has to be something else to keep the movie alive  most favorably actors. Who act. All in all I think this film is repulsively artificial pretentious and pretty much forced.".

His actions his thoughts are not represented in the film but inside the viewers. I believe it's one of the few times someone skipped the dialogs and preferred thinking. What starts as small selfdiscovering for the Dealer soon transforms and becomes as a personal renaissance. Love and vanity apathy and affection this endless battle between them is the main core of this movie A brilliant presentation a modern philosophical play...Apart from directing and the photograph The Dealer presented an extraordinary montage and a unique soundtrack.

They are all clones of which Dealer is at least the 4th of a kind the others being Is there life before death? Talking Heads and Rengeteg. His films use the same schema extremely long closeups of monologues. You can call this a personal style but it is also a tradeoff for creativity and experimenting.The reason why Dealer has been so successful in Hungary and elsewhere is probably because the issue of drugs is overpoliticised and it has been de facto taboo. In the last decade or so there have been very few Hungarian films on this topic all of them were depicting drugs undifferentiatedly as the ultimate evil. Dealer certainly has a different approach because it makes you mostly laugh at andor  to a lesser extent  feel sorry for drug users whereas the other movies were intended mostly to make you hate drugs andor  to a lesser extent  also feel sorry for drug users. So this movie suits for both prodrug and antidrug people because of not making any clear statements about the issue. It is yet to be seen whether Fliegauf or any other Hungarian director could make an intelligent and socially significant impact on the issue of drugs in Hungary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not really sure where to start with Dealer. From the first overindulgent long shot to the nauseatingly lingering closeups this film attempts to present itself as bleak and as agonisingly artistic as possible. Adding to the miasmic atmosphere is the constant presence of repetitive ambient noise conjuring images of an overenthusiastic army of small insects in tapshoes stampeding through one's earcanals. The protagonist is a dealer who lives in apparent complete ignorance of the simple principles of supply and demand. He appears to spend most of his time riding a bicycle around town forcing his potential clients to justify their need for his product. We are told the he is an exjunkie and so the question of relapse is naturally raised. However the protagonist's bafflingly unfounded self righteousness leads one to seriously question whether the writer had ever had any contact with the drugworld. The flagrant disregard for the bounds of belief is quite possibly the result of a series of wild guesses hashed together with government anti drug commercials and a generous smear of stale primitive stereotypes. This movie is an immature completely misinformed attempt at exposing the dark side of drugs. This drawnout misguided film is yawnworthy at most. Word to the wise there is no deal in Dealer.".
