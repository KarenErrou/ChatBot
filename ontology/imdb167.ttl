	schema:reviewBody "One reviewer here suggested that instead of seeing Drive you should see what Drive was aspiring to be Layer Cake. Drive is nothing like Layer Cake nor even tries to be. They have nothing in common and the comment is just absurd. It is a far far better film though. From it's title sequence written in cursive pink which a ton of idiots just did not get for some reason to it's retro soundtrack. It is a picture perfect reflection of the films from the late 60's 70's and 80's. If you have not seen films from this era i do believe so many reviewers here have not you will not entirely get this film.This is a man with no name film. Instead of horses and cowboys we get fast muscle cars and ruthless gangsters. Our hero is a man with no name. He is also a man of very few words that can break out into fits of extreme violence at any moment to protect those he cares about. We get no back story to our hero just like the Eastwood pictures which makes the film even more effective. He is not your typical Vin Diesel blabbering idiot action hero. He is an old fashioned action hero. Too many here did not understand this and decided this was bad actingdirecting. It is far better to imagine what Gosslings character has done to arrive at this point than to be shown in some cheesy flash back sequence. Albert Brooks who is just fantastic as usual Ron Pearlman and Bryan Cranston all provide nice contrast to our quiet hero.Another reviewer here stated there was no explanation for the second car at the pawn shop. Well there was. I will not give it away here but you will find the answer in the motel sequence. The violence has also been hated on here but it is just part of the world he lives in. The fact that he can be just as cruel as the gangsters adds to the mystery of his character.Not one negative review is credible. Unless you were raised on Transformer and Fast and Furious pictures. Then I guess you would need more CG louder music and bad duologue so you could understand the film easier. Or maybe you just need more imaginary computerized cars doing spectacular things on screen to hold your attention. The fact is this is a fantastic film filled with great performances and some of the best chase sequences since bullet. Be smart see films that matter.".

So when the end of the film hits you feel apart of this film and it's there to stay.This film also offers a Ryan Gosling like you've never seen him speaking only when necessary with tension and fury in his eyes. He's silent caring and ridiculously tough. Every line is delivered perfectly and every gesture is natural.I saw this at the LA Film Festival on a mammoth screen with booming speakers. The music only makes this film more unique. It is catchy and synchronized perfectly with the TRULY beautiful cinematography.This film is the BEST of its genre. I honestly cannot compare it to any other film for it is truly that different. Drive is already the best of the year because I'm POSITIVE no other film will haunt and invade me quite like this film has.

	schema:reviewBody "A truly beautiful and hypnotic film.I've seen the last few Nicholas Winding Refn films and while I liked both Bronson and Valhalla Rising a lot they were both difficult films in that both structure pacing and tone were bound to alienate some people and of course they were both marketed as somewhat mainstream films while being anything but.Part of the irony of Refn's situation is that he makes films about Primal man and these protagonists invariably commit acts of great violence on those around them. This violence puts his films into the genre categories that Hollywood recognises and promotes to the public resulting in trailers for Refn movies that grossly misrepresent the sophistication of the actual film. In that way Valhalla's intense slowburning and almost dialoguefree mythic exploration of our savage past can be repackaged as a Vlad the Viking goes to the New World action movie.Yet both Valhalla and Bronson were highly directed films revealing a very strong hand in control of the material. And so I was extremely curious to see what Refn would do with the material and whether he would be able to rein in his sometimes obtrusive style in order to allow the story more room to breathe... I shouldn't have worried. I think the director has managed to balance a genuine artistry with the demands of the genre in a way that is rarely if ever achieved. I absolutely loved it. Just stay the hell away from the trailer as it reveals far too much and again misrepresents the film's true feel.Driver has a tone of wry amusement at everything around it much like Gosling's halfsmirk pivoted on the toothpick perpetually in the corner of his mouth. Schmucky gangsters and mob clichs provide some laughs but the heart of the film is Gosling's portrayal of the unnamed? main character and his sweet underplayed romance with Mulligan and her young son. While an ethereal synthesizerpop soundtrack provides an attimes tenderattimes mythic undercurrent the car chases and action scenes when they come are tense brutal and brief far more Eastern Promises than The Transporter. Mulligan plays her character all trembly weteyed sweet and innocent and is swept away by Gosling's quiet strength and selfassured charm while Gosling speaks little and remains a mystery to the end though we never doubt his fundamentally good nature. The seasoned supporting cast are all very fun except maybe for Kendricks who is relegated to a fairly irrelevant part. Of course this is really Gosling's film and he inhabits the character completely turning what could be a straightforward Hollyood toughguy role into a complex and contradictory character selfconfident and physical yet clearly lonely and possessed with a certain peculiarity and stillness almost reminiscent of De Niro's Travis Bickle.Visually the film is lush and gorgeous. Like Michael Mann Refn and his cinematographer are able to instill LA with a sense of life and character that most directors just fail to do. Unlike Mann however Refn opts for warm orange tones over Mann's hard blues and in one particularly beautiful sequence the familiar LA clich of driving down the dry LA river is taken to an unexpectedly joyful conclusion. Despite its absolute craftsmanship Driver is probably not for everybody which makes me sad. People who prefer baldheaded muscle men slugging and wisecracking their way into their wallets should of course stay away as this bears very little resemblance to the standard Hollywood fare associated with the genre and they might well be disappointed.But for me Driver was sweet surreal mythic tense fun hilarious revolting and surprising. See it because it will make you a better person.And so 10 out of 10 because it deserves it.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a summer of cheap thrills Drive delivers thrills on the cheap. With a budget Michael Bay might have allocated for a single effects sequence in Transformers 3 Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made one of the best movies of the year. Following Bronson and Valhalla Rising Refn crafts his most polished commercial work yet while retaining all the ambiguity and unbridled aggression of his toughasnails art house pictures.Bearing thematic resemblance to Darren Aronofsky's recent output Drive is like Black Swan in overdrive. The film pins its headlights on the dark implications of unchecked obsession and good intentions gone haywire. That dangerous duality  humanity on the razor's edge of animal brutality  is played to unnerving perfection by Ryan Gosling.Rightly among the most reliable names on the Hollywood marquee the star of Drive plays a crucible of a character. A friendly fatherly figure to his neighbor Carey Mulligan and her young son he's decidedly less so when the two are threatened. A sort of oblique ultraviolent superhero the driver leaps to defend the innocent with bloody determination. If the first half of Drive plays as drama the second is straight up revenge fare.Playing on the juxtaposition of calm and calamity Refn keeps us on our toes throughout. Quiet moments stretch into suffocating silence and the explosive violence that inevitably shatters it practically tears the frame in half. The audio is expertly mixed you'll want to see Drive loud. From its roaring engines and visceral blows to its curt dialogue the film is an altar to the power of great sound design.In truth Drive isn't pervasively violent though its most excruciatingly effective moments leave a memory trail like tire streaks on a sunbaked highway. At the heart of the story is a compelling surprisingly tender romance. Carey Mulligan has proved herself a similarly reliable talent to Gosling and has worked in recent years with the likes of Michael Mann Oliver Stone and Mark Romanek.Her fragile character's relationship with the driver is subtle and nuanced in a manner atypical of thriller convention. They're not family they're not even sleeping together. Drive is not a sexy film. Refn fetishizes neither cars nor women if The Fast and the Furious is the sleek exterior curves of an automobile Drive is the greasy undulating pistons. And it's utilitarian at a lean 100 minutes.The rest of the small cast also impresses. Albert Brooks plays against type as a cutthroat crime lord and a noteperfect Ron Perlman plays his meathead partner. Bryan Cranston of TV's Breaking Bad has a small role too as employer and confidant to Gosling's character. Their relationships shuffle as lines are drawn and redrawn but none of them comes away unscathed by the film's end.Drive is either the explosive end to a lukewarm summer movie season or an early autumn adrenaline rush. In machismo it far outpaces its hundred million dollar competition leaving overwrought tales of lesser heroes like Thor and Green Lantern in the dust. Its troubled characters and the bonds of desperation that link them elevate the film above its genre trappings and shield it from disposable entertainment status.Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is an anomaly. It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.".

It's like a 1200 horsepower hybrid. And it's one of the best movies of 2011.";

It stars Ryan Gosling Carey Mulligan Bryan Cranston Albert Brooks Oscar Isaac Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman. Music is by Cliff Martinez and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Driver Gosling has a day job he's a Hollywood stunt man but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. Into his life comes married next door neighbour Irene Mulligan and her little boy Benicio Kaden Leos pitching him right into the middle of two wars one is for his emotional worth the other with the criminal underworld.Real human being and a real hero.They cheered at Cannes it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise Drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. Some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables meaning it wouldn't take much for something like Drive to find a favourable audience. Yet Drive is a special movie the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. There would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to The Fast  The Furious 19 but as its reputation grows one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by Refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.Yes at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. But the material is in excellent hands with Refn Sigel Gosling and co calmly unravelling Amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. A picture where a look means more than any words can express a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence beating a mighty heart in the process.Propelling the picture forward is the complexity of Gosling's driver character. He has no back story for us to work from and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with Irene and child. He is actually one of many purposeful grey areas or should that be gris areas? within the plot structure. We learn just enough to be on his side a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent he be Shane for a modern pot boiling Los Angeles. Helps too that he's so cool behind the wheel where he mines Steve McQueen's effortless charisma. Refn delivers magic moments of car play from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.Gosling is amazing instantly iconic soft voice matching his soft blue eyes toothpick perched between teeth it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. It's with the calm moments that he triumphs most be it watching TV with the boy Benicio or just gazing intensely into Irene's eyes Gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. Mulligan too is wonderful deftly underplaying Irene to work off of Gosling to create heart aching tenderness their chemistry superb. Isaac does fine work with the exconhusband character that is thankfully not stereotypical Brooks is Colm Meaney like thriving on simmering badness while Cranston puts real heart into the role of Driver's garage boss the closest thing the Driver has to a pal. The only one dimensional character lands in Perlman's court but Perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.From the opening pink neon credits accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days it's evident that Refn is a man who takes his style serious. Drive is full of classy yes arty passages fluid camera movements single takes non central framing of characters slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted L.A. the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. He of course is aided considerably by his editor Matthew Newman and Sigel's photography. The former is dealing in seamless precision the latter a master of shades a lift sequence is to ahem die for and colour toning delights. Marking this out as a Bluray essential.You can name about ten films that Drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence and Refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by Michael Mann Walter Hill William Friedkin and Sergio Leone all viable and all actually high praise indeed. But rest assured Drive is still fresh and exciting the perfect movie package. Refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 1010".

	schema:headline " An arthouse action flick at it's finest";
	schema:reviewBody "I think we all remember hearing about Ryan Gosling right after 'The Notebook' came out. Most men including myself neglected the man on his acting ability. It's not a good reason to not really appreciate an actor. But when it comes to romantic flicks like that i'm not really keen on the subject or it's actors for that matter. But film by film this man is starting to impress the hell out of me. Now it's about time to see what kind of chops this man has when it comes to an action film.Believe me when i say this.......it is the coolest damn action flick i've seen in quiet some time. It's not your basic shoot em' picture. It has this slight 'noire' edge to it that makes it shine much brighter than the rest.For starters let's talk about the pace of the film. Most may call it slow whereas i call it hypnotic. The lead played by Gosling is a cold and quiet fellow who barely even speaks blinks or give any reference to his emotions. The film is littered with these somewhat awkward pauses by his character........i personally wouldn't call them awkward because the way the film is presented it makes them look beautiful. Case in point......in the movie Heat you know how Dinero Kilmer Sizemore Trejo barely speak to one another. But the overall feeling is just so entertaining to watch? That's the exact same feeling you get when you watch this picture.But as the film rolls on Gosling's character becomes a bit more vibrant. And by that i mean more gory. It's not the kind of gore you would expect. Not like Tarantino gore but more like a David Cronenberg gore. History of Violence Eastern Promises. You know the settle yet explosive gore that you really weren't expecting......which i love. And then the movie does nothing but climb higher and higher with it's level of intensity. It took this stone cold character and molded him into one cool ass superhero.But what really sold me on this film was it's overall FEEL. The best example i can give is this........it's a cool mix between Heat and Taxi Driver with a very artistic edge. I already said that the movie is hypnotic and i cannot stress that enough. Once the picture starts your eyes are literally glued to the screen. The cinematography is fantastic the musical score is hip and awesome and the acting is top notch. All these elements were executed to perfection.Bottom Line.......i may go and see this movie again. I rarely ever do that......THAT'S how awesome this was. It's an arthouse action flick at it's finest. Both men and women will drool over this movie. If you get the chance go and see this movie......you will never regret it.".

When I got out of the cinema the other night I was outraged. But not in the I want my money back! or I want my two hours back! way. I was outraged because this movie is rated higher than Leon for example. I can name a hundred movies that are better than Drive but have lower ratings. In my opinion it's a 610 movie. Full of clichs weak plot no dialogue and uncalled for explicit violence scenes. The cinematic was good and the soundtrack was OK but that doesn't add up. Everybody is talking about the acting. Well what acting? There are no characters not even one line of dialogue to be remembered. Ryan Gosling acts like he is the most awesome person in the universe. Moving around with his hands in his pockets or with his arms crossed on his chest with a toothpick in his mouth like he's Stallone in Cobra. A man of few words but who looks smarter than anybody else. He is ridiculous taking himself so seriously. But hey he is a mechanic part time stunt driver part time getaway driver. How cool is that? Maybe he should have also applied for a school bus driver position so his sensitive side appear more clear to us and soften our dull old hearts.And what's with all that violence? Broken skulls throats cut blood everywhere all of a sudden. These scenes just don't fit in the movie. It seems that they were added just to shock the audience and to impress the 12 yearold who managed to get tickets. And don't get me started on the screenplay flaws...Anyway there are so many things that I didn't like in this movie that they wouldn't fit in 10 reviews. I believe though that his rating will eventually go down. I mean 8.7? Lets have some sense. That's how Matrix The usual suspects or Forrest Gump are rated... Drive is just a B movie and doesn't deserve to share the spot with any other film above. Unless the world turns upside down.EDIT OK I was a bit out of line regarding the title of my review. It's just a highly overrated movie.".

Gosling is this weird arrogant silent guy that we never learn much about. All the other characters are quite clich. The coincidence is also pretty strange that Gosling happened to live in the same floor as the guy he wants to help with money problems is actually in dirty business with the guy sponsoring Gosling. Plus the movie is called drive. I expected to see little more stunts than just unrealistic and unnecessary handbrake spinning in only one scene. The filming and setting were the only good things about this movie. Not even the music was catchy. I feel like I've been have a strange plot less and lifeless dream while watching this movie. NO substance at all and strange acting i will rate this movie maximum a 6.8. I don't understand what the hype is and why people are going crazy about it. It really is something just to pass time let alone a masterpiece. As if everything mentioned wasn't bad enough the violence is just downright ridiculous and again unnecessary. Who is one second kiss a girl romantically and the next second bashing someones skull open. I don't even know what else to say this is a movie i will remember for being slow and strange.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to the first edition of Movie Math. Beware I spoil the entire movie in this review. My sincerest apologies. First I do not like to applaud mediocrity even if it is well done mediocrity. I understand the underlying point of the movie but it was really buried and I shouldn't be able to get to that point so quickly. The audience prefers to be led not slapped into submission. It just stings less after you realize you paid 12 to be treated like an idiot. Second I did love the neon pink script the members only jacket and the 80's pop which alone is awesome but seemed like a loud annoying filler for scenes that had absolutely nothing going on. Combined they seemed like an afterthought.The movie consists of about 30 minutes of good solid plot line stuffed with about 1.5 hours worth of pointless fluff ex. the river scene all the staring the shots of watching TV the random garage  test driving scenes all meant to build character and inspire or something. This failed completely because I actually connected more with Albert Brooks'  Bryan Cranston's characters. Both of whom had less airtime than the main characters.And plot line wait there isn't A plot line there are several terribly integrated plot lines. Think The Notebook  Grindhouse  Steve Mcqueen  Tarantino. The narration was so clich it made me wince. Never EVER should narration take the place of integral character development.The love plot is absurd. She doesn't know Gosling he's super creepy says nothing and somehow she gets a warmcozy vibe so she invites him over to hang out with her kid. And I thought the romance in Twilight was bad 1 star simply because I was forced to write Twilight. The violence was eh. I've seen gory horror flicks integrate gratuitous violence into the story line better and in a less inyourface manner so that was unimpressive and unimaginative1. Especially because unless you're sadistic no one actually enjoys watching someone get stabbed in the eye. As for the dialog there isn't any and the cars have fewer appearances than sentences. So this leads me to believe the title is meant to have more than one connotation. Warning here is where I get all artsy. The title Drive can be interpreted in two different ways one being the more literal sense someone that drives a car the second alluding perseverance. If it is the second then the RefnAmini duo are sorely lacking all around and Mulligan desperately wants her kid to die quietly at the hands of an insane mechanic. There's some perseverance for you.That being said I did not enjoy this movie. I do not require the Michael Bay effect to be entertained but please do not treat me like a Teen wolfTwilight moviegoer 1 AGAIN. Long pauses do not develop character especially when a blank affect is meant to be a representation of stoicismwideeyes and a momhaircut represent vulnerability1 for being a giant stereotype. Even if those blank stares are backed up by a wicked soundtrack hell yes Chris Martinez high five! 1and excellent cinematography it's already been done before but whatever 1. However I was constantly reminded of other movies while watchingCollateral anyone? 1 and I was left feeling like someone Gosling and RefnAminihad watched far too many Steve Mcqueen movies. And then they attempted quite literally to copy the dynamics. Unfortunately the entire team and some of the audiencefailed to realize that Mr. Mcqueen's movies were written FOR him and Mr. Gosling has not quite reached that level. So 1 for not being original. I was not impressed by Mr. Gosling's acting What acting? It's so easy to stand around and chew a toothpick 1 and I honestly do not understand all the hype regarding Ms. Mulligan. I've seen almost all her movies and she plays the doeeyed victim with a giant heart in every. single. one.So 1 for typecasting. This also includes Christina Hendricks by the way. She looked SO uncomfortable. Well maybe that was the point or maybe it was because her pants were too tight and she was robbing a pawn shop wearing 5 heels. I should 1 for it being unrealistic but this movie would then have a negative rating.Gosling and Mulligan attempt the profound say something by not saying anything at all 1 for bad directing but Mulligan appears dimwitted and Gosling goes from mimicking George Washington on the side of Mt. Rushmore to suddenly being a skilled fighter. I did not see that coming. Maybe that was yet another point?The stunt driver should be commended though heshe had some pretty tricks done with effortless flair  1 for talent. So I tip my hat to you sirma'am. Mustangs are not easy to do donuts in.I was bored an hour into the movie .5 and was squirming at the pretentiousness of the director by the second hour .5. That by itself says quite a bit seeing as I am an avid moviegoer and watch just about anything. May I reiterate that being reminded of others' work does not dredge feelings of nostalgia it makes me want my 12 back. So unless I didn't do my math correctly I gave this movie a 310.".

Something so powerful especially when it works is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world. View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward effective at expanding the feeling of voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat right in the room with the characters while safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography. Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows on a technical level the audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to the final resolution of the plot the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story pun intended. I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review but I had to write something tonight because this film is ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too obvious packaging.

The many scenes just showing Gosling's blood stained clothes are so slow and stretched that you can see the changing of seasons in the background. And every time our hero starts to talk there's a standard 6 seconds delay before he actually starts to mutter his script lines. Pause in a conversation can add drama to the moment but I shouldn't have to be tearing the hair from my cranium while watching it. Action sequences are few and far between and the story itself is done completely by the numbers excavating only stereotypical behaviour and gratuitous violence from the flimsily drawn out characters. Think of a Tarantino movie you liked then strip away the interesting characters the music the daring plot and sharp dialog. What is left is good cinematography and an incredibly cool choice of font for the end credits.I'm seriously left dumbfounded as to what prompts people to vote on this miserable excuse for entertainment with more than 6 stars. Perhaps it is the overall quality of films nowadays which seems to be in a hasty decline rendering people clueless as to what rating to give to a film. But I can safely say that this project is as lifeless as it is artless and I would recommend the 1999 movie Ghost Dog in stead. A movie that shares many parallels with 'Drive' but which is made with far more authenticity humor and overall class. Not to mention it having an actual silver lining and point to it.30100".

Gosling's unnamed character when spoken to takes ridiculously long pausesupwards of 10 secondsto respond.Spoilers ahead The story is um flimsy. Pornmovie flimsy. There is a central crime to this story that never really IS explained very well sure it looked really cool when that other car showed up but... wwwhy was it there exactly? and is really the product of a monumental coincidence. Think about it Gosling just happens to be the driver for a holdup where his neighbor is robbing cash from a pawn shop in a heist that's really been masterminded by... the guy who's bankrolling his race car? Huh? and no the story makes absolutely NO effort to explain this.As much as I love Ryan Gosling he's just plain bad here. Maybe not just plain bad spectacularly pretentiously bad. I know what the creative intent was that the character was just something of a blank canvas that others project their wants and needs on to. The biggest problem here is that Gosling can't tone down the smart and charming enough for us to believe that he's as socially isolated as his character really should be. And again he tends to try to substitute blankness for intensity. It doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is okay but her character is pretty onedimensional as well. I got zero chemistry off of the combo of her and Gosling. The kid is basically a prop. I'm sorry I got absolutely nothing to say why this guy develops an attachment to these two.When Mulligan's husband appears there's actually a little tension for a bit and I began to hope for some substance especially since he has considerably more chemistry with Mulligan than Gosling does. Sadly Standard is killed off fairly quickly.There's no shortage of great performers in this movie and they're mostly wasted. Ron Perlman is so awesomely menacing! And so completely underwritten! And what's there is clichd! God what were these people thinking? Bryan Cranston has a supporting role as Gosling's partnerboss. A huge opportunity is wasted when his character's interest in the stolen money is just casually discarded. That might have actually GONE somewhere. As a Breaking Bad fan I know just how good he can be but the writing here is nowhere near as good and his character as well is left adrift.And Albert Brooks. Who I've loved since Lost in America. It breaks my heart because he's actually awesome in this movie. One of the most compelling cinematic criminals since Brando I kid you not. Thoughtful emotional utterly believable but since he's the only character that we develop even the remotest sympathy for he's not quite enough to redeem this mess.I was hoping for some action at least. And there really isn't much. For a movie about a driver there honestly isn't that much driving. The movie opens with a notbad robbery getaway but there's only one more serious chase later on and even IT isn't especially noteworthy. Did none of these people even WATCH Bullitt? And speaking of car action there's one scene where Gosling's character repeatedly rams another car. Hard. Hard enough to send it rolling off a small cliff. And yet afterwards we see the front end of his car seemingly undamaged. Are mid70s Chevelle parts really that hard to come by? There are legitimate flashes of creativity in Drive. There are some genuinely original scenes of violence and to be fair wellexecuted. Had the story and characters risen to a level where the audience might have cared well this might have been a different movie.This is one of those emperor'snewclothes things the movie industry pulls on the public every once in a while. Don't fall for it.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic retro action with arthouse flair!";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywoodstyle action and arthouse flair which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver Ryan Gosling moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose Albert Brooks. Seemingly a loner the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene Carey Mulligan and her young son Benicio Kaden Leos. After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard Oscar Isaac and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a wellworn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller yet the massively talented director who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn previously known for the fantastic Bronson and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson the influence was a little more obvious with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however the traces are a little more subtle visible in the impeccable technical touches and the use of dissolves pensive long takes and slow zooms a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston Christina Hendricks the ever dependable Ron Perlman and particularly Brooks who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season.

	onyx:emotionText "It seems to be the case nowadays that film audiences particularly at this time of year as the summer winds down are left with a choice of seeing the latest broad appeal movies filling the multiplexes or venturing to the local independent cinema in search of more intellectual fare. Very rarely will a film transcend these boundaries and offer a mix of Hollywoodstyle action and arthouse flair which is what makes Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive so unique and something to be celebrated.Drive tells the story of an unnamed stunt driver Ryan Gosling moonlighting as a getaway driver for a crime syndicate run by Bernie Rose Albert Brooks. Seemingly a loner the driver becomes involved in the life of his neighbour Irene Carey Mulligan and her young son Benicio Kaden Leos. After agreeing to drive for Irene's newly paroled husband Standard Oscar Isaac and finding himself on the wrong side of assassination contract the driver embarks on a mission to protect Irene from the vicious gangsters who would seek to harm her to get at him. It's a wellworn plot line which in the hands of someone less adept than Refn would likely be nothing more than a forgettable thriller yet the massively talented director who picked up the Best Director prize at Cannes this year for Drive crafts an engaging and thrilling throwback film elevated by masterful performances across the board.Refn previously known for the fantastic Bronson and the lesser known but equally excellent Pusher trilogy is a man who has very clearly studied his Kubrick. Certainly most modern directors could do worse than imitate the style of one of history's greats like Stanley Kubrick but rarely does one pull it off with the skill of Refn. In Bronson the influence was a little more obvious with the resulting film seeming like something of a spiritual successor to A Clockwork Orange. With Drive however the traces are a little more subtle visible in the impeccable technical touches and the use of dissolves pensive long takes and slow zooms a hallmark of Kubrick's catalogue. Drive is a flawlessly crafted film filled with beautiful imagery of the Los Angeles underworld seen more often in the work of Michael Mann.The technical achievements of Drive are more than matched by the acting of the entire cast and Refn shrewdly selects a wide variety of performers to populate the story. Top notch support comes from Bryan Cranston Christina Hendricks the ever dependable Ron Perlman and particularly Brooks who jettisons his familiar comedic persona in a truly frightening and villainous performance which will surely be on the radar of voters come awards season.

Don't believe the hype that this is some cinematic artistic achievement when over 30 minutes of a two hour run time is filled with dead silence or overly long awkward pauses in dialogue  it's not hip and artistic it's just boring nor is it stylish and clever when our main protagonist  who clearly has the upper hand at the end defies common sense by putting himself needlessly in danger and not taking necessary precautions. I also don't find the retro 80s styling and soundtrack of a movie set in modern times to be artistic brilliance either it's just distracting and awkward. Even our heroes' intentions seem to defy common sense...risk your life for a girl you didn't even screwa kid that's not yours and her excon husband who doesn't even like you that's not heroic that's idiotic. If you want to be duped by critics who would have you believe this is stylish and clever neo noir go ahead and waste your time and money but trust me once you dissect this movie for what it really is it becomes a pointless exercise in nihilism whose plot points defy logic common sense and motivation all glossed over by an overstylized retro80s feel and boring silence and self contemplation. Were there some good action sequences? yes but if you add them all up they take up about ten minutes of the run time.

This man cannot do the strong silent brooding type at all especially not wearing a daft white satin jacket with wait for it ..... a scorpion on the back and a toothpick in his mouth.The plot what there was of it is so old and tired and so overdone the whole film was completely predictable. None of the characters have any depth or interest to them probably due to the lack of any script. Even Carey Mulligan who is a real favourite of ours was wasted and looked rather uncomfortable in her rather dull character  the single mum at home. And the clichs just continued at Ryan became the child's new 'best friend'.The violence is also completely at odds with the rest of the film. It is extreme graphic and vicious which is fine and dandy if the rest of the film demands it unfortunately this film doesn't and it looks like it's been thrown in just for shock value.I really cannot understand why such a piece of second rate and boring drivel has got such amazing reviews on here and from some critics. Just before this we watched The Good The Bad and The Ugly again now that has everything this movie doesn't but seems to be trying so hard to emulate  characters that aren't black and white minimal dialogue to add to the tension and stunning camerawork to keep you captivated.Save your time and money and watch this classic instead Drive has nothing to offer but annoyance and the WORST soundtrack I've ever heard.".

Several idiotic flaws run through the movie  Gosling's character wearing a white jacket which becomes blood stained mid way through yet he continues to wear it in public without consequences. His car which he rams into the bad guys vehicle with enough force to flip it onto a beach is still pretty drivable for the remainder of the movie.A pretty decent cast was assembled for this movie Ron Perlman Christina Hendricks Albert Brooks and Bryan Cranston so I expected more.I'm sure there are those who will call this movie a classic and I'm sure it is by a certain set of standards but for a Joe Soap guy like me it was a waste of my time".

Several idiotic flaws run through the movie  Gosling's character wearing a white jacket which becomes blood stained mid way through yet he continues to wear it in public without consequences. His car which he rams into the bad guys vehicle with enough force to flip it onto a beach is still pretty drivable for the remainder of the movie.A pretty decent cast was assembled for this movie Ron Perlman Christina Hendricks Albert Brooks and Bryan Cranston so I expected more.I'm sure there are those who will call this movie a classic and I'm sure it is by a certain set of standards but for a Joe Soap guy like me it was a waste of my time";

	schema:reviewBody "Sigourney Weaver plays Margeret Matheson a jaded middleaged psychologist. If you've seen Avatar it's the same character she plays in that but with a bit less vitriol. I liked this character a firm womanbut fair and kind when she needs to be. This is a character we've all met in real life at some point. She's compelling and extremely well acted by Weaver. In every scene you're completely hooked by the show she puts on.Cillian Murphy's character Tom Buckley is a little more mysterious. He plays a Physicist allegedly who accompanies Matheson on her expeditions to debunk fake mediums and psychics. The character is written with little back story and what little back story that is introduced remains cryptic. The role is well acted but outshone by the better conceived better written character of Matheson. The film starts out well. The first scene a prologueintro sequence is suspenseful and I thought it worked really well. Both Weaver's and Murphy's characters are introduced well and chemistry is established right from the first scene. The best thing about this film is the atmosphere. Every scene is absolutely dripping with it. The direction as well is tasteful and strong. Little touches like the camera shaking a little more in every scene that Matheson is in to show her questionable health are very effective and add to the feel.This 2 hour film trundles along at a steady pace fleshing out Matheson and Buckley sort of and introducing a completely irrelevant love interest for Buckley. She plays little role in the story and could be cut entirely.We follow them as they expose a Psychic as a fake. They perform surveillance in the crowd before the show spotting so called Red Lights employees of the Psychic who scout potential targets for the psychiching later and hacking into the radio frequency that is used to communicated with the Psychic on stage and tell him names and other secrets to fool the audience into thinking he's actually got a gift. Looking good so far.We are shown Matheson's inner turmoil her sick son. Apparently in a coma for over a decade the soft squishy side of such a apparently tough woman is laid bare. Apparently her zeal for exposing fake psychics stems from her inability to let him go. She uses him as an excuse almost each case shown to be a fake solidifying her belief that there's no afterlife and justifying her keeping him alive. Besides a spot of clumsy writing with some unneeded overexposition a bit of a theme with this film I'm afraid the time spent in the hospital room really opens up Matheson's character.And then she dies.Seriously she dies. Why? I don't know. Matheson the most fleshed out and built up character just up and dies. Such a pointless grab at an emotional scene completely kicks the legs out from under the film. There's no reason why the Matheson character couldn't have been included in the rest of the film she just disappear. This was supposed to be a parallel of a past event in the story where Simon Silver's a blind formerly extremely famous psychic Robert De Niro biggest critic mysteriously died from a heart attack. However it is very very loosely linked and barely explained.The latter half of the film we focus on Buckley as he becomes obsessed with discovering Simon Silver as a fraud. Buckley now apparently the main character slowly seems to get more and more unhinged as he's apparently haunted by Silver. Birds spontaneously fly into windows near him things go bump in the night equipment explodes randomly etc etc. The void left by Matheson never quite goes away though for all the wrong reasons.Silver is eventually found to not be a fraud after a heavy duty scientific study but Buckley unleashes his tryingsohardtodoanAmericanaccent studentBen Craig Roberts on the footage from the experiment who eventually comes up with nothing. Suddenly love interest who I'd completely forgotten about comes along and spots that Silver's watch and the other scientist performing the test's watch are perfectly in sync. Ignoring the fact that Silver was told to remove his watch earlier in the scene and the fact that the other unintroduced scientist is apparently totally alright with jeopardising his scientific career for whatever Silver is paying him this reveal is pretty weak and totally not characteristic of actual scientific study.Buckley confronts Silver on stage at his last show after being beaten thoroughly to fine mush by one of Silver's minions and the theatre goes mad. Lights explode ceilings crack the ground shakes Silver's glasses fall off. This is all very exciting and you really wonder how Silver is pulling it all off. You wait for the great reveal. The turmoil subsides and Buckley flicks a coin at Silver who snatches it out of the air revealing he is not in fact blind and is a fraud. This is where the film should have ended.And then Silver says that one line. That simple 5 word line that completely ruins the entire film. How did you do thatYep you got it. Buckley the mysterious physicist the man obsessed with revealing Silver as a fraud is the true Psychic. This is a twist so violent and random it finally breaks the films neck. It completely mangles the whole tone message moral anything this film had is now gone. The mystery and tension evaporates like a flock of birds after a gunshot. The intrigue at how these apparently impossible events could have possibly happened to Buckley is moot. All of this in the last 5 minutes of the film. I have never known a film be more thoroughly ruined in such an thorough and accurate way. 510. The story is nearly there the acting is generally good the atmosphere created is stellar but those last 5 minutes are truly horrifying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Psychologist and paranormal investigator Dr. Margaret Matheson Sigourney Weaver and her assistant Dr. Tom Buckley Cillian Murphy a physicist travel around debunking supposed paranormal activity from bumps in the night to stage psychics. Dr. Buckley wants to investigate their most challenging person to date Simon Silver Robert De Niro a redound psychic who is making a comeback after a thirty year absence from the stage. Dr. Matheson warns Buckley against this though after having come up against him in the 1970s and failing to prove him a fraud. With the help of student Sally Owen Elisabeth Olsen Buckley defies Matheson and begins investigating the illusive Silver.As a radical atheist and sceptic the film's ideas appealed to me. I was delighted to watch the scientists make fun of and debunk people who claim to see ghosts and be able to read minds. The script treats these people with distain and isn't afraid to mention how these people can be responsible for giving stupid people false hope and can even cost lives. The cast is also amongst the best of any film this year. With actors such as Signourney Weaver Cillian Murphy Toby Jones Joely Richardson the delightful Elizabeth Olsen and my all time favourite actor Robert De Niro anything less than a great film would be a disappointment. Well this isn't a great film but it isn't terrible either.The cast are all great. It's nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a more substantial role for a change and not just popping up at the end of a scifi film. She is believable as a psychologist and it's fun to see her spa with Toby Jones. Her character also has just the tiniest bit of doubt which makes her fallible and this is conveyed well by the actress. Cillian Murphy is also excellent as the physicist but is a bit more mysterious than Weaver. He gets better as his character develops as the film progresses. Elisabeth Olsen gives another good performance but after her break out roles in Mary Martha and Safe House takes a bit of a back seat here. De Niro who as I said is my all time favourite actor doesn't embarrass himself for once and while we don't get De Niro of the 70s or 80s he's on good form here. The supporting cast of Submarine's Craig Roberts Joley Richardson Toby Jones and English language newcomer Leonardo Sbaraglia help to round out a great cast with good performances.The plot develops at a good pace and it gets darker and scarier as it goes on. I wasn't able to get the main twist which was a satisfying if ever so slightly confusing one but De Niro's twists were ridiculously obvious and pointed to far too much. Anyone can see what is going on you just have to watch. The camera work is far too busy for my liking. One scene featuring Murphy and Olsen having a conversation in a caf used about seven different camera angles and it became a little distracting. After filming Ryan Reynolds in a box for his last feature Buried director Rodrigo Cortes could have done with making his latest film a bit more confined.The first hour is definitely better than the second and there was an echo of oh well then as the lights went up in the cinema. The film loses its way slightly in the second half and the somewhat pedestrian script comes to the forefront. While the actors do a good job and while there is plenty to like the ending isn't brilliant and doesn't do the opening justice. Even so it's nice to watch some great actors delivering good performances and the twists should keep most people guessing.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

I gather the ending has divided opinion quite a lot and I admit that it could have been done much better. I've said before when reviewing movies that it's never a good sign when you have to have a character explicitly explain just what has happened in the film. It might have been a better idea to leave it without the explanation and let the audience decide. That might have stoked up debate in a good way and generated some more interest in the film.Actingwise i'm sorry to say i'm always skeptical when Robert De Niro appears in a movie nowadays. The man was a terrific actor in his day but he's been in a lot of recent turkeys. He doesn't have a lot of screentime here but his performance was fine. If he keeps choosing credible films like this one his reputation will start to repair itself. Sigourney Weaver performs with credit as usual and I always rate Cillian Murphy highly.Definitely worth going to see this. It's above average if only slightly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not much has been made of it but 'Red Lights' has a twist which I don't care how attentive or clever you are you will simply not predict. Paranormalthemed films are getting to be quite stale but the ending which actually has two twists is marvellous and might  might  galvanise the genre. Sigourney Weaver and Cillian pronounced 'Killian' Murphy play Doctors Matheson and Buckley. They're a psychologist and physicist who investigate psychic claims. Invariably they come away from each case laughing. Every one is explained scientifically rationally. They're exposed as magic tricks. Recent roles haven't reflected why Weaver who is nearly 65 has been so prolific of late but here she excels. Her character is meant to be an expert and because of the plausibility she exudes that's exactly how I viewed her. Writerdirector Rodrigo Cortes' 'Buried' excellent script assists her characterisation. Intellectual detailed lifelike you could be mistaken at moments for watching a TV show debate. Murphy gets similar credit. He invests in his role a seriousness which might have been silly if he did so in isolation. The doctors find their match in Simon Silver Robert De Niro a famous psychic who comes out of retirement for one last pay check. He's the only one Weaver won't investigate because 'he's the only one who makes her doubt'. Murphy insists however but when he does he  we  uncover more than we were expecting. Like you I hope I'm convinced that psychic ability is balderdash. So I was more than impressed at how Cortes creates a mood and a tempo that keeps you guessing until the dramatic end. His film is original suspenseful and most importantly for a film with this premise credible. But then there's De Niro my favourite actor. Always has been. Always will be. But my God has he been making it hard for me these past 20 years. He once said that he was an actor not a personality. I think it's time for him to update his personal quote book. Why do I say this? Because and I deeply regret admitting this he's the single biggest reason why 'Red Lights' regardless of Weaver's and Murphy's endeavours and the superb final twist will join his expanding cannon of fodder.www.moseleyb13.com".

Because and I deeply regret admitting this he's the single biggest reason why 'Red Lights' regardless of Weaver's and Murphy's endeavours and the superb final twist will join his expanding cannon of fodder.www.moseleyb13.com";

It turns into a total circus with a VERY easy to predict plot. I've read reviews of people saying stuff about needing to be a genius to figure this movie out. The clues are blatantly obvious! As for the characters it's the best I've seen Weaver since the Alien movies. As for De Niro why does he keep choosing roles that are just not suited to De Niro? Murphy is best sticking to being a slime bad guy.This could have been a genuinely good story but turned out to be a poor imitation of an M Night Shyamalan movie. I cannot recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly don't how or why this film made it beyond a random thought in some idiot's drug addled brain. The entire concept is flawed. I read in another post that the director did a great deal of research because he wanted the film to be believable? Are you kidding? This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen... and that's including what plays behind the hilarious characters of MST3K. The only reason to sit through this train wreck is if you are really stoned and want something to dissect and laugh at.At one point about halfway into the film I commented to my wife Maybe De Niro is just a regular old blind guy and all of this is in his head. A sort of fantasy he made up to entertain himself as he trudges through the daily routine. It was supposed to be a joke but a testament to the awful reality of the script was my wife's response That would actually be a better idea for a movie!Honestly we only finished watching for two reasons 1 We were having a great time making fun of it. 2 We wanted to see what laughable twist was coming at the end. The twist did not disappoint. SPOILERS De Niro wasn't really blind. OOOHHHHHHH!!! Couldn't see that one coming ten thousand miles away. The second twist? I'll let you find out but it's just silly and certainly not worth sitting through the film if that's the only reason you're still watching after the first 20 minutes.Now this section will contain many SPOILERS as I want to respond to some of the more ridiculous plot points1. Is this supposed to be some alternate reality as other reviewers have stated where any of the subject matter of this script actually matters... to anyone? If so they did not do a good job of establishing this fact. The movie makes it seems as though psychic frauds are PLAGUING the world and must be fought with the fervor of the war on terror or the drug war. Which incidentally I do not agree with but at least those would make sense for a movie plot.2. De Niro is supposed to be some master villain hellbent on destroying people's lives but they never really cover any terrible act he's committing. Ohhhh... he's a fraud who fleeces people for money... AND?! Who gives a sh!7? Am I supposed to care that much about idiots giving their money to a conman? He's no worse than a televangelist. Did they show him raping women and children? Was he shown stealing money from thousands of sick and poor people? No. So who cares what some hack psychic does with his time?3. The scene where they bust the fraudulent faith healer is hilarious. First Sigourney and Cillian are using some hightech spy gear to bust the guy and for some reason the police are with them. OK. When the bust occurs the director makes a halfassed attempt to make it look like the whole production is being run by biker meth dealing types? I assume that's what he was going for. The bust concludes with the cops hauling the faith healer off to prison... for... I'm not sure. In this world I guess being a faith healer is some major crime that gets you locked away for life? I doubt they even broke any laws scummy as the characters might be.4. Sigourney Weaver's death. WTF? Did those people on the talk show kill her? Cillian just finds her dead after the talk show got out of hand. And why are they portraying the talk show appearance as though it would matter at all? In most believable worlds Sigourney's appearance would be little more than an episode of some daytime talk show or a blurb in a TLC programs on debunking paranormal claims. Yet Cillian is watching this event unfold on his television screen as though he's watching a State of the Union address or some debate that has ANY consequences to important matters. Again... who cares? Cillian's character I guess. The audience sure wasn't lead to a place of caring by this point in the script.5. Near the end of the film the scientist who ran the experiment on De Niro is about to publish his findings that the demonstrated psychic phenomena was real. This is supposed to be a HUGE deal for some reason that ONE scientist at ONE university published a study. This also goes against the point other reviewers posted that this script takes place in a universe where everyone is interested in the paranormal and the public widely believes in paranormal abilities. If that is the case then why would this study be a big deal? I think this point shows that the writerdirector wanted this script to take place in the real world which is absolute insanity. Anyway... back to the topic. This scene is ridiculous! Scientist publish controversial findings all the time. The movie acts as though the second this study is signed and published the world as we know it will come to an end. Up will become down. Black will become white. Yadda yadda. Who... gives... a... sh17?! Studies like this one HAVE been published in the real world and no one cared. So... why would anyone care about a fictionalization of a common occurrence? It's all just so terrible.Review continued below...".

	schema:reviewBody "I can sum up this mess of a film in a few short paragraphsSigourney Weaver was amazing. A brilliant performance a kin to her role in Copy Cat as Criminal Psychologist Helen Hudson. Weaver plays Margaret Matheson a no nonsense style professional out to help people understand that paranormal abilities are not real.

The movie as a whole is a genuine piece of manure due to one thing and one thing only the finale and as I will continue to preach on and on  the movie's only as good as its ending. That's what I call an axiom of good film making. However if you happen to disagree read no further as the rest of this film is actually pretty good. Maybe you can fantasize an ending that doesn't suck and settle on that. I did make up a much better ending that was actually somewhat intelligent unlike the ending we have received but I will not settle on an imaginary ending it's simply not my responsibility it is the screenplay writer's one. The rules of engagement are elementary a creator has to be criticised for his halfgood job.Red Lights starts out promising enough. We have two physicists from a Myth Busters science division rolling around the country in their Mystery Van it's not really a van. They keep exposing one small charlatan after another passing their knowledge and experience to a small group of students in the time between their supernatural escapades.There is another rather unusual branch of science on the other side of the unknown university our meddling scientists work for suffice to say it's no Cambridge. That division is more akin to being the Weird Al Yankovic of science rather than Myth Busters. The socalled Scientific Paranormal Research Centre emphasis on the word scientific which of course takes in triple the money our protagonists receive from the government a plotpoint that goes nowhere by the way and of which the boss is shown to be a complete fool by my favourite actress of all time Sigourney Weaver in a matter of mere seconds... And then she dies that point being? Who knows? Not me certainly. Oh yes she establishes De Niro to be the big bad wolf of the picture just before she does. That point being? I feel like we're falling into repetition here.Cillian Murphy goes completely insane obsessing over De Niro trying to expose him as a fraud. All the weird things start happening around Cillian as the plot thickens suicidal birds toasters blowing up cement dust falling on him unusual dreams and so on and so forth following every single line in the great book of horror movie clichs. None of which would've bothered me that much as I grew accustomed to the Hollywood clichs on one condition provided the rest of the film is adequate. Which sadly it is not.Then comes the crescendo and suddenly the film is on its head. The ending makes such a sudden 180degrees turn the twist is so nonsensical and stupid that it gives Magnolia a run for its money not talking about De Niro being able to see I figured it out long before since that part actually makes sense.Ready for the big reveal? Cillian Murphy is actually a powerful psychic himself and all the strange happenings were his doing De Niro is of course a nobody which once again makes perfect sense. Tactical facepalm you have got to be kidding me. Somebody please poke me have I suddenly been teleported into a screening of a completely different movie next door? What's with all the morality of a woman dying of a stomach cancer due to a quack psychic telling her those pains are irrelevant here we fall into a debate as to who is a legitimate psychic and who isn't? What happened to Cillian and his student being the last barrier between the world and stupidity? Furthermore what's with the idea of divine presence? The existence of paranormality does not prove afterlife and there being a god in the slightest. Isn't Cillian supposed to be a scientist a scientist that is able to use a basic logical reasoning like that? This film had just been elevated onto an entirely new level of mental retardation. The only thing that's missing to complete the landscape is Murphy flying away into the sunrise Copperfield style which unfortunately did not happen.Oh yeah and the watch should not be there in the first place a controlled experiment remember we even had a scene but so does the Scientific Paranormal Research Centre so why am I complaining? Also did you notice that I didn't mention the girlfriend? Well neither did I since she's so secondary to the story.It's blatantly obvious that Rodrigo Cortes traded his brains for a pinch of faith a long time ago him trying to come off as deep is just pathetic. I do realize that this film isn't really mocking sceptics rather trying to establish a paradigm shift however childish it might be or maybe I'm wrong and Cortes is doing exactly that. Either way this film is probably not worth your time. It can be entertaining sometimes but entertainment is cheap and the substance is not. Substance you shall not find here or rather you shall but that substance is twisted which is a lot worse. Yes and please do not mistake fringe science for pseudoscience. Fringe science can become good science pseudoscience cannot.".

Though I will try not to decline in the quality of analysis.With a highly respected and frankly quite surprising cast the surprise being the lack of marketing and attention the film has received nothing negative can be said of the fine performances most notably from our protagonist Cillian Murphy. The actors deliver dialogue to assist the slow plot development and at times subtle appropriate humour between Murphy and Sigourney Weaver's characters. The chemistry between the two paranormal researchers is evident throughout and it is not until one of the film's many expositions where this is lost. This technique of continuous revelations is what enables an audience to remain in their seats despite having perhaps consumed too much of the overpriced beverages from the lobby and as clich as it is keeps you on the edge of your seat. hopefully not due to irritability The script itself unveils an original idea of exposing paranormal phenomena as fraudulent which itself is reason enough to enjoy this film in theatres while you still can!Now onto the second hour I mean paragraph. The immediate impact of the arguably primary disequilibrium can be felt as it occurs as the tone of the motion picture changes. Unexpected plot holes begin to expose themselves as spots might to a thirteen yearold.

Would our unusual tragic hero achieve his goal? How would a new equilibrium be incorporated? This is what kept blinking to a minimum throughout though eyes were still rolling at particular moments due to the inconceivable mistakes and unexplained occurrences. We were almost being rushed towards the end of the story so that the theatre could get more people to enjoy the film for an hour or tw... forget it just the one hour.Without the cast to save the ambition and potential of Rodrigo Cortes' piece it no doubt would have been a disaster in all respects and its already mundane box office performance would be as low as my mood coming out of Screen 14 last Wednesday. With all respect to the directorwriter though 'Red Lights' is worth watching based solely on the first 60 minutes because of the idea as well as the performances of the many talented actors despite some characters being completely irrelevant and unnecessary. If you find yourself searching for something to do one evening and if there are no particular films you desire to see but you desire to see a film then 'Red Lights' will moderately satisfy your appetite though you may be disappointed there wasn't more on the plate.".

	schema:headline " In the valley of love with Kenny Moore and Jayne Mansfield.";
	schema:reviewBody "A British comedy Western filmed in Spain starring a bastion of English acting Kenneth Moore an American sexbomb Jayne Mansfield and directed by the man who brought us High Sierra  White Heat Raoul Walsh. Yes that's quite a hodgepodge of elements and it's no surprise to find that that's exactly what the film is a mixture of fun froth and cringe inducing oddities.The film is adapted by Howard Dimsdale from a short story written by Jacob Hay. The plot centres around Jonathon Tibbs Moore the young son of a family of English gunsmiths. He travels to the American West in the 1880s to sell firearms to the locals. While on stagecoach route he survives an Indian attack purely by stiff upper lip British luck and then he inadvertently acquires a reputation of quickness on the draw due to his wrist mounted Derringer style weapon. Sensing an opportunity to finally clean up Fractured Jaw which is in the middle of a war between The Lazy S  Box T factions the mayor bluffs Tibbs into becoming the sheriff. Cue hilarity as the hopelessly ill equipped Englishman starts to clean up the town with the help of buxom saloon owner Kate Mansfield and his new family the Indians.The problems with the film are many the over used fish out of water formula the budget restrictions being over obvious and the glaringly blatant lack of chemistry between the two oddly casted leadsare just the ones that first spring to mind. Then you can add the bad idea to include the likes of Robert Morley and Sid James in your film and give them next to no time on screen. So yes it's not too harsh to say that The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw is a weak film in many ways.

	onyx:emotionText "A British comedy Western filmed in Spain starring a bastion of English acting Kenneth Moore an American sexbomb Jayne Mansfield and directed by the man who brought us High Sierra  White Heat Raoul Walsh. Yes that's quite a hodgepodge of elements and it's no surprise to find that that's exactly what the film is a mixture of fun froth and cringe inducing oddities.The film is adapted by Howard Dimsdale from a short story written by Jacob Hay. The plot centres around Jonathon Tibbs Moore the young son of a family of English gunsmiths. He travels to the American West in the 1880s to sell firearms to the locals. While on stagecoach route he survives an Indian attack purely by stiff upper lip British luck and then he inadvertently acquires a reputation of quickness on the draw due to his wrist mounted Derringer style weapon. Sensing an opportunity to finally clean up Fractured Jaw which is in the middle of a war between The Lazy S  Box T factions the mayor bluffs Tibbs into becoming the sheriff. Cue hilarity as the hopelessly ill equipped Englishman starts to clean up the town with the help of buxom saloon owner Kate Mansfield and his new family the Indians.The problems with the film are many the over used fish out of water formula the budget restrictions being over obvious and the glaringly blatant lack of chemistry between the two oddly casted leadsare just the ones that first spring to mind. Then you can add the bad idea to include the likes of Robert Morley and Sid James in your film and give them next to no time on screen. So yes it's not too harsh to say that The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw is a weak film in many ways. Yet it is funny something that comes quite often with the fish out of water formula if the writing is clever enough. Mercifully Dimsdale's screenplay sets up a number of humorous set pieces and Walsh tho long past his best professionally puts them together.Moore gives the whole British tenderfoot act his complete gusto and Mansfield looks terrific every inch the sexbomb befitting her legacy. Some fine support comes from Henry Hull  Bruce Cabot while the tunes Mansfield dubbed by the brilliant Connie Francis notably the gorgeous theme song In The Valley Of Love keep the film brisk and firmly footed in the light entertainment department. It's a film that if you dwell on it too much could drive you to distraction but as time fillers go in the comedy Western subgenre it just about finishes above average and is recommended for like minded adults on a very rainy day. 610";

He just wanted to sell some Britishmade guns to the locals but ends up shanghaied into becoming the latest in a series of recent sheriffs the others having died by violent means....... Is Tibbs likely to fare any better? Well many of the locals initially have a strong prejudice against him because he's obviously a Brit of good breeding talking and acting very different from the other men of this town and probably a tinhorn when it comes to sheriffing. As Jane MansfieldKate as the proprietor and singer of a saloon and boarding housediscovers he's less than handy at shooting firearms. And as the local Indians discover he's never ridden a horse and again shows little aptitude in mounting or staying on a horse. But he has 2 assets that help him He's not afraid to approach armed men Including Indians and talk to them. Also he has a derringer up his sleeve attached to his arm that impresses everyone who often submit to him after seeing it. Seeing this makes Kate change from acting surly toward him to deciding that maybe he is her ticket out of this forgotten town into the wide world of sophistication and urbanites......Kate lipsyncs to 3 songs sung by Connie Francis and composed by Harry Harris. TwoStrolling Down the Lane with Bill and If the San Francisco Hills Could Only Talk were sung as part of stage shows with dancers in the background. The third In the Valley of Love probably the best was sung while accompanying Tibbs on a buckboard ride through a canyon where the walls supposedly echoed her singing enhancing it. Connie also sang this during the opening credits. Kate lost her strong Southern lingo when singing......Although first billed Robert Morley as well as Robert Squire and David Horne were only present in the rather brief beginning when we supposedly are in the UK....William Campbell serves as Keeno who has some hostile encounters with Tibbs....Henry Hull as Mayor Masters exhibits his signature bombastic personality similarly seen in Jesse James 1939 for example....Sidney James is the drunk in the initial stagecoach ride. .....Jonas Applegarth serves as the Indian ChiefRunning Deer who has a number of interactions with Tibbs and serves as Kate's substitute father in her wedding to Tibbs....Charles Irwin serves as the undertaker who is waiting for Tibbs to be shot dead......The climax involves a 4 way battle in the boondocks between the cowboys of the Lazy S and the Box T who are gunning for each other as well as for Tibbs who is defended by Kate and her rifle. Eventually Tibbs' bloodbrother Indians show up to tip the battle in Tibbs' favor. The two groups of cowboys agree to forget their differences and behave in town....I enjoyed the film for the most part. More and Hull especially are appropriately amusing and Jane provides some serious eye candy endearing sassiness and charm whatever her deficiencies in acting might be. See it at YouTube.".

More sells Morley on the fact that in the lawless American west what better place can the company find a better market. Poor Moore he manages to get himself involved in a range war between two large ranches gets appointed sheriff of the town of Fractured Jaw and gets made an adopted member of the local Indian tribe. But this was not without its pleasant side as he manages to also win saloon singer Jayne Mansfield. She's more like Wrangler Jane of F Troop than Marlene Dietrich.Jayne gets three songs also and she's dubbed by the familiar voice of Connie Francis. Not that Connie doesn't sing them well but we know that's Connie Francis coming from Mansfield. They should have used an unknown singer.The film has its amusing moments but it really is an overblown Carry On film.".

'A Night to Remember' and in one case in terms of films  his later TV appearances such as in the first BBC 'Forsythe Saga' is something different his talents coincided exactly with the demands of the film to produce a really good memorable film 'Reach for the Sky'. Unfortunately his usual caution failed him entirely in this sad excuse of an 'entertainment' movie. It is lavishly produced on an epic Cinemascopic scale and one presumes his fee for appearing was commensurate. It has one of the best directors in the field Roaul Walsh and a stock of standard 1950s British support characters inevitably including Sidney James in attendance as well. Beyond this however it has nothing at all going for it. The essential humorous 'core' of the film the incongruity of Moore's upper class Englishman amongst the crudities and what even by the 1950s were becoming stereotypical film clichs of the 'Wild West' wears off after about the first fifteen minutes and becomes increasingly tiresome as the film progresses. The 'plot' is waferthin and recourse has to be made to inserting songs which have not worn at all well over the decades and are all instantly forgettable in order to 'entertain' the audience. To make matters worse the background scenery does not even LOOK like 'the Wild West' but rather a cross between the Yorkshire Dales and North Wales. Finally oh dear oh dear there is Miss Mansfield's 'performance'. Full marks for effort and determination but whether it is through trying to comprehend what she is saying in her 'southern drawl' which seems to change almost from scene to scene but still remains largely impenetrable for long stretches of the film or from listening to her warbling attempts to get through the aforementioned songs one unfortunately just has to draw the conclusion that she simply 'did not have it' in terms of being a star to carry a film in a lead role. Her physical resemblance to Munroe is obviously a strong one but as this film shows all too clearly was just not enough in itself to build a career on in films. Overall then a sad affair and waste of talents and resources through inappropriate usage. One for passing a couple of hours if one is really illdown in the dumps on a wet afternoon and just wants something to 'pass the time' before tea but is unlikely ever to want to see again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Astonishingly the name and the person of Genghis Khan in Sergei Bodrov's Mongol a great Shakespearean drama about this seminal figure in history don't appear until the very end of the twohour epic. Instead we see Temudjin the man yet to become posthumously Khagan emperor of what was to be for several centuries the largest contiguous empire in history. Whether Bodrov completes the contemplated two additional chapters of the story or not Mongol stands on its own as a masterpiece. Contradicting the Western and Russian image of Genghis as the monstrous conqueror Bodrov's work is influenced by Lev Gumilev's The Legend of the Black Arrow and is based on The Secret History of the Mongols the 13th century Mongolian account unknown until its reemergence in China 700 years later. For a director who learned in school only about the horrors of Russia's 200year subjugation by the Mongols taking a larger view is a remarkable act.Unlike Omar Sharif in the 1965 Henry Levin Genghis Khan or Takashi Sorimachi in Shinichiro Sawai's disappointing 2007 To the Ends of the Earth and Sea Tadanobu Asano in Bodrov's film is strictly Temudjin not the great Khan. He lived from 1162 to 1227 and Mongol covers the years between 1171 and the beginning of the unification of Mongolian tribes around the turn of the century.In fact the spookily powerful child Temudjin Odnyam Odsuren dominates the first part of the film undergoing trials and tribulations that make the lives of Dickens' abused and imperiled children look like a picnic. From age nine into his 30s Temudjin was orphaned hunted imprisoned enslaved and constantly threatened by extinction. Literally alone in the vast landscape brilliantly photographed by Rogier Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov Temudjin escapes death repeatedly at times almost mysteriously.Mongol is huge  with endless vistas and epic crowd scenes quite without special effects  but Bodrov keeps the setting just that never strutting visuals for their own sake. The film is about people and the cast is magnificent. Asano's face and eyes hold attention and make the viewer experience simultaneous feelings of getting to know the character he plays and being held at arm's length. Bodrov and Asano escape all the many Hollywood pitfalls in making an epic  they present nothing easy predictable trite. The term Shakespearean is used here advisedly. The Mongolian actors are sensational Khulan Chuluun is luminous as Borte Temudjin's wife Borte's 10yearold self the girl who chooses Temudjin then 9 while he thinks he is the one making the decision is unforgettable even if the name is hard to remember Bayertsetseg Erdenebat. Chinese actors are vital to the film. As Temudjin's father poisoned by Tatars before the boy reached 10 Sai Xing Ga makes an impression few actors can achieve in such a brief appearance. Nearly overshadowing Asano is the grand thespian exercise from Sun HongLei as Temudjin's allimportant blood brother Jamukha. Sun is almost too big for the big screen perhaps a less intense performance would have served the film better. Another problem is near the end of Mongol with Borte's strangerthanfiction and actually fictional rescue of Temudjin from a Tangut prison years hundreds of miles and impossible alliances and dalliances telescoped into a few nearincongruous minutes  all to cover a 10yearlong gap in Genghis' history. Except for that however Bodrov's work is engrossing spectacular and memorable.".

It's called the secret history of the Mongols and was written shortly after he died as a record for the Mongolian royal family. He was just a chieftain's's son of a very minor tribe. That's what makes this story so impressive he didn't start out as a king or a prince with a huge army like Alexander. Everything he had he had to earn. He didn't get to be Genghis Khan until he was in his 30's. He was always aware of how victory wasn't assured but had to be paid for with planning and strategy. He wasn't a saint by any means but he wasn't an unthinking savage. This movie is actually meant to be the first in a trilogy with the second one probably detailing his conquest of north china and the third the conquest of the Khwarezim empire in Iran and Afghanistan.This is an approach that I like because the Alexander movie died on account of it trying to condense all of his conquests into one movie.".

The film is destined to be historically flawed as there is little known about his life this being said Bodrov takes large handfuls of creative license. Bodrov's Mongol attempts to capture a man's rise to power in just two hours without making a rushed film this impossible feat is Mongol's only true shortcoming.Mongol is very much a based off a true story kind of movie. We certainly aren't seeing the true Genghis Khan. The film is riddled with historical inaccuracies he is captured three times during the film in reality he was only captured once. However historical accuracy is not Bodrov's intent. Sergei Bodrov grew up in the Soviet Union a place where Genghis Khan is painted as a vicious killing machine. Mongol attempts to humanize him. This is the film's strongest point.Mongol is just a good love story. Temudjin picks a bride at age nine named Brte and is set to wed her in five years. Soon after his father a Khan is killed. Betrayed by those his father used to command Temudjin is left with nothing and swears to take it all back. This is the basic premise of Mongol. The relationship between Temudjin and Brte is portrayed as beautifully simple love. The film uses this connection to move the plot rather than bloody violence. Mongol does however contain several spectacular battles. Bodrov seems to have taken a page out of 300 and we're given a splattering of death sequences that while all together different feel and are shot similarly.The largest flaw of the film is it's continuity. Bodrov in order to condense the story under 120 minutes constantly cuts scenes in half. He will start a conflict and cut to it being over leaving the audience to infer what happened. This is a double edged sword on one hand it frees up time for necessary character development on the other it makes the film feel choppy. Mongol is one of the few films that should be 15 minutes longer.In the end Sergei Bodrov's Mongol is an epic war film that succeeds not only on that level but as a beautiful love story. The breathtaking landscapes of Mongolia provide an awe inspiring backdrop for the action on the screen. Mongol is a film of proportions not usually seen in Russian or Asian cinema. It delivers on a level that rivals if not surpasses many Hollywood blockbusters while keeping surprising heart evident throughout the film. Mongol truly is an inspiring film not only for the eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first installment of a prospective trilogy Mongol chronicles the early life of Temudjin from his childhood on the Asian steppe to his ascension to Khan in 1206.The performances are passable  with special thanks to Honglei Sun with an engaging turn as Temudjin's longtime friend and ally Jamukha  but the film has a rushed quality to it that is predominantly the fault of the screenplay. We jump too quickly from one scene to the next the tension is constantly disrupted and the characters are for the most part onedimensional void of quirks and personal histories and any of the other qualities that might make them relatable. I'm not asking for anything fancy theirs was a tribal culture constantly engaged in the act of survival and any philosophical rants or emotive confessionals would feel forced and inorganic but none of that pardons the film for the simple crime of not giving its characters enough to do. The needs of the plot seem to dictate their actions rather than the needs of the characters driving the plot.The biggest casualty as always is the love story. Ironically enough Temudjin and Borte generate the most chemistry when they meet as children Borte commanding him  with a freeness of spirit that gets less and less visible as the movie progresses  to pick her as his bride. Unfortunately their subsequent romance is more about desperate rescues and longwinded goodbyes than it is the simple moments of intimacy that make a relationship believable.That said the cinematography is tremendous and the costumes topnotch and the casting department deserves a couple extra bushels of brownie points for picking actors who  unlike many a Hollywood ensemble  look like they could actually survive the conditions they supposedly inhabit. The combat scenes are captivating and cleverly shot and despite the inevitable comparison to such battleheavy epics as Lord of the Rings and Gladiator Bodrov keeps a handle on things never letting any of the battles run beyond the five minute mark endowing the film with an element of realism and restraint where many of the other socalled epics go completely over the top. True the movie relies a bit more heavily on CGI than I would prefer but the Mongolian landscape the real star of the show is so gorgeous so demanding so jawdroppingly authentic that we quickly forget our visual grievances and get lost in the rudimentary act of watching.A pity we can never lose ourselves completely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mongol 2007 was cowritten and directed by Sergei Bodrov. It was filmed in Kazakhstan and is in Mongolian with English subtitles. It's a biography of Ghenghis Khan especially his rise to power. The movie quotes an old proverb Do not scorn a weak cub he may become a brutal tiger. Actually as portrayed in the film Ghenghis Khan was hardly a weak cub even as a young child. However he certainly became a tiger when grownwhether brutal or just powerful is another question.The film is more or less consistent with the Wikipedia report of Khan's life. He was captured and enslaved as a boy but managed to escape and eventually conquer his local tribal enemies. The movie portrays Ghenghis Khan as a young boy and then a young man. The film ends before we can see Khan's eventual consolidation of his huge empire.There is literally a cast of thousands. The movie is colorful the battle scenes are graphic and men women and horses all look great. The acting was excellent especially that of Odnyam Odsuren as the young Ghenghis Khan Tadanobu Asano as the grown man and the beautiful Khulan Chuluun as Brte his wife.For political andor esthetic reasons Khan is portrayed as a man who brought the warring Mongolian tribes together and as a lawgiver and just ruler. I don't have enough knowledge of the period to know whether the people of his empire would have taken this view. However this is a movie not a Ph.D. dissertation so I accepted it as an actionfilled and enjoyableif not profoundfilm.We saw this film at the excellent Rochester High Falls International Film Festival. Because of the sweeping nature of the battles and the glorious shots of the landscape this movie will lose a lot on DVD. Try to see it in a theater preferably one with a large screen.".

In some ways it reminded me of Braveheart because you learned about the history but there was also beautiful cinematography landscapes and very well done battle scenes.

Would really appreciate if this made into a trilogy but I don't think the film makers have left any scope to stretch it further.

	schema:reviewBody "'Mongol' the Russiandirected semihistorical epic big emphasis on the semi here shot for 20 million in China and Mongolia and Kazhakistan with a multinational cast and crew and Japanese and Chinese stars purports to depict the first thirtyfive years of the life of the emperor Genghis Khan. I say purports because not much is known of this period and even in depicting legend Bodrov chooses to leave out many of the essential connectives that make a good story or fairy tale or legend. Temudjin as the young superKhan is called is a yoked prisoner for example awaiting execution then inexplicably the yoke is off and he's free. He sinks through thin ice deep into the frozen water below then inexplicably he's lying on land and getting rescued. He is languishing in a Chinese prisonhis face seeming to acquire a patina of dust and sand I liked that part Bodrov excels at faces and tableaux then he's miraculously found by his faithful wife Borte. She throws him a key and sets him free. Then inexplicably he is leading a vast army to defeat his arch rival. Over and over how we get from point A to point B is left on the cuttingroom floor. This is enjoyable as spectacle but unsatisfying from other standpoints.How Genghis Khan got to be Genghis Khan in short is one thing this movie doesn't begin to try to explain. Could anyone? That I don't know but 'Mongol' presents its biographical narrative without the connectives that make sense of a life. Despite lots of dramatic scenes with snappy dialog striking images and above all computerassisted battles with crunching bones and crackling arrows and ringing swords the film has an epic style without epic themes because its great issues are not so much resolved as abruptly magically removed. This may in fact be more an epic love story than anything else. It is that in the backhanded way the 'Odyssey' is a love story because though Temudjin is away from Borte a lot of the time as Odysseus is mostly away from Ithaka and Penelope 'Mongol's' opening sequence gives Borte a primary importance because she as played by Bayertsetseg Erdenebat belonging to another tribe a liberated young woman of the twelfth century isn't chosen by but chooses Temudjin when he's nine years old and she's ten. It's not supposed to be that wayand maybe it wasn't it seems a bit implausible. Temudjin is traveling with his Khan tribal chieftain father Ba Sen on their way to placate another tribe by choosing the boy's wife from their girls. When they don't the father is promptly poisoned by the other tribe. And its leader Targutai Amadu Mamadakov vows to kill Temudjinbut not for a year or so because Mongols don't kill children. Well what Mongols do or don't do seems up for grabs and probably at the time historically Mongol itself must have been a rather vague concept. In fact that is another running theme what's a Mongol? What are their primary values? There is no satisfactory answer though killing and stealing are advanced as major concepts.Surprisingly since not too many are to the right of Genghis Khan and since he succeeds in wiping out all his enemies Temudjin as played as an adult by the imposing Tadanobu Asano is a gentlefaced zenlike fellow who's a strong advocate of fair play. Tadanobu along with the somewhat overhistrionic Chinese actor Honglai Sun as Jamukha his childhood blood brother and eventual arch rival are both impressive. But the real star with some substantial help from computergenerated effects is the vast landscape of steppe snow mountain and sky that dominates many scenes. With effective use of lenses and light the filmmakers have created an epic look and it's this plus the authoritative acting that make this film worth viewingbut only if you like this kind of thing and if you don't mind that you're not going to emerge from it with any historical knowledge. Said to be the first of a trilogy. One will approach the sequels with a certain reserve.Shown as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival AprilMay 2008 and in US theatrical release June 2008.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see the film yesterday eagerly expecting to learn something more about the man who probably was the greatest military and political leader of all times and who is relatively little known in Western Europe and even more so in such a provincial country as Italy. I am aware that one shouldn't expect films to be history essays but then a great film about historical figures should be able to deliver an insight about their motives their ways their personalities their achievements. Given that we are flooded with unnecessary rubbish coming chiefly from the United States sorry Americans both on the big and on the small screen I'm talking about the various History and Discovery channels which are often filled with gross inaccuracies magnified by their horrible and hasty translations from English I was also intrigued by the fact that this was a Russian and German production. Unusual maybe better? Definitely not.I don't know much about the story of the Far East and about Genghis Khan in particular but the film does not fit much to use a euphemism with that little I know and comments by other readers who know definitely more than me Rom Port from Israel for example bear out my suspicions. Now I know why I had never heard before about a Tangut kingdom watching the film I thought it had to be some Chinese state because apparently one such kingdom has never existed on the face of the earth. As far as I know as a kid Temujin was far from the harmless and somewhat pretentious cub depicted in the film he himself killed one of his brothers because the latter had hidden food in order not to share it with the rest of his hungry and beleaguered family. Some of his generals were boiled alive by Jamuka during the internecine wars among the Mongols.What do we see instead? Genghis Khan is some sort of saint as if he like other great statesmen before and after him had not built his power on cruelty and blood sure they were more than just that but that's the stuff REAL history is made of whether we talk about Genghis Khan Alexander the Great Julius Caesar or Napoleon out of ambition and thirst for power justified or not and of course a loving husband a tender father a generous leader and in a way even a devout one all in all some sort of a funny maverick. If he was driven by revenge as the saying in the opening titles seems to suggest he must have shrugged it off pretty soon or hidden it very very well. Jamuka? A vulgar drunk perhaps superficial but definitely not so infamously cruel. Tangutai hope to remember his name well? A vile coward. Borte? A steelwilled and skilful if need be wife. Is that what it takes to become a leader? Hard to believe if you've come of age as much as it is hard to believe that a handful of knights can wreak havoc in a an army several times bigger by just using two swords instead of one if that's strategy then we're talking about Centurion or Risiko but probably not at all about history. Some characters appear and disappear inexplicably first of all Genghis Khan's mother and his father's death looks really stupid. True? Maybe. Plausible? Hardly overall.The film is epic and often fascinating. But the authors take so much arbitrary liberty with fact and history that the film reminds me more of a mixture between The Lord of the Rings and The Gladiator with Genghis Khan as a pretext than of a film based on a real historical figure. Fun to watch but perhaps not so worth spending so much money and time both making it and watching it.I will give Sergei Bodrov a second chance when the time arrives.But on these premises not a third one.".

Some characters appear and disappear inexplicably first of all Genghis Khan's mother and his father's death looks really stupid. True? Maybe. Plausible? Hardly overall.The film is epic and often fascinating. But the authors take so much arbitrary liberty with fact and history that the film reminds me more of a mixture between The Lord of the Rings and The Gladiator with Genghis Khan as a pretext than of a film based on a real historical figure. Fun to watch but perhaps not so worth spending so much money and time both making it and watching it.I will give Sergei Bodrov a second chance when the time arrives.But on these premises not a third one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have always believed that following the original story of Genghis Khan would be the best idea to make a movie about him. Bodrov has come up very eccentric ideas and fantasies about Genghis Khan but it was a total disappointment for me. If you have read the Secret History of the Mongols you would easily get my point. That book is the most relevant historical writing about his life excluding some mythical elements. The stories around Genghis Khan are amazing as his whole life was a struggle from a poor boy to one of the greatest and probably the most successful conquerors in world history. Then Bodrov comes up with some totally strange ideas like Genghis Khan in Tangud prison or Jamukha selling him as a slave.Historically it is a complete mess. I assume the last battle is the one when Jamukha in aliance with Naiman's Buyurug Khan Oirats Merkits and Taichuts after declaring himself as Gur Khan fought against Genghis Khan and Tooril Khan at Khuiten. There is a story that Buyurag Khan could cause some bad weather but it the storm actually came on them and they retreated as feared that the Heaven's will was against them. Bodrov probably used this story. It was not a decisive battle between Genghis and Jamukha as they fought against each other a couple times more Battle at Muu Undur and battle at Nahu Gun.Recommended for those who are not interested in history.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well before the film ended I was looking at my watch in order to see how much more I had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes about a dozen of them all more or less interchangeable and plot development.One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world plotting would have been relatively easy. There's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. However the writers fluffed it completely. We get no real history. We get instead a Hollywood version of history.What sustains young Temudjin through his long  almost endless actually or so they seem to the viewer  tribulations? Why the love of a good woman of course.How does he get out of prison? Well an old monk who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises Temudjin's love for her dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there talisman in his hand. And of course she then goes and having inexplicably become rich and powerful rescues him.How does he escape from the shackles? Well he goes off to the shrine of the great wolfgod Tengri or some such name and Tengri sets him free by magic. Yeah right.Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols? The wolfgod again apparently. Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance and  surprise! surprise!  he gets it. Laws he says to himself. What the Mongols need are laws. Good simple ones. Golly it was impressive.And then finally how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? Better tactics certainly but also through the aid of the good old wolfgod again who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes Mongols are scared of thunder you see  but not our Temudjin. The troops completely wowed by his bravery acclaim him king! I don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. The funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism lots of slurping of milk dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.There's heaps of violence in graphic closeup slashings impalings spouts of blood sprays of blood clouds of blood  the blood guys had a great time actually. Despite the realism it's impossible to take seriously.I must mention the ludicrous CGI final battle scene. How anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style  breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery and the supercloseup Stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. And the standard Dolby supersoundeffects of whumps and thumps and the constant lowfrequency hum to sustain tension.Tedious.Avoid.".

There's nothing I can say.I won't get into those arguments. But what about the movie? It's beautiful! Technically it's impressive. I was shocked by the beauty of the landscapes all of which are actually located in Mongolia. I was also very impressed by the lack of advertisement here in France. And all the actors???? WoW. There is no bad acting in this movie and this friends is quite rare! What about Borte his wife?? No info on this actress although she's the only one speaking really mongolian stunning actress stunning beauty on screen. Tadanobu Asano and Hongley Sun are HUGE actors. Sun especially. Fighting scenes are well shot no backflips and headkicks  I was expecting something as epic as Jet Li's Hero and I was relieved and amazed to see it was not the case. I loved this movie and I'm really waiting for the next one...".

	schema:headline " Memorable Photography Highlights Story Of 'Temudjin'";
	schema:reviewBody "The most pleasing part of this film I thought was the excellent cinematography. Kudos to Roger Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov for an outstanding job photographing this movie making the most bleak of landscapes look stunning many times and adding some wonderful closeup shots of objects and faces.It's not a bad story either although not one that will keep you riveted to the screen for the full two hours. However I wasn't bored either although some of the action scenes looked too repetitive with very hokeylooking specialeffects concerning blood splashing out of people in the battle scenes. It did not look real but as if it were drawn. It's ironic in that the production values seem to be so high with a such a nicelyfilmed effort yet the action scenes are staged like a Bmovie.In a nutshell this is the story of how Genghis Kahn who is Temudjin throughout the movie spent his tough early life and how he became the famous warrior. We just see how many hardships the man endured to become who he was later in life. He was never referred to as Genghis Kahn which I learned hear is a title more than a name. That must have come later after he had control of all the Mongol armies which is where the film ends.Many times it's a not a pleasant existence for Temudjin who was marked man from the age of nine. We see him spend many lonely hours held captive in different places. The looks on his face are memorable. Odnyam Odsuren ad the young Temudjin and Tadanobu Asano as the adult Temudjin both had extraordinarily photographic faces.One of the few problems I had with the movie were understanding the rest of the story as certain scenes ended abruptly leaving me and I assume other viewers wondering what happened? His friends though were fun to watch and his bride was a beautiful kind and strong woman as pictured in this movie. Actually I found this just as much of a love story as a war epic and the romance angle was far more dramatic. The devotion the lead male and female had to each other and the faithfulness and loyalty were inspiring to say the least.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was looking forward to seeing Mongol after viewing several trailers and reading in the press about the hundreds of extras drafted in to populate the battle scenes and the relative lack of CGI by modern standards. This sounded like epic film making of the old school and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed! Sweeping panoramas of stunning scenery hundreds of horses galloping across the Steppes tales of honour enslavement freedom and revenge a charismatic warrior and the beautiful woman he loved. This is a relatively traditional style of film made by a director with a grand vision a talented and charismatic cast virtually unknown in the West and a subject  Genghis Khan  of whom we have all heard but who lived long enough ago for fact and fiction to have melded allowing the film makers a fair amount of poetic license. I loved it!I'm not even going to pretend that I know much about the historical accuracy of this film. A quick look online at an internet encyclopedia itself an occasionally unreliable source suggested to me that the essential details were pretty correct times places names the basic plot outlines all seemed to fit with the known facts. The film directed by Russian Sergei Bodrov covers the early formative years of Genghis Khan's life illustrating how he rose to power by uniting the warring clans of Central Asia and essentially forging Mongolia into a nation before heading outwards to conquer further afield. He and his descendants would conquer the largest empire in history stretching from northern Asia to eastern Europe and south into the Middle East. The Mongolians were a tough nomadic pastoral people whose lives revolved entirely around their horses. Lightly armoured highly mobile well trained and armed mostly with bows they were an unbeatable foe at the time. But this is not a history documentary it is a work of fiction woven around some basic known facts and should be viewed as such.Setting off to pick a bride from a rival tribe the Merkits with whom his clanchief father must make peace young Temujin as he was then called instead picks a bride Borte from a friendly neighbouring tribe thus setting off a chain of events which result in his father being poisoned his own clan ousting him as heir and his family being cast out. Forced to flee for their lives and live a solitary existence led by his resourceful mother Tamujin and his siblings become tough even by the tough standards of nomadic Mongolian twelfth century life. Found near dead in the snow by a youth from another clan Jamuka they become blood brothers a relationship which will impact him later in positive and negative ways. Jamuka assists Tamujin in rescuing Borte when she is kidnapped but later they find themselves on opposing sides.After a long period of enslavement and separation from Borte Tamujin returns to the beautiful but harsh Mongolian plains where he succeeds in uniting the diverse and warring clans and setting in place some basic concepts of law. It's easy to view history from our own perspective of a comfortable life and label such warriors as bloodthirsty. But I suspect that Genghis Khan as he would be known eventually was well ahead of his time. He apparently accepted as his own children two offspring of Borte children whose paternity was wide open to speculation after Borte had been kidnapped and he set in place rules about the fair division of spoils and punishment of disloyalty.I thought the cinematography was excellent and among the actors I especially liked Tadanobu Asano as adult Temujin. I've seen him described as the Japanese Johnny Depp but personally I think the guy could be a huge star worldwide without necessitating any comparisons. He has charisma by the bucket load. Also stand out were Khulan Chuluun as adult Borte she seems to be a complete newcomer and Sun HongLei as adult Jamukha. It's a multinational cast of hundreds. I can only imagine that filming must have been a logistics nightmare! My only slight criticism is that the story is light on the mechanics of his rise to power concentrating far more on his interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take itself too seriously and never lapses too far into melodrama.View this as a sweeping piece of story telling based loosely on some facts and enjoy it at that level. I'm looking forward to the next part already. Great entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A tremendous historical epic pray for a sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Mongol is a film about the trials of Temudjin the young man who became Genghis Khan ruler of Mongolia and a great Eurasian empire. Although born heir to the Khanate Temudjin loses his father at the age of nine and undergoes a terrible ordeal in the next two decades of his life being hunted imprisoned and narrowly escaping death on a number of occasions. He remains stoical and resilient through the most terrible of hardships including being placed in shackles as a young boy whilst execution hangs over his head.Alongside these trials of misery there develops a moving love story. Just before his father's death the nineyearold Temudjin chose Borte a young girl from a neighbouring tribe to be his future bride. After repeated escape and recapture the grownup Temudjin comes back to claim his bride. Throughout the continuing hardship that follows Borte and Temudjin remain steadfast to one another.When Borte is captured by the Merkits a hostile tribe of maskwearing warriors Temudjin looks for assistance to rescue her from their clutches. This introduces us to his brother Jamukha. Drunken garrulous and theatrical Jamukha is a showstealing presence and later becomes the almost comicbook villain whom Temudjin must defeat to become Khan of Mongolia.The dialogue in Mongol is spare and one senses that some subtlety has been lost in translation. Yet it is the landscapes and the incredible action sequences that make this film such a success. The cinematography is simply brilliant drinking in the breathtaking Mongolian landscape with its vast green plains soaring mountain peaks and unending expanses of thick winter snow. Erratic weather causes sudden torrents of rainfall and when fork lightning and thunderclaps rupture the sky you can understand why the Mongolians worship a God of the sky. The brutal medieval battles are among the many highlights culminating in the great clash between Temudjin and Jamukha's armies which hinges on a dramatic intervention.Sergei Bodrov's film is fascinating for its observation of Mongolian customs and the respect that these were accorded at the time. The offerings exchanged by travellers the wrestling the nomadic way of life all of these feel remarkably authentic. Many Mongolians have criticised the use of nonMongolian actors to play most of the major parts claiming that the accents sound ridiculously out of place but this is not something that will affect Western ears. I am also a big fan of Tuomas Kantelinen's soundtrack a combination of orchestral score chanting and some modern rock and electronic touches.Mongol has also been criticised for the overwhelmingly sympathetic portrayal of the man reckoned by many to be one of the great massmurderers. The film is apparently based on a thirteenthcentury Mongolian account of the Khan's early life which helps to explain director Sergei Bodrov's lessthanimpartial treatment of his subject but I can understand the unapologetic tone of the film the first in a projected trilogy this is a film about Temudjin's rise to power a battle against tremendous odds which surely deserves some sympathetic treatment. I can only hope that Bodrov is willing to acknowledge the darker chapters of Temudjin's life when shooting the sequels. Hopefully it will not take another four years to ready part two of this brilliant saga.".

Well the horses looked Mongolian and the camels but that's about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh Borte is played by a Mongolian actress albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.But I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact there was hardly any story at all just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in Mongolian clothes speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like Mongolian. Most actors were either Japanese Russian or Chinese most scenes were shot in China Kazakhstan or Russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a Mongolian. The dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. The battle scenes are laughable. All the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy soft stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.And I don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. To see Chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave to see his two first kids be born from other men to see his wife selling herself to the Tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? One could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? Of his childhood of his relationship with his family with his brothers of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is Van khan who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe of the life of the nomads of their traditions of their relations with the other nations around them?Where is development of the characters? We totally fail to see what brought Temujin together with Jamukha and what brought them apart and most important how Temujin became Chinggiskhan how he an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in Bodrov's creation not even a glimpse.".

Plot line focused well on all primary life points. I was in the satisfied state during all 2h of the film. The one thing why not 10 of 10 is that battles too small and too short. It could be better if there were at least 2 times more of the battles. So the question is to watch or not to watch?. My answer Yes! Specially for Russianspoken peoples.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a gorgeous movie with great photography filmed in breathtaking locations. Since Mongols had no written language and no one was taking notes while Temudgin or Temujin was alive. Thus most of his early life is just mere speculation so I cannot complain about the director's interpretation of Tedmudgin's younger years or the importance he places in the role of his wife Borte or Bortei. We know next to nothing about this early period of Temudgin's life. The most important written source The Secret History of the Mongols was penned at least 14 years after his death. Hence Truth and Fiction are intrinsically intertwined for ever . . .Although I tried to overlooked them the following is a list of inaccuracies that really bugged me 1 In the film the actors use European HORSES not Mongolian ponies because the latter are much harder to ride. Well that is what accomplished extras and stuntmen are for.2 Mongols shaved most of their head to avoid lice. They retained some patches of hair in their forehead but that's about it. Most have ponytails at the back of their heads. In the film most actors did not shave their heads.3 Mongols did not wear beards also to avoid lice. They did wear long thin mustaches. In the film most actors including the protagonist wear beards.4 An important percentage of Mongols displayed ritual scars on their cheeks as proof of manhood. In the film we don't see these scars. Bad aesthetics?? 5 Mongols used very elaborated composite bows capable of shooting an arrow up to 500 yards. The bows used in this film did not have the distinctive shape of the composite arrows. Worse in the film the Merkits use crappy bows.6 Mongols hardly ever engaged in close combat with swords much less on foot. As the great riders they were Mongols only dismounted from their horses when they had no other choice.It is interesting to see this entertaining movie in conjunction with Discovery Channel's impressive documentary on the life of Genghis Khan.".

The sweep is epic but the emphasis is on character.Only Gladiator's Maximus Russell Crowe comes to mind for recent depictions of complicated warriors and maybe William WallaceMel Gibsonfrom Braveheart.As he did in the mystical Bear's Kiss Bodrov succeeds in having it both ways humanity on display through the arcs of dynamic characters and inhumanity exposed with a backdrop of life's big issues and the tyranny of fate and death. Peppered with the mystical paganism such as the fear of thunder as a manifestation of God Mongol seems to treat almost every important part of 12th13th century barbarian life. The quotidian is just as interesting as the sublimewitness the importance of securing a wife with strong legs both for following a husband and making love. Although misogynistic the society protects and reveres its wives as precious commodities.From costumes to climate Bodrov catches the visual beauty of Central Asia its unforgiving terrain and the fierce warrior Mongols who could at any time choose whom to follow and did.Despite the epic nature of the film I was just as moved by the young nineyear old selecting his bride with the wisdom and her help of a worldclass leader. Bodrov doesn't overplay the potential greatness he just accentuates the lad's common sense and reservoir of love. Bodrov doesn't so much create an oversized hero as he depicts a gifted man with a vision of how Mongols should act according to laws simple ones that he could create. And did.".

The filmmaker Sergei Bondrov decided to stop just before we get to the really meaty juicy notorious parts of his days. This isn't a flaw but the design of the story and in this design to give us the rise to power of Khan here known as Temudjin which was his real name delivers a story lush with the ferocity of a bloody powerful epic that harkons back to Gladiator and Braveheart only with a little more 'umph' in dealing with the subject of the barbaric period. In the midst of what are described as being nothing but murderers and thieves there's someone who has such a strong code of honor that he never leaves or forsakes his wife whom he chose at the age of nine.If one were to judge and I will for a bit the Genghis Khan of this film is so honorable in fact that he doesn't mind that he's made a cuckold by his wife and that he raises children that aren't even his at least one of them anyway. And he lives by such a code that is unspoken that his character as depicted here is among the most honorable and heroic of the classic epicmovie hero of this caliber. But taking apart this strange choice Bondrov could have just made him a total pig Mongol comes off braver and helpful in realizing the epic scope of the project which apparently isn't finished yet. Thankfully not the choice of actor Asano Tadanobu is inspired and just right as he's an actor who can portray Temudjin as likable but also appropriately savage and badass where need be. He's a trublu warrior and he fills the shoes wonderfully. As do many other cast members in their parts I don't remember many of the names but the one who shaves his head and cruelly runs Mongolia is very good.What impresses most and what should hopefully make Mongol something of a mustsee on DVD when most Americans can watch it is that it fulfills the quasigenre requirements of a sweeping heartpounding bigname historical drama without relying too heavily on CGI the last battle sequence is the only one that uses it extensively using the locations to put one in the place of the period to a T summoning some eerie musical accompaniments and the director a promising professional who isn't afraid to keep the pace of the timeline over the years with the story. For the most part everything clicks which is more than can be said of some of the recent historical actiondramas Troy and 300 however extreme comparisons as examples. Bottom line can't wait for the sequel to get some serious carnage going on!".

Most of the information you'll absorb is just fiction. The details of Temujin's early career and the culture and costumes of the Mongol nomads are wildly embellished here. The filmmakers are obviously capitalizing on the fact that most westerners know very little about Mongolian history and are presenting a fantasy view of it. This movie teaches you as much about real 12th century Mongolians as 300 taught you about real ancient Persians. Enjoy the spectacle but take the history with a grain of salt.But anyone who is encouraged to learn more should check out an old BBC documentary miniseries called Storm From the East. It covers the whole Mongol empire in plenty of detail.".

	onyx:emotionText "Enjoyable as art but don't leave this movie thinking you've learned all that much about Genghis Khan or Mongolia during that period. Most of the information you'll absorb is just fiction. The details of Temujin's early career and the culture and costumes of the Mongol nomads are wildly embellished here. The filmmakers are obviously capitalizing on the fact that most westerners know very little about Mongolian history and are presenting a fantasy view of it. This movie teaches you as much about real 12th century Mongolians as 300 taught you about real ancient Persians. Enjoy the spectacle but take the history with a grain of salt.But anyone who is encouraged to learn more should check out an old BBC documentary miniseries called Storm From the East. It covers the whole Mongol empire in plenty of detail.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't normally bother to write any reviews for films I have watched. But after reading some of the reviews of imbeciles who CLEARLY missed the point of Dabangg I felt compelled to add my two cents.Firstly to all those people who are bashing Dabangg because it's action scenes are over the top or it can't decide whether it's an action filmcomedydrama etc........here's a thought.....do you think maybe just MAYBE that was the whole point in the first place?? This is generally the problem with the nouveau Indian cinema goers of the multiplex era. They will happily watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard 4 bring down a helicopter with a taxi cab. They will applaud when Jason Statham drives a car off a bridge and lands it perfectly on to a moving truck in The Transporter. They will not bat an eyelid when Pierce Brosnan drives around in an invisible car in Die Another Day. Uma Thurman single handedly killing a hundred Chinese assassins with a sword in Kill Bill? Sure that can happen. And a very good movie from Tarantino they might say. But GOD FORBID that any Indian movie has action scenes where the hero launches a guy in front of a speeding train and pulls him back just before the train smashes into him. NOOOOOOO!!!! they will scream. That is so stupid! they will say. Where is the REALISM? they will exclaim. A bunch of HYPOCRITES if you ask me! I mean honestly any person who expects a serious and realistic action film after the first scene in Dabangg where the two main character's names are established as Chulbul and Makkhi and after seeing the trailers of the film no less is quite frankly a moron of the highest order. Dabangg is a film which doesn't take itself seriously for a single second which already makes it FAR superior and a more honest effort than the overhyped Ghajini that took itself ridiculously seriously while at the same time offering NOTHING new. It is what it is a complete nobrainer masala film. And tell me what is wrong with that? Reading some of the reviews here about how Dabangg is taking the Hindi Film Industry backwards you would think that other film industries all over the world just churn out serious films all the time. NEWSFLASH! They don't as you can see from the list above. Then there are complaints about how some action scenes are copied from Western films namely Salman's opening scene resembling Transporter second NEWSFLASH! Hollywood copies A LOT of it's action scenes from Hong Kong and Chinese cinema all the time. But do you complain about that? Of course you don't. Because you are either ignorant or as said before hypocritical. As long as the scene is done well who cares if it's copied from another film? Dabangg sets it's stall out very early on in the proceedings and it has a fabulous kitsch appeal to it. Salman Khan bites into his role with relish and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing Inspector Chulbul Pandey. This material in the hands of other actors might have gone down in flames but Salman grabs the film by the scruff of it's neck and runs with it. Make no mistake about it this film is a oneman show and luckily for us Salman carries it off with lan. He plays the role of Chulbul with just the right amount of selfmockery the type of which Shahrukh Khan was aiming for in Om Shanti Om but failed miserably at. There are moans about how actors like Om Puri and Anupam Kher aren't given enough scope but who cares? Like I said before this film really doesn't require brilliant performances from secondary characters. Character development is not the agenda here. However it has to be said that dbutant Sonakshi Sinha does perform very well in her smallish role.Bottom line if you are expecting an intelligent and realistic action thriller like any of the Jason Bourne series then avoid Debangg at all costs. With that sort of mindset you are sure to be disappointed. BUT if you are in the mood for an old fashioned masala movie in the mould of films such as Die Hard 4 Kung Fu Hustle and Desperado then you are in for a treat. Just sit back relax accept the film for what it is a pure popcorn and purposefully OTT flick and let Salman Khan entertain you.".

It's silly it's ridiculous it's mad it lacks a real storyline but it's so much fun. The movie has great action sequences fantastic music an allstar cast but more than anything it has Salman Khan who totally delivers in a role that is a caricature of his own image. That's Chulbul Pandey hands down. He's carefree he's corrupt he's cruel he's tough he's cool he's got a good heart and he's dabangg fearless. He practically encompasses everything that Salman Khan is known for and the actor wonderfully displays this fun mixture onscreen to create a role he will definitely be remembered for. In many portions Dabangg works because it's unintentionally hilarious and the funniest thing about it lies in the fact that it was actually the intention and that's what makes it so terribly entertaining. And then it has several moments of drama and they somehow manage to work. In a few words Dabangg is one of the rarest of it kind and is one of the best bad movies of recent years.

He can't stand his stepbrother Makhi Arbaaz Khan and detests the dubious Cheedi Singh Sonu Sood. But when Cheedi tries to put Makhi against Chulbul for his personal gains the brothers unite to fight back Cheedi.Try to find a novel storyline and there is none in Dabangg.

As much as Chulbul Pandey tries to hide his tears behind his sunglasses the film tries to camouflage its conventional storytelling behind Salman's style.Chulbul Pandey Salman Khan is a totally fearless but corrupt police officer with unorthodox working methods. He can't stand his stepbrother Makhi Arbaaz Khan and detests the dubious Cheedi Singh Sonu Sood. But when Cheedi tries to put Makhi against Chulbul for his personal gains the brothers unite to fight back Cheedi.Try to find a novel storyline and there is none in Dabangg. Try to find Salman Khan and there is nothing else.";

And fortunately 'Dabangg' lives up to it's gargantuan expectations!Let me get this straight 'Dabangg' is no pathbreaking lifechanging cinema. It has an outdated story which worked big time back in the 1980's but it's presentation  execution is mindblowing. This one's an outandout mass entertainer with perfect direction clapworthy dialouge Marvelous Action Meldious Music  Salman like never before! 'Dabangg' starts with a bang slips in the middle but picks up big time in the final 30minutes. The climax is bombastic it's kickass  worth whistling. One more thing that works for this film is that it's not a violent experience. It has loads of Action but there's hardly any bloodshed.Abhinav's direction is perfect. The Screenplay is MassMeant it has Action Romance Comedy  little bit Melodrama. Cinematography is satisfactory. Stunts are marvelous. The Music is a chartbuster! In the acting department Salman is the life of the show. As Chulbul Pandey he performs fearlessly  leaves you in awe of him. Chulbul Pandey is sure to go down as a legendary character. Sonu Sood is another topper. He excels as the conniving villain. Sonakshi makes a good debut. Dimple is wonderful in a brief role. Arbaaz Khan is decent. Vinod Khanna is able. Om Puri is wasted. Ditto for Anupam Kher. Mahesh Manjrekar is good. Tinnu Anand is effective. Mahi Gill is casual.On the whole The Legend of Chulbul Pandey is worth your time and money. A Fearless Thumbs Up!".

Well I wonder how many movies they copied from. Mmmmm Inglourious Basterds Matrix Desperado Planet Terror The Transporter Sherlock Holmes The Dark Knight Romeo must Die District B 13 Kill Bill of what I know and etc etc. There is no character development and they have not tried to characterize any other character than Chulbul Pandey's. Dialogs are pathetic for me. There is no scene where I could laugh. Action scenes are much more pathetic and its foolish to say that why can't we like such scenes in bollywood if we like such mindless action in Hollywood movies. The answer is simple they are screened with perfection making them realistic with efficient direction. Abhinav Kashyap here simply tries to grab the style of Tarantino and place it exactly over his project but he even could not do that. Sonakshi Sinha has nothing to do with the movie and it would not have mattered at all if they removed her completely. She should at least learn to speak the dialogs if she's been given two or so. There is practically no script involved and its like someone wrote a story in childhood over which they tried to make a movie.Especially the climax is where you'll wanna bang your head. On whole the movie is below average. Songs are nice and are onlysavior. It got the hype of Salman and became a blockbuster. Obviously Salman fans must love it but others stay away from it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Due to his hallmark of unorthodox meaningful and adroitly narrated movies Anurag Kashyap would've exiled to Rajasthan's deserts to bury his head in shame after watching his younger brother's entertainerforthemasses  'Dabangg'. While the film goes against the tide of new age cinema it does one thing better than most films. It entertains. With overthetop sequences exaggerated circumstances incredulous action and Salman Khan at its helm Dabangg not only explodes with its outlandish style to entertain but garners more money than all of Anurag's films combined.One look at Salman's entry in the film and you know what's in store for you. No superhero can walk like him pack a punch like him or jump over obstacles in one breath. This is Inspector Chulbul Pandey in the hinterland of U.P where the lawless land is a haven for the corrupt. Regardless of his weird mannerisms of placing sunglasses on the back collar his silly expressions or the brashness under his kindest self Pandeyji is unmistakably charming. He will tend to let himself loose at times by dancing to Wanted's ring tone that plays on a sidekick's cell phone while he's about to beat the life out of him. Try controlling your laughter at that point. Dabangg draws much of its strength from a screenplay that keeps the action rolling with Salman's presence seldom missed. Witty dialogs in Bhojpuri add the most to the fun element while Salman's rendering of them will leave you craving for more. Director Abhinav Kashyap puts Salman Khan in Rajnikant's shoes in action sequences while the film's setting in U.P gives it a grand scope to explore the bhojpuri realm and take advantage of it for entertainment through dialogs and characters. Although the plot is dead simple it still has enough juice in it to keep its momentum going with action romance comedy and Salman's screen presence. There is something about Salman's performance here that may not necessarily be charismatic but it engages you enough to make you whistle even in a multiplex although this is totally a G7 or Chandan movie. This is Sunny Deol on drugs and Rajnikant revamped for Bollywood. Dabangg is different from 'Wanted' yet similar in Salman's prowess against adversaries. The music by SajidWajidLalit is hummable with Tere Mast Mast and full of masti with Munni Badnaam and Humka Peeni hai. Reminiscent of 'Omkara's title song is Hud Hud Dabangg with excellent cinematography. Salman in all these songs is a charmer and looks to be enjoying the filming completely. There is no choreography. Just some drinks on thehouse. As the unstoppable Machoman Salman Khan excels in action sequences. He is of course known to be stiff and it becomes very apparent while he is dancing but it is fun to watch no doubt when he lets loose in most songs and just goes wild. Delivering bhojpuri dialogs threats and romanticism Salman Khan earns your whistling and hooting. Wanted and Dabangg both would've been catastrophic flops if it weren't for Salman reinventing himself. Here he doesn't look like he is out to prove that point. Most of the time you can see him simply enjoying himself. Arbaaz Khan is passable but could've been sillier to add to the fun as Makhi. Om Puri Vinod Khanna and Anupam Kher in cameos were superlative while Mahesh Manjrekar delivered a shockingly good performance as a drunkard father. Sonu Sood has been better in 'Jodha Akbar' but he is quite adequate as Chulbul Pandey's adversary. Newcomer Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful can put up a straight face pretty well and can compete well against her contemporaries. It goes without saying that Dabangg was never going to be an intellectual enricher. This is pure flawed entertainment and that is how it needs to be enjoyed. The action seems like a spoof of our southern counterparts and therefore is fun to watch. Dialogues however rude at times 'haraamzade se yaad aaya aapke sasur kaise hai?' are thoroughly laugh worthy and the sensational cinematography around Salman's entry at various points in the film augments his heroism. Considering these factors Dabangg offers tremendous value for money and is no surprise that it opened to such an overwhelming response. Nevertheless this is not going to be a revolution in Bollywood but just a passing tide and it better remain that way. If you have read this all the way and have now decided to go watch it then it should suffice to say..... Kamaal karte ho Pandeyji...! 8.279 on a scale of 110.".

If you have read this all the way and have now decided to go watch it then it should suffice to say..... Kamaal karte ho Pandeyji...! 8.279 on a scale of 110.";

I know there are a lot of cheezy fight sequences and silly dance steps but it was fun to see Salman in it.Camera work was really good. Nice brown and reds throughout the film..I did not like the cameraworkArtwork of Salman's previous film WANTED because it looked too colorful..these kinds of movies need to bring down the color..Story is very weak but directions takes over. The movie is only 2 hours 8 min. so definitely no boring scenes..I recommend this film for one and all. Have a Blast!!".

If we compare Dabangg with Salman's previous movie's where he played role of a cop 'Garv' or 'Wanted' the movie can not stay a sec in front of them. Effort of Anurag Kashyap to make Dabangg is better than Salman's earlier movie wanted is failed and also failed to reveal themselves as a good director. If we talk about the story then every story has some kind of secret and if secret is revealed then all the fun of movie is spoiled. But in Dabangg we missed a secret in story behind that all characters of movie running. Stunts of movie do not relate with reality it shows that Salman is some kind of super hero having supernatural Powers and some of action scene's are copied from other Hollywood movies. when we talking about dialog's the movie doesn't give any single hit dialog as we found in 'Wanted' that Once I have made commitment after that I can not change for my own. Some of characters of movie are wasted as Dayal BabuAnupam KherPrajapati PandeyVinod Khanna  Mahesh Manjerekar.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Abhinav Kashyap puts Salman Khan in Rajnikant's shoes in action sequences while the film's setting in U.P gives it a grand scope to explore the bhojpuri realm and take advantage of it for entertainment through dialogs and characters. Although the plot is dead simple it still has enough juice in it to keep its momentum going with action romance comedy and Salman's screen presence. There is something about Salman's performance here that may not necessarily be charismatic but it engages you enough to make you whistle even in a multiplex although this is totally a G7 or Chandan movie. This is Sunny Deol on drugs and Rajnikant revamped for Bollywood. Dabangg is different from 'Wanted' yet similar in Salman's prowess against adversaries. The music by SajidWajidLalit is hummable with Tere Mast Mast and full of masti with Munni Badnaam and Humka Peeni hai. Reminiscent of 'Omkara's title song is Hud Hud Dabangg with excellent cinematography. Salman in all these songs is a charmer and looks to be enjoying the filming completely. There is no choreography. Just some drinks on the house. As the unstoppable Machoman Salman Khan excels in action sequences. He is of course known to be stiff and it becomes very apparent while he is dancing but it is fun to watch no doubt when he lets loose in most songs and just goes wild. Delivering bhojpuri dialogs threats and romanticism Salman Khan earns your whistling and hooting. Wanted and Dabangg both would've been catastrophic flops if it weren't for Salman reinventing himself. Here he doesn't look like he is out to prove that point. Most of the time you can see him simply enjoying himself. Arbaaz Khan is passable but could've been sillier to add to the fun as Makhi. Om Puri Vinod Khanna and Anupam Kher in cameos were superlative while Mahesh Manjrekar delivered a shockingly good performance as a drunkard father. Sonu Sood has been better in 'Jodha Akbar' but he is quite adequate as Chulbul Pandey's adversary. Newcomer Sonakshi Sinha looks beautiful can put up a straight face pretty well and can compete well against her contemporaries. It goes without saying that Dabangg was never going to be an intellectual enricher. This is pure flawed entertainment and that is how it needs to be enjoyed. The action seems like a spoof of our southern counterparts and therefore is fun to watch. Dialogues however rude at times 'haraamzade se yaad aaya aapke sasur kaise hai?' are thoroughly laugh worthy and the sensational cinematography around Salman's entry at various points in the film augments his heroism. Considering these factors Dabangg offers tremendous value for money and is no surprise that it opened to such an overwhelming response. Nevertheless this is not going to be a revolution in Bollywood but just a passing tide and it better remain that way.".

	schema:reviewBody "EXPECTATIONS  Just log on to any Ticket Booking Site and you will get the answer. Maximum shows of this weekend is houseful already. After the path breaking success of WANTED last year nobody's gonna miss Salman Khan at his macho best this year. The stylish promos have also influenced the public for this flick. After 3 Idiots and Khan This one was the most expected movie this year and nobody would have give a damn to miss this one. And If I come to Sallu fans no wonder they may see this movie again and again the same day after watching the first show.Good And Bad  The fight between them was a common plot in 60's to 80's. It used to entertain the viewers when Good almost defeated Bad but Bad abruptly strikes against Good but at last Good wins. This grown up to masala movies at a time by adding Comedy Romance Emotional Scenes etc. etc. in it. Bollywood recalls that genre again this decade in a fully masaledaar manner in assistance with Salman as The Symbol Of Good  Tough.Ghajini Wanted A Wednesday etc. are the masterpieces this century representing the SocialAction genre. Dabangg brings back the macho feel in bollywood long time after where Action holds no bar and Dialogues no limit. Dabangg is the type that will make the college gores dance whistle shout clap and also present the other audiences two hour of complete fun ride with excessive good dialogues distinctive action sequences and peculiar scenes of which some contain enjoyable humor.The story revolves around Laalgunj Uttar PradeshWhich is said Lawless in the trailer where crime politics and socialism is at one place and police government administration is at the other place. Here in Laalgunj Prajapati Pandey is the head of PANDEY Family where his own son Makhanchand PandeyArbaaz Khan Wife Naini PandeyDimple Kapadia and his step son the extraordinary being of the family Inspector DabanggFearlessChulbul PandeySalman Khan are the members. Chulbul never liked his stepfather and stepbrother which was unlikable for his mother. His mother was the only reason he lives in the same house with his step ones. When Naini died Chulbul was thrown out of his house. Meanwhile his love interest RajoSonakshi Sinha and he got married and were hopefully living happily in Chulbul's government given house when Chhedi SinghSonu Sood supporter of MLA DayalAnupam Kher  his troops were desperate to demolish Chulbul. The Fight between Good  Bad starts here which passes through many depressive  heroic moments.In an action movie a Hero always steals the eyeballs but in Dabangg separately everyone delivered a commendable performance. Arabaaz as MakkhiChulbul's Bro Sonu as Chhedi Singh and Dimple Kapadia in a small role of Chulbul and Makkhi's mother deserve appreciation. Meanwhile Sonakshi as a Debutant was allover fare and did a well job in her sweet soundless and unimportant role.Younger brother of famous and appreciated director Anurag Kashyap The director of the movie Abhinav Singh Kashyap deserves great applause for embodying his and Dileep Shukla's fully masalamaarke story. The Dramatic  emotional scenes were handled quite well when he tried his best to avoid overdrama in some places. Action by R.

	onyx:emotionText "EXPECTATIONS  Just log on to any Ticket Booking Site and you will get the answer. Maximum shows of this weekend is houseful already. After the path breaking success of WANTED last year nobody's gonna miss Salman Khan at his macho best this year. The stylish promos have also influenced the public for this flick. After 3 Idiots and Khan This one was the most expected movie this year and nobody would have give a damn to miss this one. And If I come to Sallu fans no wonder they may see this movie again and again the same day after watching the first show.Good And Bad  The fight between them was a common plot in 60's to 80's. It used to entertain the viewers when Good almost defeated Bad but Bad abruptly strikes against Good but at last Good wins. This grown up to masala movies at a time by adding Comedy Romance Emotional Scenes etc. etc. in it. Bollywood recalls that genre again this decade in a fully masaledaar manner in assistance with Salman as The Symbol Of Good  Tough.Ghajini Wanted A Wednesday etc. are the masterpieces this century representing the SocialAction genre. Dabangg brings back the macho feel in bollywood long time after where Action holds no bar and Dialogues no limit. Dabangg is the type that will make the college gores dance whistle shout clap and also present the other audiences two hour of complete fun ride with excessive good dialogues distinctive action sequences and peculiar scenes of which some contain enjoyable humor.The story revolves around Laalgunj Uttar PradeshWhich is said Lawless in the trailer where crime politics and socialism is at one place and police government administration is at the other place. Here in Laalgunj Prajapati Pandey is the head of PANDEY Family where his own son Makhanchand PandeyArbaaz Khan Wife Naini PandeyDimple Kapadia and his step son the extraordinary being of the family Inspector DabanggFearlessChulbul PandeySalman Khan are the members. Chulbul never liked his stepfather and stepbrother which was unlikable for his mother. His mother was the only reason he lives in the same house with his step ones. When Naini died Chulbul was thrown out of his house. Meanwhile his love interest RajoSonakshi Sinha and he got married and were hopefully living happily in Chulbul's government given house when Chhedi SinghSonu Sood supporter of MLA DayalAnupam Kher  his troops were desperate to demolish Chulbul. The Fight between Good  Bad starts here which passes through many depressive  heroic moments.In an action movie a Hero always steals the eyeballs but in Dabangg separately everyone delivered a commendable performance. Arabaaz as MakkhiChulbul's Bro Sonu as Chhedi Singh and Dimple Kapadia in a small role of Chulbul and Makkhi's mother deserve appreciation. Meanwhile Sonakshi as a Debutant was allover fare and did a well job in her sweet soundless and unimportant role.Younger brother of famous and appreciated director Anurag Kashyap The director of the movie Abhinav Singh Kashyap deserves great applause for embodying his and Dileep Shukla's fully masalamaarke story. The Dramatic  emotional scenes were handled quite well when he tried his best to avoid overdrama in some places. Action by R. Vijayan was fantastic in a word because it holds many sequences that will make the viewers wow at places. Dialogues which are also a element to take care of in a action entertainer had a newness and hardcore attitude in it which will be greatly greeted by Claps And Whistles by the audience especially Hum Tum Mein Itne Chhed...

The actions sequences of the movie are remarkably done in South Indian movies style just like before in Salman Khan's super block buster movie Wanted. The End fight between Salman Khan  Sonu Sood is simply outstanding. Salman Khan has rocked the new Avatar and showed how immensely entertaining he has become over the time. From his first movie till Dabangg he has shocked us with great roles and performances and Dabangg is surely one of the best performances of his career. I loved every part of the movie sometimes it's better to watch plain full on fun movie rather than smart and clever ones. Salman Khan is the soul of the movie and he is stronger than ever. New comer Sonakshi Sinha is really gorgeous though she doesn't have much dialogue still she impresses. Suno Sood is always delightful to watch immensely talented actor and finally getting his due though in negative or supporting roles but still really strong ones. Dimple Kapadia is first rate simply Amazing. Arbaaz Khan Vinod Khanna and Mahie Gill are fine. The music of the movie is enjoyable and two songs stand out. Salman  Sonakshi's Tere Mast Mast dou Nane  Malaika Arora Khan's Item Number Munni Badnam. The Item Song is simple remarkable makes you wanna groove along with it.

The first scene shows some scary gothkid killing some guys in an alley with pretty poor gore FX and an insanely obvious SOV feel to it. Number one  people who dress up like vampires at an SM party are about the most unscary things humanly possible  and two  I typically don't care for extremely obvious SOV productions...so you can see as how from the first five minutes I didn't think I would be feelin' this one. I have to admit though that as it went along CRADLE OF FEAR ended up being quite entertaining despite and in some cases because of... it's numerous flaws...The film is made up of four vignettes that center around a mental patient who was a hypnotist and child rapistmurderer. In each vignette one or more people die in different splattery ways that are related to people that had to do with the hypnotist's incarceration. The stories themselves are all relatively entertaining the first dealing with the same goth kid from the beginning who is apparently mindcontrolled by the hypnotist who bones a semihot goth whore and some crazy babyspiderthing busts out of her stomach. The next has two friends who rob an old man and the robbery goes seriously wrong. The next is about a onelegged guy who goes to seek a donor for his missing leg and the last and in my opinion most interesting story deals with a kid who becomes obsessed with a snuff website. The four stories are all semiamusing excuses to show some tits and gore and still stay within the context of the film...CRADLE OF FEAR is a very disjointed film. The way it's shot makes it look like a bad UK soapopera. There are some decent performances from some of the cast  others are atrocious. There are a few sets of decent gothchick tits in this one and that's never a bad thing. Some of the gore FX are convincing or at least decent  others suck completely. There are a few CGI special FX that are so bad they're absolutely hilarious carchasecrash anyone???  but somehow this mess of a film still works. It is a little long clocking in at a solid two hours and could probably use a little bit of a trim but even so  it manages to stay pretty quickpaced and entertaining throughout. Not a great film by any stretch  but it's quirky and worth a look to splatter fans...810".

	schema:reviewBody "This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while.Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.So what is it then? Well of course it's not really a comedy instead it's intended as a horror flick  intended very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.But still.Bmovies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in thatand I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after thatthen that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh that and two or three pairs of breasts.Woohoo how exciting.As for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything the victims either use drugs andor are involved in serious crime. The lesson Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.I rest my case.So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean that's something innit?".

	onyx:emotionText "This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while.Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.So what is it then? Well of course it's not really a comedy instead it's intended as a horror flick  intended very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.But still.Bmovies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in thatand I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after thatthen that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh that and two or three pairs of breasts.Woohoo how exciting.As for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything the victims either use drugs andor are involved in serious crime. The lesson Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.I rest my case.So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean that's something innit?";

	schema:reviewBody "Cradle of Fear is set in London where police detective inspector Neilson Edmund Dehn is investigating the brutal murder of a young woman named Melissa Emily Booth which brings back memories of an old case he worked on about a child abuser  murderer named Kemper David McEwan. As more bodies pile up it seems that hypnotist  Satanist Kemper has been using demonic forces to murder the children of those that helped put him behind bars...This English production was written  directed by Alex Chandon  I simply can't believe some of the positive comments I have read about this seriously crap film I think Cradle of Fear was trying to be an anthology horror film but the four individual stories suck  it's so badly made at times it becomes hard to watch. Story number one involves a goth girl who has sex with the 'Man' played by Cradle of Fear frontman Dani Filth  then a mutant baby bursts out of stomach at the end  it's over there's no story here  I wouldn't even call the ending a twist either just some random happening that ultimately means nothing except to have a gore effect. The second story is equally terrible with two lesbian thieves robbing an old man in the end all three end up dead in a story which is a straight ripoff of the Father's Day segment from Creepshow 1982 just without the character's or cool effects. The third story is a take on the old limb reattachment plot think the likes of The Hnad 1981  Body Parts 1991 but substitute an arm for a leg sure the twist on the tale is amusing at first  probably the films only original concept even though the basic premise is still a ripoff. The fourth  thankfully final story warns of th dangers of internet addiction a guy becomes obsessed with an internet site selling snuff films which they make themselves  by the end the guy comes full circle in a really predictable twist that I saw coming a long long way off. The wraparound story is also lame  makes little sense the least said about it the better really. At two hours long Cradle of Filth felt like it went on forever the character's are poor the dialogue is poor the stories are poor the twists are poor the pacing is poor  the whole film is a real mess with nothing to recommend it. The single best moment of Cradle of Fear is the moment when Nick runs a tramp down in his car his wife Natalie says he should have a look Nick looks worried  nervously gets out of his car only to check his bonnet  say with great relief that there's not even a scratch on it  then they both speed off leaving the guy in the middle of the road.One thing I will say about Cradle of Filth is that the makers tried to fill it with as much gore sex depravity freaks dwarfs mutants monsters puke amputated limb stump sucking  kissing  awful rock music as possible. Virtually all the female cast get naked there's a couple of shower  bathing scenes as well. There are at least two vomit scenes. There's lots of blood including a rippedout throat a ripped in half head which is then stamped on an attempted abortion using a pair of scissors a mutant baby bursting out of a stomach people are battered  beaten stabbed have broken bottles shoved in their eyes a guy has his leg cut off heads are cut off throats are slashed guts are ripout  someone has half their head blown off in one of the films few decent CGI effects. Talking of the effects they are mostly poor  diminish the impact of the gore it all starts looking a bit goofy  cartoonish with water thin blood  just bad makeup effects. One other really bad aspect of Cradle of Filth are the sound effects which are awful just listen to the comedy sound effects at the start as Dani Filth is beaten up I am not sure if it was deliberate but it just sounds goofy  weird.Filmed in London the video quality is awful  my cheap camcorder can produce a better more film like picture quality it just screams cheap  amateurish. Besides the amount of gore the only other thing going for Cradle of Fear is the presence of Emily Booth who I do like  even though she overacts she at least does try to act. Booth now presents the Horror Channel over here in the UK  they show Cradle of Fear  during her intro she said she never got paid a penny for being it which says everything.Cradle of Fear is a terrible horror anthology with four of the worst most predictable individual stories I have seen. Usually in these anthology films there's at least on great story but not here. At two hours it's far too long  despite the constant gore  depravity  the wasted presence of Emily Booth this is a pretty awful film.".

With this background information out of the way here is a checklist to see if you will like this movie. 1. Can you tolerate bad special effects? The effects in this movie are about one step above crappy because it had a limited budget. It does take some work to get past the poor effects and get into the story but it can be done. 2. Do you have ADD? One thing I did enjoy about the movie was that it weaves together 4 story lines which really helps to keep your focus during the movie. It's far from stagnant. 3. Are you offended by anything? Anything at all? If so you will hate this movie and possibly feed the need to speak to a pastor after viewing it. The effects as previously stated are poor but the material the movie deals with is very intense and often satanic with references to Crowley. If you answered yes to 1 and 2 and no to number 3 you will probably enjoy this movie. In my opinion it's worth at least one watch if you enjoy horror movies. One last time though the special effects are weak and this movie is not for the faint of heart.".

It makes you wonder though whether he was really that evil because the people he killed were not exactly nice people. Another thing that added to it's horror movie quality was the low budget special effects they weren't awful but you could tell at times that they looked fake.

I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released they're first Demo in 1995. The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED. When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER. I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I wasn't laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multimillion dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multihundreds of dollars. The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the Hardcore Goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps. That was really it. To me this movie seemed like 80.5 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic.

The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For being low budget the special effects weren't bad either.

It's hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters. When there was a little talking the F bomb was abundant popping up in random places. Yes I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language. The storyline what I could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening.In the end Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn't work too well.

	schema:headline " With this much cheese there's bound to be some whine.";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's the whine. I knew before viewing that this would be an over the top film.  Between Danni Filth from Cradle Of Filth and the Hammeresque setting I expected a schlocky gory horror film.  I was wrong very very very very wrong!!! To sum it up the film is terrible and a let down in many ways.First and foremost have to be the splatter effects.  You don't need a huge budget or powerful CGI systems to create convincing effects.  Look at several low budget productions like Lucio Fulchi's 'The Beyond' Dario Argento's 'Suspiria' or George A. Romero's 'Dawn Of The Dead'.  All three of those films were low budget productions staring either low rent or no name actors.  Yet all three manage to set up a tense atmosphere gross us out with exploding heads ripped out intestines and a multitude of grisly slashed throats and allow us to suspend our disbelief for 90120 minutes.Now lets look at Cradle Of Fear Or low budget wannabe music video as I call it.  Danni Filth can't act to save his life.  I knew within the first 5 minutes of watching the film that it was going to be bad.  This mans acting is brutally stiff and devoid of any emotion or believability.  Id actually rate Tor's acting in Plan 9 From Outerspace above Danni Filth and that's frightning.  Unfortunately Danni's not the only hack in the film. I don't recall a single believable line of dialogue at any point during the movie.  Characters deliver the lines like they're reading from a teleprompter.  Worse yet the inspectors acting makes William Shatner's acting seem lucid and elegant.What this film reminds me of the most are not the Hammer classics I grew up with.  This tragedy reminds me of the films Troma puts out.  Only I enjoy Troma films because they're supposed to be cheap and outrageously funny. Cradle Of Fear is supposed to be a dark and frightning film. Unfortunately it's not scary but laughable.  Worst of all the film is far too long for its own good.  At over 2 hours it's about 3045 minutes too long for a movie with no major plot or story behind it.SummaryThe film is low budget not a crime as I like quite a few low budget flicks and it shows.The acting is stiff unbelievable and many times almost monotone.The dialouge itself creates some of the poor acting.  I could not imaging using the work Fu you get the idea as many times in one week as the inspector does in 15 minutes.  As pointed out previously by another reviewer Tarintino this guy ain't.  Hell Lloyd Kaufman of Troma films looks like a master compared to Chandon.The effects are just plain bad.  Prosthetics that look like they were bought at a nickel and dime store.  Blood that appears black are we killing humans or embalmed corpses and over use of blood the human body does not contain 50 gallons of blood and unlike Shogun Assassin this effect is not used in an artistic manner.  CGI that's reminiscent of The Last Starfighter which looked great in it's day but pales in comparrison to many PC games these days and is used out of place in many instances.Poor video quality.  For a movie shot mostly at night and in the dark it's important to use good film stock and a good low lite camera.  I guess Chandon forgot that seeing the movie helps alot.Too serious for it's own good.  If I wanted to laugh I would have popped in Braindead aka Dead Alive or Toxic Avenger.Rating 410 and I'm being kindSuggestion if you want a gore soaked movie laced with atmospheric elements of horror go out and buy the unrated edition of Lucio Fulchi's 'The Beyond'. While it's not heavy on plot it's not the joke that Cradle Of Fear is. Should you want a more twisting gothic yet bloody work check out some of Dario Argento's work.  Suspiria Tenebre and Opera come to mind as some of Argentos better films although I've yet to see one I did not like.".

I'm not a CoF fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie...A really bad one. If Dani made this as a comedy then good going him. Very well done.

	schema:reviewBody "Cradle of FearThis isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slackjacked uttering that sense of whoa. What it is though is a slice of lofi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director Alex Chandon as a throwback to sleazy '70s and '80s horror.This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge. The purveyor of such horrific violence is Dani Filth leadsinger of the metal band Cradle of Filth executing a role he was destined to play. As other's have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge. In this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer Kemper the father of our devilish avengingangel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum.What this provides for the Chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free. He seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached. We are also treated to closeups of skull's being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror. And for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking Did I just see what I thought I did because of course Pretty Woman this 'aint. It reminds me of some of the gorefests created out of Italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed.Story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the Sick Room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out. Further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of supporting visuals. Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie standins also adds support to the commando feel of the film. OK classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way. First of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now I love horror movies and I am very 'proviolence' but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative if you ask me. And yet  it has to be said  the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the makeup looks very amateurish  Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example . There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one.Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of deathmetal icon Danni Filth  from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ?  this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. For every selfrespecting horror fan this movie is an insult.".

I love really gory grossout films. I love horror anthologies. I also used to be a goth for several years. Sadly this film does a grave disservice to all of the above no pun intended. The film was produced on DV and therefore looks homemade. The fact that the budget didn't extend to getting it transferred to film says a lot. Sure there's nothing that says films can't be lowbudget and many people have made some excellent pieces using little more than a home DV camera. The difference is that most people don't usually try and pass them off as feature films.The plot attempts to tie four small stories into some kind of cohesive whole but the fact is that most of these segments don't really make much sense. Only the sick room plot holds your attention and looks as if it might be going somewhere interesting but then it spectacularly drops the ball with the subTwilight Zone predictability of its denouement.The dialogue is a low point amongst a sea of low points. Expletives are clumsily dropped into scenes giving the impression of the writer somehow trying to prove how grownup the film is.Acting throughout is mostly appalling. I mean really bad. The usualsuspect rentagoths Emily Booth and Eileen Daly give the type of performances that will see them typecast in this kind of tripe until they no longer look good seminaked. As for Dani Filth his virtuallysilent role merely gives him the opportunity to carry over his stage persona and if possible look an even bigger berk than usual.As for the effects well if indeed Creature FX really were involved then I can't see that they got paid more than twenty quid for their contribution. There is shocking gore yes but only shockingly bad. It almost made me laugh but I was so depressed by the rest of the experience I couldn't raise a smile.

This is not one of those films that's so bad it's good so don't get taken in by that line of reasoning.In my experience the music and imagery of Cradle Of Filth appeals mainly to young ohsorebellious justturnedteenagers and gothmetal fans who take themselves far too seriously. If this describes you you'll probably love this film. If it doesn't then don't insult your own intelligence and just walk away...".

I expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot line.But dear god I was oh so wrong. This movie seriously bites big time. Being a low budget film haha wait make that ZERO BUDGET this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects. Nope it's all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenes.Take for example when our star and violent fiend Mr Filth violently kills a mugger. A grab at the throat and blood spits out but oh my it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt.To you Cradle Of Filth fans You'll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN.My final comment Steer well away from it. It's blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it. So if you like appalling violence near no voices yes there's hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it. But if shoddy movies isn't your thing then avoid it. Don't waste your money.".

	schema:headline " A tense thriller with topnotch acting and writing";
	schema:reviewBody "About a month before State of Play came into theaters I read an article in The Washington Post I live in the D.C. area about the realism of the news industry as portrayed in the movie. One of the Post reporters served as a consultant on the set and I must say that he seems to have done his job. Almost every aspect from the constantly chaotic state of the newsroom to the reporterlingo feels authentic and true to reality. While there are occasional times when the movie's main character the reporter Cal McCaffrey strays from the usual ethical and professional guidelines there are logical explanations for such instances that are given in the movie. At one point Russell Crowe even adlibs a line about the outdated technology he has compared to the stateoftheart computers given to Della Fry Rachel McAdams's gossipy blogger I've been here fifteen years I've got a sixteen year old computer. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a fing satellite. This line was inspired by the feud between print journalists and their online counterparts that according to the Post reporter exists in reallife. Because journalism is so crucial to the story of State of Play every minute detail contributes greatly to the believability of the film as a whole and it is this attention to detail that really elevates State of Play above the average political thriller.The cast which includes three Oscar winners though Ben Affleck won for screen writing could not be more perfect. With his long shaggy hair bulging belly and old trashlittered car Russell Crowe looks appropriately scruffy and he disappears into his role becoming one of the most convincing journalists on screen in recent years. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role especially Brad Pitt who was originally signed on for the part. As his partner on the story Rachel McAdams delivers giving her character a very energetic yet idealistic flavor. Della Fry is at least in the beginning a rather obnoxious woman but in large part due to McAdams she gradually becomes more likable and we learn to accept her for who she is. Helen Mirren is splendid as Cameron McCaffery and Fry's insistent boss and every time she appears the screen comes alive not that it's dead when she isn't there. Ben Affleck once again proves that he can act when given the right material. He gives his character a promising congressman an air of detached arrogance mixed with frustrated vulnerability. Representative Stephen Collins certainly has his principles but throughout the film that sense of morality is largely shrouded in secrets and mystery and the audience is forced to constantly guess and reguess his true intentions. Aside from the main actors the supporting cast does a terrific job with a slightly comedic almost delightfully overthetop performance by Jason Bateman as a pretentious PR agent. Also worth noting is Viola Davis who plays a contact of McCaffrey's in the morgue and even though she only appears in one scene she makes the most of that short screentime that in turn makes us remember her well.Other than the superb cast one of the most impressive things about State of Play is the script which was written by Tony Gilroy Billy Ray and Matthew Michael Carnahan and based on the 2003 BBC miniseries of the same name. However it bears Tony Gilroy's distinctive mark not only because it involves corporate conspiracies and unending twists but the witty dialogue could have been written by almost no one else. Occasional instances of humor help lighten the otherwise rather dark mood. Also the writing is highly intelligent and makes the audience actually think rather than simply go along with the complicated plot. This can also be contributed to the direction of Kevin MacDonald who after winning an Oscar for his documentary One Day in September in 1999 and directing the Oscarwinning feature film The Last King of Scotland proves that he has loads of talent and hopefully will remain prominent in the filmmaking industry.Other noteworthy aspects of the movie are the cinematography and the score both of which help carry the tension throughout the entire twoandahalf hour film even during quieter scenes. However State of Play is not quite perfect. The main and perhaps only flaw is the minor plot holes that while virtually unnoticeable during the actual viewing of the movie become more obvious upon dissecting the movie afterwards. It is impossible to discuss these errors in detail without giving anything away but they do make the conclusion a little less satisfying.Nonetheless the movie is so good in all other areas that it is still easy to overlook the implausibility of the ending. From the virtually flawless cast and writing to the authenticity of its portrayal of journalists and the thoughtprovoking political themes State of Play stands out among all the conventional political thrillers churned out by Hollywood in recent years. Go see it!".

At one point Russell Crowe even adlibs a line about the outdated technology he has compared to the stateoftheart computers given to Della Fry Rachel McAdams's gossipy blogger I've been here fifteen years I've got a sixteen year old computer. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a fing satellite. This line was inspired by the feud between print journalists and their online counterparts that according to the Post reporter exists in reallife. Because journalism is so crucial to the story of State of Play every minute detail contributes greatly to the believability of the film as a whole and it is this attention to detail that really elevates State of Play above the average political thriller.The cast which includes three Oscar winners though Ben Affleck won for screen writing could not be more perfect. With his long shaggy hair bulging belly and old trashlittered car Russell Crowe looks appropriately scruffy and he disappears into his role becoming one of the most convincing journalists on screen in recent years. It is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role especially Brad Pitt who was originally signed on for the part. As his partner on the story Rachel McAdams delivers giving her character a very energetic yet idealistic flavor. Della Fry is at least in the beginning a rather obnoxious woman but in large part due to McAdams she gradually becomes more likable and we learn to accept her for who she is. Helen Mirren is splendid as Cameron McCaffery and Fry's insistent boss and every time she appears the screen comes alive not that it's dead when she isn't there. Ben Affleck once again proves that he can act when given the right material. He gives his character a promising congressman an air of detached arrogance mixed with frustrated vulnerability. Representative Stephen Collins certainly has his principles but throughout the film that sense of morality is largely shrouded in secrets and mystery and the audience is forced to constantly guess and reguess his true intentions. Aside from the main actors the supporting cast does a terrific job with a slightly comedic almost delightfully overthetop performance by Jason Bateman as a pretentious PR agent. Also worth noting is Viola Davis who plays a contact of McCaffrey's in the morgue and even though she only appears in one scene she makes the most of that short screentime that in turn makes us remember her well.Other than the superb cast one of the most impressive things about State of Play is the script which was written by Tony Gilroy Billy Ray and Matthew Michael Carnahan and based on the 2003 BBC miniseries of the same name. However it bears Tony Gilroy's distinctive mark not only because it involves corporate conspiracies and unending twists but the witty dialogue could have been written by almost no one else. Occasional instances of humor help lighten the otherwise rather dark mood. Also the writing is highly intelligent and makes the audience actually think rather than simply go along with the complicated plot. This can also be contributed to the direction of Kevin MacDonald who after winning an Oscar for his documentary One Day in September in 1999 and directing the Oscarwinning feature film The Last King of Scotland proves that he has loads of talent and hopefully will remain prominent in the filmmaking industry.Other noteworthy aspects of the movie are the cinematography and the score both of which help carry the tension throughout the entire twoandahalf hour film even during quieter scenes. However State of Play is not quite perfect. The main and perhaps only flaw is the minor plot holes that while virtually unnoticeable during the actual viewing of the movie become more obvious upon dissecting the movie afterwards. It is impossible to discuss these errors in detail without giving anything away but they do make the conclusion a little less satisfying.Nonetheless the movie is so good in all other areas that it is still easy to overlook the implausibility of the ending. From the virtually flawless cast and writing to the authenticity of its portrayal of journalists and the thoughtprovoking political themes State of Play stands out among all the conventional political thrillers churned out by Hollywood in recent years. Go see it!";

Despite being heavily dialogue driven the film is an intense ride that will keep people on edge throughout. Some scenes are downright terrifying in their amped up suspense and political intrigue. This film really set out to be tense and succeeds wonderfully. It knows just what punches to pull and when to pull them.The script written by political scribes Matthew Michael Carnahan Tony Gilory and Billy Ray is insight and intriguing. It could have easily been made boring and inundated with rehashed politicalisms like all of their last films but this film revels in how interesting it becomes. It has laughs strung throughout a genuine surprise and lacks the nerve to become loaded to the brim with facts and innuendos. Instead it expertly weaves between scenes amping up the intensity of some scenes and downplaying others.But this is mainly due to the incredible performances by the cast.

Some of the reactions on his face are downright devastating in how excellently they are conveyed. And this is a guy critics once said could not act. Coupled with onetwo shot of acting in Hollywoodland and directing Gone Baby Gone we may be seeing a renewed resonance and importance for the Oscarwinner. Crowe on the other hand delivers his strongest performance in years. While he has been downplayed and underused in his last few films he carries this film. He is stubborn and vaguely likable but he makes his character work for all of his idiosyncrasies and ethicallyquestionable tactics. He makes a seasoned journalist look like an amateur.McAdams all but a ghost recently holds her own against the two heavyhitters and delivers a performance that is both inspired and emotional. It gives her a lot of room to act and she delivers in every instance. The rest of the cast is a bit mixed however as so little of them is given that much to do. Harry Lennix Robin Wright Penn Jeff Daniels the horrifying Michael Berresse and especially Jason Bateman all deliver noteworthy performances but never get to really shine in them. They all have their traits and motivations but get little screen time to truly express them. They each are developed quite strongly but they lack the movement afforded to Crowe Affleck and McAdams. I simply loved Helen Mirren's scenerygauging editor and all of her subtleties. But she too is downplayed to the point of almost barely being in the film.Despite its intensity the film is bogged down by its dialogueheavy scenes and consistent character additions. It is easy to keep track of everyone but so many people are introduced that the film loses its focus on more than one occasion. It makes for a few scenes that are merely filler between the scenes of useful heavy acting. It just feels so tiring. I understand now how daunting a task it must have been to convert six hours of British television into a 127minute film but there are scenes that are just too easy to not have been cut out some entire mildly useful subplots may have helped. Adding characters in makes sense for a story about two journalists frantically searching to lift the lid on a story but there needs to be more emphasis on what was needed and not needed. A brilliant montage in the middle of the film goes almost entirely to waste because the filmmakers lack the knowledge of what should be cut. Limiting the preposterous and silly climax could have also done wonders. The scenes that are left in the film including the finale are great but they could have been stronger if they were as tightly wound as the film wants itself to be. A little less shaky hand camera movement could have also significantly benefited the film.Even with its problems it is clear from the onset of the first shot in the bullpen at the Washington Globe that the filmmakers are going for a very keen sense of homage to All the President's Men. While the ongoing and very professional relationship between McAffrey and Frye is very similar to Woodward and Bernstein the fabric of journalistic integrity and researching are the core of State of Play. The film is loaded with allusions to the Oscarwinning film and even mimics shots right out of the film. While it is obvious for anyone who has seen Men this film's nods are done in such a delicate and unique way that they never become distracting or blatant. The film is its own and does not ever feel like it is living in its bigbrother's shadow. It is a fresh take on oldfashioned reporting in a very digital age and frequently walks the tight line of old versus new.State of Play looked interesting and surprisingly delivers on almost every count. It is not a perfect film but it is a solid example of great filmmaking. It wants to be more but seems content at being a twisty and suspenseful modern thriller. 810.".

Adapted from a sprawling BBC miniseries created by Paul Abbott the trio is especially deft in their condensing of the story into a fully digestible two hours.

They also give the cast plenty to chew on with some great throwaway lines amidst all the posturing between the cops reporters politicians and sleazebags.Though it's Crowe and Helen Mirren as his sparring and quickwitted boss who shine the most this is essentially an ensemble piece and it's especially clever when Jason Bateman arrives on screen for a few pivotal scenes as a smug public relations guru who's too dumb to realize he knows too much. The cast also includes Robin Wright Penn as Affleck's wife Jeff Daniels as the arrogant majority whip and Harry Lennix who as a D.C. detective makes a compelling case here for the lead role in the Barack Obama Story. The only miscalculation in the casting is poor Rachel McAdams lovely but annoying in her highpitch as Crowe's blogging tagalong looking to kick it oldschool and get something in print.By the third act State of Play overplays its hand in its attempts to be timely with too much talk of the privatization of the military Capitol Hill sex scandals and traditional newspapers losing out in the digital age to bloggers more concerned with gossip than real journalism. It could've also been more subtle in its preaching about the importance of serious investigative reporting. It should be commended however for an otherwise smart screenplay that doesn't spell out all its twists and turns too early and the well polished cast who give the film a slick sheen.

I also entered the theater with a degree of apprehension about how well this feature length film would measure up to the brilliantly acted and crafted sixpart BBC series that was the basis for the film. Crowe wellembodied the tenacious oldschool investigative journalist that we've come to know from classics such as All the President's Men. However the multifaceted ensemble of journalists portrayed by a rich range of actors from the BBC series John Simm Kelly MacDonald James McAvoy is missing from this feature film where Russell Crowe does all the work. The complexity of the plot which includes the competing professional interests and emotional needs of the characters in the British miniseries is largely eliminated in this big screen version. Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn do not seem to appreciate and respond to the high stakes events that could turn their lives inside out and upside down. What this film shares with the miniseries is the glimpse into the mechanics of running a journalistic investigation under the pressure of time and editorial interference but the personal stories suffer from not being fleshed out and made to feel real and compelling to watch. It is not fair to compare one piece of art to another but when two productions are related and you've seen the original it is difficult to view the second production without prejudice. It is like trying to unring a bell.The new film State of Play is a convincing thriller but it fails to also deliver as a richly defined character drama.Curiosity will drive those who saw the BBC series to see this film and the rich pedigree of the film production will draw in those who know nothing about the original miniseries.

	schema:headline " A Pleasant Throw Back to Early PressburgerPowell Espionage and a Pakula Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Whether you loved em' or hated em' espionage thrillers made up a generous portion of cinema from the 194050's. With fast paced edge of your seat story lines plot twists political undertones and dramatic personal struggles with morality nobody did it better than Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Their attention to character detail and it's purpose in conjunction with the narrative gave heart and humanity to this new string of movies which could have fallen into similar yet shallower alpha male characters such as James Bond. Never the less we cannot forget that ultimately if it weren't for their vision and invention of the genre Hollywood may have never capitalized on the staggeringly profitable Bond franchise that's still going strong today.In the mid 70's due to the heat of the political environment at that time the genre decided to go in the same direction. All The Presidents Men brought to light the investigative strategies of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and tackled the Watergate scandal from the perspective of the Washington Post. As audiences we shared in the thrill of being able to follow the case as it unfolded interviewing witnesses and piecing together clues in order to make a 10 O'clock print deadline. We were part of the chase the scandal and always privy to the evidence necessary to solve the mystery at hand...that is until a new piece of evidence arose and bashed in all of our original assumptions.State of Play may be the first film to pay homage to this Pakula classic while dually creating more poignant themes for today's political atmosphere. Crowe plays a reporter for the Washington Post and McAdams an internet blogger serving as our Woodward and Bernstein clones on the case of a Senator Affleck whose mistress succumbs to a rather untimely death VIA train tracks. To add insult to injury it turns out that our reporter and senator are practically best friends. The plot unfolds relationships falter and the real truth to our pleasant surprise blindsides us like a drunk driver on a narrow road.Director Kevin Macdonald clearly knows what he's doing here and along with a well written screenplay by Tony Gilroy carefully crafts a neat sharp and extremely entertaining thrill ride of a movie whose run time is 2 hours and 15 minutes but feels like 30. State of Play never fails at keeping you guessing does a fine job of throwing in a few curve balls and leaves you with a clean taste in your mouth come end credits. What more do you want? Sure. It isn't the next Best Picture and Crowe won't take home an Oscar but you'll enjoy some nail biting action scenes and there are much worse things to look at than Rachel McAdams on the big screen for a few hours.Helen Mirren is delightful in what little screen time she is given. Affleck is good although decided to play it completely safe in a role that even he really can't screw up. Lets face it he needed to gain even a small amount of points since Hollywoodland and the flops that followed in his footsteps.Overall you'll be as pleased and refreshed as I was to see a picture that has the finesse of an espionage thriller the entertainment value of an All The Presidents Men political drama and the edginess that we should expect from a modern day piece of cinema that doesn't star Miley Cyrus.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whether you loved em' or hated em' espionage thrillers made up a generous portion of cinema from the 194050's. With fast paced edge of your seat story lines plot twists political undertones and dramatic personal struggles with morality nobody did it better than Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Their attention to character detail and it's purpose in conjunction with the narrative gave heart and humanity to this new string of movies which could have fallen into similar yet shallower alpha male characters such as James Bond. Never the less we cannot forget that ultimately if it weren't for their vision and invention of the genre Hollywood may have never capitalized on the staggeringly profitable Bond franchise that's still going strong today.In the mid 70's due to the heat of the political environment at that time the genre decided to go in the same direction. All The Presidents Men brought to light the investigative strategies of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and tackled the Watergate scandal from the perspective of the Washington Post. As audiences we shared in the thrill of being able to follow the case as it unfolded interviewing witnesses and piecing together clues in order to make a 10 O'clock print deadline. We were part of the chase the scandal and always privy to the evidence necessary to solve the mystery at hand...that is until a new piece of evidence arose and bashed in all of our original assumptions.State of Play may be the first film to pay homage to this Pakula classic while dually creating more poignant themes for today's political atmosphere. Crowe plays a reporter for the Washington Post and McAdams an internet blogger serving as our Woodward and Bernstein clones on the case of a Senator Affleck whose mistress succumbs to a rather untimely death VIA train tracks. To add insult to injury it turns out that our reporter and senator are practically best friends. The plot unfolds relationships falter and the real truth to our pleasant surprise blindsides us like a drunk driver on a narrow road.Director Kevin Macdonald clearly knows what he's doing here and along with a well written screenplay by Tony Gilroy carefully crafts a neat sharp and extremely entertaining thrill ride of a movie whose run time is 2 hours and 15 minutes but feels like 30. State of Play never fails at keeping you guessing does a fine job of throwing in a few curve balls and leaves you with a clean taste in your mouth come end credits. What more do you want? Sure. It isn't the next Best Picture and Crowe won't take home an Oscar but you'll enjoy some nail biting action scenes and there are much worse things to look at than Rachel McAdams on the big screen for a few hours.Helen Mirren is delightful in what little screen time she is given. Affleck is good although decided to play it completely safe in a role that even he really can't screw up. Lets face it he needed to gain even a small amount of points since Hollywoodland and the flops that followed in his footsteps.Overall you'll be as pleased and refreshed as I was to see a picture that has the finesse of an espionage thriller the entertainment value of an All The Presidents Men political drama and the edginess that we should expect from a modern day piece of cinema that doesn't star Miley Cyrus.";

Usually movies which star Russell Crowe are more dynamic although Crowe still mesmerizes as usual.I liked the twists and turns at the end but one has to wait about two hours for those and that's a little too long a wait. As slick a production as it was and with acceptable acting from actor it was many of the characters here that seemed more like Hollywood stereotypes than reallife people.There was Crowe with the hippie looks from 3040 years ago and who has the daring of James Bond the Washington newspaper editor being a foulmouthed Brit crusty Helen Mirren who uses profane expresses the Americans wouldn't know the neophyte blogster Rachel McAdams being dropdead gorgeous and getting her way despite tough bosses the bad guys being anyone connected with the military man is that getting old from Dr. Strangelove to today's films  it never changes the professional sniperassassin conveniently missing the good guy Crowe although he could kill anyone else......you get the picture  a few too many liberal film clichs. The most realistic character was probably Rep. Stephen Collins DPa played by the least of the actors Ben Affleck.As for minor characters I thought Dominic Foy played by Jason Bateman was fascinating as was Robin Wright.Overall for entertainment purposes it was okay not something you'd yawn and fall asleep watching although you might be confused here and there. Through the gimmicks of hypedup music and sound effects here and there the suspense was evident throughout the twoplus hours. It's also an interesting look at today's battle between old and new media meaning newspapers and the Internet respectively.Overall it's enough to warrant as a purchase at the rental store but not as a blind buy despite the name cast.".

Turns out it's not quite like that. State of Play is consistently good has gripping parts and some very good performances until it suddenly undoes its own highly cooked conspiracythriller intentions for one of those twistendings that takes things back a notch. And it's not a good twist not so much because of how the scene is written the final confrontation between the characters but because it deflates the rest of the paranoid drama and suspense that's been building up to it.State of Play is not without some other curious things to it such as Russell Crowe playing the grizzled old veteran reporter who may also have the kind of skills that should make him Sherlock Holmes's understudy  or competition. In the film his character practically makes the police obsolete as he takes it upon himself to investigate what is behind the suicide? of an assistant to the congressman played by Ben Affleck who is also an old college roommate of his. Rachel McAdams' character has to keep up at times breathlessly and sometimes with protest with Cal's methods of inquiry and extracting info.And yet I could buy into a lot of it partly because of Crowe's performance as usual with some good gravitas and weight and with the measure of experience he's had as an actor. and partly because it keeps the suspense and the willheorwon'the aspect of the deadline for the paper. Up until those final ten minutes when that twist not to spoil too much but it is a Keyser Soze bit as other critics have inferred the filmmakers keep us interested in the events because of us being so invested with Crowe and McAdams tracking down a case that balloons to include defense contractors the media and lord knows what else.Again performances make the difference and at the least State of Play's director of Last Kind of Scotland fame knows how to corral right actors for just the right parts. He gets Crowe and McAdams well paired and Helen Mirren as the headstrong but lenient editor in chief and especially from Affleck who can bring on a sense of truth even when he's lying to our faces perfect for a politician. Jason Bateman by the way steals his scenes as a PR guy who talks and talks big and flamboyantly until he has to crack under pressure. Even the guy who played the undercover blackop style killer was perfectly cast.The big problem then aside from the twist ending is that everything in the film for all of its fine moments of storytelling does feel the crunch of being adapted from a 5 hour miniseries. While not seen by me I can tell that there is likely more room for subject matter to breathe for the audience to digest a lot of this information. As with Watchmen what they cut out probably worked for the feature film but only up to a point. As in any story in journalism or film the details do stack up. All of the very impressive tricks with having cameras in the scenes shooting from far away and at different and opposing angles meant to create tension can't quite surmount this crunch. It's a good film that at times tries a little too much to be more important that it is.".

Afleck is very good the best I've seen him act for years. Crowe is well ordinary his character a grumpy scruffy almost unhygienic journalist is very one pace. The newspapers editor played by Helen Mirren is likewise played on one note  that of your tough mainly shouting Brit . The female sidekick of Crowes' is a token role inserted to try to involve the female viewer I guess  which is a shame as she wastes screen time which didn't allow what should have been the main female lead i.e. the wronged politicians wife to shine thru' as it did in the BBC version. In this adaptation her part was by passed with hints to an affair with Crowe an unhappy marriage etc but absolutely nothing was fleshed out  so you cared little for her situation in all of this murder and intrigue. The at times slack pace of the movie was proved to me as the director constantly intercut scenes with those of a mysterious helicopter scanning the skies of Washington  a very amateur attempt at trying to create tension which isn't necessary in a truly thrilling movie and wasn't needed in the original The two glaring nonos though were in plot lines which to me showed either lazy scriptwriting or masses of footage on the cutting room floor . In the hospital scene  where the female reporter bumps into the killer on the third floor as she emerges from the elevator. She proceeds to walk a few paces into the treatment room  within seconds a snipers rifle kills the would be witness. Now hang on  the same guy she has just passed has within ten paces of her walking he has descended three floors left the hospital  crossed the street  gone into another building ascended at least four floors into a convenient room and fired his weapon to kill the guy  mmmmm OK suspend disbelief  and timeBut then towards the climax of the whole two hours plus Crowe suddenly realises the true nature of events and without speaking  crosses Washington to confront Afleck . As he leaves him amazingly this same killer is waiting for Crowe outside Afleck's office !!. So now the killer is a clairvoyant as well as moves at super speed . This makes no sense and unfortunately my suspension was now too tired to shift my disbelief . Sloppy  sloppy plot .After transatlantic copies like this you can understand why film fans groan when they hear Hollywood is to make their version of a loved playfilm. My advice  either get the original and enjoy the real thing or don't get the original  see this copy and miss a great tale well told your choice .".

	schema:reviewBody "So I gave this movie a 10 but that's coming from a thriller fan. With most thrillers this movie has it's faults. Some exaggeration implausibilities annoying twists but the film transcends other thrillers on all other levels. Even with the overly dramatic plot and scenarios I felt this film was a very realistic portrayal of journalism and posed an interesting argument between old fashioned print journalism and the new age of the internet. Of course for the thrills they'll have to make some clich twists but it goes beyond the generic nonsense thriller to making a mild statement about the media today. In addition the cast was fantastic. I couldn't be more relieved that Russell Crowe took over Brad Pitt's role Pitt would have been a terrible choice. Russell was a much better fit for Cal. However I kind of wish Edward Norton remained with the role of Senator Collins... Affleck and Crowe didn't have the greatest chemistry. However the many supporting players were fantastic. Rachel McAdams did a fine job. Not exactly the meatiest role but she played the revised role of Della as a young popular blogger greatly. Rachel brought that playful naivety but at the same time made Della intelligent and respectable. Helen Mirren was perfect and perhaps a little underused. There is also a plethora of strong performances from the minor supporting players. Jason Bateman gave my favorite performance out of all of them Harry Lennix was another who was underutilized and Robin Wright Penn continues her reputation as one of the most consistent supporting actresses.But as a thriller it really was a fantastic and entertaining movie. I've never seen the BBC series and could only imagine how much better it could be with more time to develop characters and stories but the film does the best it could and that's enough. It isn't your typical mindless thriller though which is what I respect about it most. It is paced well but if you don't pay attention you may get lost but seeing as the film really does keep you on your toes it shouldn't be that hard. What makes this thriller so much better though is that it makes you think even after leaving the theater. It isn't just some formulaic story with mindless twists and turns it's actually saying something about the world today that is very relevant which not only makes a great thriller but a great film as well.I've read some complaints about the ending but I don't understand what the big deal was. I don't want to give anything away but I think it's an ending that could be taken in different ways depending on the viewer.".

	schema:headline " State of Play is so very Hollywood...which means it could have been better...";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot is thin and doesn't really hold up under scrutiny and yet I'd guess lots of people will love this movie. I did not and my problem goes beyond plot. My problem was with the casting. I love Helen Mirren. She always does a good job and this film is no exception. I also love Russell Crowe and as usual he does alright given what he has to work with. It's not his fault that his character is a complete caricature of a reporter. Robin Wright Penn also does alright with her role which is very limited and onedimensional. And then there's Ben Affleck who should probably just give up acting altogether. He's exceptionally bad in this movie. But my biggest gripe with this movie is in casting Rachel McAdams as the cub reporter. Why does the cub reporter have to be a beautiful young woman? Russell Crowe has just turned 45 and looks it it's one of many things I like about him. It's clear that he doesn't work out he hasn't had his teeth whitened his character is a slob with both his desk and his apartment giving ample evidence of his disorganization...and yet he's a good reporter and a good guy to boot. In other words HUMAN and BELIEVABLE...so of course Hollywood decided to cast opposite him Rachel McAdams who could grace the cover of any number of fashion magazines were she so inclined and who is 15 years his junior in real life but looks even younger I didn't get the impression that her character was supposed to be 30. Would it work the other way around? Would George Clooney or Brad Pitt all gussied up for the cover of GQ and with an appropriately slick apartment be believable as a hard hitting investigative reporter? I don't think so and someone in casting didn't think so either thus we have Russell Crowe playing a slob in the lead. So if the male lead must be gritty why does Hollywood think the counterpart must be a beautiful perfectly groomed young woman? I like Rachel McAdams and think she's a competent actress but she simply wasn't believable in this role. There must be young actresses out there who just look like regular people. Why not cast one of them? For that matter why does the cub reporter have to be young? Why couldn't she be any age but new at reporting? This might have been a better film if the cub reporter had been a plain woman of any age trying to find her way working with Crowe and Mirren and their experience. I think that would have made this a much more interesting movie and it's a movie that might actually be made somewhere but not in Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cal Russell Crowe and Stephen Ben Affleck have been buds since their college days. They still stay in touch but their lives have taken two different paths. Stephen is an upandcoming politico who has acquired the beautiful wife Anne Robin Wright Penn the spiffy mansion wealth and prestige. On the flip side Cal works as a respected but hardly rich reporter for the Washington Globe where publisher Cameron Helen Mirren reigns supreme. One day as Stephen who has been investigating the possibly nefarious doings of a Blackwatertype marinesforhire group is about to give a press conference the gallery informs him that one of his committee members Sonia has been found dead near the DC subway. Beginning to cry Stephen stumbles out of the press talk in a daze. That's because it seems redhaired pretty Sonia was having an extramarital thing with Stevie. Cal and fellow reporter Della Rachel McAdams begin to investigate the case and also the death of two other gentlemen in the region whose demises may be connected. But will the personal relationship and past that Cal has with both Stephen and Anne get in the way of the search for truth especially when it comes to the billions of funds made by the hired guns Stephen was trying to explore? This is a topnotch thriller which may put fans of the genre into a state of euphoria. The script is flatout terrific based on a British miniseries especially in its uncanny skill in blending a great deal of humor amid the chills and thrills. Likewise the cast is most wonderful with Crowe McAdams Affleck Mirren Jason Bateman Jeff Daniels Penn and many others delivering strong strong performances. Special words of praise should go to Crowe for his headturning but carefully nuanced role as a man caught in the middle. As for the movie's production the sets costumes camera work and direction are nearly flawless except for a ruffled blouse that some fashion diva thought would enhance McAdams' look but which hits 100 on the hideous meter. But that's small peanuts as they say. All in all if you love thrillers especially ones that include the juicy realms of politics and secret government operatives you would be wise to head to the nearest theater and fork over some cash for this one. It is a definitely one fertile playground for the cinematic enthusiast.".

	schema:reviewBody "State of Play is a good thriller that cleverly whether intentionally or not plays on a very strong view expectation. Everyone who goes to the movies knows that Hollywood always despises big business and usually despises the military and generally makes them the villain. When there is a murder and a big corporation is featured in the movie the audience it automatically going make the connection. This makes the surprise ending quite effective because they are not behind the murders after all. The audience it genuinely surprised and that doesn't happen too often.I am likely in the minority who prefer this movie to the original miniseries. The BBC version was far too complicated had far too many plot lines and far too many characters even for 56 hours of running time. The movie running at 2 hours time simplified the plot and eliminated unnecessary characters and scenes. Scenes of many secondary characters like the Collins's secretary the policemen most of newspaper staffers Foy and Baker's roommate are reduced or eliminated with no loss at all. Eliminating the romance with Collins's wife was a good move as it wasn't the slightest bit believable in the series. Neither was the plot twist of having the government know that Sonja Baker was a spy right from the start. The movie wisely eliminated this as well. I missed Bill Nighy but Russell Crowe was a big improvement over John Simm.Perhaps most importantly the BBC series blundered badly by killing off the hitman in the middle of the series. He was the main source of tension and the key to the suspense. The movie wisely keeps him in play until the very end. This gives the movie a big edge overall.".

In fact the pacing is terrible and the movement from scene to scene difficult to follow until it at last sinks in that the scenes are never going to really add up to anything like an interesting whole. It's not simply that threads are left dangling  they were never intended to be tied together in the first place. The whole film stinks of red herring  or more accurately dead herring.Meanwhile clichs abound unrelieved by any new insight or point of view.As for the visual jokes in the background  like the poster of the blonde seen through a window with a ketchup stain so she looks shot through the head or the fact that the Crowe character is dressed to remind us of the detective he played in American Gangster while the black detective is as dapper as the Denzel Washington character in that much better film  oh please  these were just annoying and pointless.Finally in a film that should have been about the lack of accountability that plagues both our political system and our media the final notice of the film is the filmmakers' own denial of responsibility an unwillingness to take a final stand on any of the issues it presents.A truly cowardly and depressing piece of film.".

The whole film stinks of red herring  or more accurately dead herring.Meanwhile clichs abound unrelieved by any new insight or point of view.As for the visual jokes in the background  like the poster of the blonde seen through a window with a ketchup stain so she looks shot through the head or the fact that the Crowe character is dressed to remind us of the detective he played in American Gangster while the black detective is as dapper as the Denzel Washington character in that much better film  oh please  these were just annoying and pointless.Finally in a film that should have been about the lack of accountability that plagues both our political system and our media the final notice of the film is the filmmakers' own denial of responsibility an unwillingness to take a final stand on any of the issues it presents.A truly cowardly and depressing piece of film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Russell Crowe is starting to look so crumpled and weatherbeaten that you can't help thinking it won't be long before the leading man roles start passing him by. His face almost seems to be folding in on itself and he therefore makes a rather unlikely hero. He plays Cal McAffrey a reporter for the Washington Post whose friend senator Ben Affleck no really! finds himself in the middle of a media frenzy when a pretty young aide he's been having an affair with falls in front of a train.The girl's death is the start of an involved plot that serves up a fresh twist every fifteen minutes or so. Although the film was involving enough and never became boring it seemed to me to be much longer than it actually was and as I'm quite patient when it comes to slow films I imagine many people would find it a bit of a plod. The cast is fairly good though. The irascible editor isn't played by a cigarchewing middleaged curmudgeon but comes in the slinky form of Helen Mirren who continues to withstand the rigours of time with admirable fortitude.For all it's twists and turns the plot is mostly formulaic but it's professionally put together so that you forget at times you're watching the kind of political thriller you've seen many times before. There's no romance in the film  apart form the illicit one between the girl and the Senator which is over soon after the film begins and repeated references to another affair that would probably count as a spoiler if I related it here  and the reason is probably because the idea of shaggy old Crowe and lithe young Rachel McAdams going at it is a little too farfetched to be believable.".

Even though Russell Crowe is good there is sense of connection to his character and that is the same for Rachel McAdams' character. Helen Mirren gives a solid performance as does Ben Affleck while Jason Bateman nearly steels the entire film as a sleazy PR man. The story does progress at a steady pace but without any connection for the characters it is difficult to care. There is a subplot with Russell Crowes character who had an affair with his best friends wife but it never becomes interesting and feels like a poor effort to add character depth. There were a couple of scenes that were interesting and the underlying theme of how the internet will eventually kill off the newspaper adds some weight to the story. One scene sees Russell Crowe hiding in an underground car park and it is very tense but once the film has ended you will soon forget about it.

His Italian hoodlum accent is funny and the unique character he plays Vinnie Antonelli is very entertaining to see and hear.This isn't a laughoutloudtype of comedy but a pleasant one all the way through with good subtle humor. The first half of the story was much better than the second half. It gets cornier as it goes on. Martin's supporting cast  Rick Moranis and Joan Cusack  don't quite cut it as an FBI man and district attorney respectively being ridiculous clowntype characters but hey this isn't supposed to be taken seriously. Moranis' Barney Coppersmith is stupid but likable and Cusack's Hannah Stubbs is overly silly.The language is very tame especially for a PG13 film. It's just a nice lighthearted comedy worth a look or two. I saw it three times and by then that was enough. The DVD version I saw wasn't a whole lot better than the tape with poor surround sound and a soso transfer.".

He's too typecast for me always playing a similar role. I thought he was maybe funnier in ghost busters. I don't know. He's a decent actor. It's that whole square role he plays that gets to me a bit. He's supposed to be boring obviously. But he's maybe too boring.I found the female cop love interest for Martin to be great. She's cute and she's funny.Joan Cusack...I have liked her better in other roles. She's hilarious in Grosse Pointe Blank. She's OK in this role.I liked the silent film style captions or whatever you would call them a lot. They added humor to the movie.In summary I found the movie very light very entertaining and cute. I like that type of movie. If you want something that requires no thought where your goal as a viewer is just to relax and be amused this is perfect.".

They make such a great duo and you can tell that they really enjoy each other's presence. This is the only Steve Martin movie my mom didn't have so I had to rent it. But I was excited to see Steve Martin as a tough Italin mobster so I couldn't resist the rental.My Blue Heaven is about a man Vinny aka Todd and he's about to go on trial to rat out some Mafia members but he must be protected from hit men so that's where Rick's character comes in. He must take care of Vinny and make sure that he isn't arrested or injured but that's going to be hard since Vinny keeps getting into trouble with the D.A. played by Joan Cussack. Vinny also thinks it's a good idea that she and Rick get together and they do. But Joan is going to try her best to get Vinny busted.It's predictable but it is a very adorable movie that I think any Steve Martin fan could appreciate. The cast was great and the story was very funny I thought it was so cool that it was slightly based on Henry Hill'swho you probably remember from Goodfellas life. Rick and Steve are just great and I think you'll enjoy this movie.610".

Joan Cusack and Steve Martin My Blue Heaven.There's a lot of fun to be found in My Blue Heaven a simple little comedy with only good intentions. I find it almost impossible to dislike  it has little offensive material it isn't a stupid recycled movie packaged with marketable trimmings. Instead it is a joyful little flick that knows it is no Oscar winner but still tries to entertain its audience. And it does. My Blue Heaven is pure heaven for anyone who appreciates fine comedy  it's a little bit wacky a little bit goofy and very very funny.Steve Martin is perfectly cast as the wild and crazy Vincent Antonelli a Mafia informer who has been entered into the Witness Protection Program. His wife wants no part of their new cheery life in a suburban America so she leaves him early on. Rick Moranis is equally wellcast as Barney Coopersmith the FBI agent assigned to protect Vinnie and make sure his new life is suitable to his comfort.Barney's wife has just left him too. She complains that he is too analretentive. She even mentions that he has a technique for getting equal amounts of butter on his waffles. Meanwhile Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime  first little things such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store  which results in the best single line in the entire film when a perky employee greets Vinnie. His response is a fourletterword that isn't nearly as crude as it seems it would be at first. Soon he meets up with old partners and crime and they form a new crime syndicate  much to the chagrin of a female police officer named Hannah Stubbs Joan Cusack who seems to be the perfect match for Barney Coopersmith.Hannah is unable to prosecute Vinnie because he is a Federal Witness. At first she and Barney hate each other. Then they grow closer. Vinnie watches on with joyful interest. And what makes this movie so enjoyable in part is the chemistry between Martin and Moranis. It's their first film together since Parenthood. They're a good duo and Martin is so out of character here you start to forget it's even him playing an Italian mobster. Compare Vincent Antonelli to Neal Page Martin's character in Planes Trains and Automobiles and the difference in not only attitude but mannerisms and levels of intensity is clearly evident. Martin can play the middleclass American white male especially well but this film clearly shows that he has not left his wacky background in such films as The Jerk far behind.My Blue Heaven came out the same year as Goodfellas 1990. It was impeccable timing  at the end of Goodfellas we are left with the penetrating image of Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill outside a suburban home in a cheery neighborhood which remarkably looks exactly like the neighborhood in My Blue Heaven. It could be argued that My Blue Heaven is an immediate sequel in some senses. Where Goodfellas left off My Blue Heaven starts  it just throws in some comedy. Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters. Suffice to say it sorta flopped.I own this film on a VHS tape I purchased for 4.99 at WalMart. I found it lying in the bottom of a discount video barrel with noname titles. There are comedic gems that have gained respect over the years and then there are comedic gems that have slipped by unnoticed. My Blue Heaven wasn't very noticed upon its release in 1990 the few critics who saw it seemed not to pay any attention to it. Funny how some of the most joyful comedies slip by. My Blue Heaven is a few laughs short of a comic masterpiece.4.55.".

These three are the best part of the movie. There are definite plot holes the script gives Martin a couple of one liners but is weak in general and nothing else really stands out about this movie. WHat made it worth while to watch is the great chemistry between the three leads. Martin gives it his all and is very funny. Moranis has it tougher while trying to be a nerdFBI agentunusual combo but he pulls it off. His face is so expressive its like you can see what he is thinking. This makes the scenes where Martin is making him do something crazy that much better. All in all its not great but its worth watching with your kids because they will love it and you will be entertained.".

Rick Moranis is the FBI agent Barney Coopersmith assigned to watch over Vinnie. But Vinnie is hard to watch and he keeps slipping away and into petty trouble.Vinnie's first scrape in San Diego comes when he hot wires and steals a car. District Attorney Hannah Stubbs Joan Cusack wants to keep him in jail but Barney pulls him out to preserve his false identity. Always an opportunist Vinnie sets out to make a match between Barney and Hannah. It was inspired casting for the shorter Moranis to play opposite the taller Cusack both in what are serious roles in a comedy. The comedy comes from the contrast of their characters and it is good.Most SPOILERS follow. It turns out that many of Vinnie's old cronies are also in San Diego and they tell him the payments stop after the testimony they expect us to get real jobs and earn our keep. So they all get together to run various illegal fund raising schemes. In one they hijack cargo that turns out to be empty 5gallon water bottles. So Vinnie sets them out in businesses to collect donations for Little League baseball. Later caught in the scam he weasels out by arranged from a jail cell having his friends begin actual construction of a Little League Park Vincent Antonelli Stadium. This is strictly a comedy and in the end we see Vinnie beginning to settle down and perhaps go straight in San Diego his Blue Heaven. Martin wears an unusual hairdo for him dark hair sticking straight up and he does a very good New York gangster accent. I don't like all Steve Martin roles equally but he always does a superb job. Vinnie Antonelli is becoming one of my favorites of his.".

This movie shows both of them in topform and they make this movie a fun and certainly above average one.It's not the most clever or best comedy movie even written but the movie does serve its purpose. There are quite many different plotlines. It doesn't make the movie confusing to watch but it does make it a little bit less interesting to watch at times. Therefor the move never really reaches the level of true greatness but it still is a bit of a forgotten and certainly underrated comedy that deserves some more recognition.This movie features Steve Martin in one of his best and most entertaining roles. He is perfect as the exgangster who now is in the witness protection program. He goes perfectly overthetop as the Italian wiseguy. Rick Moranis' role is a bit smaller too small but not any less entertaining because of that. Moranis and Martin form a pretty good and funny comical duo mainly because the two characters are very different from each other. The movie also has a really strong supporting cast with some big and well known respected names in it.It's a movie that really mostly relies on its two main character. They make the movie and its comedy moments work. The movie doesn't really have that many memorable moments although the dance sequences are definitely fun original and amusing. Its more the sort of movie that amuses and entertaining throughout its entire running time without making a too big or lasting impression. The movie tries to be clever at moments with its story but it only succeeds partly in this. The story is too messy and too disconnected to make it really fully work.There are too many issues with this movie to really regard it as a great comedy classic. The story is not always told in the most interesting way and not everything in the movie really connects with each other. Also the ending was a bit of a disappointment. It was like they wanted to solve every plot line and problems in the last ten minutes in just a couple of sequences.

But hey there is enough comedy and movement to keep this story going which in regards for this film is all it really needs to stay afloat.

Such a formula tends to work for him.While the movie did seem rather convoluted in some spots Martin's character is so well drawn out and likable that you tend to forget about the weakness of the plot and the predictability. But hey there is enough comedy and movement to keep this story going which in regards for this film is all it really needs to stay afloat. I thought Rick Moranis was pretty good and the ending was so perfectly cheesy it couldn't have fit this movie any better.";

Another interesting point is Shelley Winters who was a sex symbol at that time telling how she got the role of Alice Tripp. Elizabeth Taylor also tells funny things about her relationship with Montgomery Cliff.

So hobbled by a tight budget Stevens scaled back his ambitious plans but delivered perhaps even to his own surprise a superbly crafted and and powerfully sustained work of movie art.He was lucky that Paramount edgy about the story gave him a cast that would guarantee not only good box office but solid performances as well. Montgomery Clift Elizabeth Taylor and Shelly Winters take the principal roles with in the last third of the movie extra oomph courtesy of Raymond Burr in a role that may have nabbed him the Perry Mason franchise.The jaws of the vise Clift finds himself squeezed into are class and sex. Barely educated raised by stern members of a religious sect he luckily or not happens to be the shirttail nephew of a prosperous entrepreneur who casually offers him work in his factory. Awkward and lonesome Clift escapes the drudgery of his job by taking up with a mousy coworker Winters toned way down from her platinumbombshell image at the time. But his nosetothegrindstone ways attract the attention of his uncle who rewards him with a promotion and an invitation up to the manor.There he meets Taylor and launches an obsession about her reinforced by a neon sign visible from his window that blazes her surname through his restless nights she's another child of an industrial fortune raised in wealth and privilege. Somehow she falls for him  and need it be added he for her  despite his coming from the wrong side of the tracks she hasn't the faintest notion that for people like him life may not be the blithe affair it is for her. Only one inconvenient fact keeps Clift from taking his rightful place in the sun He's left Winters pregnant.

He leaves abruptly to meet Winters desperately trying to assemble the plan which will seal three fates.Stevens sustains an overwhelming ominous momentum unbroken by even a hint of levity not even a single bit player is allowed to lapse into shtik. Languorous dissolves and superimposed images heighten the sense of inevitability as each scene each event glides seamlessly into the next. Maybe he wasn't able to pile on the exhaustive social commentary that bulked up Dreiser's novel but everywhere there's sharp detail that he adroitly leaves to be noticed.

I rushed to buy a DVD after watching a BBC documentary on ELizabeth Taylor to celebrate her 75th birthday! In A Place on the Sun an Elizabeth Taylor barely out of her teens is paired with Montgomery Clift. She had been raised at MGM and groomed for movie stardom from day one. He was a method actor complex introspective and their coupling produced something that I'm tempted to call unrepeatable. The actors own personal stories their friendship mutual love and respect made it possible for their communion to be so transcendental. To make things even more perfect the film seems a love letter from director George Stevens to his stars and vice versa. Look at the opening credits and tell me if you've ever seen a more startling introduction to a characterstar. The story of doomed love and descend into darkness is without question one of the best ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Eastman takes up friendly offer from his uncle to go work in the highly prosperous Eastman bathingsuit factory. Formerly a bell hop at a hotel and born out of a relatively poor but religiously devout home George is spellbound by how the upper crust live. As he starts to climb the social ladder he becomes besotted with his cousin's beautiful partner Angela Vickers. While at the same time neglecting his girlfriend and mother of his unborn child Alice Tripp. The outcome of George's confused emotions will have devastating effects on everyone involved...A Place In The Sun is one of those revered yet seemingly divisive classic pictures that I believe deserves every bit of praise heaped upon it. Based on the Theodore Dreiser novel An American Tragedy and the Patrick Kearney play it's a slow simmering piece that boasts technical greatness and a class division script that is intriguingly shrouded by a real life sad story. The book and subsequent film versions Josef von Sternberg filmed an adaptation in 1931 are working from the real case of Chester Gillette and his girlfriend Grace Brown. To expand further would result in major spoilers but it's a case that is readily available to anyone with internet access. Here with this adaptation director George Stevens sublime direction has gathered all the things available to him and crafted a Gothic almost dreamy classic amongst classics. The source and Sternberg's take on the novel may well be more stark and grimly oppressive but this has such high cinema values it positively begs you to invest your very being with it.The story behind the scenes is itself worthy of a movie Stevens clashing constantly with Montgomery Clift Eastman and Shelley Winters Tripp Clift because he would only take motivation from his personal coach Mira Rostova and Winters because Stevens had never wanted her cast in the first place! Then there is the Elizabeth Taylor Angela Vickers factor blissfully unaware of Clift's burgeoning homosexuality she reciprocated Clift's adoration of her by falling for him big time the results all captured by Stevens are akin to being put under a spell that you simply can't turn away from. Montgomery Clift was one of the best actors of his generation here in spite of a secretly confused emotional state the sparks that ping off Taylor and himself are the kind that few lauded chemistry couples in movie history have ever gotten close too. Monty Clift is worth every penny or cent that is spent to watch him perform here is yet another performance of emotional oomph to only confirm his standing as a true giant of American actors.Academy Awards went to Best Director Best Screenplay Michael Wilson  Harry Brown Best Cinematography William Mellor Best Costume Design Edith Head Best Editing William Hornbeck and Best Score Franx Waxman all of them deserved with Waxman's score one of the true greats of 50s cinema a character in itself and something to totally lose yourself in. Clift  Winters were both nominated in the Best actorActress categories respectively and really in any other year they surely would have won while the film itself was also nominated for Best Film. Ultimately it's the story itself that makes A Place In The Sun such a beguiling viewing it's love divided by classes no middle ground here it's the rich and beautiful on one side on the other is the plain and poor the result is a majestic piece of cinema. 1010".

Her wealth and position in society is what most affects Clift.Eager to leave Shelley he soon discovers that she is pregnant. This part as the impoverished pregnant girl with nowhere to go was the best part and performance by Miss Winters. We feel for her as she tries to maintain a grip on the Clift character. She brings to the part a nervousness rarely seen in motion pictures. Had she been nominated for best supporting actress she would have possessed 3 Oscars in that category. Instead she was nominated for lead actress and lost to Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire.Clift is perfect as the drifterhe was Oscar nominated for it. His scenes in the court where he maintains that the drowning of Miss Winters was an accident are real and leave a vivid reminder in the minds of the viewers.The film also marked a breakout performance for Miss Taylor. Up until then possibly with the exception of 1949's Elephant Walk her roles were mostly childish in nondramatic films. The viewer is put in the moral dilemma of whether or not Clift made an attempt to save the drowning Ms. Winters. Capital punishment becomes a question as always.Anne Revere is effective in an all too brief role as Clift's biblereading mother.All emotional stops are put out in the final scene when Taylor visits a condemned Clift in prison..

	schema:reviewBody "George Stevens' A PLACE IN THE SUN is a poetic film filled with tender moments sadness and pending doom.  Having not read the book I had the pleasure of seeing the material for the first time which is preferable if you see a film based on a classic novel.  Montgomery Clift is his usual mysterious self as he has a scandalous relationship with the homely Shelly Winters and falls instantly in love with a spellbindingly beautiful Liz Taylor who was only 19 when the picture was made.  She glows with energy and a sense of optimism about life a stark contrast to Clift whom Taylor has also fallen for.  Rumor has it they had an actual affair while making the movie.  This is not for all tastes for it is slow and Clift is not all that appealing.  The idea of dropping a lesser life with Winters and pursuing the good life with Taylor is what makes it work and the lengths to which Clift will go are staggering.George Stevens has a gift for painting a movie onscreen.  Just see GIANT also with Taylor or SHANE the other two parts of his American Trilogy. The scenes on the lake and the way the mood of the movie is painted is quite simply amazing.  He also uses slow dissolves that leave a ghostly image onscreen between scenes.  This all adds to the atmospheric touch of tragedy that will ensue.  Poor Shelly Winters.  She always gets a raw deal in films. There are times when you almost sympathize with Clift.  Imagine living the life of a socialite with the girl of your dreams and a good job with your family.  A life with Winters would be dismal according to Clift and us. What's right is right however.  An unnecessary court room saga closes the picture to ensure the viewer's sense of justice.  This must've been pretty controversial stuff back in the early50'sA PLACE IN THE SUN truly is an American tragedy a portrait of young lives gone wrong with postWWII optimism as a backdrop.  Clift and Taylor shine together and provide film fans with a romance never to be forgotten.  The finale is emotionally draining during Taylor's expression of undying love. Unfortunately Clift cannot have it all.   A beautiful piece of classical Hollywood filmmaking with a mix of method acting Clift and a love story we wish could work.RATING 8 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor shine in this adapted Theodore Dreiser novel AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY.  Clift does his finest work in this film showing his sensitivity and incredible good looks making the role of George Easton brilliant.  He is thorough throughout the movie.  His quiet honesty as an actor comes off superbly.  He must had affected Liz Taylor for she gives her most honest work in her career.  Usually the glamour gal but now with substance and simplicity as Angela Vickers the pretty rich girl.  Add to this Shelley Winters in a different kind of role.  Departing from her typical wise dame acting Shelley as Alice Tripp a simple plain girl of poor class comes off wonderfully in a very difficult role.  I hear she had to audition for the director to prove she could act the part.  Of course years later she and Liz both won several Oscars for thir work.  Monty although nominated many times and for this film never won the coveted award. George Stevens directs this romantic tragedy bringing out the excellent work of his actors.  I liked the way he used the camera.  The close up of Clift and Taylor's first kiss on the balcony at a dance was worth the price of admission To see the two most beautiful eyes in Movieland. in a close up as they come together was breathtaking.  Add to that the haunting score by Victor Young or Franz Waxman or both and you have avery beautiful film well acted and directed.  Stevens' use of fading from one scene to another often having a double exposure shot of both scenes at the same time was brilliant and often reminded you of the pending tragedy that was unfolding.  Quick synopsis  George from a poor background leaves home and his mother a sort of Salvation Army sufferer played by that austere and stonefaced Anne Revere comes to work for his uncle in a swim suit factory.  He starts at the bottom as a box sorter and meets along the way a girl who also works at the plant Alice Tripp.  Eventually he gets her in the sack.  He finally gets invited to the boss's house to a dance and meets the rich and pretty Angela.  He falls for her and she for him.  Upon returning to Alice he learns she's pregnant a fact that is tabboo at the plant.  What to do!  Easy .. eliminate Alice by drowning her in a lake.  In a tense and well played scene in the boat on the lake George changes heart and begins to row back when Alice in an attempt to be near George tips the boat and drowns anyway.  Was it on purpose or was it an accident?   That's the big question that is challenged in George's trial after he is acccused of murder.  Of course not until the trial did Angela have any knowledge of George and Alice.  George is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. There's a wonderful quiet scene between Monty and Liz in the prison cell. Only down fall to me was Raymound Burr's overthehill acting as the prosecuting attorney.  He should have done some of his Perry Mason work but that hadn't happened yet. This early 50s film still holds up on VHS and Classic TV viewing.  To add to this review about two weeks after the film opened I met Clift in a bar on Third Avenue in NYC with friends and had a wonderful evening in conversation with him. He talked about Taylor and the movie and his up and coming film  THE HEIRESS.".

Of course not until the trial did Angela have any knowledge of George and Alice.  George is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. There's a wonderful quiet scene between Monty and Liz in the prison cell. Only down fall to me was Raymound Burr's overthehill acting as the prosecuting attorney.  He should have done some of his Perry Mason work but that hadn't happened yet. This early 50s film still holds up on VHS and Classic TV viewing.  To add to this review about two weeks after the film opened I met Clift in a bar on Third Avenue in NYC with friends and had a wonderful evening in conversation with him. He talked about Taylor and the movie and his up and coming film  THE HEIRESS.";

The film's tone varies from romantic to sad to suspenseful. At mysterious Loon Lake where significant events occur the cinematic atmosphere is heavy with anticipation. It's like something out of a Hitchcock thriller.I've never cared much for sad love stories and the film does seem a tad dated. Still it's so well made it can be appreciated by most everyone but the terminally shallow. It has a powerful ending one that accentuates the acting accomplishments of Clift and especially of Taylor. A Place In The Sun was nominated for nine academy awards and winner of six. I'd say this is one time when Oscar voters got it right.".

Liz was in in her prime lookswise with an absolutely classic face.Anyway watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting. Clift as is the case with most of us causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him. The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth. It comes back to bite you bigtime!I really found it refreshing however to see Clift's attitude at the end. It's the exact opposite of what you hear today.

This was one of those rare movies another being 'Dead Man Walking' where I found myself not knowing whether or not to feel sympathy for the main character which I imagine was exactly the audience impartiality that Stevens was aiming for.There is more than one theme prevalent in this movie which makes it so good the main one centering  on love  breaking through social barriers not an uncommon theme but well executed.  There is also an underlying theme of betrayal which is offsets the former theme and is what makes this movie such a success.Even though the movie is centred on the characters of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor it is  Shelley Winters that steals the show.

	schema:headline " Hollywood's greatest film ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.'A Place in the Sun' is for my quids the greatest movie ever made in Hollywood. The film is a reworking of Dreiser's novel 'An American Tragedy' filmed previously which in turn is based on a real murder case. In 1905 a young man named Chester Gillette a supervisor in a skirt factory in upstate New York began an affair with Grace Brown an illpaid employee in the factory. The affair led to Brown becoming pregnant presumably by Gillette. He strung her along for a while assuring her that he intended to marry her but insisting that she not tell anyone else. In the summer of 1906 Gillette lured Brown to a remote lake where he killed her. Overwhelming evidence showed that the murder was premeditated and planned in detail. Gillette was convicted and executed.Although the reallife case is wellknown chroniclers continue to get it wrong by turning the illfated relationship into a triangle. Dreiser's novel introduced a wealthy society girl who became attracted to the Gillette character seeing a chance to enter high society by marrying her Gillette supposedly perceived Grace Brown as an obstacle to his entree to wealth. This is simply not true there was no 'other woman' in the original case although tabloid reporters tried to link Gillette romantically with several local debutantes.Montgomery Clift gives the best performance of his career as the Griffiths character here named George. Shelley Winters whom I usually dislike is deeply impressive and sympathetic here as Alice the simple working girl who's been seduced and traduced. Winters has a deeply moving scene when the pregnant Alice desperately asks a doctor to help her 'take care of' abort her unborn child.Less impressive is Angela the society girl played by Elizabeth Taylor. We're meant to like her yet she behaves irresponsibly. When a highway cop gives Angela the latest in a long series of speeding tickets she laughingly declares that her rich daddy will pay the fine as usual. I can't respect anybody with that attitude. While this film was in production Taylor was married to Nicky Hilton her first husband and the frivolous playboy scion of the Hilton hotel fortune. There's now as I write this another frivolous Hilton heir who's making headlines for irresponsible behaviour and I don't see why I'm supposed to admire people whose bank balances exceed their IQs.Another thing that baffles me about 'A Place in the Sun' is Taylor's famous line to Clift 'Tell mama. Tell mama all.' For some reason this keeps showing up on lists of alltime great movie lines. Yet the line doesn't excite me and the camera isn't even on Taylor's face for most of the line.But ah that camera! Director George Stevens and his brilliant cinematographer William C. Mellor use multiple lap dissolves here. How many films can you name in which a shot begins AND finishes with two separate lap dissolves? How many films can you name in which this effect WORKS rather than just being an attentiongetting device? The photography is excellent throughout aided by Bill Hornbeck's taut editing. I was deeply impressed by an overhead shot of a marsh bird during the murder sequence.There are many great things in 'A Place in the Sun' but the greatest is its moral complexity. At the climax George lures Alice to the remote lake we know he's intending to kill her. But now unexpectedly he tells her his intentions and declares he's changed his mind. This was also done in the previous film version. What's happening here? Has George really reclaimed his conscience or has he merely lost his nerve? We never learn which it is. And now the boat capsizes and Alice drowns ... exactly as if George had murdered her deliberately.The courtroom sequences are harrowing. Ted de Corsia who usually played coarse thugs is a brave casting choice as the judge. Also an interesting choice is Fred Clark  an actor usually associated with comedy roles  as the defence attorney.The moral complexity comes home to roost in a quiet powerful scene between convicted murderer George and the prison chaplain. Another surprising casting choice the chaplain is played by Paul Frees best known for voicing cartoon characters. Reverend Morrison asks George what his emotions were at the moment when Alice died then explains the situation. If George felt relief at Alice's death or any positive reaction then  from a moral standpoint  he is just as guilty of murdering her as if he had actually done the deed.Wow! It's not often that Hollywood movies address the morality of a situation especially one as complex as murder. In a typical Hollywood movie the nearest they get to a moral debate is a gunfight. The last scene with George walking to his execution is deeply haunting ... although I was sceptical that in 1951 an American murderer would be on an allwhite Death Row. What a powerful film. I'll rate 'A Place in the Sun' 10 out of 10 only because the scale doesn't go any higher.".

	onyx:emotionText "CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.'A Place in the Sun' is for my quids the greatest movie ever made in Hollywood. The film is a reworking of Dreiser's novel 'An American Tragedy' filmed previously which in turn is based on a real murder case. In 1905 a young man named Chester Gillette a supervisor in a skirt factory in upstate New York began an affair with Grace Brown an illpaid employee in the factory. The affair led to Brown becoming pregnant presumably by Gillette. He strung her along for a while assuring her that he intended to marry her but insisting that she not tell anyone else. In the summer of 1906 Gillette lured Brown to a remote lake where he killed her. Overwhelming evidence showed that the murder was premeditated and planned in detail. Gillette was convicted and executed.Although the reallife case is wellknown chroniclers continue to get it wrong by turning the illfated relationship into a triangle. Dreiser's novel introduced a wealthy society girl who became attracted to the Gillette character seeing a chance to enter high society by marrying her Gillette supposedly perceived Grace Brown as an obstacle to his entree to wealth. This is simply not true there was no 'other woman' in the original case although tabloid reporters tried to link Gillette romantically with several local debutantes.Montgomery Clift gives the best performance of his career as the Griffiths character here named George. Shelley Winters whom I usually dislike is deeply impressive and sympathetic here as Alice the simple working girl who's been seduced and traduced. Winters has a deeply moving scene when the pregnant Alice desperately asks a doctor to help her 'take care of' abort her unborn child.Less impressive is Angela the society girl played by Elizabeth Taylor. We're meant to like her yet she behaves irresponsibly. When a highway cop gives Angela the latest in a long series of speeding tickets she laughingly declares that her rich daddy will pay the fine as usual. I can't respect anybody with that attitude. While this film was in production Taylor was married to Nicky Hilton her first husband and the frivolous playboy scion of the Hilton hotel fortune. There's now as I write this another frivolous Hilton heir who's making headlines for irresponsible behaviour and I don't see why I'm supposed to admire people whose bank balances exceed their IQs.Another thing that baffles me about 'A Place in the Sun' is Taylor's famous line to Clift 'Tell mama. Tell mama all.' For some reason this keeps showing up on lists of alltime great movie lines. Yet the line doesn't excite me and the camera isn't even on Taylor's face for most of the line.But ah that camera! Director George Stevens and his brilliant cinematographer William C. Mellor use multiple lap dissolves here. How many films can you name in which a shot begins AND finishes with two separate lap dissolves? How many films can you name in which this effect WORKS rather than just being an attentiongetting device? The photography is excellent throughout aided by Bill Hornbeck's taut editing. I was deeply impressed by an overhead shot of a marsh bird during the murder sequence.There are many great things in 'A Place in the Sun' but the greatest is its moral complexity. At the climax George lures Alice to the remote lake we know he's intending to kill her. But now unexpectedly he tells her his intentions and declares he's changed his mind. This was also done in the previous film version. What's happening here? Has George really reclaimed his conscience or has he merely lost his nerve? We never learn which it is. And now the boat capsizes and Alice drowns ... exactly as if George had murdered her deliberately.The courtroom sequences are harrowing. Ted de Corsia who usually played coarse thugs is a brave casting choice as the judge. Also an interesting choice is Fred Clark  an actor usually associated with comedy roles  as the defence attorney.The moral complexity comes home to roost in a quiet powerful scene between convicted murderer George and the prison chaplain. Another surprising casting choice the chaplain is played by Paul Frees best known for voicing cartoon characters. Reverend Morrison asks George what his emotions were at the moment when Alice died then explains the situation. If George felt relief at Alice's death or any positive reaction then  from a moral standpoint  he is just as guilty of murdering her as if he had actually done the deed.Wow! It's not often that Hollywood movies address the morality of a situation especially one as complex as murder. In a typical Hollywood movie the nearest they get to a moral debate is a gunfight. The last scene with George walking to his execution is deeply haunting ... although I was sceptical that in 1951 an American murderer would be on an allwhite Death Row. What a powerful film. I'll rate 'A Place in the Sun' 10 out of 10 only because the scale doesn't go any higher.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Place In The Sun is a dark tragedy in which one man's pursuit of success and romance leads to an incident which ultimately has a devastating effect on the lives of all three of the story's main characters. The screenplay by Harry Brown and Michael Wilson was based on Theodore Dreiser's novel An American Tragedy and is set in a period in which society's rules and attitudes were very much different from those which prevail today.George Eastman Montgomery Clift is the poor nephew of a wealthy factory owner and travels from Chicago to L.A. to take up the offer of employment in his uncle's business which manufactures bathing suits. George is hardworking and makes a good impression but during this period is not entirely comfortable with the other Eastmans because in their company he's sharply aware of his humble background. His consequent loneliness is soon relieved however when he embarks on a secret relationship with Alice Tripp Shelley Winters who works with him on the factory production line.George's good work is rewarded when he's promoted and invited to a party at his uncle's house. He accepts the invitation even though it clashes with an arrangement he'd previously made to celebrate his birthday with Alice. At the Eastmans' party he retires alone to the billiard room where he's later joined by Angela Vickers Elizabeth Taylor who's a bright and pretty society girl. They chat and dance together but later George leaves to return to Alice's place where she gets annoyed at his late arrival and tells him that she's pregnant and he comforts her.When Angela invites George to a party at her parents' house the couple enjoy being together and declare their love for each other. Angela has plans to spend the summer at her parents' vacation home by Loon Lake and George subsequently accepts Angela's invitation to spend some time there after telling Alice that he'll be with his uncle and is likely to be offered a bonus which will benefit them both. Alice soon recognises what's going on however when she sees a newspaper photograph of Angela and George having fun together at the lake. Alice responds by threatening to expose the truth about their relationship unless George agrees to marry her without delay. The way in which he deals with this ultimatum leads to an incident on the lake and to him eventually being arrested on a murder charge.The events in A Place In The Sun happen at a time when being pregnant and unmarried was considered to be shameful legal abortion was not available and anyone in Alice's predicament could find themselves cruelly stigmatised for years. With the stakes so high it's understandable why she became so fearful and angry at George's uncertainty and reluctant agreement to getting married.In a society in which respect and success mostly seem to be measured in direct proportion to the level of a person's wealth it's also understandable how George an unskilled and poorly educated young man who came from an impoverished background would instinctively reach for the best of everything that was made available to him. He was ambitious but not ruthless and this combination of qualities makes him react to his problems in a more complex confused and interesting way than might otherwise be expected.Angela Vickers had enjoyed a privileged upbringing during which her life had been very uncomplicated and frivolous. Her relationship with George had also developed at a time when she was unaware of his involvement with Alice and she was therefore not at all well equipped emotionally to come to terms with what happened to him.Elizabeth Taylor is scintillating and self confident in her role and Shelley Winters is convincing and skilled in how well she portrays Alice's transformation from an ordinary working class girl into someone who becomes very scared angry and needy. Montgomery Clift is incredibly powerful in the way in which he conveys all the turmoil confusion and anxiety that his character goes through as he tries to come to terms with the conflicts that arise when the pursuit of his ambitions becomes incompatible with the responsibility that he has to Alice. Similarly the soul searching that he goes through towards the end of the movie is also depicted in a very sensitive and haunting way.Appropriately for such a tragic and troubling tale the mood of the film is often sombre with the use of effective closeups heightening the intensity of what's happening on screen. The use of shadows is also impressive in many scenes such as the one where Alice gets into a car with George after visiting the doctor. At a time when she's feeling trapped and desperate the area around her face is visible but the remainder of the screen is symbolically totally engulfed in shadow.A Place In The Sun is an absorbing and touching film which has clearly deserved all the popularity and critical success that it's achieved over the years.".

	schema:reviewBody "A place in the sun is one of the most Romantic films ever produced and the beauty of Elizabeth Taylor is just beyond belief. I remember seeing the film when I was very young and without remembering the title remembered only ET's beauty. M Clift is beautiful as well and presumably Shelley Winters is made to look especially ugly notably when she calls Eastman from the bus station and orders him to come and collect her or she will reveal all. Plastically very beautiful the film is also an interesting study on the notion of guilt . Eastman sets out to kill Tripp does everything including lying to get her out on the boat and then can't go through with it. The boat turns over and we don't really see what becomes of Tripp nor do we see Eastman trying to save her. The way events are presented in the trial even if we are supposed to assume that Eastman didn't want to go through with it makes the guilt fall squarely on Eastman's shoulders to a point that even he has difficulty admitting he is innocent. The final scenes with his mother and the minister in the prison cell are very hard to take. Both these personnages seem to consider him guilty and at the end of the film one is left wondering whether he is guilty or not. It's his intention to murder tripp rather than the fact that he actually bumped her off which takes him to the electric chair. One therefore poses the question  Is the intention to kill as bad as killing itself??  Where do you draw the line when trying to determine the level of guilt between intention and reality ? Let's face it we don't really see precisely what happens in the boat during those last fateful seconds. Ambiguity is the key word here and Eastman's behaviour and lying obviously lead the jury to condemn him. Away from the sombre side of the story we have E Taylor's stunning beauty and love for Eastman whatever the cost and whatever he has done. Does love like that really exist. I don't believe so for one single minute but this is a film and films must make us dream!! And dreaming at least helps to offset the crude reality of life. One last thing the music of the film is beautiful. I'm sure many people know the music without knowing it's title and where it comes from. Years ago it was the theme music for a program on French TV called Cincinemas.".

I don't believe so for one single minute but this is a film and films must make us dream!! And dreaming at least helps to offset the crude reality of life. One last thing the music of the film is beautiful. I'm sure many people know the music without knowing it's title and where it comes from. Years ago it was the theme music for a program on French TV called Cincinemas.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1906 there resided in upstate New York a young man named Chester Gillette. Mr. Gillette was good looking and ambitious and hoped to better his social and financial situation by family connections and a socially advantageous marriage to a wealthy young woman. But Gillette had been dating Grace Brown a farmer's daughter and Brown found out she was pregnant. She insisted that Gillette marry her or she would reveal what he did to her. Gillette arranged for her to meet him at a resort at Big Moose Lake in the Adirondacks but they were to go there separately and he made sure they were not seen together too much. Actually they were seen many times together  like many schemers Gillette thought he had accomplished his intentions but actually had failed to do so.He took Grace out on a boat supposedly to enjoy the quiet pleasures of the lake. Something occurred in that boat  we will never know for certain. The majority of us feel certain that Chester hit Grace with either an oar or a tennis racket knocking her unconscious into the water so that she drowned. However he always maintained she hit her head after upsetting the boat on the overturned boat. We just don't know. Chester's behavior after the accident was that of a skulking coward not revealing himself to the authorities or seeking assistance but trying to get back to his room at a local hotel to get his luggage. He was arrested within a few days and a trial took place that became nationally prominent. At the end of the trial Chester Gillette was convicted of first degree murder. After an appeal failed Chester was electrocuted in 1908.Roughly seventeen years later Theodore Dreiser was considering his next literary project. Dreiser's social views were left of center and he wanted to write a novel that tore open the materialist center of American social values. It was to be based on a famous homicide case that was based on misguided attempts at social advancement. Dreiser looked at several cases another one was a notorious 1911 case the murder of Avis Linnell in Massachusetts by Reverend Charles Richeson  the Reverend poisoned Miss Linnell who stood in his way to an advantageous marriage. Dreiser decided the story of Chester Gillette fit the bill. It was to tell in fictional form of course the background of the case the social pressures that lead to the main event and the trial of the hero as well as his condemnation and execution. Changing the name of the hero to Clyde Griffiths note the same initials as Chester's published the novel as an attack on the misguided social clawing and status seeking in our capitalist society. As such it was entitled An American Tragedy.The novel was a success perhaps Dreiser's masterpiece. He helped dramatize it in the late 1920s and in 1931 it was filmed for the first time as by Joseph Von Sternberg. But much was cut out of that version and Dreiser was so upset he sued Paramount and Von Sternberg and lost the case. That film version with Phillips Holmes as Clyde and Sylvia Sidney as the doomed girl was actually quite good on its own merits.In 1947 Dreiser died. In 1951 George Stevens assembled the production staff and cast including Monty Cliff Shelley Winters Elizabeth Taylor Raymond Burr Fred Clark and Keefe Brazzell. It is a wonderfully rich and good film showing the shocking underside of the American dream just as Dreiser would have hoped. The central figure is no longer Clyde Griffiths but George Eastman but Monty Cliff shows how a basically hard working young man is destroyed pursuing his dream of success. And again the film properly leaves the central issue  did ChesterClydeGeorge kill his girlfriend and try to make it look like an accident or did he change his mind but there was an accident or did he panic when in the water and fail to save her. Was it a moral crime rather than a factual one? Raymond Burr's performance in the part of the local district attorney is one of the two movie roles the other is Lars Thorwald in REAR WINDOW that people recall if not thinking of his great television career. As the District Attorney Burr usually typecast as villains actually is a heavy but one with a moral mission. He is certain that this was murder pure and simple and he is going to avenge poor Shelley Winters. His performance when cross examining Cliff is a marvel particularly the moment he bares down on the spot Winters was sitting at with an oar and smashes it. It has been called over the top but it is deservedly over the top. And I suspect it was also important for Burr's future career as well. It was a great way for him to demonstrate his strength appearing as a courtroom gladiator. I am certain that when casting for the Perry Mason series occurred a few years later the producers recalled what a splendid job Burr did here when considering hiring him. The rest was television history.".

	schema:headline " A Closer Look at Two Key Themes";
	schema:reviewBody "Outstanding example of Hollywood craftsmanship attention to detail and sheer romanticism. The film takes up two key themes in American life class and morality treating each with uncommon care. Consider the opening scene of the indigent George Clift standing roadside while cars whiz past much as life seems to be brushing him aside. Mocking him at the same time is a billboard with a provocative girl advertising the Good Life. No wonder he rushes to his rich uncle Eastman's mansion where he hopes to join the fast cars and the beautiful girl if he dare to hope so.That scene of his entering the mansion's huge reception room is to me one of the movie's best. In his cheap wrong color suit George couldn't be more selfconscious. How will the rich Eastmans' receive him in their fancy party clothes ready for a night on the town. In fact they are oh so polite while keeping a social distance. After all he does come from the poor family branch his mother giving her life over to religious pursuits instead of money. For his brief visit at least he gets a job on an Eastman assembly line. The scene itself is beautifully staged and performed while Clift is simply terrific here as the uncertain poor relation all deference and submission.For awhile it looks like the cars will continue to whiz by as he repeats the same deadening moves on the assembly line. But at least he has someone now to share time with. Alice Winters is a dowdy working girl across from him. Lonely they soon get together. But now life gets complicated for George. Suddenly one day he's promoted to administration at the same time he's invited to a party at the mansion. Eagerly he attends this time dressed appropriately and ready to please but he's still bypassed by other guests. Then in another memorable scene lightning again strikes in the form of the beauteous Angela note the classy name who suddenly enters his solitary billiards room where he has retreated friendless. Can it be as they banter that she's taking a real fancy to him with all her upper class ways. An unmistakable glow begins to emerge on screen and it's a tribute to both Taylor and Clift that their chemistry is both vivid and compelling in this key scene that sets the stage for what follows. Now it seems a whizzing car has stopped for him and all he has to do is get in. But back at the rooming house waiting for him is Alice. Not just a reminder of the roadside life he'd like to leave she's pregnant and insisting on marriage. So on one hand he's got the frumpy working class Alice alone and pregnant and on the other a budding romance with the glitzy upper class Angela who's opened the door to the billboard life he could only dream of. What's George to do. Then in a gutsy scene for the repressed 1950's Alice is sent to a doctor Wolfe for what by inference only is an abortion. The writers do a clever job getting her purpose across without violating the Production Code's prohibition on such frank talk. Nonetheless the doctor firmly refuses leaving both George and Alice in a real pickle.With his religious background George still has a conscience even if he's deeply in love with Angela and drawn to her materialistic world. Thus the question is which direction he will go in will he do the morally right thing and marry Alice or will he succumb to the pull of a glamorous life with Angela. In short which is stronger moral duty or romantic love. In a moment of moral weakness George plans to relieve his dilemma by drowning Alice in a lake seemingly the only recourse left open to a life with Angela. But fate the call of the loon intervenes and Alice accidentally tips over the small boat they're in. Importantly the camera withdraws at that point to a distance shot so that we cannot see exactly what happens next. But Alice ends up dead by drowning just as George had planned when giving false names to the boat rental. However having escaped George is now torn by a sense of guilt even as he and Angela plan to marry the whizzing car door now open wide. But it's at that fateful point the cops put various clues together and arrest George for murder. But is he really guilty. We can't be sure since we never saw the exact events. It seems not even George is sure. If nothing else at this point George is trying to come to grips with what his intention was vs. what actually happened in the water. Could he have saved her as the DA contends at George's trial. She couldn't have been far away then why didn't he. George seems unclear himself. In a melodramatic moment the DA Burr claims George struck Alice with a paddle thereby insuring her death. But that is clearly wrong since we know what happened in the boat. But the jury apparently buys it otherwise how could they sentence him to firstdegree murder. Thus the car door closes on George forever.The question iswhat is George really guilty of. Is it just the intention but not the act itself. Or is it the act in some illdefined sense. The movie settles for being guilty of a wrong thought at a crucial moment. That may be blameworthy in some metaphysical sense but certainly doesn't justify his execution. As things stand George's sentence stands as a miscarriage of justice. In that sense the movie turns out to be a tragedy particularly for Alice whose only crime is being poor and frumpy. The moral I guess is that what may seem an up spiral may actually be its ironical opposite.Anyway it's a brilliantly sensitive thought provoking movie deserving of its many awards.".

George with his dark good looks starts working in his uncle's garment factory but he has ambitions about how to be part of the wealthy family. We watch him as he goes from the packing area into a more important position. It's his ambition that proves to be his undoing.Theodore Dreiser the great American writer wrote An American Tragedy which was published in 1925. The book was a social commentary on the country during those years. Mr. Dreiser was above all a social reformer his book dealt with a reality that doesn't appear in the movie. By the way the book was first adapted as a stage play by Patrick Kearney. When the time came to turn this classic for the screen the task fell on Josef Von Sternberg to direct the film treatment in 1931.The book finally got the interest of George Stevens a Hollywood film director who up to that point didn't have great dramatic credentials behind him. Mr. Stevens was a cinematographer first who later on took to directing. The screen play by Michael Wilson and Harry Brown was typical of the Hollywood of those years. There was so much that could be shown on the screen at the time without arousing the Hays Code people into action.A Place in the Sun was an ambitious project for the film makers. The casting of Montgomery Clift one of the best actors of that era proved to be a coup for Mr. Stevens and his team. The young Elizabeth Taylor in one of her first dramatic roles added sexual allure to the production as it's clear the camera adored her as much as it loved Montgomery Clift. Both actors made them a romantic couple that lured viewers to the theaters. Shelley Winters was cast as the plain Alice Tripp who is the pivotal figure in the novel as well as in the film.George Eastman is said to be modeled after Hamlet. It makes perfect sense as he is an indecisive man whose loneliness when he first arrives in the town makes him crave to belong to the social circle of his uncle. When he starts working in the factory George seeks Alice Tripp for his own pleasure without taking into consideration the terrible consequences of his actions. When Angela the beautiful rich and sophisticated girl appears George figures he has to ditch Alice who is a peasant girl after all. This turn of events make George hate the loving Alice.Theodore Dreiser wanted to make a statement about George. How this young man was a victim of the materialistic society he wanted to belong to as well as pointing to George as a monster that falls prey to his desire to belong to that same society that looked down on him when he first enters it. George learns his lesson too late and he can't escape his fate.A Place in the Sun although superficial still shows some aspects of the novel. The best thing in the film is Montgomery Clift playing George Eastman. He brought his own brand of intensity into the character and he is at his best in his scenes with Elizabeth Taylor. Shelley Winters did what she could with a role that had limitations. In supporting roles we see Raymond Burr Keefe Brasselle Fred Clark Shepperd Strudwick and Herbert Heyes among others.The other interesting aspect of the film is the great music score by Franz Waxman that blends easily into the background. William Mellor's cinematography especially the lake sequence adds luster to the film. George Stevens was lucky in getting all this talent involved in the movie and although it doesn't say much about what Theodore Dreiser intended to as an entertainment it has its merits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain however it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.I have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody's masterpiece I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me. The NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where's Woody? Well he's in London but the place and time despite the opinions of some critics are largely irrelevant in this film.There is only one line in this film that indicates its origin  it has something to do with 'intertwined neuroses' and nearly made me laugh. The first 34ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable and if you're like me you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out!  you've just been hooked and Woody's about to reel you in! Match Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first defining its territory as a smart hip and sophisticated character study early on in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him. The performances and cinematography in this film are allaround the best I've seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very closein face shots and his cast handles it with ease performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot  this is easily Woody's most plotheavy film and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. The story line of Match Point is powerful disturbing and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody's own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well from my perspective it is simply damn good storytelling.Highly recommended for adult audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and what a great stroke of luck it is to have sat through Woody Allen's latest Match Point. Fans of Woody could sense his comeback in the tragedy half of his last effort Melinda and Melinda. It was far more compelling than the comedy half and the philosophical ideas it brought up were the best Woody Allen had given us in a long while. Here with Match Point he explores the notion of luck and gives us his best film since....well since I don't know when. He proves here that when he leaves himself out of the cast and changes locations the transition from New York City to London is as flawless as it is invigorating he can deliver the goods. This film free of all the typical Allen shtick and full of noirish twists and surprises is every bit as good as Robert Altman's The Player or Gosford Park and like those two films it's the best kind of return to form you could hope for from a past master.Chris Wilton played moderately well by Johnathan Rhys Myers who comes across as a more handsome Joquin Phoenix is a failed tennis pro from Ireland who gets a plum job at a snobbish country club in London where he meets up with Tom an appropriately British Matthew Goode woos his sister Chloe an adorable Emily Mortimer and has an affair with Tom's flighty fiance a struggling American actress named Nola a ravishing Scarlett Johansson. The film starts off like a more refined version of last year's tawdry affair Closer with Allen exploring the love lives of semibored overeducated filthy rich Brits who when not hopping in and out of each other's beds are hobnobbing at the opera the latest art exhibit or lounging around their lavish estates reading and drinking. There's also a hint of The Talented Mr. Ripley in its exploration of the class system and Chris' obsession with infiltrating this exclusive and beguiling society. Thankfully we're spared all of the weirdness of an atrocity like Ripley as Allen keeps it all very clean sheen clever and classy.The film takes some dark turns and has some operatic overtures spiced with some Dostoevsky references and plenty of pondering on luck. Allen here doesn't seem to be writing off the need for hard work completely but to achieve a truly privileged life where one can get away with just about anything you better have a lot of luck.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Woody Allen's most polarizing films so far as I can tell there seems to be very little neutral feeling on Match Point viewers either hail it as a latecareer gem or deride it as an absolutely miscast poorlyscripted farce. It's neither really what the film demonstrates best is that anything 'new' in Woody Allen films is essentially the Emperor's new clothes.The novelty in Match Point is that the director has found a new playpen to cast his sophisticated characters and their discussions of high art and snobby social um concerns in this case London. Chris an Irish semipro tennis player earns the trust of a rich upperclass English family and marries into it. Then there's his jealous mistress Scarlett Johansson a struggling American actress on the side. Their emotional dramas are played out through visits to the opera and art gallery in which in one line a character is marveling at the intensity of an artist's brushstrokes and in the next are talking about having an affair or getting knocked up. It all sounds rather pretentious on paper but here Allen's talent as a writer and behind the lens takes over and makes it all somehow believable even compelling for a good hour of its runtime.A common complaint with the film is that the attempts at British speak are risible and stilted. I'm not English myself so I'm not sure how accurate these criticisms are but there are patches of dialog that are either clumsy or too obvious Allen seems obsessed with tossing foreshadowing into his character's dialog a trick that lends the production a feeling as artificial as the mechanics of his storyline. The whole tennis subplot is weakly written as well as executed and could do with being excised. In terms of acting Jonathan Rhys Meyers severely underplays his calculated lead character appearing generally disinterested and sleepwalking through his part and Scarlett Johansson is very good as his love interest with a screen presence that makes the relationship between the two work  on that note it's doubtful whether there's been a director as obsessed with his blonde star since Hitchcock. The supporting turns from Emily Mortimer Matthew Goode and Brian Cox are all convincing and the direction is generally good.The problem with Match Point is that there's a nagging evidence of pretension and patchiness that prevents the film from being entirely absorbing even when it's at its best  not usually a recommendable combination. In addition Allen takes a serious wrong turn in the last third or so of his drama. Depending how you see it what unfolds is either a plot twist or an aspiration for the sort of high drama you get in operas get it? because the characters all love the arts so much! yet it casts a 'wtf' shadow over the whole film. And then proceedings get weirder still via ghosts hallucinations and more clunky dialog... I felt cheated.Misgivings aside Match Point winds up a competent film with all of Woody Allen's expected trademarks and is worth seeing for Scarlett Johansson's performance. Despite being muddled it provides  despite its highart focus  fairly decent trashy entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Would it that this film had been made in the Forties or Fifties when filmnoir was at its high point! Woody Allen one of America's best directors pays his homage to the genre in his latest film about romantic obsession and if his name weren't in the opening credits you wouldn't know he directed it. Taking a break from filming in the city he loves the most deleting every trace of the well known neurotic hoots and clicks from his main and supporting British cast and even removing the trademark reference to his own persona from Jonathan RhysMeyers' performance MATCH POINT becomes a very European film that starts out deceptively as a character study with comedic tones and ever so subtle moves into the darker side of love echoing THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and of all films FATAL ATTRACTION.A love quadrangle the oldest plot device is Allen's focus this time Chris Wilton RhysMeyers a retired tennis player becomes an instructor to Tom Hewett Matthew Goode. Both find that they have similar interests such as the love of opera and the works of Dostoyevsky. They have another similar interest but I'm getting there. Tom invites Chris for an evening at the opera and introduces him to his family and sister Chloe Emily Mortimer who falls for him and who later on signifies familial safety in all forms. Sensing an opportunity to climb the social ladder he starts seeing her just as he meets Nola Rice Scarlett Johanssen an aspiring American actress whom he openly flirts with until he realizes she's Tom's girlfriend but an outsider in the Wilton household. A clandestine affair between Chris and Nola begins tentative at first  she advises him against it since it would ruin his chances to become a success and she is engaged to Tom  but turns deeper. However a turn of events transpire taking Nola out of the picture having Tom marry another girl and Chris marry Chloe and start to get complicated once Chris tracks Nola down.Like I said would it that MATCH POINT would have been filmed 60 years ago because everything in it smolders like the plot elements of the sleekest of noir films. With a deliberate pace that begins taking a sinister shape after the second half Allen misdirects the audience to the very core. Allen avoids any trace of romantic melodrama though and in showing what actually transpires between a couple ensnared in an affair  their initial bedazzlement their passion consummated turning into routine and then its painful decline  is true to life. Nola initially seen in white much like Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE seems to be in total control until Allen deftly pulls the rug out of her feet and has her do a slow collapse into her own trap dressed in darker and darker colors. Chris at first so lusts after her it's a question if he can choose her love over social status and this becomes the crux of MATCH POINT whether the tennis ball falls over the net or not.There are moments when you think that a director who once had his audience eating out of his hand has gone into autopilot or entered a point of no return. Up until recently Woody Allen had had even his most hardcore fans put through the ringer with film after film of a disposable nature. With this film which has a strong connection to CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS he shows that he never was gone. In erasing all references to his staccatto style he wins over a new audience willing to accept his work with ease and this is at times necessary like Hitchcock's selfeffacing FRENZY MATCH POINT is an excellent movie showcasing a director in full control of his ability to tell a visual tale. Maybe not up there with the best of his roster but pretty damn close and that's saying quite a wallop.".

Both find that they have similar interests such as the love of opera and the works of Dostoyevsky. They have another similar interest but I'm getting there. Tom invites Chris for an evening at the opera and introduces him to his family and sister Chloe Emily Mortimer who falls for him and who later on signifies familial safety in all forms. Sensing an opportunity to climb the social ladder he starts seeing her just as he meets Nola Rice Scarlett Johanssen an aspiring American actress whom he openly flirts with until he realizes she's Tom's girlfriend but an outsider in the Wilton household. A clandestine affair between Chris and Nola begins tentative at first  she advises him against it since it would ruin his chances to become a success and she is engaged to Tom  but turns deeper. However a turn of events transpire taking Nola out of the picture having Tom marry another girl and Chris marry Chloe and start to get complicated once Chris tracks Nola down.Like I said would it that MATCH POINT would have been filmed 60 years ago because everything in it smolders like the plot elements of the sleekest of noir films. With a deliberate pace that begins taking a sinister shape after the second half Allen misdirects the audience to the very core. Allen avoids any trace of romantic melodrama though and in showing what actually transpires between a couple ensnared in an affair  their initial bedazzlement their passion consummated turning into routine and then its painful decline  is true to life. Nola initially seen in white much like Lana Turner in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE seems to be in total control until Allen deftly pulls the rug out of her feet and has her do a slow collapse into her own trap dressed in darker and darker colors. Chris at first so lusts after her it's a question if he can choose her love over social status and this becomes the crux of MATCH POINT whether the tennis ball falls over the net or not.There are moments when you think that a director who once had his audience eating out of his hand has gone into autopilot or entered a point of no return. Up until recently Woody Allen had had even his most hardcore fans put through the ringer with film after film of a disposable nature. With this film which has a strong connection to CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS he shows that he never was gone. In erasing all references to his staccatto style he wins over a new audience willing to accept his work with ease and this is at times necessary like Hitchcock's selfeffacing FRENZY MATCH POINT is an excellent movie showcasing a director in full control of his ability to tell a visual tale. Maybe not up there with the best of his roster but pretty damn close and that's saying quite a wallop.";

	schema:headline " engrossing tale of adultery and obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "In Match Point Woody Allen caught in one of his more serious moods takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating. Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy albeit set in England perhaps to throw us off the scent. The parallels between the two works are not perfect of course  in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted  but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did indeed do it all on purpose.Jonathan RhysMeyers plays Chris Wilton a downonhisluck social climber who marries into wealth but longs for the passion he finds with another woman. Chris is a professional tennis player who decides to leave the circuit when he realizes he hasn't the skill to compete with the real pros. Taking a job as an instructor at a posh highly exclusive tennis club Chris finds himself wining and dining with the rich and famous after one of his pupils Tom Hewett takes a liking to him and introduces Chris to his snooty but accepting family. Chris begins to date Tom's warmhearted sister Chloe but he is really smitten by an aspiring American actress Nola who just happens to be Tom's fianc. Chris makes the mistake of marrying Chloe before Tom and Nola call off their engagement and go their separate ways. The fact that Nola is free but he is not doesn't deter Chris from pursing an affair with the woman who provides all the passion and excitement his loving but boring wife cannot. But Chris soon discovers that carrying on an affair can result in a life filled with secrecy lies guilt and selfloathing. And when the going gets to be just a bit too much for our hero to handlewell there's always that final solution lurking in the wings as many an earlier adulterer has discovered to his everlasting regret.Match Point starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love. Yet Allen really knows how to draw us into Chris' predicament so that by about halfway into the film we feel as enmeshed in his seemingly irreconcilable dilemma as he himself is. Torn between the wealth and position he has as Chloe's husband and the love he feels for the relatively impoverished Nola Chris is frozen into a state of paralyzing indecisiveness his every waking moment a tormenting hell of fear and gathering dread as he keeps waiting in breathless anticipation for that other shoe to drop. It isn't until the other woman becomes more of a burden than his clinging wife that Chris can finally launch into action. This turnabout in the screenplay might strike many in the audience as arbitrary and implausible and there is certainly a case to be made for that. But if you can go with the flow you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that for all the efforts we make to control our lives The Fickle Finger of Fate  or in this case a tennis ball precariously balancing on the top of a net trying to figure out which way to fall  always has the final word.Allen has written dialogue that is incisive intelligent and literate and the performances he's drawn from the likes of RhysMeyers Goode Emily Mortimer Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail. Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance keeping us firmly locked in the nearclaustrophobic drama. Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.Guided by the hands of a master Match Point is one of Allen's finest films in years.".

	schema:headline " Quite possibly... IMO";
	schema:reviewBody "The best Woody Allen movie in about 15 years. I would've said that a couple of months back about 'Melinda and Melinda' but this is a far better cry than Melinda and Melinda. Don't get me wrong I think Melinda and Melinda is a good movie but 'Match' is more fulfilling.Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris Wilton a former tennis pro turned tennis teacher who is of Irish lower class. He is shocked to find out he got a job as a tennis instructor in a high class country club. There he meets Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode in a very strong performance. What Rhys Meyers does is unbelievable he showcases what he is really made of in this movie. Chris sounds like a simple person but what Rhys Meyers did was make him a person of complexity. From the moments of solitude when he's in the same room as his family the way he grieves for what he's doing and what he is about to do is very convincing.Emily Mortimer plays Chloe Hewett Wilton Chris' wife and Tom's sister. Also what Mortimer does is also outstanding even though she isn't given much to make Chloe a person rather than a persona Mortimer makes Chloe a person with ease. In my opinion I think Emily Mortimer does a better job of playing her character than Kate Winslet would've done had she been attached. She has the right notes and chemistry with Jonathan Rhys Meyers to make their marriage and romance very believable and what Mortimer does in the moments of denial and solitude she is given she makes Chloe a complete person. This performance should make her a star.Scarlett Johansson gives in my opinion maybe her 2nd best performance in this movie. Johansson is OUTSTANDING as Nola Rice a struggling actress. Johansson shows us her range to play this character the epitome of tragic beauty Johansson combines elements of sexuality desire nostalgia in one being. Though this performance may not be as good as her performance in Lost in Translation its still good enough to get her an Academy Award Nomination.Match Point starts off as a drama and works its way into being a very tense psychological thriller and Woody Allen shows he is still in top form by trying something daring and pulling it off. This movie is a silent masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been said but for a while one of the best filmmakers of the 20th century has been staggering with mediocre films not nearly up to his potential. But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.Match Point offers a simple but powerful message that luck plays a huge part in everyday life which to a major extent is true. Luck plays a huge part in Chris Wiltons life when he gets a job as a tennis trainer at a fancy club and meets Tom the son of a rich business man. Tom invites Chris to an opera where he meets Chloe the sister of Tom. From there Chris and Chloe start to date and Chris a small and unwealthy man gets introduced to high society life. He's offered a high stakes job a personal driver etc just to bring happiness into the life of Chloe.Chris is perfectly content until he meets the beautiful Nola played by Scarlett Johansson. Nola is everything Chloe is not exciting extremely sexy and unwealthy which leads to Chris's dilemma. Nola and Chris begin an affair that leads to even more once Tom dumps Nola giving Chris the opportunity to live out all his sexual desires with a beautiful woman but the high life of Chloe overpowers the little ambitions and lack of money. Match Point is about luck but also about choices made in life for personal enjoyment. Is it better to be rich and not completely satisfied or poor and happy? As a failure Chris finds luck with Chloe's rich family willing to set him up with whatever he desires.The film is very similar to Woody's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors and it takes similar turns. Chris gets himself in the situation where he must choose from a small life with a woman he is satisfied and turned on by or choose a high society life with a woman he barely loves and lacks attraction to. I won't tell you what he chooses but I will tell you the dilemma leads Allen to his most satisfying tense engaging film in over a decade.It's great to see Allen take such a simple premise used several times and put all his trademark qualities into it mixed with a discovery of new terrain. Match Point is an engaging entertaining film that gives you a taste of the high life and shows you what it can lead a man to. 1010 for this excellent film by the great Woody Allen. Let's hope this is a revelation for Allen returning him to morality filmmaking.".

	schema:headline " a serious channeling of Dostoyevsky via infidelity drama by Woody Allen";
	schema:reviewBody "Match Point is my favorite Americandirected film of 2005. Woody Allen coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda goes back to his darker dramatic side and makes a story that may seem a little familiar though not to his discredit. Woody borrows some may say steal elements from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment one of the great novels of the 19th century some may say ever written I have read his work though not this yet and transfuses it with subject matter that he's more than well acquainted with the relationship drama. But unlike Love and Death which was Allen's way of parodying the work of the author this time he takes the work seriously plunging the audience into the mind conflicts and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved particularly the three main leads are top notch Jonathan RhysMyers Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best brings full blood and flesh to Woody's strong skeleton of a film.The story starts slow. Chris Wilton RhysMyers is an Irishman in London a tennis instructor who could've gone pro. He meets Chloe Mortimer through her brother Tom Matthew Goode and they soon become close close enough for marriage. Basically he marries into an upperclass family where he's coaxed into becoming a businessman for the family. But during this he also meets Nola Rice Scarlett Johansson a struggling American actress who's engaged to Tom. One thing leads to another yadayada and Chris winds up in a big pickle as he's in a lovetriangle between Chloe and Nola. Allen handles this dilemma with a powerful precision by building up the relationships Chris has with each girl and how there is not unbelievability in the setups. Nola is sensible and intelligent if not altogether while Chloe is caring and decent if maybe too picture perfect for Chris. The dynamics are setup so well it leaves room for ample drama and suspense.Allen who has also been a playwright for decades knows the way people interact like so and how not to rush the situations and use tact with delicate scenes. There is also the element of Opera which Chris sees with Chloe's family often and the element of tennis. The analogies that both produce could possibly be very trite or clich. It's not to say a couple of scenes are even clich ladies you know you've seen quite a few movies with passionate kissing in the rain but I even bought into those scenes. There is perhaps a certain manipulation that goes into these kinds of love stories how much the audience can go with the inner conflict of our main character. But as the protagonist goes into a frame of mind that most may not be able to identify with we're still with him all the way. And perhaps it's also because I love a good solid infidelity story. Allen has here not only his best film in several years but also likely his most suspenseful one.Those who may not go with the sympathies or empathy for the characters may not like the film as much. Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film like RhysMyers's unconvincing accent or the overusage of London's most famous landmarks. As an American perhaps I didn't mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script and Woody pushing 70 in making this is not amateur and has the right cast it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an understatement and at the core was even cathartic in a way. It's the kind of film I would love to tell more people about even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably lessthangreat pictures. For some it might not even 'feel' like a Woody Allen movie that at times it's a little 'slick'. It still is however the work of an artist reaching further into his grabbag with younger exciting actors and an interesting use of a finally new city.".

Some have even criticized minor gripes with the film like RhysMyers's unconvincing accent or the overusage of London's most famous landmarks. As an American perhaps I didn't mind certain things like these. When a filmmaker has this much trust in his script and Woody pushing 70 in making this is not amateur and has the right cast it just takes off from there. To say I was on the edge of my seat through a good chunk of the third act is an understatement and at the core was even cathartic in a way. It's the kind of film I would love to tell more people about even if they think Woody is washed up after years of arguably lessthangreat pictures. For some it might not even 'feel' like a Woody Allen movie that at times it's a little 'slick'. It still is however the work of an artist reaching further into his grabbag with younger exciting actors and an interesting use of a finally new city.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first part of 'Match Point' about the drift of the hero into a passionate but adulterous affair is pretty good. But even in these scenes there are problems. For example there is a love making scene in a field in the rain. I guess it is supposed to resonate with unbridled passion  but all I could think of is how uncomfortable the lovers would be in the cold English rain and damp prickly hay. I generally enjoy tasteful erotic scenes but the concept is preposterous.However this is small potatoes compared to the utter idiocy of the criminal plot and subsequent police work. The hero steals a skeet gun belonging to his fatherinlaw to murder his mistress by staging a robbery. He kills a neighbor and then his girlfriend the notion being that she surprised the thief. Both times the gun makes a polite little pop. Did Allen or any of the critics who praised this movie ever consider what sort of sound a skeet rifle ACTUALLY makes? When fired indoors? The entire building would shake. The reverbations would be heard for blocks around. The murderer would be found out in two minutes. The whole concept is utter nonsense. Hitchcock never overlooked such realistic details in his movies.But infinitely worse is the police work  the typical contempt of a New York intellectual for the solid common sense of everyday life. One of the detectives sees through the scheme. But he gives up when a drug addict is discovered with an item of jewelry from the theft. Allen actually believes the police are not going to wonder how such a derelict came to possess an expensive skeet rifle? Or what happened to it? Or will not run routine ballistic tests on the rifles the father owns the hero's motive being known to them? That they will close out a double homicide on one flimsy possibly coincidental bit of evidence? Do be serious. There is more thoughtfulness in the first five minutes of any 'Law and Order' episode than this.This movie is a little better than Allen's recent stuff  the drift into adultery is really good. But the plot twist is just plain stupid. The critics are rooting so hard for Allen that they overlook the sheer dumbness of the plot.

	schema:reviewBody "Well. And what a waste of 8 euros Match Point turned out to be. As it happens Woody Allen couldn't get financing in the US or at least without strings attached so he's decided to go and milk the BBC instead. Which means in effect that he recycled a story he'd written for a New York setting straight into a London setting without any attempt at any significant rewrite. And written is a loose term. An American Tragedy meets A Place In The Sun meets Room at the Top meets The Talented Mr. Ripley meets but let's not get carried away Le Rouge et le Noir. Ambitious poor boy courts aristocratic rich girl then gets torn between rich inlaws and poor girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks. If you think this is too generic a summary that's the whole point Match Point is nothing but generic.It's not just that Jonathan Rhys Meyers' young Irish tennis pro speaks like a 1950s BBC presenter without a hint of an explanation of how it came to him it's that when he meets an old tennis acquaintance in the street or when he bursts into a rage his accent doesn't change. Everybody in the movie speaks RP except for the ScotandCockneycoppersascomicrelief and the property agent right at the beginning probably because he was initially written as yammering in broad Brooklynese. It's not just that sugardaddy's country house is totally unconvincing if he's old money walltowall carpeting? or his accent is if he's Alan Sugar. It's not just that somehow I can't imagine a London copper calling someone a schmuck or a Sloane Ranger however arty mention that a couple is made in heaven because their neuroses match. Or another Sloane boasting of getting good invitations because she was born in Belgravia. Or that the country house set would welcome their daughter marrying a tennis instructor. Or that the cocktailswilling son of the house all publicschool accent and JeevesandWoosterish quips could get away with calling even the hired help Hey Irish meaning it to be affectionate. Although the initial meeting between said son played on automatic pilot by Matthew Goode and JRM as his tennis coach at the Kensington Queen's Club plays like nothing more than a gay pickup all Oh you like opera? My father gives a tonne of money to Covent Garden can I take you to Traviata tomorrow night? for entirely too long for his sister to look like anything but a beard for the rest of the movie. Or that even Richard Branson could just snap his fingers and said tennis pro becomes magically a business wizard. Or that a wouldbe American actress with only a commercial under her belt would audition for a part at the Royal Court.It's that nobody has a real backstory or even edges. Scarlett Johansson does wonders with what little she's given. JRM is pretty  when he panics you can't quite tell whether it's because he's afraid of handling a gun or because he's just read the rest of the screenplay. As for London Allen tries for the postcard effect he perfected in Manhattan complete with selfreference to the River Caf shot but he entirely misses the texture of the city there isn't a single London scene set in a house for instance it's all flats it's summer but Allen's London practically has no trees people shop in Mayfair at Aspreys and Ralph Lauren natch not Sloane Street and when JRM early in the movie takes his posh totty for a romantic walk it's to watch the changing of the guard at Buck House.To be honest there is a lovely plot twist right in the last five minutes. It's contrived yes but very clever. But it's not worth waiting two hours for.And apparently the Beeb has done it again Allen's next movie also starring Johansson is also set in London. Chaps this is your licence fee money that's being wasted.It probably won't surprise anyone that the same French critics who found Existentialist genius in Jerry Lewis simply loved the movie ranking it as high as Annie Hall in Allen's oeuvre. Le Monde called in pungent social criticism with...a deeplyfelt clinical study of class relations conditioning men's  behaviour and destiny in the...deterministic social system. And you were wondering why we had those riots. Nah this isn't a feminist take  Le Monde's critics have no qualms about using men when they mean human.".

	schema:headline " Woody Allen Is A Serious Artist  And We All Must Pay!";
	schema:reviewBody "A sleazy blue collar tennis pro marries into a wealthy family  only to risk it all for backalley passion that swiftly turns to horror.Woody Allen is telling an old story. Not only does he borrow shamelessly from Dreiser's classic novel An American Tragedy 1925 but from modern films like MASQUERADE 1988 and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY 1999.Problem is the cast and the script are not good enough to make the familiar material seem fresh let alone gripping. When you watch THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY the lush Italian setting and the casual cool of Jude Law's Dickie Greenleaf really sell you on the idea that the good life is worth killing for. But in this movie the rich family are such a onedimensional collection of yawning British stereotypes it's impossible to imagine any poor boy being tempted  let alone captivated  by their listless pleasures and sleepy little lives.Then there's the hero. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a total Joe Blow. He fails to make this creepy little social climber even remotely interesting. When Matt Damon played Tom Ripley he did a brilliant job of making Ripley seem sweet and helpless at first so you could like him and also so you could see why he reaches his breaking point and starts fighting back. Even Rob Lowe in MASQUERADE was able to summon up a certain easy cool. His gigolo was a rugged sailor a true competitor and he fell in love with his target for real. Very romantic. More than that he was a guy who got off on thinking fast and fooling the rich folks. But Joe Blow can't do that. He has zero sexual allure zero danger no soul. Just a blank stare and a pout.Things only get worse when Scarlett Johanssen makes the scene. Not since Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were scorching up the screen in their STARS WARS abomination have two sulky young stars so utterly lacked any sexual fire or intelligence. The difference is that George Lucas never said he understood sexual passion. And he never built his stories around desire. But in MATCH POINT everything depends on the idea that Joe Blow is willing to throw away everything and I mean EVERYTHING  just for more hot sex with his secret girlfriend.Poor Scarlett Johannsen! She's not really that bad an actress. But she's in the hands of a director who is so old and tired and bored that he can't even begin to think about helping her create a character. Woody's idea of making a young woman sexy is to have her light up a cigarette. So disgusting! And worse than that so out of date!Scarlett's Nola Rice is nothing but a plot contrivance. One minute she's a crude trashtalking slut a gold digger bragging that she can bag any man. Then suddenly she's a good girl toiling away in a cozy little shop and aching for her man to come home to her instead of going back to his wife. Huh??!??! Did Woody even TRY to explain this character to Scarlett? I don't think so because she looks really confused and sleepy all the time like a young actress who's been partying a bit too hard while shooting overseas.At any rate the movie all boils down to Joe Blow suddenly being so desperate and obsessed that he just has to kill someone. Now the truth is he could have killed the ENTIRE CAST by the last half hour and the whole audience would have just turned over and snored. Or stood up and cheered. But there are a couple of surprise twists at the end  worth seeing just for the way they make you think. But on an emotional level they don't involve anything sexy or exciting like a happy ending. Woody Allen is above that sort of thing.Woody Allen is a serious artist  and we all must pay!".

Woody's idea of making a young woman sexy is to have her light up a cigarette. So disgusting! And worse than that so out of date!Scarlett's Nola Rice is nothing but a plot contrivance. One minute she's a crude trashtalking slut a gold digger bragging that she can bag any man. Then suddenly she's a good girl toiling away in a cozy little shop and aching for her man to come home to her instead of going back to his wife. Huh??!??! Did Woody even TRY to explain this character to Scarlett? I don't think so because she looks really confused and sleepy all the time like a young actress who's been partying a bit too hard while shooting overseas.At any rate the movie all boils down to Joe Blow suddenly being so desperate and obsessed that he just has to kill someone. Now the truth is he could have killed the ENTIRE CAST by the last half hour and the whole audience would have just turned over and snored. Or stood up and cheered. But there are a couple of surprise twists at the end  worth seeing just for the way they make you think. But on an emotional level they don't involve anything sexy or exciting like a happy ending. Woody Allen is above that sort of thing.Woody Allen is a serious artist  and we all must pay!";

	schema:reviewBody "This film at first doesn't seem like a typical Woody Allen film but at the end you know it's one and why. While the story and theme is familiar Mr Allen brings new perspective and avoids clichs. He goes to the themes he explored in Crimes and Misdemeanors but without the Ingmar Bergman homage. Instead it's more fun and exciting to watch. I guess the young hot cast and new location doesn't seem like the usual Woody Allen film even though he used young hot talents before. This one belongs to his best films which is good news to his fans. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. Matthew Goode made a strong impression and sure to become a star in the near future. I'm glad Woody Allen changed locations and used some of the best British actors for a change. I guess people who will read this comment will already know about the plot so I will avoid it. I watched the film at Cannes where it was well received by critics and the audience.".

However since watching the film i have found myself unable to stop thinking about the story and the characters in all its layers.The start was disappointing. I was beginning to suspect that perhaps the film was being sponsored by the tourist board. Most Londoners would cringe at the picture postcard name dropping such as the Saatchi gallery and the Tate Modern.I was particularly impressed by Jonathan RhysMeyers who i had only seen before in a minor role in the Beckham movie. He was extremely believable and had excellent chemistry with Ms Johansson. He came across as good looking yet shifty passionate yet cold his speech was articulate yet artificial. Emily Mortimor Brian Cox Matthew Goode and obviously Scarlett Johansson were also very good.There was no hint of overacting or overdramatisation. There was virtually no dialogue or scenes in the film that were irrelevant to the plot.The film explored Allen's usual topics of love and fidelity replacing the New York set with upper class society. He also explored the concept of luck versus skill as well as nepotism and the English class system.I don't think that Jonathan's character was intentionally either bad or social climbing. Events were happening to him as much as he was making them happen. He did not seek the good life and for much of the film was battling between the wish to maintain it and his feelings for Nola. The point where he made his decision on this was believable but his solution was a bit of an overkill. Despite his calculating act i cant believe that many viewers actually wanted him to get caught.Match Point has obvious similarities with Crimes and Misdemeanors. Both Martin Landau and Jonathan chose the dangerous yet lazy option of dealing with the other woman who is getting desperate and threatening their perfect lives. In both cases this is an extraordinary act committed by ordinary people. As we entered the final third of the film Woody Allen fans were left wondering whether he would let the criminal get away with it again. I don't know what it says about Allen or his view on justice that he has done this in two films. Maybe this is a more realistic depiction of crime where there is not always a Poirot or Columbo following you break in drugs taken case closed.There were a few tricks at the end to put us off the track. Bumping into a neighbour on the way out of the house. Assuming that the ring falling short of the Thames was bad for Jonathan. Hints about the father in laws shotguns that could have easily been forensically tied to the murder and of course the dynamics between the two detectives.Overall a refreshing change of scenery and theme from Allen.

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this film on cable expecting a real waste of time hey I wasn't busy but was very surprised to see that there was a lot more to this movie than it seems on the surface. Yes 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' 'Psycho' 'Silence of the Lambs' and numerous other films have been loosely based on the story of Ed. These are all far better horror movies and with the exception of 'Psycho' depend very heavily on blood  guts. However all three of those films were fictional accounts. There's something considerably more horrific about the fact that these events actually happened although many names were changed to protect the innocentdeadconsumed.Yet another case of showing what happens when children are raised without a sense of love compassion or happiness. Jeffery Dahmer's problems had very similar origins as did several other serial killers and I'm sure many who are still out there. Instead of 'love and affection' Ed and his brother are given large doses of 'fire  brimstone'... Ed accepts this without question although his brother does not much to Ed's dismay and the combination of the twisted religious concepts his mother imposed upon him to her there seemed to be no good in the Bible only 'Revelations' and in particular the 'Whore of Babylon' which all other women seemed to be in her mind... upon which most of his killings are attributed to granted through his schizophrenic delusions of his mother.Regardless of what made him what he turned out to be the sensationalistic qualities of the true events are better left for those who wish to learn more. This film touches on much of the creepiness but explains little motivation aside from his religious 'logic'... I believe this is intentional as the movie is really telling the life story of Ed Gein rather than describing his tabloid exploits. Oddly enough I was not left with a feeling of disgust repulsion or anger with Ed Ed was a surprisingly sympathetic character that you feel more pathos for than anything else. Steve Railsback again has done a wonderful job of portraying a historical sicko after his wildeyed performance as Charlie Manson in 'Helter Skelter' and is utterly convincing.This is a psychological profile rather than a case history. They hint at several motivations in the film his comment at the bar of ...any of y'all fellas ever considered changing your sex like they do in Sweden? his 'skin suit' his 'rituals' where he is attempting to resurrect his dead mother etc but ultimately it is simply the delusions of his mother that drive him to action... actions which in most case Ed really seems to object to but being a loyal son he obeys his mother.They do not focus on the truly bizarre elements such as the skull bowls or the skin lampshades because for the most part this film is told through the mind of Ed... and these things would have been nothing special to Ed just another hobby like books on Nazi atrocities cannibalism shrunken heads and taxidermy. To him these artifacts were simple furnishings that he didn't think twice about. I also question that the skull bowls were something that were used a lot I believe that they were the equivalent of his 'fine china' that he brought out for special occasions like have his next dinner over for dinner. My wife felt that Ed should not have been found insane because he knew what he was doing was wrong. I disagree with that. While he may have known that what he was doing could get him in trouble were he to get caught he clearly felt that he was doing what mother told him to do which for him was the 'right' thing to do... never mind the fact that he accepts these instructions from a delusion compare this to Russell Crowe's character in 'A Beautiful Mind'... he has delusions as well but he ultimately acknowledges them as delusions and can ignore them... Ed is so focused on bringing his mother back that he wouldn't ignore his delusion even if he knew she was not real  it might seem strange to compare the two films but I happened to see them back to back. In the end do we learn anything new? Not really. Do we learn anything about ourselves? Not really. Do we learn anything about human nature? Only that we seem to be fascinated with these sort of aberrations. Serial killers and mass murderers have become the 'freak show' of modern times and it's ok to stare at them... at least that's the way it seems. The film 'bookends' with actual footage of his neighbors at the beginning of the film talking about what a quiet normal guy Ed was and ends with actual footage of the real Ed being hauled away by the police. To say that the aforementioned films were based on the life of Ed is like saying that a film about chopping down trees is based on the life of George Washington they only take snippets of his tale. Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes the 'leatherface' mask bone sculptures and indirect cannibalism since they are selling the meat it is a different type of cannibalism but Ed certainly had no commercial operation Psycho takes the aspects of his isolation taxidermic skills and the delusions of his domineering dead mother Silence of the Lambs takes the cannibalism true cannibalism which Ed was a 'fan' of the sexual identity issues and the idea of dressing up as a woman as opposed to dressing up LIKE a woman... but none of these are as horrible as what really happened. To tell the true story of Ed Gein in full Technicolor blood  guts would be far more than what most audiences could stomach... Not a bad film not a great film. Great performance by Railsback. Best to see if you know a little bit about Ed to begin with but not required... the actual atrocities are not as interesting as the man himself and how he came to be what he was.".

The recreations and reenactments are filled with actual quotes Ed why is it that every time someone vanishes you are around? that it becomes almost how the way it must have happened. Steve Railsback who once convinced us that he was Charlie Manson in Helter Skelter again convinces us that he is Ed Gein. His portrayal is very sympathetic and the score and flashbacks to certain key events in his life certainly augment the story as it moves along. Several of the characters in the movie however turn out to be representatives or amalgamations of characters of one or more characters. Berneice Worden is renamed Collette Marshall and her son Frank Worden is now Brian Hillman. Mary Hogan however is Mary Hogan because no living relatives could be found for her in order to get permission to use her in the movie. Of course you can't overlook the numerous references that would later inspire Hitchcock's Psycho. The preserved room the voice of mother the split personality and the sheer shock value all made their way to the fictional story of Norman Bates. Ed GeinIn The Light Of The Moon is basically what a true horror film should be. A highly intelligent plot with suspense and intrigue where the antagonist can be sympathetic and not just a ruthless killing machine in a hockey mask that does nothing but conjure blood and vomit.".

On the contrary it's very interesting.  But when compared to those other films it just seems lacking.  There's not much gore and you don't really get to see him kill anyone.  So why invest time with the film you ask.  Because of Steve Railsback.  Railsback performs wonderfully as the demented momma's boy. It's a joy to just sit back and watch him act.  His last lines of the film are especially disturbing.  This is the best of the current serial killer film craze that I have seen thus far however I do prefer the 70's film Deranged as a much creepier representation of Ed Gein's life.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie gets a lot more criticism than it generally deserves. Indeed it is extremely lowbudget but it basically nails the whole point of Ed Gein better than anyone ever has or possibly ever will. What seems to disappoint most people is the fact that the film sticks so closely to the story of what happened. The reality is Ed Gein was not a serialkiller in any respect and murdered two women who he may have felt resembled his deadmother. What he is most remembered for inreality are the ghoulishexcavations and articulations of deadbodies. It's very difficult for us to imagine in 2005 how much of a bombshell Ed Gein was in late1950s America. Infact it's my own humble opinion that we still haven't entirely coped with the knowledge of such aberrantbehavior. Why do people do such things? Sometimes there are no clearanswers but the makers of Ed Gein have shed some muchneeded light on what is known about Gein's metamorphosis into a fullblown ghoul. Surprisingly a greatdeal of the psychological subtext of his life has leakedinto films based on his true story. Most successfulofallnaturallyis Hitchcock's Psycho but Steve Railsback and Chuck Parello have shown us a very clear scenario into why Ed Gein became the man we knowof today. Gein was basically bisexual and had a strongdesire to BE a woman like his mother. As stated in Psycho so well he wanted to ...become his mother in a sadattempt to bring her back to life. His father was a patheticdrunk and as is wellknown his mother had a godlike dominance coupled with religiousfanaticism and sociopathicattitudesover the young boy. Ed was also deeplytraumatized by an incident on the family farm where he saw his parents slaughtering a pigEd was unable to assist them and was often called a pantywaist by his mother. The incident and a few others are enacted convincingly by Parello and company and much of the film takesplace in Gein's head where it belongs. There are a few continuityerrors the headlights of a car are clearly from the 1990s in one insertshot and there are a few moments where the productiondesign could have been closer to what 1950s America lookedlike. But allinall you have the definitive film on Ed Gein. It's all here in all its patheticglory. This is what happens when someone is neglected by family and society spiritually and medicallythis was simply a sick man who needed help. Nobody did until it was toolate. This isn't sexy and exciting to gorehounds and thrillseekers who come to a film like this not to learn something but merely to stimulate their hunger for viscera. Excellent film! How can you lose with ole' Steve Railsback anyway?Postscript It seems possible Mr. Railsback was a targetfordeath of Mr. Robert Blake!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Gein  Special prerelease preview USA200118. Dir. Chuck Parello. Hailed as the inspiration for many of Hollywood's greatest murderers Ed Gein was a reallife serial killer operating in 1950's Wisconsin. We were treated to a special prerelease preview of this forthcoming biopic.  Many may have been left with a strange sense of dj vu.  'Psycho' the novel upon which Hitchcock's classic horror is based was inspired by the activities of the reclusive farmer with the author Robert Bloch living just fifty miles from the town of Plainfield where Gein lived. The domineering mother character is consequently a big part of both films as she instructs her wayward son to kill from beyond the grave.  The skin wearing antics of 'Buffalo Bill' in Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs' based on the Robert Harris novel were also a part of the twisted Gein routine as his butchered and ate his way through his victims spreading fear through smalltown America.  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and American Psycho' also owe a debt to this true tale which demonstrates the full extremes of human depravity.  Such was the myth attached to this story that it is surprising that no one has tried to bring it to the big screen before.  The character of Psycho's' Norman Bates is undoubtedly far better known than his reallife inspiration but director Chuck Parello takes a brave step and tackles the monster head on.  Ed Gein's shy existence from abused child to grave robber and murderer are carefully charted with his obsession for anatomy and his mother always in the background.  Whether completely truthful or not the film portrays Gein as more of a misguided bumpkin than a coldblooded maniac.  The opening shows apparently authentic news footage from the time with neighbours expressing their shock that such a nice quiet young man like Ed' could be involved in such horrific crimes.  This adds a touch of realism to the proceedings but the remainder from childhood through killings to capture is standard fare with few surprises en route.".

If only it had stayed like thatif she'd come back before he'd killed Mary Hogan and they would have been happy in the confines of Ed's broken mind.I KNOW he killed his big brother Henry prior to this but the real Ed was not charged with Henry's murder so this is just conjuncture plus artistic licenceOnly one slight complaint According to my reading Augusta Gein the Mother was a big woman and the slender slight Carrie Snodgress seemed too small and delicate to play her. I imagined someone like the excellent and underrated Tyne Daly in the role of the powerful well built Mrs Gein.

	schema:reviewBody "Considered as a film about an unhappy and perverted man the movie is soso perhaps a bit more. A boy and his brother grow up on a dismal farm. Their father is brutal their mother religious and caring but stern too. Always when they show weakness there is the shadow of the allegation of femininity hanging in the background. Older boy leaves home as soon as decorum allows.The father disappears from their lives and the mother domineering and clinging takes over Ed Gein's life. She dies painfully. Ed goes mad. Mother appears in hallucinations telling Ed what to do scolding him if he hesitates prompting him to acts most of us might vomit at the mere thought of.But you know what? This is way way ahead of the usual sorts of slasher movies the kind that have turned into self parodies. Railsback was executive producer and cast himself in the principal role and he's good too although his mangled Southern mumble is a bit difficult to square with the actual Wisconsin setting of the events. Railsback underplays Gein's psychosis just enough. Gein isn't a loony loner as he might have been. He's a slowmoving gloomy looking guy who dresses like a sloppy rube you can almost smell his unwashed overalls but he's reasonable in public seems to have his wits about him. He makes the right kinds of comments more or less at the times they are called for. Overhearing a conversation between a saleswoman and a customer who has heart disease he wishes her well on her forthcoming operation a nice gesture that anyone with claims to normality might make. Railsback makes him quiet slightly awkward and gives him a constant shy smile in front of others. It's a fine portrayal of schizophrenia better than Russel Crowe's in A Beautiful Mind. Gein is just about perfect a shambling walk almost on tip toe a stare that lasts far too long the unfunny joke he tells that makes him laugh out loud while others gawk the halfbaked religious ideas a daily cycle that seems all non sequitur. He gets the necessary chores done buys antifreeze and goes shopping. Not the way you and I might  he lives on nothing but canned pork and beans and some other things  but he gets the job done. He hangs out from time to time in a depressingly dark rural saloon where he sits one or two stools away from the few other customers. The others know him and some like the bartender are kind and sympathetic to him while some make jokes about him. That's his public face. Rather a dull lonely man a sad man really who has never recovered from his mother's death someone who needs looking after and will never get it.His home however  well that's a different matter entirely. As a police officer once said about Son of Sam's residence the inside of his house looks like the inside of his head. It's a remote and nonproductive place falling apart on the outside the lock missing from the front door old tires and bedsprings in the yard. That's just the outside. The inside is even worse. Horrible in fact. About the single most depressing dump I can remember seeing on screen in recent years. Little light seems to enter. And what the light shows us we'd rather not see. The man seems never to have thrown out any piece of junk he's come into possession of. Old newspapers stacked in corners. Dirty dishes. An unmade bed that any prison could improve upon. Gein was frankly nuts no question about it. But as I understand it he murdered only two people both of them middleaged ladies who treated him in a motherly fashion. Of course the house had body parts all over it but these were from dugup corpses. The man ate out of bowls made from that part of the skull called the calvarium and so did his few guests. But naturally he had few guests. He made a few dollars babysitting two boys at his place but when one of them wandered into his bedroom  the bedroom with the shrunken heads on the walls and the rats on the floor  he ushered the kids to the door and politely and firmly told them not to come back. I guess a man needs his privacy he tells them.The two murders are horrifying in a nonsensational way. Both women are shot without expecting it to happen. One doesn't die immediately and protests when her punctured body is dragged out to Gein's truck to be taken to his cellar and dressed like a hog. But although the scenes are graphic and realistic they are not at all sensationalized. No preliminary threats no bondage or torture no screaming no maniacal whacking with axes or bashing in of heads with maces. It's all the more frightening for its matteroffact tone. And there is one scene in which Gein a raving lunatic dances out of his front door into the moonlight dressed in long johns and human skin a merkin fixed to his groin banging pots and pans and whooping with God only knows what rotten pot of exaltations. It's far more shocking than anything in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer although the two have the senselessness of random murders in common.You want to be scared? This true story this production ought to do the job. You'll be locking your doors at night.".

'Ed Gein' fails to surpass that overlooked movie. It has one or two good moments but I couldn't help but be disappointed. The best thing by far about it is the strong performance of Steve Railsback as Gein. He gives it his best shot and is almost as good as Roberts Blossom 'Deranged's star but I don't feel that the movie overall is as effective. Railsback is a talented actor 'Helter Skelter' 'The Stunt Man' who has spent the last twenty years in bgrade hell 'Turkey Shoot' 'Lifeforce' 'Scissors' 'Barb Wire' 'Vanishing Point' 'Disturbing Behavior'. He deserves better but I don't think this movie is going to help any. Too bad because as usual he is much better than the material he has to work with. Better luck next time Steve!".

Chuck Parello now takes the credit of creating the most accurate and faithful portrait of this historical psychopath not even changing the name of killer  victims like it was the case in Deranged but he wasn't capable of delivering a disturbing andor compelling horror movie with the subject matter he gathered. Ed Gein is a sober ...better make that VERY sober and monotonous drama about an emotionally unstable bachelor still under the influence of his dominating mother who's been dead since 9 years already. Despite everyone in the little village being friendly and patient with Ed he's very introvert and suffering from delusions in which his dead mother orders him to kill sinful people in his surrounding. This film is not scary at all since Parello wastes too much time on pointless flashbacks and amateurish psychology. The film merely just hints at Gein's bizarre and perverted sexual preferences and shows very little apart from a totally outofplace sequence in which he dances around in the light of the moon wearing the skinned face of one of his victims. The acts of violence Gein eventually does commit are rather tame and not nearly as unsettling as the real thing. The obvious lack in budget can hardly be used as an excuse since the 1974 film Deranged Confessions of a Serial Necrophile was a poverty row production as well and that film DID deliver genuine shocks and gruesome images. I strongly advice to watch that one instead even though it's a lot more difficult to track down.".

I would consider it to be equal to Citizen X. The best of these types of films are the ones that show in some way the psychology of why these psychopathic killers are such and this does such with it's exploration of Ed Gein's childhood and bizarre relationship with his equally demented mother. 90 minutes is not much time to really do an indepth study but it's a very good attempt and Steve Railsback is in top form as the almost reluctant killer. Some would say that there's no need to understand why killers are killers and that we only need to know how to rid society of them. In agreement with the desire to keep them from society I am yet these deranged persons need to be recognized quickly and the sooner the better. Psychological studies of these persons are beneficial this way.".

The acting in this film is top notch especially from the lead. It shows how his family upbringing affected his brain and his mother's influence so there's loads of flashback the timeframe is not constant so watch out. One of the best serial killer films so far. 910.".

And the gore scenes or lack thereof are completely laughable! You would think they would have at least had the decency to make the gun shot scenes a bit realistic than just some cheap red paint and no shot wounds. In fact I find it hardly believable at all that someone could POSSIBLY live through being shot in the back on your left side by a rifle 4 feet away! What the heck is THAT all about I ask? I don't know...Midway through the film my friend and I started to look at the cover of the DVD to see when this movie was made and it took us by complete shock when we saw it was made in the year of our technology 2000!!! The only other film I have seen that is worse than this is The Item a stupid retarded indie horror film that should DEFFINITELY be in the Special Interest section at Blockbuster.Don't see this movie! I warn you! It's complete bollocks! I could give you a 100 better things to do in your time than waste your money on this crap! 110 for me!".

I didn't see it on original release because I happen to be somewhat fascinated by the Ed Gein story and have read up on it and I was afraid the film would be a Bmovie exploitation of one of the most bizarre episodes in the history of American crime. Gee I wish it were.This film is really a pretty mediocre docudrama that attempts to explain away the more disturbing aspects of the Gein story with cheap and easy Freudian references down to having Gein see and listen to his dead mother urge him on to do God's work by punishing wicked women for their sexuality.Unfortunately this explanation doesn't tell us anything at all about Gein's cannibalism nor about his almost childish fascination for body parts. In one scene in a bar Gein suddenly asks the other customers whether any of them know about sexchange operations. I take it this was cut into the movie to explain Gein's efforts to wear the skin of some of his victims and certainly the real Gein was interested in the issue. What gets lost here is all the rich sense of transformation that might go into a sick fascination for donning the skin of another human being. This isn't simply changing one's sex  this is becoming something other than human.One other point  as a Freudian explanation the film has Gein denying responsibility for his murders  either he can't remember them or it was mom's fault. Wait a minute  could Gein have just ignored all those body parts cluttering up his house? Obviously not in fact the real Gein was aware of what he was doing  he just didn't think there was anything wrong with it. The only reason we know parts of his story is because he was able to give detailed descriptions of what he did. He approached murder dismemberment and cannibalism with a clinical disinterest in any of the moral implications of these acts. It was simply Gein's way of living in the world.Now that is truly frightening. The terrible thing about Gein was that he was utterly bland  he was the guy next door the quiet neighbor not very interesting not much to say.Few films have managed to capture this quality about any serial killer. This film certainly hasn't. A real missed opportunity.".

That is scarier than Jason Michael and Freddy melded together for an allstar extravaganza.I think that this film is a wonderful exercise in character study. The macabre aspect will have you shuddering and the incidental script humor will make you actually laugh out loud.

But that is the only thing that I find good in the movie and it is not enough to have a good story to make a good movie. The movie lacks some action something to keep you interested in seeing the rest of it. I don't feel that the actors gave a 100 performance although Steve Railsback Gein was quite good. I found the framing and editing a bit boring too but considering it a Low Budget film then I guess it is OK...";

I sure hope he eventually breaks through either in film television or theatre even in an older age frame. Dang he's good!Second yeah the presentation is often low budget but not an issue for obviously many who have viewed this film on its level. It's really a much better film than several lowbrow reviewers those too caught up and enthralled in special effects rather than storytelling let on to be. Those interested in a true crime story watch this one. Honestly not a disappointment overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Light of the Moon doesn't offers anything new. It's your typical Hallmark Television drama with horror elements. Making a movie based on the biography of a serial killer is not easy task if you want to recreate perfecly the shocking events. With a low budget like this you can't get too far. The movie delivers because it shows Ed Gein's life and tries to explain his motives for killing. That's what you have to know. The director is careful in stating his point of view because he doesn't shows Gein as a killer a la Michael Myers neither he tries to justify his actions. The movie shows the 2 faces of the coin 1. The Hollywoodesque influence. Gein's dead mother directs his behavior and tells him to murder. 2. Gein's human side. The disease that Gein suffers Schizophrenia? is the reason for him to murder. The audience has the responsibility to choose either reason. There are some chilling scenes that turn the drama into a thriller. For example the scene where Gein dances at dawnor whatever naked outside his house wearing the infamous Leatherface mask. Yikes! A creepy moment. Worked for me. There are other scenes that increase the disturbing factor Gein eating over women's skin Gein killing old women etc. Is it me or Railsback tried too hard to act like the great Anthony Perkins? His gestures and reactions reminded me a lot of the Psycho star. Still Railsback delivers a solid believable performance. 610. Wait for it on T.V. There's no need to rent it.".

	schema:headline " Good chemistry is the best drug for any standard romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Love stories are essentially the same  it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through Love and Other Drugs and count the  romance clichs and formulaic characters others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attractionlove and get you to  without blunt coercion  invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is his best credits include  Glory The Last Samurai and The Blood Diamond  not exactly  romance. He cowrote the script based on Jamie Reidy's memoir with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph The Interpreter so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother Josh Gad who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements usually to the tune of no laughs but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie a bit of a freespirited cynic who in  a unique twist has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the diseased girl archetype but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly.

	onyx:emotionText "Love stories are essentially the same  it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through Love and Other Drugs and count the  romance clichs and formulaic characters others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attractionlove and get you to  without blunt coercion  invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is his best credits include  Glory The Last Samurai and The Blood Diamond  not exactly  romance. He cowrote the script based on Jamie Reidy's memoir with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph The Interpreter so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother Josh Gad who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements usually to the tune of no laughs but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie a bit of a freespirited cynic who in  a unique twist has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the diseased girl archetype but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's selfesteem  might be and how strictly anticommitment she is when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of she's playing hard to get which is not the  best of reasons.

	schema:reviewBody "Ladies man Jamie Randall Jake Gyllenhaal is a super smooth talker working in an appliance store. When he is fired for having sex with a coworker he is pressured to find a new profession. His brother a lazy overweight computer geek has already made a fortune selling computer software to pharmaceutical companies. As such Jamie uses his charming persona to become a sales representative for a drug company working to sell drugs to local doctors and GP's. It's a cutthroat business but he still manages to work his way around people. He meets his match when he meets Maggie Anne Hathaway a slightly neurotic artist who initially holds him in contempt but then grows to appreciate his fleeting nature. She is only interested in casual sex but slowly Jaime becomes more attached and more concerned about her wellbeing.Love and Other Drugs was adapted from the book Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by director Edward Zwick. With Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph he also wrote the screenplay too. It seems like an oddity for Zwick who has mostly specialised in action films like The Last Samurai Blood Diamond and Defiance. His lack of familiarity with the romantic comedy genre is most evident with the jarring changes of tone of this film. It starts off as a quirky comedy but there's also a distinct lack of wit in the screenplay. Jamie's supposed charm and suave is so overdone and phoney that is difficult to believe that any of the women in the film could fall for it. Annoyingly they do repeatedly. The intrusion of Jamie's overweight brother the typical fat character employed for comic relief is a superfluous addition too that adds little to the narrative. In the second half the film is nearly two hours the story attempts to change gears to become a medical melodrama as Maggie's illness deteriorates. At this point the film seems to becoming more thoughtful and smarter than the typical Hollywood romantic comedy since Jaime has to find a balance between his work and looking after her. However it's undone by an extremely safe and predictable conclusion complete with the kind of mawkish speech that only a romantic comedy could provide. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have worked previously together in the film Brokeback Mountain. Gyllenhaal though is an unusual choice for what this particular role demands. He seems miscast because his smoothness and supposed suave is so artificial. He overplays it entirely in the opening scene. His choice of stealing drugs from rival companies seems like an incredibly unlikely practice. After he transforms into the typical nice guy in the latter portion of the film his character becomes bland rather than sincere. This is more the fault of the screenplay as the inner life of his character is particular uninteresting. The only particularly memorable aspect about his character is that he never managed to finish medical school. Hathaway is rather spiteful as Maggie not always likable in the way that she treats Jamie particular in the second act. The women in the film generally do not come off well here as they are either gullible or in Maggie's case plain irrational. Notably the love scenes shared between Jamie and Maggie are more frank than most mainstream comedies. It's just unfortunate that the film is a lot less interesting when the characters have their clothes on. Ultimately the cardinal rule of a romantic comedy is broken you don't care whether they end up together or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say that Love and Other Drugs is clearly one of the better films I've saw in awhile. For a variety of reasons for one the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is in perfect form as the two worked together beforeas a couple in Brokeback Mountain. Second it's an emotional story that involves sickness and finding unexpected love. And finally what can I say the film has plenty of passion lust and hot steamy love scenes so plenty plenty of sex! So aside from those reasons this picture can best be summed up as a kind of old fashioned romance falling in love story that touches your emotions as you feel the couplesJamie and Maggiegrowing pains of trust sickness and feel good pleasure. Still the sex overshadows those ingredients leaving a happy and feel good side effect for a viewer like me and it helps because I'm a big Anne Hathaway fan and with this picture you get to see plenty of her skin.Set in the mid 1990's when the economy was booming you have JamieJake Gyllenhaalwho's a young playboy from a well to do family and his biggest love in life is going to bed with hot young females. Then Jamie decides to get a little bit more power hungry when he becomes a pharmaceutical sales rep. he's taken under the arms of an ego driven boss BruceOliver Plattand the catch and sale of the game is for Jamie to use his charm and good looks to help sell medicine like Zoloft and Viagraremember the wonder pills of the 90's!. Plus his connection with a cocky Dr. KnightHank Azariahelps his climb and profile in the drug selling world too! Now that Jamie has became a hotshot pharmaceutical rep. he now meets his match in one of Knight's patients that being the sassy and witty sharp tongued free spirited sexy Maggie MurdockAnne Hathaway in her best and most sexy role of her careeras you can see a lot of adjectives to describe her. Only blemish with the beautiful Maggie is that she has stage one Parkinson's disease. Never mind these hot young attractive singles hit it off perfect as this quickly becomes a relationship of no strings attached lust bedroom making very hot passionate sexI must say the bed and love scenes were very hot for an R rated film. And this is what both enjoy lots and lots of sex.Yet as the charms of Jamie continues to go both for Maggie and his business he unexpectedly starts to have feelings for Maggie has he finally meet his match can he charm the stubborn sex magnet Maggie? The film is blended well with both comedy and drama as Jamie's slob geek overweight brother JoshJosh Gad provides laughs trying to score and it's fun seeing he's addicted to watching internet porn and sex tapes. Plus the scene of Jamie's boner from taking the Viagra pill was down right funny. Still Maggie is a serious go getter by traveling even to Canada to Parkinson support groups in the search for new cures and ways of living with the disease.This film thru it all is wonderful as the sex and hot lustful passion make it a tasty treat to watch and enjoy as the strong chemistry of Jake and Anne is great as Hathaway is sexy as ever. Those factors alone make it one of the better films I've seen. And adding the sickness theme of Parkinson's makes it depressing to some still it proves that anyone can be loved and that it's unexpected and everyone needs someone. Most of all it proves that sex and hot passion can easy lead to strong emotions of feeling and yes you guessed it as this film proves love. Love  Other Drugs is a feel good film that's enjoyable it touches emotions leaves you happy and you don't feel any side effects only love in the end.".

Being kicked out of his job at an electronic store for his amorous ways he soon finds himself applying his innate ways with women into his selling routine now working as a sales rep in the medical industry for Pfizer which when he joined hasn't created the magical blue pill called Viagra yet.I'd always wonder whether Pfizer was totally OK with the use of their branding just like how Up in the Air featured Hilton. After all this section of the film relentlessly pummels you with their sales strategy arguments and counterarguments where some aren't really flattering or even ethical to begin with. It's like a statement of how numbers and quotas are being chased no matter the cost and their sales training made for some comedic fodder. And to make matters worst it puts up front how the use of freebies can open up doors which are closed and to Jamie it also means manipulating women to get at what he wants especially an account with Dr Stan Knight Hank Azaria who in one scene opened up and blabbers about how corrupt the entire industry could be in demolishing one's medical ideals.So I suppose it's fair game for Pfizer since the story or at least this part of it is based on the book Hard Sell The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by author Jamie Reidy himself a former Pfizer sales rep because at least it gets itself everywhere in the film by virtue of Jamie's job. Besides the lessons learnt and applicability in the corporate world I totally agree with how being good looking puts one at a certain advantage because people like aesthetically pleasing things and beings or try as hard to deny that such things exist. Things work appeals work and just about everything one touches turn into gold or you get a leg up in your mission in life. This entire part on the bubbling new career of Jamie's I enjoyed and had a huge chuckle from for its bold portrayal of things that cut close to real life.Then there's the romantic portion of the film that kicked in once Anne Hathaway's Maggie Murdock comes into the picture piquing Jamie's interest when she revealed a boob and caught him ogling. The love between the two is anything but simple and I touch on this in a while since she wants to keep her emotional walls up to prevent from getting hurt again. They reach an agreeable compromise in establishing a relation that's built on purely physical terms and try as hard as they can to avoid falling into the usual relationship trap. Through their interactions we learn a lot more about their characters and in these moments come the expansion to prevent them from lapsing into caricature mode. Both Gyllenhaal and Hathaway score in their respective roles so much so that it earned them a Golden Globe nomination each. Gyllenhaal's Jamie develops from schmuck to an all round nice guy something which love does of course since it forces you to care about somebody else while Hathaway has to mimic an early stage of Parkinson's for her Maggie role and brings to light some basic understanding of sufferers for the disease in which there's still no cure. After all modern medicine seems to be interested in developing products that have mass market demand like Viagra appealing to the primal desires of men and women too which automatically translates to profits. Needless to say having been on screen together sans clothes too in Brokeback Mountain meant some natural chemistry already established and which they shared But the third part to the film was the home run for me. It defines the concept of unconditional love other than the innate one that a mom will always possess for her kids. You'll know someone is right for you and there's no point denying it anyway when they choose to stick by you when they know the going will get tough that things will turn out quite the nightmare and disadvantageous but decide to do so nonetheless. It takes the concept of in sickness and in health and weaves a strong emotional narrative around it in this film where a couple not yet bounded by matrimonial vows decide to adopt its concept implicitly. One is a sufferer from an incurable long term disease afraid to get too close to someone in fear of being pitied upon or unfairly bogging down and clipping another's wings when the other half has opportunities to take off and fly.But no the film isn't that sombre in mood always and contains plenty of comedy also courtesy of Oliver Platt as Jamie's sales manager and that of Josh Gad playing Jamie's uncouth brother Josh a one time internet paper millionaire until the dot com bubble burst having to live on the couch in Jamie's apartment the details of his shenanigans best left for you to find out from the film. The strength of Love and Other Drugs come from the development and transformation of characters and their relationships with each other which dialogues that reminded me of of all films Jerry Maguire set against an historical backdrop of developments in the medical industry that shook up the whole world. As I said it's smart and all encompassing for a film like how Zwick likes his films to be and I'm sure has elements that you'll identify with and enjoy.I'm firmly putting this in my Highly Recommended list and an early shoo in as one of the best of this year even though it's early. Now excuse me as I go practice my Hey Lisa routine!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway deliver inspiring charismatic and dimensional performances in Edward Zwick's latest directorial venture. The film like the performances arcs from shallow objectives and arguably questionable behaviors to capturing the essence of love. It's the classic tale of boy meets girl except as Maggie Hathaway puts it ...this isn't about connection for you this isn't even about sex for you. This is about finding and hour or two of relief from the pain of being you and that's fine with me because all I want's the exact same thing. Maggie's quote is perhaps the single most foreshadowing moment that will cause their parallel paths to intersect putting forth a moving story of human compassion and love. Jamie Gyllenhaal is intent on becoming the most successful sales rep for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. His aspirations are simple sex the Viagra account and getting to Chicago. Maggie's objectives are a bit different. While she too is intent on the escapism she finds in sex it's subtly presented that her goal is to be an artist  a goal that may be no longer achievable. What transpires is a character arc for each person and the realization that meaningless sex may have led to the ultimate human goals of companionship and love.'Love and Other Drugs' is a nicely told story that keeps you laughing and hoping but will ultimately leave a tear in your eye. It exudes to perfection human emotion and leaves you feeling the reality of the situation and of each character while doing its best to present a diagnosis with antidepressants and Viagra. It's cinematically beautiful and nicely paced to deliver a standout film containing all the chemistry Gyllenhaal and Hathaway had in years prior while filming 'Brokeback Mountain'. Acting is where the film garners much of its success through beautiful nuances flawless delivery and strong eye contact. It leaves you hoping for the future of both Maggie and Jamie and of a reuniting of Gyllenhaal and Hathaway.Grade A".

The brother was a poor man's Jonah Hill but he was quite entertaining in the end. Some pretty gross moments especially one involving a sex video but it really made me laugh.

I am in love but I didn't feel happy for them especially not when Jake has to go sleep with other women just to know how he feels for Anne or when Anne keeps taking off her clothes and jumping him and then telling him to leave her alone. Really the nudity in this movie seemed there just to distract the audience from the fact that the dialogue was actually really unoriginal. In an interview I read with Anne she says she thinks nudity is important to the movie because both characters express themselves through their bodies while at the same time shutting off their minds. I get her explanation but I didn't get this from the movie.The really good parts centered around the discussion of Parkinsons and the world of pharmaceutical drugs. However I feel that the actors involved wanted to produce a blockbuster with lots of boobs not a serious movie that centers around these issues. The movie was reaching to get to a point that it could never achieve. I personally came away feeling that I wasted my time.".

The story centers around Jamie's overwhelming desire to hide his insecurity of self worth by being an overachiever in his work and social skills. Whereas Maggie's incurable Parkinson's disease with it's progressive lifestyle deterioration causes her to protect herself from those who would pity her or not be able to carry the burden of the support she will ultimately need.The story presents these two characters with extreme passion for life and sexual prowess that at first hides their personal issues from each other but which also increases the desires of both to connect more fully with the other. The juxtaposition of these two very intelligent and talented characters makes for an intriguing portrayal for their discovery of love for each other.That desire is largely manifest by Jake's character Jamie Randall in that Maggie makes him desire to be a better person thru her insightful understanding of his weaknesses yet her total acceptance of him. Ironically this insight makes her feel less threatened by Jamie yet very concerned about letting Jamie see her trials with Parkinson's disease.I found this story to be completely engaging and well performed by all the actors and the director. This is an intelligent film and should be recognized for its achievement as such.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love and Other Drugs is in a word confused. Its a film that doesn't quite know what it is. Is it a film about the ever expanding morally murky world of pharmacuticals? or is it a rerun of the much tried and very tested love through adversity schtick? if i'm honest i don't think either story presented here is particularly engaging or interesting but if Zwick were to have focused on just one maybe the movie would have been at least bearable.I must say that Hathaway does the best she can with what she is given here and is believable as a trodden artist cum parkinsons suffer. She handles the superficially complex duality of her character with aplomb allowing herself to be both seemingly care free and independent whilst always relying or needing the attentionsaffections of a suitably shallow male here played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Just to be clear Gyllenhaal will never be an actor of substance he is too defined by his odd mannerisms and his strange intriguing looks. Here Gyllenhaal retreads the familiar Tom Cruise Matthew MacCournehey styled cock sure alpha male who is of course always slightly more fractured than his bravado would have us believe. Like previously stated its all a little tired.Probably the most tiresome element of the film is the regularity of the 'sex'. Since the reemergence of Rrated comedies we have been peppered with crude references to hyper real sexual situations but this definitely the most insulting example of the trend. Here sex is used to make the film seem more adult and grown up when in reality the way the screenplay treats the 'real' elements of the plot is superfulous and superficial. The sex is never a plot device nor does it aid us in getting to know the characters its just something that happens like when a car blows up in an action movie and our hero doesn't even react to it as he walks away. Therefore the disease is never disected or respected nor is it ever used a serious tool. It does however feel more like a desperate and basic attempt to make Hathaway more likable and therefore by association Gyllenhaal if only because he sticks around and still wants to have sex with her. The parrallel between Gyllenhaals job and Hathaways disease should the movies emotional anchor but instead its ignored as we watch them fool around. I do understand that they are both ignoring the elephant in the room as it were but here it feels laboured and shallow and not grown up and challenging.Finally i am not someone who cant enjoy the simple pleasures of these types of film. If you were to ask me i would champion movies like Friends With Benefits which somehow manages to both syrupy and racy which is surely down to two funloving leads and a neat and tidy screenplay. I would even reference something like Knocked Up for a movie that walks a similarly 'adult' path with more regular levels of success. Its a shame then to watch a film with such talent behind it Zwick iswas full of promise Hathaway is by all acounts a good actress become something that is just so full of nothingness and boring nevermind unfunny.Crap.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ed Zwick is a good director with an admirable body of work and Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhall can both act particularly Hathaway. How did these elements go so wrong? Falsely marketed as a comedy about a viagra salesman and a beautiful woman the movie is about a charismatic salesman who falls for a woman with a debilitating illness. We've seen it all before. Having worked at a big studio I could feel the hands of the creative executives and their notes all over the screenplay suck us in in the first thirty minutes with laughs and sex and then try to get us to buy into the drama of beautiful woman who is going to live a horrible life. Oh don't forget that vulgarity is in vogue so throw in the obese sophomoric internetrich brother to bring the sophistication level down to the worst Judd Apatow movie and let's throw in a totally unnecessary role for Oliver Platt. This seemed more like the first draft of a novice's screenplay than a professionally crafted effort. The screenplay and the director never could figure out where to go next. My biggest problem was that the Gyllenhall character whose arc moves form a charming womanizer to a committed man. He was never a jerk or a bad guy and never did or said one thing in the movie that the audience could dislike him for hence his transformation to a guy who loves a fantastic beautiful sexy woman wasn't that big a step or rather not an impressive arc. This movie needed a page one rewrite as it moved from romcom to dramady to expose of big pharma to vulgar for no reason andfailing to succeed anywhere. No red blooded man will ever complain about seeing Anne Hathaway nude but after a while it seemed like a gimmickwe get the fact that she was sexually liberated. Ten nude scenes didn't make the movie any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maggie Hathaway has Parkinson's and meets Jamie Gyllenhaal who doesn't seem to care that Maggie has that disease. Jamie is a pharmaceutical salesman who sells Pfizer drugs Zoloft and Viagra and he is on the rise. Let's see.. this seems to be a story about a pharmaceutical salesman who meets a girl who likes sex but doesn't want a relationship. And this works for a while but you and I know that one is going to fall in love. Yes we are psychic.Or it's a story about Pfizer and Viagra and let the good times roll.Or it's almost an Xrated story about a girl who likes sex still doesn't want a relationship.Or it's really about Parkinson's and that nothing can be done about it to a point senior citizens go to Canada for cheaper meds for the disease. Or it is simply a love story about a girl with Parkinson's who meets a salesman who says that is okay for now and leaves when the girl tells him to leave because it isn't fair to him. Most of the acting in here is good but Gyllenhaal in the beginning as a electronics salesman wasn't into it and this seemed to be quite a stretch for him. I saw in his eyes that he wasn't into it. Could be wrong but the eyes never lie. However when he meets Hathaway all that changes and he is now committed to the role. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway really wasn't that good. If it was I would have reached for the Kleenix at least once. Didn't happen as that is my gauge. I didn't think Anne Hathaway needed to be in the buff all that much as we got the point of the love story  such as it was. The gettingtoknowyou romance in the beginning lasted too long. The sex bouts lasted too long however the 7th and 8th graders who sneaked in said they weren't long enough. The real story was the Parkinson's thing and they should have gotten to that sooner. Don't look for comedy at anytime in the movie. It wasn't there except for the Parkinson's jokes at a meeting of people afflicted with Parkinson's. Yeah some were lame and we heard them years ago. This is not good for a new movie as there should have been some new joke material here. But also at this Unconvention was a man whose wife was in the 4th stage of Parkinson's and he tells Jamie the facts of life as to what to expect if he continues with Maggie.Josh Gad as Josh Randall was miscast. He probably was supposed to be the comic relief but was just annoying with dirty sex talk. Also I was somewhat disappointed in Oliver Platt as Bruce Winston. I regard him highly as a Class A actor and I don't like to see or hear him use the language he used and to be so animated? What is this world coming to?There was a girl in here that Jamie called Lisa Winnick and she looked very much like Scarlett Johansson. And very pretty. Hope to see more of her. All in all too long too many sub plots too many Fbombs and not the chemistry there should have been between the two stars. Violence No. Sex Yes too often. Nudity Yes too often. Lesbian Scene Brief kissing. Language Yes.".

	schema:headline " Not for everyone but definitely original";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is a movie that cannot be classified in any subcategory. Many viewers of now and then seemed to be disturbed by its lack of evident meaning or message. Starting more or less like a gangster flick it abruptly turns halfway through into a psychedelic trip where Mick Jagger appears in one of his rare screen roles as a retired rock star. No doubt Performance doesn't do much effort to be easily understood. If you like stories with a clear plot well defined characters and a happy ending then skip this one. In order to enjoy that movie you should better give up your rationality for a while. There are many interpretations one can have about it but they will most likely come in the second run. Like a dream Performance is a visual and mental shock where nothing comes as expected and it lets you wake up dazed and confused by its so peculiar atmosphere. What I find most puzzling about it is how far ahead of its time this movie was in every aspect. It was shot in 1968 but released only two years later because the distributors were obviously not prepared for this kind of performance and had not seen anything alike before. Western society was undergoing incredibly fast and drastic mutations and the culture shock that happened in those days is at the very heart of the picture. It was time for a change. Just like the main character the western world would never be the same again afterwards.Interesting fact  a mere five years before the lead actor James Fox had played in the Servant a film based on a play by Harold Pinter with a story that has a lot in common with Performance. The Servant appeared highly controversial by then because of its allusions to seedy sex but it was shot in black and white with very conventional filming editing and acting and a very outdated jazzy soundtrack. Hard to believe it takes place in the same city London with the same lead actor within just a five year gap.Nothing about Performance is conventional. It takes off immediately into a hectic pace flashy colors haunting music and very graphic sex and violence. The London crime world is photographed with a rare accuracy. Actually one of the guys playing the gangsters happened to be a real life gangster. Then suddenly by a random twist of fate the cockney villain no heroes here is propelled into another completely different underground scene where nothing is true everything is permitted. He meets his alter ego as a hasbeen pop musician living secluded in a redwalled mansion covered with mirrors together with a duet of intriguing women. Hallucinogenic mushrooms are casually served at breakfast notions of time and space fade away while gender identity and truth get blurred. The two main characters gradually merge together and though both of them seemingly get doomed by their fate in the end you don't know by then which of them is whom anymore.I don't know of any other movie where you see a Rolls Royce burning down in an acid bath gangsters performing a striptease show or a plunging view inside a skull as a bullet is shot through it least all of them together. Besides the recurring use of mirrors all throughout the picture the constant play with colors and the superimposing of faces and images don't have many parallels either in film history. Of course if you are a Rolling Stones fan this movie is a mustsee but then you probably have seen it already. Like the main character the Rolling Stones began as English street kids and came to explore a world of sex drugs and rockroll where one of them actually lost his life. In Performance  an androgynous longhaired Mick Jagger with pouting lips is at the acme of his character while blond and foxy Anita Pallenberg who had affairs with three members of the band and freckled boyish Michle Breton fit perfectly into the scenery .If there was to be a popart movie that would be it. You may love or hate this film but for sure it is daringly creative and experimental and anything but ordinary. To quote the character played by Jagger  the only performance that makes it that really makes it is the one that achieves madness.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here is a movie that cannot be classified in any subcategory. Many viewers of now and then seemed to be disturbed by its lack of evident meaning or message. Starting more or less like a gangster flick it abruptly turns halfway through into a psychedelic trip where Mick Jagger appears in one of his rare screen roles as a retired rock star. No doubt Performance doesn't do much effort to be easily understood. If you like stories with a clear plot well defined characters and a happy ending then skip this one. In order to enjoy that movie you should better give up your rationality for a while. There are many interpretations one can have about it but they will most likely come in the second run. Like a dream Performance is a visual and mental shock where nothing comes as expected and it lets you wake up dazed and confused by its so peculiar atmosphere. What I find most puzzling about it is how far ahead of its time this movie was in every aspect.

After a rapid fall from power within local crime syndicate James Fox flees the mafia and finds refuge in the eclectic house of Mick Jagger. Jagger is living the life of the failed superstar with a small entourage of women a recluse whose appetite for sex and drugs is fueled by his royalty cheques. When this young gangster stumbles into his house Jagger involves him into his kinky games transforming him into one of his own. There is plenty of subtext here if anyone is interested in digging deeper.Perhaps the biggest letdown of the recent DVD release is that it was released in mono Dolby. Seeing as the soundtrack was released on stereo CD why couldn't the audio at least during the music sequences have been similarly remastered? The Stones rarely played Memo From Turner due to their women troubles that stemmed from the film. Jagger was sleeping with Richard's girlfriend on the set or something to that effect. Anyway Memo From Turner was released on the album Metamorphasis in 1976. The intro on the 1976 version is great but the 1970 version on this album is one of the hottest tracks the Stones ever recorded without Mic Taylor. This song proves to be one of the first music videos ever made as it appears in its entirety in Roeg's film.".

As they embroil Fox in their weird games the writersdirectors Nicholas Roeg and Donald Cammell create brilliantly the mushroombased trip that they take him on and through.

	schema:reviewBody "Visually compelling and disturbing look at two diverse sides of 1960s London the criminal underworld and hippie culture respectively symbolised by Fox's Chas the wayward gangster and Jagger's Turner a semiretired bisexual rock musician.It's Chas' world we are first introduced to during a highly charged furiously paced scene of gangland violence.  It soon becomes clear to us that he is not only an outcast to society but also dangerously individual within his own mob circle.  On the run from both the law and the mob he takes refuge in a Notting Hill home which he finds is occupied by Turner his junkie girlfriend Pherber and her French lover Lucy.  Tunrer becomes infatuated with Chas' violent charisma and his vital energy he himself feels he has lost.As the title suggests the film is all about performances.  Chas is initiated into Turner's underground world of drug experimentation and gender bending. Turner's name in itself is symbolic of the way he tries to play with and turn Chas' psyche around.  It is ultimately the performance of Turner which brings the two worlds together as he poses as Chas' mobster boss Harry Flowers in a scene shot similarly to a modern day music video.Some critics had felt the film lost its way once Chas entered Turner's world.  Yet surely such disorientation is indicative of how the film successfully explores Chas' own uneasiness in confronting his own subconscious in an alien atmosphere.  The film is full of visual flourishes as one might expect from Roeg  who had been cinemaphotographer on films such as 'Fahrenheit 451'.  Fox is mesmerising playing out the evolving identities of Chas whilst Jagger's persona is exhibited to its full potential.  Roeg was again to explore the theme of alienation using a rock star this time David Bowie in a more literal sense in his landmark science fiction film 'The Man Who Fell To Earth'.".

	schema:headline " A tremendous experience a work of true power and originality";
	schema:reviewBody "As the title might suggest Performance 1970 is a film to be experienced as opposed to simply endured. At its most basic level the film can be seen as an experiment into the nature of personality roleplaying character and the lines between fact and fiction reality and fantasy all blurred together by a heady cocktail of sex drugs and rock n' roll that is representative of the late 60's artscene that writer and codirector Donald Cammell was very much a part of. For many it will have no doubt become something of a dated relic a film from the days when East End gangsters were all sharpsuited mother's boys or closeted homosexuals with Jags' and boxing clubs or 60's radicals with beards in bedsits dropped acid and strummed endless drones about the doors of perception on electric guitars. Others will see it for what it truly is a disorientating hall of mirrors of psychology and satire  part Borges part Carroll  as Mick Jagger's selfdestructive rock star becomes a sort of white rabbit figure leading exiled gangster James Fox into a wonderland of psychological manipulation mindgames and more.On a secondary level of content and presentation Performance can also be seen as a playful subversion of the codes and conventions of early gangster cinema extending on certain wellworn characteristics of 40's filmnoir  with the idea of a disgraced hood forced to hideout after a botched job gives way to the threat of mob retaliation  whilst creating a continually evocative underworld environment that is rife with a number of recognisable references to the iconic gangland milieu of London's East End. This particular period setting is later contrasted and eventually broken down by the second half of the film in which a combination of bohemian squalor and 60's decadence erode the carefully created facade that these troubled and enigmatic characters  performers even  have exploited in order to progress within their disparate social environments. The lines are further blurred by the use of drugs which again parallel the emotional landscapes of Lewis Carroll as well as the more potent ideas of sex and sexuality which are here presented as being part of a greater performance in itself.The film is littered with presentations of sex  both heterosexual and homosexual  and always loaded with the threat of both physical and psychological violence power and manipulation. The sex is a continual distortion neither erotic nor titillating and seemingly inspired by the paintings of Francis Bacon or Domenico di Michelino. It works in the creation of a heightened atmosphere that becomes continually more oppressive and dangerously claustrophobic as the film develops with the kaleidoscope of images sounds and colours all blending and blurring between extended philosophical discussions violence and transfiguration. From here the film shows the subtle symbiosis between the selfaware rockstar and the naive gangster as sex and drugs are again combined to break down the boundaries of personality and the literal mirroring between life and death. There are all kinds of different ways that we as an audience can interpret these ideas and the relationship between the characters as Cammell  here in closecollaboration with codirector and cinematographer Nicholas Roeg  creates a continually fascinating atmosphere that is punctuated by abstract thought and dark surrealist imagery.As a work of artistic expression and cinematic experimentation Performance is a film that needs to be experienced. It is not only notable as a deep penetrating expose into the human psyche and the dangerous places that narcissism and selfdelusion can carry us when the walls of reality have slowly broken down but as a time capsule to the creative spirit of the 1960's and a brief bohemian subculture that I for one find incredibly interesting. The film also manages to capture the raw energy and quiet sexuality of Jagger before he became an insufferable clich all gyrating geriatric hips swinging to a packedout football stadium as he saunters through possibly the 100000000th performance of Gimme Shelter with the seductive energy and shamanlike otherworldliness instead creating a character that is selfaware and clearly selfreferential and yet  so perfectly matched against the brooding uncertainty of Fox's wayward gangster. Likewise the artpop drug culture and obvious psychedelic influences never overwhelm the story instead feeling absolutely germane to the scene that Cammell and Roeg were attempting to explore and to the themes expressed within the subtle subtext of Cammell's strange and suggestive script.In hindsight Performance can be seen as the point in time at which the psychedelic experimentation expression and drugculture of the 1960's was allowed to envelope the cinematic medium extending on the more exciting and progressive films that had been emerging from places like France Japan or the Czech Republic throughout the years leading up to 1967 and finally creating a complete symbiosis between content theme character and presentation that was socially progressive and entirely relevant. If America had films like Easy Rider 1969 Medium Cool 1969 and Zabriskie Point 1970 then we had Performance and 'If...' 1968. And if the latter remains a truly defining masterpiece of British filmmaking and a testament to the unsung greatness of director Lindsay Anderson then Performance is the essence of the scene preserved as a sort of cinematic reflection where the underground met the mainstream and the experience was allowed to take control.".

This particular period setting is later contrasted and eventually broken down by the second half of the film in which a combination of bohemian squalor and 60's decadence erode the carefully created facade that these troubled and enigmatic characters  performers even  have exploited in order to progress within their disparate social environments. The lines are further blurred by the use of drugs which again parallel the emotional landscapes of Lewis Carroll as well as the more potent ideas of sex and sexuality which are here presented as being part of a greater performance in itself.The film is littered with presentations of sex  both heterosexual and homosexual  and always loaded with the threat of both physical and psychological violence power and manipulation. The sex is a continual distortion neither erotic nor titillating and seemingly inspired by the paintings of Francis Bacon or Domenico di Michelino. It works in the creation of a heightened atmosphere that becomes continually more oppressive and dangerously claustrophobic as the film develops with the kaleidoscope of images sounds and colours all blending and blurring between extended philosophical discussions violence and transfiguration. From here the film shows the subtle symbiosis between the selfaware rockstar and the naive gangster as sex and drugs are again combined to break down the boundaries of personality and the literal mirroring between life and death. There are all kinds of different ways that we as an audience can interpret these ideas and the relationship between the characters as Cammell  here in closecollaboration with codirector and cinematographer Nicholas Roeg  creates a continually fascinating atmosphere that is punctuated by abstract thought and dark surrealist imagery.As a work of artistic expression and cinematic experimentation Performance is a film that needs to be experienced. It is not only notable as a deep penetrating expose into the human psyche and the dangerous places that narcissism and selfdelusion can carry us when the walls of reality have slowly broken down but as a time capsule to the creative spirit of the 1960's and a brief bohemian subculture that I for one find incredibly interesting. The film also manages to capture the raw energy and quiet sexuality of Jagger before he became an insufferable clich all gyrating geriatric hips swinging to a packedout football stadium as he saunters through possibly the 100000000th performance of Gimme Shelter with the seductive energy and shamanlike otherworldliness instead creating a character that is selfaware and clearly selfreferential and yet  so perfectly matched against the brooding uncertainty of Fox's wayward gangster. Likewise the artpop drug culture and obvious psychedelic influences never overwhelm the story instead feeling absolutely germane to the scene that Cammell and Roeg were attempting to explore and to the themes expressed within the subtle subtext of Cammell's strange and suggestive script.In hindsight Performance can be seen as the point in time at which the psychedelic experimentation expression and drugculture of the 1960's was allowed to envelope the cinematic medium extending on the more exciting and progressive films that had been emerging from places like France Japan or the Czech Republic throughout the years leading up to 1967 and finally creating a complete symbiosis between content theme character and presentation that was socially progressive and entirely relevant. If America had films like Easy Rider 1969 Medium Cool 1969 and Zabriskie Point 1970 then we had Performance and 'If...' 1968. And if the latter remains a truly defining masterpiece of British filmmaking and a testament to the unsung greatness of director Lindsay Anderson then Performance is the essence of the scene preserved as a sort of cinematic reflection where the underground met the mainstream and the experience was allowed to take control.";

If you get into the mystical and psychological subtext you'll probably end watching this movie more than once and you'll get more out of it each time.

It feels like a character from one film has accidentally wandered into another and can't get back. There are two aspects which make it highly watchable for me. One is Fox's performance which is intermittently stunning  with his spiky red hair tight clothes and thug stylings he's a punkrocker six years before punkrock was invented. The second is just the sheer variety of experimental techniques both cinematic and artistic on view which is pretty amazing in a major studio movie  in what other film can you see a bullet fired into someone's head from the bullet's point of view or have a scene where the leading lady injects peyote into her butt ?

	schema:headline " In Search Of Turner's Demon";
	schema:reviewBody "It's fascinating to see how this movie which was made in the late 1960s develops from a routine crime drama into an exploration of the nature of identity sexuality and reality. By the standards of the time it was clearly ambitious innovative and challenging but that's only half the story because its dazzling visual style which facilitates the process so effectively was also an introduction to the highly individual approach which became such a familiar feature of codirector Nicolas Roeg's later films. Montages superimposed images and editing that intentionally disrupts the chronology of the narrative are just some of the stylistic flourishes that are used to good effect in Performance to blur the lines between various identities and what's real and what's imagined.Chas James Fox is a sadistic young criminal who works as an enforcer for London crime boss Harry Flowers Johnny Shannon. He's welldressed very good at his job and recognised by his fellow gangmembers as someone who really enjoys his work. His ability to terrorise people into seeing the benefits of the protection that his boss' organisation provides is also well recognised but when he gets involved in a job where a man he's known since childhood is involved things go badly because he hates the guy and kills him. This doesn't go down well with Harry Flowers and so to save his own life Chas immediately has to go on the run. A conversation he overhears in a railway station waiting room alerts him to the fact that there could be a vacant apartment in Notting Hill Gate which he could use as a temporary hideout.At the mansion of retired rock star Turner Mick Jagger Chas introduces himself as Johnny Dean and claims to be a professional juggler. His new surroundings are not what he expects because the rather eccentric Turner lives with a couple of bisexual women called Pherber Anita Pallenberg and Lucy Michele Breton. Chas tries to change his appearance by dying his hair and only intends to stay in his basement accommodation until he can get his hands on a forged passport and leave the country for good.Chas' initial antipathy to the lifestyle of the house's other three residents who regularly sleep and bath together slowly changes after he gets to know Pherber more closely and begins to take on some of Turner's characteristics. The faded rock star had given up his career when he'd lost his demon which had been the source of his inspiration and creativity and starts to see Chas who also considers himself a performer as possessing some quality which might enable him to recover his lost muse. The mind games and hallucinogenic mushrooms that Chas is then exposed to change him profoundly but will this bring back Turner's demon? The musical number in which Turner assumes Chas' identity in an imagined situation where he interacts with other members of the Flowers gang is brilliantly conceived highly entertaining and thoroughly consistent with the movie's main themes. It also forms part of a soundtrack that's perfect for this exceptional film.The use of androgynous characters Lucy and Turner gay gangsters and visual references to the works of Francis Bacon and Jorge Luis Borges also provide indications of some of the plot's preoccupations but it's the recurring use of mirrors that ultimately provides the movie with its most memorable motif. With excellent performances especially from Jagger and Fox and its groundbreaking visual techniques Performance is definitely a movie that's not to be missed.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's fascinating to see how this movie which was made in the late 1960s develops from a routine crime drama into an exploration of the nature of identity sexuality and reality. By the standards of the time it was clearly ambitious innovative and challenging but that's only half the story because its dazzling visual style which facilitates the process so effectively was also an introduction to the highly individual approach which became such a familiar feature of codirector Nicolas Roeg's later films. Montages superimposed images and editing that intentionally disrupts the chronology of the narrative are just some of the stylistic flourishes that are used to good effect in Performance to blur the lines between various identities and what's real and what's imagined.Chas James Fox is a sadistic young criminal who works as an enforcer for London crime boss Harry Flowers Johnny Shannon. He's welldressed very good at his job and recognised by his fellow gangmembers as someone who really enjoys his work. His ability to terrorise people into seeing the benefits of the protection that his boss' organisation provides is also well recognised but when he gets involved in a job where a man he's known since childhood is involved things go badly because he hates the guy and kills him.

	schema:reviewBody "Often cited as one of the greatest films in British Cinema 'Performance' is a hallucinogenic trip pun intended through London's criminal underworld the tentative edifice of identity and the whole glorious mess of psychotropic drugsoaked late 1960s popculture when flowerpower was beginning to wilt and swinging London was beginning to sway. Rolling Stone singer Mick Jagger plays Turner a hasbeen rock star ensconced in his Notting Hill mansion living a life of orgiastic decadence with the spellbinding Pherber Pallenberg and exquisitely androgynous Lucy Breton in an atmosphere where money floats idly on bath water and psilocybin mushrooms are served for breakfastuntil one day Chas Fox an ontherun South London gangland hood knocks on his door seeking solace under the guise of being a juggler. It doesn't take long for Turner and Co. to cotton onto the ruse and voyeuristically fascinated by the implications of the violent underworld Chas inhabits indulge in a bizarre rite where definitions of violence and sexuality are explored and identity is deconstructed.Many rumours surround the film which no doubt got the green light from execs who in seeing the name of a Rolling Stone attached no doubt envisioned a filmpop hybrid like 'A Hard Day's Night'. However 'Performance' is as far away from a mainstreambaiting tongueincheek romp as you can get. Instead it is a raw and in more than one sense adult film which is transgressive and deviant in every respect. One such rumour has it that at a screening for the studio executives one exec wife vomited while another was apparently heard to say even the bath water was dirty. What is sure is that after various cuts and reedits the film was shelved for 2 years after it was finished not seeing the light of day until 1970. Saying this by modern standards this seems a quaint overreaction modern pop videos are arguably more erotic than the nudity and the sex scenes between Jagger and Pallenberg come across as positively tasteful although another rumour has it that the sex wasn't simulated and was indeed real which no doubt cough annoyed Stones guitarist Keith Richards who Pallenberg was officially with at the time and that outtakes from the scene were shown at adult movie festivals. Modern audiences may also smirk a little at the depiction of drugtaking in the film which lacks both the glamour of Scorcesestyle fistfulsofcokeflungintotheair as well as the searing gritty realism of films like 'Christiane F' or 'Trainspotting'.Okay surethe film is dated somewhat even down to the casting of Jagger who after emerging from his late 60s dissolute Baudelaire phase ended up symbolising the mainstream and entering the establishment! but we need to respect the fact that it was films like 'Performance' which broke new ground wherein these other films would follow. Secondly I would argue the violence in the first half of the film still actually packs a punch today in terms of grittiness the conflation made between violence and sex as well as the implications of homosexuality within the gangland world which it should be remembered was still a tangible presence in late60s London owing to the Kray brothers and their Firm. Thirdly it should be noted that for all its explictness the drugtaking sex and violence in the film are merely vehicles for the grander ruminations on identity that are the heart of the film.Out of the directorial duo of Nic Roeg and Donald Cammell it is Roeg who with the acclaimed 'The Man who Fell to Earth' and the bewilderingly beautiful 'Don't Look Now' went onto to establish himself as a director of some standing while Cammell struggled to get his various projects off the groundbut 'Performance' should really be recognised as Cammell's baby as its content is a clear articulation of his musings and fetishes from organised crime to drugs to threesomes and to the work of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. Borges in collections like 'Fictions' and 'Labyrinths' wrote short stories in a magic realist style which collapsed the distinctions between imagination and reality and created worlds of confusion which elicit awe in the possibilities that open up. As Turner himself says in the film nothing is trueeverything is permitted. What's more a copy of a book by Borges is seen lying in the apartment Turner's speech references Borges' stories several times and in the climatic confrontation at the end of the film the image looming towards us as we are fired into Turner's brain is none other than Borges himself. A curious and morbid postscript to this is that after being all but completely rejected by Hollywood for years after 'Performance' Cammell killed himself with a shotgun blast to the headhowever death wasn't immediate and after shooting himself he walked around for sometime even claiming to his partner that he couldn't see Borges.Such stories of madness run all though the circumstances of the genesis of 'Performance' as well as through the film itself. Certainly much more could be said about the film as in coming from the abyss the film permits an interpretation as deep as you care to take it. What is sure is that it's a unique film born of a unique vision operating in unique times and although dated in parts serves as both a document of the time a manifesto of madness and simply just has to be seen.".

This film was shot in 1968 but wasn't released until 1970 and it was only released then thanks to the censorship that was in decline in Britain in the late 60's. This film developed a cult representation. It parallels between gangsters and pop stars. It was criticised for being two totally different films at the start following the life of a gangster to then following the life of a burnt out rock star. However if your a person who reads deep into films then you will find the subtext that is snuggled deep inside this film.Lets all give praise to the man called Donald Cammell who wrote this script and who then got Mick Jagger involved which resulted in Warner Brothers taking on the script. Lets also give praise to Cammell who brought in Frank Mazzolla who helped with the creation of the rapid cutting technique! Without the sharp editing the psychedelic feel would of had less of an impact. Overall this film introduces us to the different worlds in the 60's. It shows us that even if our lives are completely different it doesn't mean that we ourselves are different as James Fox's and Mick Jagger's characters show when they become one.".

The cockney accents and just London at that time was the place to be. It was like looking in a time voretx of London in the 60's. Thats all the movies had going for it. But Mick Jagger and the other fellow dressing up like women and having gay sex. Nah just wasn't for me.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh what a strange film PERFORMANCE is . It often gets praised to the high heavens but much of this praise is unworthy . It certainly deserves its reputation as a strange avant gard movie but believe me it's no masterpiece .James Fox plays London gangster Chas and it's a hoot seeing Fox trying to play some tough working class cockney bloke . No doubt Michael Caine was written with the role in mind but decided he didn't fancy the location filming in rainy old London town . Certainly Fox fails to convince as a tough guy but this adds some much needed watchability to the proceedings The best thing about PERFORMANCE is the portrayal of old school London gangsters . The movie was actually shot in 1968 but wasn't released until 1970 and one can't help thinking the trial and subsequent jailing of the Kray firm might have had something to do with the delay . I mean it's obvious the gangsters seen here are a bunch of violent homosexuals who stay stay in bed all day lusting over pictures of gay porn and it's obvious they're based on Ronnie and Reggie Kray . One can't help believing that if the Krays were found not guilty of the murders of McVitie and Cornell in 1969 this movie's release would have been delayed even longer After a torture scene so camp you'd think it was filmed at a trailer park   Oh you like this you twerp   Chas finds himself taking on the identity of a juggler and staying at a safe house owned by a rock star played by Mick Jagger and it's at this point the film loses much of its entertainment value because Mick Jagger can't even play Mick Jagger convincingly and the vague story becomes static A lot of people consider PERFORMANCE to be some sort of masterpiece but to be honest it's a slightly irritating art house movie with some crazy editing technique . Much of its reputation is built upon its homoerotic air which no doubt shocked audiences at the time but seems pretentious and a little tame nowadays . Perhaps the only thing a mainstream British audience will notice about it now is that actor Billy Murray looks far older as a 27 year old than he does as a 60 something in 2006".

Donald Cammell and Nic Roeg's movie 'Performance' is a case in point. This story of an oldstyle gangster James Fox atypically playing a working class character who gets mixed up in a bohemian sect is radically filmed and assembled but not completely successfully there may have been some merit in the old ideas after all. The film features frequent crosscutting between scenes a narrative that does not strictly reflect chronology and a lipsynching scene where the characters mouth the words to a Rolling Stones song. In some ways this all correctly predicted where mainstream movies have since gone but only in less exaggerated forms. The start of 'Performance' is so rapidly crosscut as to be almost unwatchable after this it settles down and the manner of its construction maintains some interest in the viewer. If anything by the end it's the story that undermines this film whose themes seem hopelessly rooted in the year of its making. An interesting curio it is also noteworthy for a rare screen appearance by Mick Jagger and certain points Jagger plays a retired musician and there are comments about what he'll look like at 50 now seem to have added meaning to what was intended when the script was written.

Cutting two songs and adding another 10 minutes of exposition to show his evolution into the enlightened and compassionate meesenger of Buddhism would have made the film much more complete and raised it to the level of highest achievement. Ashoka made Kalinga into a centre of Buddhism that endured more than a millennium until the Shaivaite and Vaishnavite Hindu Renaissance of the 12th and 13th centuries. His legacy as a prophet of multiculturalism peace and tolerance was insufficiently explored. It might have helped to have had an English translation of the beautiful and profound rock edicts that were shown only as a visual element in the opening and closing credits. It is a shame that Ashoka's Greek ancestry is not even acknowledged in the film. His grandfather Chandragupta who is seen as convert to the ultrapacifist Jain faith in the opening scenes married the daughter of rht edfeated Greek general Seleucus Nicator who led Alexander the Great's forces to defeat in the Punjab. Ashoka was born of one of Bindusara's Indian wives which makes Ashoka at least one quarter Greek  he was the very fusion of the GrecoIndian classical tradition snd it was he who caused to be erected the collossal Buddhas at Bamiyan destroyed earlier this year by the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Despite these minor failings it is a superb film and even today you can wander the sand dunes of the River Daya Compassion in southeastern Orissa formerly Kalinga and experience the fullimagining of the Ashokan battlefield.

Of course most Hindi films are really vivid but this was exceptional I think. Really well done by Santosh Sivan.If you are not a veteran of Hindi films then you may not fully appreciate this movie...  You kinda have to be used to the subtitles used to the musicdance sequences and the basic formula that all Hindi films follow in regards to romance.  I mean the story doesnt focus on Asoka's romantic life but it does play an important role...  Once you get past the first 15 minutes or so the story really takes off.  The story basically is how Prince Asoka rose to power to become King Asoka and can happen when one is overcome with blind vengeance despair and hatred...Shahrukh Khan Asoka has got to be by far the best male Indian actor Ive seen besides maybe Om Puri.  He has great chemistry with Kareena Kapoor and overall the movie is wellacted.Asoka is more reminiscent of Braveheart excellent film not Gladiator terrible garbage which the liner notes suggest.  If there is a weak point it might be the editing...alot of times after a cut I felt like there was too big a jump and a scene missing....Overall an A.  I  recommend it especially if you are interested in Indian culture...its based on real events around 3rd century BC.".

	schema:headline " One of Indian cinema's finest offerings";
	schema:reviewBody "Asoka is a movie by acclaimed cinematographer and director Santosh Sivan and it is clearly evident from his latest venture that he is about to change the celluloid world forever. The movie is an epic and the first example of International Indian cinema on a wide scale bigger canvas and projected through the eye of a master filmmaker.The film begins with the young Prince Asoka Shah Rukh Khan as a boy who watches his father accept Jainism a peaceful religion that encourages him to toss aside his sword which has caused much bloodshed. The young boy is intrigued by the weapon and picks up the new toy masters it and soon learns that with the power of yielding this sword comes a great price. A warrior is born who fights many battles yet it is quickly established that this young man is very much fighting human wars quenching a thirst for power and balancing this with his love for his family particularly his mother. His mother renounces her son's violent ways and requests him to undergo the greatest education any person can a journey.On his journey as an ordinary traveller the prince encounters friends and learns to eat peasant food with his trusty horse Pawan who mirroring an opposite reflection to Asoka's seemingly black heart is pure white with eyes that steal the heart of anyone who gazes into them. While exploring through a forest he meets the Princess Kaurwaki Kareena Kapoor whose eyes mesmerise one moment and warn off invaders in a blink. She is the embodiment of beauty and the prince introduces himself as Pawan to her only to find there is a price on her head and she accompanied by General Bheema Rahul Dev and young Prince Arya Suraj Balaji are on their own journey to make it alive to Kalinga where their destiny awaits them.The journey of Asoka continues with trials and love jealousy and betrayal all making up cornerstones of what Prince Asoka experiences along the way. He falls flawlessly in love with Kaurwaki and she becomes his soul and purpose of living but destiny strikes a blow only to begin a mission born in rage and spread by blood. To reveal the rest of the movie would be taking too much from the audiences' viewing pleasure but the journey for Asoka is far from over.A story of a traveller's travels his education that is the journey the loves and losses and wars and redemption all encompass this 173 minute epic that grips the viewer from the moment the camera pans down onto Asoka as if indicating it is descending onto a mountain full of riches within up until the deeply disturbing ending which leaves the viewer with a ray of hope before the credits flash to announce not the end of the story but the beginning.Santosh Sivan's camerawork and direction are par excellence as his unique flashtechnique and use of many shots to accentuate a minor detail in a scene all add together to create a cleverly woven story immortalised on film. In some sequences the camera cuts like a sword with flashes of residue left lingering both on screen and in the viewer's mind yet in others following he uses less shots and still manages to maintain rhythm. A film such as Asoka cannot be appreciated on a single viewing alone as upon initial contact one is simply bombarded with an onslaught of visual delights spellbinding sounds and a story that emerges from our past but still reaches into the depths of every man's soul.Performance wise Shah Rukh Khan is the life of the movie. His acting prowess is detailed to the fullest in emotional gutwrenching scenes that portray innocence rage peace and longing all through his demeanour and eyelanguage. Asoka's arrogance and clarity of his every action coupled with the consistent river of flowing energy is evident through the actor's performance which to his credit leaves one finding the line which ends with the character and turns into actor. Asoka could not only be Shah Rukh's greatest screen incarnation but also a clear message to international cinema of his screen presence dedication and mastery of his art.Kareena Kapoor as the warrior princess who acts as sister and mother figure to Arya a cautious then enduring lover to Asoka and emerges as someone on her own personal journey in search of her identity and sense of belonging while juggling her duties heart and mind in a three ring circus Kareena gives what is by far her finest performance to date. After her innocent and natural debut in Refugee she is finally allowed to once more realise her potential and play a character that only she could do justice to. Her look sans make up except a few lines accentuating her eyes as the window to her soul is as pure as the princess herself and the image of her going to get milk fully wrapped except for her eyes is of sheer cinematic delight. Kareena has mastered the art of acting with her whole body in a short span of time and her performance in Asoka proves this. One hopes her potential is continually unlocked and her future holds many more performances and films of this calibre.It is ironical that a film inspired by history is destined to make history itself by being the first Indian masterpiece to be shown at so many festivals in so many countries and shown nationwide breaking into mainstream British cinema. It is certainly one of Indian cinema's finest offerings and deserves the attention it is bound to receive missing out on this homage to true cinematic form would be like missing history. Go see it.Fuad Omar.".

I would have loved to have seen more of the underwater scene in ROSHNI SE  innovative and full of grace and playfulness.The Baadshah King of Bollywood SHAH RUKH KHAN demonstrates his personal aura of majesty and magnetism classy gutsy seductive and intense he IS Asoka incarnate imperious vengeful or romantic .every move and emotion delivering a message of Grace Truth and Sincerity straight to the viewer's heart.More famously known for his exuberant dancing irrepressible energy and audacity Shah Rukh's flawless portrayal is so internalized and contained with moments of chilling stillness that it's difficult to remember any of his previous persona. Shah Rukh in his prime is a formidable unforgettable vision.Another highlight was Shah Rukh's graceful Kallaripayattu martial art and oneonone combat scenes especially with the enthralling snake sword almost balletic in execution no pun intended  giving added dimension to the phrase Poetry In Motion'.Shah Rukh's intensity reminds me of Martin Sheen who was 35 in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now' a highlight of Hollywood history in its time the same age as Shah Rukh in Asoka.The entire cast lends excellent support with many outstanding scenes and no disappointments. Karriena is bewitching young Suraj beguiling and Rahul Dev fiercely protective to help flesh out Santosh Sivan's magnificent movie. Ajith Kumar impresses more every time I see this movie and successfully evokes sympathy from an unsympathetic role.Costume and set design forsake the typical lavish royal' trimmings giving a clean timeless look of elegant simplicity to haunting visuals in soft muted colours except for the rich rich red and stunning peacock blue fabrics in subtle harmony with the luxurious foliage.

Yes its not yr typical music of the Indian setting but if u listen Anu Malik has done something very interesting with the classical instruments of the age. This music has an evolved feel to it that actually serves the movie very well. Its was an ambitious move that the director pulled off. So many bollywood films have the same songs the same formula the same dreary uninventive sound  these songs were different sounding even if they touched on the same typical subjects. And the lyrics are beautiful in a lot of them granted not the 'tayar hoja'. the script wasn't amazing but far surpasses the embarrassing lines of some many other Indian movies but it served its purpose. the actions scenes were better crafted then most Indian cinema pieces  the use of cgi would have been tacky and poor  until we have an industry that can create a war scene on full scale its a bad idea.. Shah rukh khan did a good job kareena kapoor was beautiful and I'm not a big fan. no one acted cringingly as so many Indian actors do.finally yes the movie may have achieved something more had it been historically correct but u r warned as a viewer that the film isn't historically correct and some features are fictional. who cares? its still good cinema. not everything needs a wonderful sweeping message.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is underrated and deserves more then the 6.8 from the users' rating here in IMDb. Shahrukh Khan is totally hot and perfect as Asoka but I don't understand why so many people are saying bad things about the actress Kareena Kapoor that in my opinion was also nice in the role of Kaurwaki. Well Whatever''Asoka'' is a very beautiful film with a great cinematography scenarios and clothes. It is also a great epic from the Indian movies that deserves to be watched by people of all ages and even not being 100 faithful about the real Asoka's life it is a great adaptation of it. The only two things I need to complain are  The songs that are not a masterpiece like in ''Lagaan'' and also doesn't have anything to do with the story of the movie. In most of the Indian movies  the songs always have lyrics about what is happening to the characters. In ''Asoka'' they don't. The end of the film. After the tension if Kaurwaki and Asoka are going to be together or not the end should show at least a little bit about their lives as a noble couple. Another thing I missed was to see the good things Asoka did for his people like spreading the Buddhism and doing great constructions and monuments. It would help the end to be better specially after seeing such a massive destruction and annihilation.Finally many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'' that is directed by Dick Lowry the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.And Kauwarki being undercover and protected by General Bheema remembers me a classic from Akira Kurosawa''Kakushitoride no sanakunin''' more well known as ''The Hidden fortress'' where the general Rokurota Makabe takes care of princess yuki in an identical situation of Kauwarki.Prince Asokaafter leaving his kingdom by his mother's wishes since he is being hunted by his own brothers falls in love with the beautiful princess Kaurwaki. Kaurwaki doesn't know he is a prince but eventually falls in love with him too spite of the efforts of the general to let her safe from everybody since she and her brother are being hunted by the Kallinga traitors.But when Asoka returns his kingdom to talk with his mother he doesn't find Kaurwaki  thinking that she was killed by the Kallinga traitors he falls into despair and becomes a brutal emperor.".

In most of the Indian movies  the songs always have lyrics about what is happening to the characters. In ''Asoka'' they don't. The end of the film. After the tension if Kaurwaki and Asoka are going to be together or not the end should show at least a little bit about their lives as a noble couple. Another thing I missed was to see the good things Asoka did for his people like spreading the Buddhism and doing great constructions and monuments. It would help the end to be better specially after seeing such a massive destruction and annihilation.Finally many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'' that is directed by Dick Lowry the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.And Kauwarki being undercover and protected by General Bheema remembers me a classic from Akira Kurosawa''Kakushitoride no sanakunin''' more well known as ''The Hidden fortress'' where the general Rokurota Makabe takes care of princess yuki in an identical situation of Kauwarki.Prince Asokaafter leaving his kingdom by his mother's wishes since he is being hunted by his own brothers falls in love with the beautiful princess Kaurwaki. Kaurwaki doesn't know he is a prince but eventually falls in love with him too spite of the efforts of the general to let her safe from everybody since she and her brother are being hunted by the Kallinga traitors.But when Asoka returns his kingdom to talk with his mother he doesn't find Kaurwaki  thinking that she was killed by the Kallinga traitors he falls into despair and becomes a brutal emperor.";

Asoka's mother orders him to leave Magadha to save his life and while traveling he meets Princess Kaurwaki Karriena Kapoor and her brother Prince Aryan Sooraj Balaji from Kalinga who are undercover and protected by General Bheema Rahul Dev. Asoka and Kaurwaki falls in love for each other but the mother of Asoka calls him back to Magadha.

When Asoka's mother is killed by a man of Susima Asoka becomes mad kills all his evil brothers but Sugatra who escapes to Kalinga. Asoka decides to conquer Kalinga but in the end he concludes that he has not built an empire but conquered only corpses and destroyed everything and he decides to spread love and the Buddhism with his son and his daughter.Asoka is a spectacular epic from Bolywood. In Brazil there are very few Indian movies released on DVD but all of them are excellent. Asoka is one of the best with a beautiful romance very dramatic situations and great actions scenes and a touching conclusion. The actress Karriena Kapoor is extremely beautiful and sexy and has a great chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. The boy Sooraj Balaji has a great performance in the role of a prince. Unfortunately the lyrics of the songs have not been translated in the Brazilian DVD. From other Bolywood movies I am sure that the songs are very important since they always tell something about the feelings of the characters in that moment. By the way the music score is excellent. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Asoka".

	schema:headline " An Indian Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragonincredible!";
	schema:reviewBody "2001 in spite of everything might be remembered as the year Bollywood met Hollywood in the flesh. Years from now film historians critics and fans will remember this film as a landmark an unparalleled achievement. This incredible film really needs to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated fully.Santosh Sivan the gifted cinematographer best known in the USA for the arthouse hit The Terrorist and in India for his work with director Mani Ratnam switches gears completely. While The Terrorist was a tiny contemplative drama Asoka is bigger than big a total opposite. In fact I read that the war sequence was the largest of its kind ever filmed in the history of Indian cinema.Asoka a littleknown figure in the West was a bloodthirsty maniac who became a bastion for peace and tolerance through Buddhism in the 3rd century ce. The film is a journey a character study of Asoka's progression to the time when he first embraced the Buddha. Some have complained that there is nothing in the film about his conversion to Buddhism but that is really not the film's point. The events that led up to this transformation are what the film is really about.Particular attention needs to be made to the cinematography and editingit is nothing short of extraordinary. Done with an uncanny sensitivity Sivan brings third century India to breathing bustling life in a way that perhaps no one else could deliver with such vitality and beauty. However portions of the editing are a little too MTV for my taste with white flashes and jumpcuts interrupting establishing shots. It functions well though during the fight scenes. It is a strange dichotomy between art and commercial cinema. You'll never see swordplay in the same way again.Pay attention to the acting tooit is excellent. Kareena Kapoor proves that she's a much finer actress than her older sister Karisma and Shahrukh Khan currently India's biggest star gives the performance of his life. Both show incredible nuances. Also Suraj Balaje who plays the young prince Arya shows a surprising maturity and even comedian Johnny Lever in a cameo role as a soldier is excellent. If you are not familiar with commercial Indian cinema the acting may seem like it is a bit over the top but here the entire cast especially the leads shows tremendous restraint. Know however that the overthetop acting style a staple of commercial Indian cinema has a direct connection to traditions that are hundreds and hundreds years old in the classical styles of the Sanskrit and Parsee theater.The inevitable comparisons between Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Asoka are warranted. This is the first commercial Indian film to receive nationwide distribution in the US in this case through the independent First Look Pictures and it is poised to bring an otherwise unknown filmmaking tradition in the American mainstream to a wide US audience. Both films are sumptuous recreations of history although this film is based on an actual historical figure and CTHD is based on a novel. Both films have amazing fight choreography Asoka's done without the aid of computers. Personally I am biased toward commercial Indian cinema because it holds much more of a mystique. Sadly because of the image that commercial Indian cinema holds in the USA it may never see the wide audience that this film so deserves.Whereas the Hong Kong action picture has heavy doses of martial arts the commercial Indian film has songs akin to musicals but in this case more like music videos. There are five songs in the film and they may be a turnoff to those not familiar with mainstream Indian cinema. However they are wellintegrated into the story line and they are among the best filmi Indian film songs I have ever heard combining modern and ancient instruments with just a touch of electronica. The film really loses some of its impact if they are cutthey are that important. They are wellpicturized term for the filming of musical numbers in Indian cinema and provide additional atmosphere. The influence of MTV is apparent in the editing style that takes over during the song sequences this may interrupt the film's rhythm and impact but they are part of the overall story. Unfortunately I believe that the song sequences are being cut severely for international release although I was lucky enough to see them in full DTS digital sound. Because of the need for Indian cinema to appeal to as wide an audience as possible the allIndia film and because filmgoing in India is a family experience films try to appeal to all members of the family. This means that violent scenes can turn into comedy many genres are often combined and there is neither sex nor nudity not even kissing on the lips because of a puritanical society. Overall this may be seem cheesy to American audiences but this is one of the pleasures of commercial Indian cinema. It is strange though with its lack of any nudity or sex which are all suggested but never shown that the film received an R rating. Yes it is VERY violent but the violence is quite stylized and often uses the power of suggestion rather than actual representation. I hope sincerely that when First Look releases the DVD the film is completely uncut and complete with ALL the songs.The film's last song Raat Ka Nasha would be my Oscar pick for best song an exemplar of superior filmi. The film itself definitely deserves an Oscar for Best ForeignLanguage Film. It is a big bonus to see a film of such high production values devoid of any references to Western civilization or without any Western aesthetics. Incredibly entertaining something for everyone music drama romance violence with unparalleled highquality production values and a moving story Asoka is a dynamite cinematic experience. It is that good. Peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was the video cover of ASOKA that attracted me to the film . It claims to be as spectacular as GLADIATOR  a really good epic film I'd seen a couple of days previously. The video cover tells us it's about the Emperor Asoka of the 3rd Century BC though it doesn't claim to be historically accurate. Well BRAVEHEART was farcical in it's accuracy but the battle scenes were good  so that didn't put me off  or the fact that it was subtitled. After all DAS BOOT had subtitles and that's one of the finest antiwar films ever made so I stuck ASOKA into the VCR expecting GLADIATOR meets BRAVEHEART. I got a disappointing surprise  ASOKA is a Bollywood movie.I've nothing against Bollywood films are made as a form of mass entertainment and outside the American industry Bollywood stands heads and shoulders above all the other countries of the World put together which is evidence of its success  it's just that I find them unfocused when it comes to genres. Can you imagine a James Bond film suddenly turning into a musical ?As for the  Epic  merits of ASOKA itself I was very disappointed. Within the first ten minutes we have a line stolen from CROCODILE DUNDEE and a battle scene stolen from SPARTACUS which isn't as exciting as it sounds. Indeed some the fight scenes are laughable with the camera locked onto the actors faces in a completely unconvincing attempt to hide the fact that there are about a dozen or so actors comprising an army. Having said that the final battle is relatively well done with a cast of hundreds  though it's not all that impressive if you've seen GLADIATOR a couple of days previously.POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS My major complaint is the bitter sweet ending which preaches the message that evil begets evil  violence begets violence. It's a poignant and serious message so why did we have 5 song and dance routines in the first half of the film ? And the fact that the musical numbers disappear half way through gives the film in general and the ending in particular an extremely uneven feel. If the producers wanted to make a musical then they should have done so if they wanted to make a serious epic they should have done so  as it is ASOKA might have appealed to some people but not to me".

Shahrukh Khan was voted as the sexiest man in Asia and his partner is considered as the sexiest babe in India a grandaughter of a dynasty of actors in India. if u like professionally made quality movies if u like some chemistry romance love combined with action in battlefield excellent music and hot actors in a meaningful movie ASOKA is definitely yours. u gotta watch it for sure then. trust on my word.".

	schema:headline " An Epic of the First Order";
	schema:reviewBody "This film combining familiar elements of epics such as Gladiator and Braveheart is directed by the internationally renowned Indian director Santosh Sivan. Sivan is primarily known for his lowbudget arthouse hit The Terrorist. Asoka is quite different from The Terrorist in both scale and starpower. Shah Rukh Khan India's biggest star plays the Mauryan Emperor Asoka who wages bloody wars across the country only to renounce violence when he witnesses the aftermath of the destruction he causes. Drawn from legends and folk tales about the emperor much of the film is not historical fact. However the narrative provides true entertainment. Some criticism Asoka seems to be using the same Bollywood love story formula and augmenting the story of Asoka onto that formula. If it had been the other way around this film would have been far more intriguing and relevent. Most of the movie revolves around his romance with his one true love princess Kaurwaki played by Kareena Kapoor. We are left not knowing much about Asoka's message of peace only his trials with love. On top of that the poor song and dance numbers in the film disrupt the narrative flow. On the other hand while Anu Malik does a bad job with the composition of the songs the composers Sandeep Chowta and Ranjit Barot weave a superb musical score seamlessly into the film. Even with its faults Asoka is gripping through and through with spectacular battle scenes fine acting by Khan and also notably Ajit Kumar who plays Asoka's duplicitous brother Susima. Techincally the film is unbeatable by any other Indian film to date. The editing is fast paced and spectacularly done by Sreekar Prasad the premier film editor of India.  The direction is magnificent and above all else the cinematography done by Sivan himself is indescribably gorgeous. It is sumptuous and spectacularly vivid. Sivan is regarded as one of the world's premiere cinematogaphers and this film is proof positive of that. This film should like Aamir Khan's Lagaan be able to break through to western audiences. All in all a great acheivement.".

I read the comments section of this movie and I see a lot of people make excuses to why so much romance was involved in what should have been a serious dramatization of Asoka the tyrant and Asoka the saint. They say that without romance the movie would not have been entertaining. The ones that say this likely have never seen the real good stuff such as Lawrence in Arabia. Seriously imagine Lawrence of Arabia movie not imagine if several scenes portraying his multilayered character were replaced with some romantic scenes with a scantily clad beauty in the desert. That movie would have been laughed at globally. A similar form of adulteration was done in the plot of Asoka. I am startled by the kind of praise this movie has received despite the utter dilution and corruption of topic at hand. The problem with general Indian audience is they do not even know what makes a good movie. If someone made the movie Asoka without romance and mostly focusing on conquests and spiritual messages the same fans who are praising this movie would have loved it and probably called their all time favorite. Problem with Indian movie making industry is you very rarely get movies that have been flawlessly directed and focused on a certain topic. This has made the fanbase laud mediocrity. I am terribly disappointed in Santosh Sivan who went this route possibly at the behest of producers. I do not doubt Sivan's credentials but someone like Gowariker would have probably made a far superior flick by condensing the romance to about 10 of what we saw. Sivan and SRK probably took this route to earn profits but this movie was a huge disappointment at the box office. I believe that if this movie got a Gowariker treatment where he would not give two fs about catering to the masses the movie would have done much better.".

He's convinced his writing is of no lasting value but he still has an ego about his work and his masculine appeal. He's drawn to a museum guide he sees on his first afternoon and when she appears at dinner he tries charm. She reads widely knows his work loved it once and now finds it trivial and she says so. He's stung. The next day they walk through a cemetery where she talks of a dead peasant's poems and he grabs an idea of hers as the theme for a new play. She remains indifferent he's baffled.

	schema:headline " The Forbidden Theme";
	schema:reviewBody "The Theme is a film that had to stay on the shelf for almost ten years because of its theme. Mikhail Ulyanov plays Kim Yesenin a disillusioned and cynical playwright who uses the system by writing the conformist plays and enjoys the benefits of being the officially recognized and appointed great Soviet writer but who in reality has been used by a system and spent all the talent he ever had in writing the plays that had no artistic value whatsoever. Bitter irony lies in the name of the character Sergei Yesenin was a real life enormously talented widely popular and beloved Russian poet who committed suicide at the age of 30 in 1925 because he could not fit in the Soviet Russia. Kim Yesenin in the movie suffers the writing block and arrives to the small provincial town with a friend and a young mistress in search of inspiration. He meets an attractive intelligent and well educated museum guide named Sasha Inna Churikova never looked so beautiful and sophisticated and I finally understood why Panfilov always had been fascinated by her face never conventionally pretty who used to be a big fan of his earlier works but has a lot of unflattering things to say about his officially praised outings. Sasha is in love with a talented historian who had made a very difficult and life changing decision to emigrate from the Soviet Union. He had lost his job by becoming a dissident and had to work as a gravedigger to support himself while waiting for permission to leave the country. Those who never had to emigrate from their country knowing that they might leave forever and never be allowed to go back to see their loved ones and the places dear to their heart again would not fully understand why Panfilov's film had to stay on the shelf for almost ten year after it was completed. It was released only during the perestroika in 1987 and I saw it then. I respect Panfilov for his siding with the real artists rejected by the system but his film is not only a courageous statement against the conformity suffocating cultural life under the Brezhnev regime which would be later called period zastoya or stagnation it is a memorable work of cinema with very good performances from his muse Inna Churikova Mikhail Ulyanov and supporting cast.".

This films has one of the best scripts ever. I'll say right now that this film will be a love or hate.I love the mood atmosphere and the location. I think there are to songs used throughout the film very effectively and just at the perfect times one is a piece by Shubert so they say in the film and the other an instrumentalvocal song probably written for the film. I've never liked a film where the character thinks to himself and we hear his thoughts as much as this one. The writer rambles around the old snowy town thinking and we hear his thoughts. This is how the film works his thoughts are never hidden from us we hear his voice whatever he may be doing. Incredibly well calculated cinematography. I love the pacing the shots so completely natural and perfect for the story. My favorite scene like I'm sure many other's is the 20 minute dinner scene. I can't begin to describe it but the dialogue is so well written acted and shot. This scene has the funniest and saddest moments and great characters. BTW this film has absolutely no credits at the beginning of this film it jumps straight into the story I love that. Finally I'd compare this movie and i don't like to compare movies to Bressen's Diary of a Country Priest and Tarkovsky's Nostalghia. In all three film we hear the main character's thoughts. it's much closer to Nostalghia because the guy's a writer and because his narration is present tense where as Diary.. is retrospective. Visually TEMA I like using the Russian name because it's spelled the same in English and Russian TEMA can't be compared to either film though again the deep depressed existentialist mood is closer to Tarkovsky. Again love or hate. If you like film where the time flows naturally and character's actions are realistic and the story itself is honest and deep if you don't mind a lot of excellent dialogue say Manoel De Oliviera's Um Filme FaladoA Talking Picture and an immersive ride for the main character's odyssey you might like this. This film would be best watched very attentively without distractions the sound up dark room or simply as comfortably as possible because it has such deep thoughts. Incredible film purely. I haven't gone into the story much because I can't say much to make explain it's brilliance one should just take a chance and seek it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "'From this day forward' is a rare enough film in Hollywood part of the postwar cycle of cominghome movies of GIs returning from the ironic certainties and status of war and finding the stability of home fraught and precarious jobs gone identity questioned loved ones changed.  The masterpiece of this cycle is 'The Best Years of our lives' and 'Forward' may not be in that class despite some critics' admiration for it.  But it is a different kind of film from Wyler's  the latter shows the war as an irrecoverable breach a disjunction between past and present where the postwar world cannot simply return to that before it.  Its heroes were men with secure identities before the war took them away. For Bill Cummings the war was a break from a life of banality mediocrity poverty unemployment frustrated ambition even brushes with the law. Though rigorously focused on the domestic on men who have been to put it crudely feminised dependent on a breadwinning wife denied an arena in which to express their masculine status and thus paving the way for the melodramas of Minnelli and Sirk the film is not a melodrama in the sense of giddy emotional highs and miserable lows.  'Forward' is rare in Hollywood because it is content to focus on unremarkable ordinariness the undifferentiated relentless grind of life from which brief epiphanies or happiness can be salvaged.  These are lives gradually frayed by economic circumstance  there is no melodramatic adultery or contrived plot mechanisms like that even the singular encounter with the obscenity laws not exactly the fate of every John Doe is made bathetic and normalised.  The best and most characteristic sequence of the movie is when Bill gets a nightshift job while his wife Susan still works by day  obviously they rarely meet one asleep when the other comes home.  Noone of course is to blame but frustrations mount tempers wear and the couple gradually become less familiar to one another have to watch what they say becoming clumsy resulting in that wonderful scene on the bridge where Bill gives Susan a ghastly anniversary present with money hocked from the tool kit on which he depends for his livelihood.Although the war is a crucial four year break tearing the couple apart it is absent in narrative terms present only in the scene where Hitler blares from a megaphone as Susan makes illtimed plans for motherhood.  For most people the film suggests in America at any rate the war was a good thing a rare burst of prosperity  now for most people the grind must begin again.  Very few Hollywood films of the period suggested this such fears were usually displaced onto the nightmares of film noir.  And bravely the film never cops out  although seemingly upbeat Bill and Susan have even more problems at the end than when they began  she is pregnant he is still unemployed the final gigantic crane shot of this tiny couple on a huge bridge their uncertain future stretching before them is very poignant.The film's two main formal devices  moving from the individual to the wider social context showing that Bill's is only one story among millions and also the external circumstances that decide his personal wellbeing and moving between past and present ironising the optimism of the title  create a narrative tapestry of unusual depth in Hollywood a series of vignettes revealing a particular time and place in American history as well as the people that lived it the families and individuals the entrepreneurs and workers the artists and housewives.  This is a thoroughly decent film in the best Hollywood liberal tradition and I'm glad it was made.  I can't say i enjoyed it very much.  Maybe I like the 'contrivances' of melodrama too much.  The acting is amiable  and Joan Fontaine is enchanting freed from her mousy persona   but lightweight especially compared to the giants in Wyler's film.  I don't know maybe decency just isn't always very exciting.".

Noone of course is to blame but frustrations mount tempers wear and the couple gradually become less familiar to one another have to watch what they say becoming clumsy resulting in that wonderful scene on the bridge where Bill gives Susan a ghastly anniversary present with money hocked from the tool kit on which he depends for his livelihood.Although the war is a crucial four year break tearing the couple apart it is absent in narrative terms present only in the scene where Hitler blares from a megaphone as Susan makes illtimed plans for motherhood.  For most people the film suggests in America at any rate the war was a good thing a rare burst of prosperity  now for most people the grind must begin again.  Very few Hollywood films of the period suggested this such fears were usually displaced onto the nightmares of film noir.  And bravely the film never cops out  although seemingly upbeat Bill and Susan have even more problems at the end than when they began  she is pregnant he is still unemployed the final gigantic crane shot of this tiny couple on a huge bridge their uncertain future stretching before them is very poignant.The film's two main formal devices  moving from the individual to the wider social context showing that Bill's is only one story among millions and also the external circumstances that decide his personal wellbeing and moving between past and present ironising the optimism of the title  create a narrative tapestry of unusual depth in Hollywood a series of vignettes revealing a particular time and place in American history as well as the people that lived it the families and individuals the entrepreneurs and workers the artists and housewives.  This is a thoroughly decent film in the best Hollywood liberal tradition and I'm glad it was made.  I can't say i enjoyed it very much.  Maybe I like the 'contrivances' of melodrama too much.  The acting is amiable  and Joan Fontaine is enchanting freed from her mousy persona   but lightweight especially compared to the giants in Wyler's film.  I don't know maybe decency just isn't always very exciting.";

	schema:headline " Joan Fontaine's most radiant performance";
	schema:reviewBody "In this film Joan Fontaine comes closest to being a true 'screen goddess' and she surpasses the magic even of her performances in REBECCA 1940 and LETTER TO AN UNKNOWN WOMAN 1948 which most people including myself until now have thought her best. The trouble is that this film appears to have been suppressed for political reasons for nearly seventy years. It does not seem ever to have been released on video or DVD in America or Britain. I came across it because I was seeking films featuring Mark Stevens and this starring role opposite Fontaine was effectively his debut. I discovered that this title was available in France in the series of RKO pictures inexpensively distributed there by Editions Montparnasse. So I ordered it from French Amazon. It is now available in that French edition from British and American Amazon at higher prices. Just before the film begins you select 'Version Originale' and you get it without French subtitles. The film is based upon a powerful novel by Thomas Bell 19031961 entitled 'All Brides Are Beautiful' which is a sardonic line of dialogue delivered by Fontaine in the film. Five writers wrote and rewrote the screenplay including the well known Garson Kanin Clifford Odets and Charley Schnee. The result of all that work was superb. The film was magnificently and brilliantly directed by John Berry whose film noir TENSION 1949 see my review starring Audrey Totter in probably her finest role is a classic. Berry had what cynics calls 'a social conscience' and he was blacklisted and could not go on working in America so he moved to France dying there in 1999 aged 82 having directed many French films. His popularity in France doubtless explains why the French have rescued this early masterpiece of his and put it into circulation for the first time. This film is so amazing that the final shot in the film alone is so breathtaking that it is truly one for cinema history. The film is that rare thing an American example of what we now call NeoRealism and it even outdoes Robert Rossellini who the year before had made ROME OPEN CITY and this year was making PAISAN with Germany YEAR ZERO to follow two years later. This film is an ode to the power of innocent young love to triumph over all obstacles and there are plenty of those! The film portrays the full depth of the squalor and horror of lower middle class life in New York City in the 1930s and 1940s. Fontaine's sister and her family are so poor that they survive only by sending their little son to ask the local butcher for a soup bone for the dog to chew. The butcher knows there is no dog and she boils the bone to make soup which is their only food. The horrors of social injustice of sudden loss of jobs and resultant total penury of persecution by the authorities and the courts of Stevens for 'offending against the League of Decency' by illustrating a book with paintings he has done of nude models resulting in a criminal record which prevents his getting employment the crushing bureaucracy in the search for a job the brutality of daily life and the coarseness of friends and neighbours are all shown in grim detail. This film portrays the hollow nature of the myth of the American Dream with such overwhelming power and passion that even today it seems that it is considered so dangerously subversive that no one must be allowed to see it. The story commences in 1946 the year the film was made with Stevens returning to civilian life at last having been a master sergeant in the Army. As we see his pathetic and heroic struggles to find employment again as a machine lathe operator in a factory we view the history of his marriage to Fontaine in 1938 and the years before the War in flashbacks. We never see him in the Army since this is a film exclusively about civilian life and of a soldier returning to it. Stevens is perfectly cast as the 'good man' married to the 'angel' Fontaine both of them doomed to struggle against the most grinding poverty imaginable. Despite the constant despair of their situation they keep the freshness of their love for one another shining amidst the gloom. It was undoubtedly the purpose of the film to contrast the goodness of the characters with the shallowness and callousness of so many other characters in the film but above all to portray them in the sharpest possible contrast to their intolerable situation. Here we see the merciless and heartless American nondream trying to crush the idyll of love of two pure souls but despite everything that life can throw at then they refuse to crack. Berry wishes these two simple people fortified by love to be seen as the true American heroes. His hatred of everyone and everything that tries to destroy them is so strong that he strips away all the myths of a land of plenty to show how a divine light can still shine deep within a dung heap in defiance of all lies brutality and hypocrisy. This film was John Berry's testament but watching it is a far from comfortable experience. It challenges all of our cozy assumptions and it makes us realize how lucky we are if we have even a few pennies to our name or can afford the dizzying luxury of actually eating supper tonight. Perhaps every spoilt brat child in America today should be forced to stop playing video games for an hour and a half and made to watch this film and get some realistic perspective on life. But the social challenge posed by this film is too great hence its shocking suppression in the Englishspeaking world for three quarters of a century. We must not be allowed to see it!".

It's admirable that she wants to participate in the life of a former soldier who now ends up unemployed after the war. And to a certain degree it fits in with her image of being the devoted housewife who is loyal to her husband. But this is not how most women are and that's why the film kind of drags its feet with a sense of unreality. There are a few films of this period that deal with unemployment but it's depressing to watch. It doesn't make good entertainment and the writer needs to find more creative ways to tell the story of unemployment after the war. The performances are good but the handling of the subject matter is too linear.".

And to a certain degree it fits in with her image of being the devoted housewife who is loyal to her husband. But this is not how most women are and that's why the film kind of drags its feet with a sense of unreality. There are a few films of this period that deal with unemployment but it's depressing to watch. It doesn't make good entertainment and the writer needs to find more creative ways to tell the story of unemployment after the war. The performances are good but the handling of the subject matter is too linear.";

This film is classy and well made much the same as Ken Russell's later film Whore 1991. It has the same sense of lightheartedness and is actually well written.Much of the dialogue is clever witty and bitingly effective. The performances are top notch  particularly Perkins as the maniacal priest whom is captivated by the streetsmart fashiondesignercumhooker Turner. The sexual scenes are bold but not sexually explicit.It is truly amazing to see Kathleen Turner in this film as opposed to her performance as a fat frumpy conservative and highly religious middleaged mother in the Virgin Suicides 1999. I cannot think of a character performance so diametrically opposite to the one in Crimes of Passion. I recommend you rent both films and watch them back to back. It is sure to make your head spin and perhaps even generate a sense of appreciation for the diversity of Turner's acting ability!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's no surprise that Ken Russell's ambitious psychosexual drama Crimes of Passion was not well received upon its initial release back in 1984. But to be fair based on the heavy edits required to achieve an 'R' rating it's hard to imagine the film having the same sort of effect as the unrated director's cut. Explicitness is key to a film of this nature  necessary for provoking audience reaction but also for providing a raw layer of intensity to which the viewer can connect with. For example the explicit dialogue in the bedroom confessional scene between Bobby  Amy Grady equally fine performances from John Laughlin and Annie Potts effectively captures the real disconnect present within so many relationships. On one hand there's a need andor desire for sex as a means of fulfillment and expression of love but on the other hand there are responsibilities associated with family life that may impede that desire or in the case of the character of Amy Grady a general lack of sexual desire is just part of her persona. Meanwhile this leaves her husband Bobby feeling discontented. The film asks then just how important is sex? Is it an essential part of being happy? In stark contrast to the dynamic between Bobby  Amy Grady is the character of China BlueJoanna Crane  played with absolute gusto by Kathleen Turner giving one of the finest performances of her career. While her motives remain for the most part unclear the character of China Blue appears to be using sex as a control mechanism. But what is it that she is trying to control? Through the use of some fairly explicit sex scenes it seems apparent that she enjoys the sex itself while also enjoying the anonymity and emotional disconnect involved with being a girl for hire. But is this feeling the result of her actual disdain for having that emotional connection or is it a result of having been scarred by a past relationship? The power play argument is reinforced by seeing the Joanna Crane side of the character  a highly successful undergarment designer with a cool car and a great apartment someone who seems to have it all yet wants to take her power one step further. This theory is drawn into question of course! when her path crosses with Bobby Grady someone who seems to be able to offer her the entire package she secretly longs for. To complicate things further there's the character of Rev. Peter Shayne an Oscar worthy performance from Anthony Perkins a man so distraught and shamed by his own inner demons that he seeks his own redemption through the course of offering to redeem China Blue. Throw in an enjoyably hypnotic yet cheesy  dated synthesizer score and the usual striking visual imagery and religious allegory that Ken Russell is well known for and the result is a thought provoking and highly entertaining film. Best recommended to those who don't mind being left with a lot of unanswered questions at the end or who aren't easily offended  an 810 this film is destined to become a major classic and deserves repeated viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite weird movie of all time and I say that because of the numerous things that just do not belong and dont make sense.  Like why is Turner a hooker? Shes a fashion designer during the day why does she degrade herself at night?  Does she get a thrill off of it its never really explained.  Whats with that dopey music video featuring a family of weirdos jumping into a pool dressed in wedding attire?  You'll have no idea what it means but again thats one of the charms of the film for me silly scenes that make no sense.  Another would be Perkins stabbing a blow up doll with a vibrator with tons o' blood gushing about.  Another you squint at but then laugh at loud to.  Though there are moments of confusion there are plenty of terrific scenes most surprisingly shot unbroken without cuts.  One has Laughlin and Potts discussing their probs in bed for about 10 minutes without breaking the shot.  Very professional actors make it look impressive.  Most of the plot deals with Laughlins character a struggling home securities guy stuck in a stale marriage.  He gets involved with Turner though she has her own problems like constant harrassment from Perkins demented street preacher.  The three are very strong from start to finish especially Kathleen in my favorite performance of hers ever.  She has a ton of great oneliners that inject humor at the right moments without it looking out of place.  If your unfamiliar with the films history you may be unaware of the different versions available.  Back in 84 it was too graphic for an R rating so they released an R Unrated and X rated version.  I've only seen the R and Unrated and there are considerable changes made.  The R does not contain shots of Turners face during a rather intimate moment at the beginning of the film.  And they also totally threw out a hardcore scene involving a cop and Turner engaged in nasty nookie.  As well as Turner and Laughlins first love scene where several positions shown only in shadow were taken out.  But in terms of the story those scenes are not crucial so no harm done.  Either way you go this will be one of the more stranger film experiences you'll ever have.  I mean where else are you gonna see someone actually killed at the end of a movie with a vibrator?!! And I cant forget the terrific sexy saxaphone score by Rick Wakeman which he reworked from previous material.".

	schema:headline " Goodbye China Blue";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the film which demonstrated what a great actress Turner is and why she should still be a bigger star today than perhaps she is. She has such a wonderful voice and figure in this film  it's as if the part was written especially for her perhaps it was! It also shows you how good Perkins was in a role where he could let himself go as over the top as Russell would like him to. He Perkins must have loved it. The musical score is supposedly written by Rick Wakeman but is of course derived from Dvorak's New World Symphony. Wakeman does a great job and the music adds to the gloss of the film. The saxophone playing in the lovemaking scene is sensual in the extreme. Anthony Perkins has several monologues that serve as a narrative for the audience. Not for the wowserish nor is it pornographic using clever imagery to allude to what is occurring it is full of very witty memorable oneliners.This is easily Kathleen's best film work and really no other American actress has ever shown such intimacy and duality in the sexuality of her character it is compelling enthralling and heart breaking. Plus you feel a connection to her because of her vulnerability that she develops as the movie unfolds. Finally her comedic timing is hilarious yes there are plenty of laugh out scenes in this film too. Perkins is simply brilliant in this role it seems to be a far cousin of the disturbed mind of Norman Bates but having grown up in major crimes of the soul and the good manners. Once more let' s remind the ineffable statement of Nicholas Machiaveli The half of the sin is the scandal.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

She has such a wonderful voice and figure in this film  it's as if the part was written especially for her perhaps it was! It also shows you how good Perkins was in a role where he could let himself go as over the top as Russell would like him to. He Perkins must have loved it. The musical score is supposedly written by Rick Wakeman but is of course derived from Dvorak's New World Symphony. Wakeman does a great job and the music adds to the gloss of the film. The saxophone playing in the lovemaking scene is sensual in the extreme. Anthony Perkins has several monologues that serve as a narrative for the audience. Not for the wowserish nor is it pornographic using clever imagery to allude to what is occurring it is full of very witty memorable oneliners.This is easily Kathleen's best film work and really no other American actress has ever shown such intimacy and duality in the sexuality of her character it is compelling enthralling and heart breaking. Plus you feel a connection to her because of her vulnerability that she develops as the movie unfolds. Finally her comedic timing is hilarious yes there are plenty of laugh out scenes in this film too. Perkins is simply brilliant in this role it seems to be a far cousin of the disturbed mind of Norman Bates but having grown up in major crimes of the soul and the good manners. Once more let' s remind the ineffable statement of Nicholas Machiaveli The half of the sin is the scandal.Overall rating 8 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is no secret that since the beginning of civilization sex and religion have always been able to maintain a unique love hate relationship with each other. The story of Adam and Eve is also viewed in the same context. Wherever there is religion sex is likely to be found and vice versa. No religion has been able to free itself from the influence of sex. This has always been a trend and it would continue to be so in near future too. Crimes of Passion might turn out to be mild for many viewers according to today's standards but it was viewed as an absolutely shocking controversial film upon its initial release in 1984. Words would fail to describe actress Kathleen Turner's impeccable performances as 'China Blue' an expensive hooker who is also leading a double life. Apart from some kinky sex scenes China blue's character allows viewers to get a glimpse of tough lives faced by hookers. The religious side is presented by actor Anthony Perkins as a crazy priest whose only obsession seems to rescue china blue from damnation at all costs. He is able to succeed to a very large extent but a sudden event completely changes the course of action. Director Ken Russell has been honest with his depiction of people with dual identities. They have been presented as they are in real life without any embellishment. 'Crimes of Passion' has a lot of hilarious lines which denounce hypocrisy falsehood and dishonesty. They are absolutely essential for viewers' comprehension in order to give them better ideas about a marriage which is on the verge of collapse due to lack of sex and how mean are societies to create and promote fallen women like China Blue for their selfish interests ?".

	schema:headline " Brilliant sleazy trash flick from Ken Russell!";
	schema:reviewBody "What a great slice of sleaze this is! Ken Russell certainly has a style of his own and it's on overdrive in Crimes of Passion as the movie is as much about the bizarre way that Russell tells his story as it is about the story itself. Crimes of Passion is unlikely to appeal to all tastes but for everyone who likes trashy and sleazy thrillers you really can't go wrong with this one! The film is very surreal and at times even takes on something of a fantasy feel. The way that Russell uses lighting and the rock theme tune which often feels slightly out of place help to keep things surreal and the heavy amount of sex makes this more than your average Hollywood thriller! A double life is the basis for the plot and here we focus on China Blue shameless hooker by night and sportswear designer by day. A street preacher meets her and decides he wants to save her soul around the same time a man is hired to spy on her by the sportswear business she works for. He later meets her as China Blue and is shown a good time...but soon the preacher starts to get out of control.This might not be particularly intelligent stuff but Crimes of Passion appealed to me because it's not quite like any other thriller I've seen and director Ken Russell seems more interested in making the film as bizarre as possible than telling a story  and that is no bad thing as it ensures that Crimes of Passion is original and that's the sort of thing that gives a film a cult following! Crimes of Passion has an interesting cast which is lead by Kathleen Turner who is just great in her double role. John Laughlin falls into the background a little bit as his role is the least interesting of the three central ones  but he's not bad. The third central role is taken up by Anthony Perkins and it suits him like a glove! Perkins wasn't so maniacal since Psycho and Russell definitely picked the right man for the job with this piece of casting! While the film isn't exactly plot heavy what story we do have flows well and there's always enough going on outside of the plot anyway  if there's one thing this film isn't it's boring! Overall Crimes of Passion is a great trash flick and it gets high recommendations from me!".

	schema:headline " Maybe not among Ken Russell's best but still a very good film";
	schema:reviewBody "Ken Russell as has been said many times before always was an interesting and unique director though also understandably controversial. Crimes of Passion is not quite Women in Love and The Devils among his best but it is certainly much better than Lisztomania and Gothic. Crimes of Passion may not be perfect with the score rather repetitive and excessively utilised and Annie Potts' deadly serious performance at odds with the rest of the performanceswhich are campier and broader she is a talented actress who wasn't able to play to her strengths. To a lesser extent also the scene with the vibrator and the blowup doll didn't make much sense and reminiscent of the irrelevant excesses that Russell could be prone to though admittedly it did have some entertainment value. Crimes of Passion does look great though very stylishly filmed with some garishness that meshed perfectly within the atmosphere. The scene with the couple in bed in conversation is shot cleverly too with a severalminute nonbreak shot. The satire is very witty and the funny moments are enough to make you laughoutloud while with the story Crimes of Passion is not plotheavy but it does keep one's attention and is paced well never what you can deem as dull. As well as funny parts there are also some poignant parts like the woman with the terminally ill husband and some shocking ones with the scene with the cop. The ending is a shocker too though also may be a headscratcher for some. The sex scenes are very lurid but also very sensual as well and Russell directs with not that much restraint here adopting the pulls no punches approach but there is nothing really distasteful either. Kathleen Turner gives one of her best performances she is very sexy and her performance is daring and even with the theatrical style of acting herein general not just with her she manages to make China sympathetic. Anthony Perkins evokes Norman Bates and brilliantly insanely psychopathic that it's scary as well as somewhat campy. John Laughlin's role is smaller and he is not as experienced or as good as Turner and Perkins but he acquits himself well. In conclusion a very good film not for everybody and Russell personally has done better but it's easy to see why it's won over people here and it does deserve its deemed cult classic status. 810 Bethany Cox".

Classic.P.S. One of my favorite scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Bruce Davidson analyzes this girl in a bar makes an animal noise and asks her if she likes the Bee Gees all while laughing. It's hilarious and it hits on an interesting point. Isn't it all just a game? If you say the right thing you get a prize.";

	schema:reviewBody "Crimes of Passion an incredibly bizarre sexually charged drama provides interesting material with which inimitable filmmaker Ken Russell can work. It's as stylish as anything he's done and maintains a gritty fairly sleazy atmosphere and a deliberate pace. Kathleen Turner is striking in the role of China Blue a lady with a double life by day she's a fashion designer real name Joanna Crane by night she's a hooker. She fascinates two men one of them an ordinary guy named Bobby Grady John Laughlin the other a fanatical socalled preacher named Peter Shayne Anthony Perkins who claims to be out to save her. Bobby was hired by Joannas' boss to tail her and she presents the young man with a fresh view of the world his relationship with his uptight wife Amy Annie Potts has soured after years of marriage and he's happy to meet somebody who doesn't have any hangups about being intimate. The movie is never quite as outrageous as some viewers may expect but that doesn't mean that there isn't some explicit imagery here and there. Its few sex scenes are done in a surprisingly tasteful manner but its dialogue is quite kinky witty and delicious it's amazing to hear ever reliable Perkins extremely well cast in one of his typical nutty roles utter lots of obscenities. He's just fantastic as always and the lovely Turner delivers a multi dimensional performance worthy of some respect. Laughlin and Potts are both fine and the cast also features people such as Bruce Davison Stephen Lee Norman Burton Peggy Feury and Gerald S. O'Loughlin but it's the two leads that truly command your attention. Working from a screenplay by producer Barry Sandler Russell injects the film with plenty of humour just the idea of Perkins carrying erotic paraphernalia around with him is a hoot. There's a vibrator in particular that will prove to be a very important prop later on. It may require a bit of patience on the part of some viewers due to its unhurried nature and of course some may find the subject matter a turn off. Those who don't will be amused by the sordid story and all of the trappings of the milieu. In the end this isn't something that can be easily forgotten. Seven out of 10.".

It's yet more sexual lunacy from the most sexobsessed director of the last three decades not counting Russ Meyer. Russell presents a bizarre combination between wacky sexualsituation comedy family drama and psychothriller. The movie goes in all sorts of directions and seems to be about a lot of things  with sex what else? being the unifying theme in all the issues. There is both intentional and unintentional humour though with Russell you can't always tell which is which but most of the film is a sort of eccentric drama.The characters of Turner and Perkins are absurd and overthetop respectively Turner is a career woman who works as a prostitute during the night while Perkins is a deranged wannabe minister with mania written all over his face. At the beginning Perkins so overdoes his part as is typical of this incompetent overactor that you can't help but laugh. Turner though playing a farfetched character is quite convincing and very charismatic as usual. Turner's character is the writer's idea of what a woman who has been emotionally hurt by a failed relationshit might do to deal with her disappointment in malekind i.e. mankind she turns to fulfilling male fantasies as a prostitute. That'll happen... The idea that Turner  who has sex all the time with various men  would suddenly get emotionally aroused with a customer Laughlin just because he feels for her or whatever is preposterous though not annoying. In fact nothing seems to be annoying in the film in spite of it being Russell's.Well almost Russell took one or two themes from Dvorak's New World Symphony and milked them for all they're worth. These melodies are played over and over and over in varying styles. Strange because this music doesn't in any way suit this film. Some dialog sounds unnatural some is sillycomical and loaded with sexual wordplay and some is right out of a TV soapopera.Perhaps the funniest moment was when Turner while rummaging through Perkins's bag finds a powerfullooking metal dildo and asks him whether it's a cruisemissile.".

Meanwhile a street preacher Anthony Perkins works the red light district trying to save souls.Allegedly the male lead passed over Patrick Swayze and Jeff Bridges before landing on John Laughlin. Not that Laughlin does a bad job but in retrospect this seems like an odd choice  the movie would have had a more lasting impact with one of the other two.Although Kathleen Turner takes up most of the screen time and really puts herself out there in these sexual situations Perkins is the highlight of the film. He never shies away from pushing his own emotions saying and acting in the most manic of manners. For an actor who made his name working with Hitchcock he was never afraid to push the envelope in his career. Allegedly the poppers we see him using on screen were real and he was indeed pumped up for much of the shoot.One aspect of the film that Ken Russell ought to be praised for is how strongly he suggests certain things but never shows them. For a film about American sexuality there is surprisingly little nudity. Instead he uses Japanese art to double for this and presents an endless stream of suggestive  but rarely explicit  scenes. This is brilliant and keeps the movie from becoming smut despite its themes. Likewise the violence is almost all psychological  even a murder scene somewhat humorously uses a doll to avoid showing direct human physical interaction. Russell and cinematographer Dick Bush do an excellent job of projecting character on to the actors through lighting. We have garish colors and neon lights for the scenes with China Blue while the other scenes were more naturalistic light. There are clearly two worlds at play and Kathleen Turner seamlessly goes from one to the other.On top of a beautiful 2K restoration and the ability to watch either the cut or uncut version the Arrow Video bluray comes packed with features. We have audio commentary with director Ken Russell and producerscreenwriter Barry Sandler seven deletedextended scenes with optional commentary by Sandler a brandnew interview with Sandler and a brandnew interview with composer Rick Wakeman.

Throw in the talents of Kathleen Turner Anthony Perkins John Laughlin and Annie Potts and you have a winner.A fashion designer by day and a prostitute by night Joanna Crane who goes by the name of China Blue when she is turning tricks is suspected of stealing designs is being followed by an unhappily married Bobby Grady.China Blue aka Joanna is also being stalked by a street preacher the Reverend Peter Shayne who develops an unhealthy obsession with being able to 'save' her.As a relationship starts to bud between Bobby and Joanna Peter Shayne becomes more and more frenzied in his attempts to convert Joanna.Crimes Of Passion is a striking movie. The music which is perfect adds to the sexually charged atmosphere as does the setting and lighting.A thriller that does not fear to cross any boundary and is still able to include genuinely touching scenes such as one where China Blue is hired to have sex with a man who is terminally ill.The scenes between Bobby and his wife Amy are also tinged with sadness as you can see how very unhappy they both are together.Despite the fine performances from the cast this is definitely Anthony Perkin's movie. His portrayal of Peter Shayne is both comical and terrifying as the menacing and deranged preacher who is desperate to find salvation in saving China Blue no matter what the cost.Kathleen Turner also puts in a great performance as the tormented woman who leads two lives. My only gripe with Crimes Of Passion is that Joanna's backstory was never really explored. But that would be a gripping film within itself.Ken Russell's film really explores the darker side of sexual attraction and obsession.It does end on a lighter note though which gives the film a more optimistic feel that gives the film a bit of a lift.Crimes Of Passion is not for everyone some of the scenes are explicit but it is worth checking out.".

As it is Kathleen Turner gives the bravest boldest and most bravura performance as the part time prostitute with a passion for the unusual and Anthony Perkins gives surely the scariest performance of his career. And yes David Lynch or Dennis Hopper must have had a little look at this before making Blue Velvet. Ken Russell clearly had fun here and creates the most splendid neon drenched streets sleazy character aplenty whilst encouraging Turner to give her all and Perkins to just let rip. Exciting disturbing silly sexy and serious by turns this is an extraordinary film that despite my mention of the Lynch film truly stands alone even in comparison to the craziest creations in the wonderful world of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all if you are going to watch this movie you'd better get the uncut version. Crimes of Passion is pure 80's entertainment thanks to Anthony Perkins mainly who was given some of the most hilarious bad lines ever. Characters are so overthetop and absurd dialogue is so unnatural and badfunny the acting is exaggerated and sometimes awful intentionally maybe? the music is so out of place that the whole thing is a Camp Masterpiece. Anthony Perkins seems to be spoofing his own classic demented persona even the ending looks like some sort of Psycho parody. The preacher's maniacal performance sniffing drugs in sleazy sex booths reminded me of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. This is funny stuff and it looks like a De Palma film. The sexual content is surprising for a mainstream movie with famous actors and it only adds to the quirkiness. The point seems to be going everywhere and the plot crazy and unlikely as it is is all over the place the movie can't decide whether it's a satire thriller comedy love story or marital drama the common element being sexuality and what it represents for different individuals. For the housewife sex is something dirty and unpleasant a conjugal duty for the husband it's the best way to express love and respect for China Blue it's a means to avoid emotional attachment for the preacher it's a destructive impulse a source of guilt and selfhatred. Despite some hardcore scenes the movies remains lighthearted and it's very entertaining.".

'Fridericus' was made barely a year after 'Der Alte und der Junge Knig' another biography of Friedrich. The best and most elaborate of these biopics is 'Der Grosse Konig' made in 1942. 'Fridericus' stars Otto Gebuhr in the title role the same actor who portrayed Friedrich in 'Der Grosse Konig' The Great King.'Fridericus' is a less effective film than 'The Great King' basically a remake but a comparison of the two films is interesting. 'Fridericus' was made in 1936 when Hitler was firmly in power but the Second World War had not started yet. 'The Great King' was made in 1942 when Hitler's biggest victories were past and it was likely that the Third Reich would lose the war. This explains why 'The Great King' places greater emphasis on Friedrich's military struggle against superior forces and overwhelming odds.There's nothing in 'Fridericus' that isn't done better in 'The Great King' including Otto Gebuhr's performance in the title role. The best thing in 'Fridericus' is a brief performance by beautiful darkeyed Lil Dagover as Madame Pompadour. I'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I rented this after reading the pitiful typically oversensualized box I hoped only that it might struggle above tepid mediocrity in some way. In fact I saw it and despised Leslie Cheung's petty Songlian and his sister Caifei He for the first hour.Yet then I began to realize how intricately woven the characters and plot were as visual symbols began reappearing and the movie began to happily shirk off introductory pretenses and reveal the forces behind the characters and their actions.  Songlian's pettiness began to reveal itself as an intense and justifiable selfhatred and that of his sister as terrible hopelessness.  Meanwhile the others in the movie undergo powerful transformations as well as we see how people struggle to bring their own beliefs to bear beneath the tidal wave of external circumstances.  We see how they fail and how their failure propogates their weaknesses undermining others.Overall we see the power of the subversive as it plays on the human mind and heart.  We see beliefs destroyed at several levels we see new beliefs emerge less pure and more calculating.  We see regret unfold in each of the characters or worse cold numbness to it from enduring too much.And there is nothing to regret about the movie except that the subterranean depths of the content make recommendation difficult this is not a movie for most grandmothers even though it is still delicate in how it examines its touchier subject matter.  Still it is beautiful in everything it does. The sights the characters the transformations even the twistiness.  We rever the characters and their changes for good or worse because we understand them irrevokably.  The movie is highly rich and interwoven. Elements interplay even down to recurring symbols and by the end we realize that the entire movie is really symbolized in the first ten minutes even though there is no way we could realize that from the beginning even if told so.  Those ten minutes where we see the beautiful Pang estate and the children and life so revoltingly innocent at first glance. That is purposeful.  What we take for inconsequential initially is proved to be far from it and really that contrapuntal layering of pretended motive and deeper meaning continues throughout.Every minute in this movie counts.  Every side glance reflects meaning. The Piano was supposed to be subversive sensual touching and powerful showcasing how the heart must contend with external harshness.  However it is clumsy ugly blatant and ineffectual in comparison to Temptress Moon which tells so much more with so much less and it breaks our heart unspeakably but is above the painful selfish bitterness or wallowing found in Farewell My Concubine Raise the Red Lantern and Indochine which really tell stories half as complex maybe not Indochine.  The characters in Temptress Moon are noble despite and because of their outer twistedness and rent hearts.A sumptuous earring a swinging lamp fresh roses Songlian's longings for Peking and twisting opium smoke and speeches on its merits and cruelties all these symbols snake by at first yet come to how powerful meaning in the end and they strike us at many levels in the movie each time richer with understanding.  I left far surprised and impressed.  Finally a movie great enough to express itself in humility of pretenses.  If only they'd ditch the stupid and coarsely sensual box.".

Ruyi who is first seen as a young girl playing with her cousin Duanwu likes him until Zhongliang falls out of favor and flees to Shanghai.Zhongliang's life in Shanghai goes through a transformation as he becomes part of a gang that extort money from wealthy women who fall in love with members of the gang who then proceed to extort money from them to keep things quiet.When the old man of the Pang family dies Pang An is too far gone into his opium to rule. In a surprise movement Ruyi is made head of the family and she has Duangwu serve as her adviser. The boss of the gang in Shanghai learning about it decides to send Zhongliang to lure Ruyi to their turf. Fate intervenes as Zhongliang falls madly in love with the ravishing Ruyi who in turn will discover what the young man was really after and who is instrumental for Ruyi's fall at the end.The film relies on the visual aspects Chen Kaige has brought to the story. This is one of the most daring Chinese films as far as the sexual context that is seen on the screen. Never before has the Chinese cinema shown scenes that burn the screen as when Zhongliang and Ruyi make love.Chen Kaige is a director with a style of his own. He cowrote the screen play in which this film is based. The action takes place during the first part of the 20th Century in China before the period that changed that country into what it is today.The best asset in the film is the way Chen Kaige sets his story in motion. He surrounds his tale with some of the most dazzling sets in recent memory and the reconstruction of the night life and the criminal around Shanghai in that period is effectively captured in the excellent cinematography by Christopher Doyle. The atmospheric music heard in the background is by Jiping Zhao.The gorgeous Gong Li plays the adult Ruyi and the late Leslie Cheung is Zhonliang. Kevin Liu is seen as Duanwu and Caifei He is Xiuye. The supporting cast add a note of authenticity to the film.This is one of Chen Kaige best achievements as a director.".

	schema:headline " Sensual film about a love triangle and social change in early 20th century China.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a fabulous movie instantly making it onto my list of favorites. There was so much going on between the three main characters along with the background of China emerging as a modern nation.  The tragic ending brought real tears to my eyes.The story revolves around the household of the Pang family a very wealthy and traditional clan that lives in the countryside and has remained untouched by the rise of modern society in Shanghai during the 1920's.  SPOILERS Yu Xiuyi is married to the son of the clan elder Pang An a cruel opium addict.  One day she sends for her much younger brother Yu Zhongliang Leslie Cheung to come live on the Pang estate and tend to her husband's opium needs while he completes his studies.  His playmates become his sisterinlaw Pang Ruyi Li Gong and her cousin Pang Duanwu Kevin Lin. Zhongliang is turned into a servant and humiliated by his master and his sister.  He leaves for Shanghai and hooks up with a crime family there.  He seduces married women and the gang extorts money from their husbands.  He's a playboy without a heart.Back at the Pang estate An suffers some sort of brain damage from his opium use so when the elder dies his younger sister Ruyi is chosen to rule the clan.  She chooses her cousin Duanwu to act as her counselor much to the chagrin of the clan elders who see both of them as inexperienced and not traditional enough.Zhongliang's boss sends him back to the Pang estate to seduce Ruyi so that they can extort money from the clan but when he returns he soon falls in love with her.  Complicating matters Duanwu the ever loyal cousin also is in love with Ruyi.Zhongliang is torn between loyalty to his crime boss who has become a father figure to him and his newfound emotions toward Ruyi.  Ruyi had despaired of never finding a suitable husband  the marriage arranged for her years ago had been broken when the family found out she was an opium addict like her older brother.  The love she and Zhongliang find for each other is liberating for each.Zhongliang begins to feel guilty  members of his gang are pressuring him to set up the extortion.  He came back to the Pang estate to exact revenge for what An and his sister did to him years ago but he's in love with Ruyi and can't go through with his plan.  So he leaves and returns to Shanghai where his understanding boss lets him off the hook sort of.He is ordered to go through with the extortion of a married women he's been having an affair with a woman he really loves.  The gang boss sends for Ruyi so that she can witness Zhongliang's seduction and betrayal of this woman hoping this will ruin the love between the two and return Zhongliang to his former cynical self.  But the woman kills herself in despair and Zhongliang is destroyed by his guilt.Ruyi returns to the country and is met at her estate by the man whose family spurned their betrothal years ago.  He is now a modern selfsufficient businessman in Shanghai and after the two get along well they both decide to get married  he's transitioned to modern life and doesn't care anymore what his family thinks of Ruyi.But Zhongliang returns.  Ruyi had thrown herself at him in Shanghai despite finding out what he was really like and he had been afraid to tell her how he felt but now he wants to reclaim her.  Ruyi tells him she no longer loves him.Zhongliang's sister jealous and bitter about her isolation and reduction to second class status within the clan nags him into putting arsenic into Ruyi's opium something he did years ago to An as part of his revenge.  Too late he regrets his actions and tries to stop her from smoking the poison. She's rendered a vegetable just like her older brother was.As Zhongliang's about to return to Shanghai in deep sorrow Duanwu guns him down on the pier.  And Duanwu no longer meek and subservient but cruel and decisive now becomes the head of the clan while Ruyi is carried comatose into the ancestral hall to witness the ceremony.The story is terrific and the acting superb.  I've seen several of Li Gong's films and this is her best part of all.  She portrays innocence and betrayal with great beauty and skill.  Leslie Cheung is also terrific in the role of Zhongliang really the main figure in the film.  His character has such depth and complexity and the actor does a great job of letting the viewer see the pathos within him as he's torn between revenge and love.The cinematography is spectacular.  The scenes in the countryside surrounding events in the Pang estate are filmed with a fuzzy aura to them almost putting events into a dreamlike state.  Shanghai on the other hand is shot cleanly with defined edges.  Christopher Doyle an Australian also did the cinematography on several other Chinese films as well as recent entries like RabbitProof Fence and The Quiet American another film with stunning visuals.For English speaking cinema fans don't let the subtitles intimidate you. This is a great film a beautiful film about a tragic love story and one you really should see.".

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to purchase Temptress Moon after viewing the breathtaking and devastating Farewell My Concubine. Both movies feature the amazing talents of Gong Li and Leslie Cheung. So total is their transformation between the two films it's difficult to believe that these are the same actors. While Concubine served as a historical epic Temptress Moon seemed more along the lines of Shakespearean tragedy. Like Kaige's previous work the characters' frustrations signify larger themes domestic turmoil gender repression class conflict etc. Although these themes concern the private sphere of life and are not as overtly political as those addressed in Concubine they are just as much about power its abuse and the resulting disfigurement of the human spirit.Temptress Moon is by no means a romance. The movie succeeds in being lyrical and melancholy  more engrossing than entertaining. Despite the requisite tragic ending I found the plot to be oddly satisfying! The waxing and waning fates of Zhongliang Ruyi and Duanwu intertwined to create a luminous study of the heart and its insatiable hunger.Overall Temptress Moon was a clear reflection of the obsessions that ruthlessly dictate interpersonal affairs. Leslie Cheung Gong Li and Kevin Lin give mesmerizing performances while supporting portrayals like that of Caifei He as Zhongliang's sister and Yin Tse as Zhongliang's Boss are equally flawless. Among the movie's many moral messages Don't Do Drugs! ".

Like Kaige's previous work the characters' frustrations signify larger themes domestic turmoil gender repression class conflict etc. Although these themes concern the private sphere of life and are not as overtly political as those addressed in Concubine they are just as much about power its abuse and the resulting disfigurement of the human spirit.Temptress Moon is by no means a romance. The movie succeeds in being lyrical and melancholy  more engrossing than entertaining. Despite the requisite tragic ending I found the plot to be oddly satisfying! The waxing and waning fates of Zhongliang Ruyi and Duanwu intertwined to create a luminous study of the heart and its insatiable hunger.Overall Temptress Moon was a clear reflection of the obsessions that ruthlessly dictate interpersonal affairs. Leslie Cheung Gong Li and Kevin Lin give mesmerizing performances while supporting portrayals like that of Caifei He as Zhongliang's sister and Yin Tse as Zhongliang's Boss are equally flawless. Among the movie's many moral messages Don't Do Drugs! ";

But I did not find it to be as sensual as its billing had led me to believe. I expected a more erotic sensual overtone to some of the story andor the scenes. But instead it was a tale laced with opium betrayal and desperation in a world that was changing from the old ways of ancient China to the newer ways of the West. I can see why it would have caused such controversy in China in the first place as the box proclaims. But I think that words like Sensuous Steamy and  Ravishing were overused. It was a good story not for the tame of heart or mind. There are many quiet parts of the movie where there is little action and few words. It works well if you have the mindset to pay attention patiently. I think that a film like this will appeal to select audiences and I would be a little weary to recommend it to everyone. I think some people will like this film others absolutely love it while others yet may be bored with the slowmoving action and dark dialogues.".

This is a tale of tragic romance where the male character is an emotional wreck due to him being a slave for his sister and her husband who also forces him to have a little experience with incest and the female character is living her day in an opium cloud. The acting from the main actors is top notch namely Leslie Cheung and Li Gong who always seem to deliver in every movie I have seen them in Li Gong struggles a bit in her English speaking roles and it does take something away from her performance in those movies I must admit. Li Gong usually plays an intelligent character but here she is an opium addict so it is definitely different seeing her looking all confused and dumbfounded all the time. The cinematography was spectacular as it usually is when Christopher Doyle is in charge. The lighting and camera angles reminded me a little of David Lynch and I believe it was done this way in order for you to see the world like you had smoked opium just like the characters. You should see the movie for the acting cinematography and camera work alone.The main critique of the movie seems to be that it is very hard to follow the plot and figure out who is who. I agree with this. It gets established 40 min or so into the movie but you could be tempted to turn off the movie before that because it is so confusing. But once it gets established who is who and what they want the plot becomes a lot better and I became very involved in the movie.".

And all those courtiers and palace hangerson doing those balancing acts to try and stay in the royal favor. Don't say the wrong word or else! Frightfully amusing. I did gain a little respect for the guy at the end when he decided to sword fight it out with 'eroe' Gordon Scott instead of putting on the expected abject coward act. He died true to his convictions however nuts.".

The subtitled version I saw under the title of Hero of Babylon is much better than the Beast of Babylon with English dubbing. For what ever reason it plays less silly. The plot is the typical muscle bound hero fights and wins the freedom of an oppressed people but its done with just enough conviction of the leads that you do care what happens. The film is a really good action film for most of its run falling into a bit of silliness as the tries to tie up all the plot threads.".

	schema:reviewBody "Say what you want about the genre of sword and sandal films. Without any historical credibility whatsoever or any similarities with the historicalmythical characters that give the heroes their names some muscle men mostly American bodybuilders fight for freedom and glory somewhere in the ancient world. This time around it's Gordon Scott as prince Nippur name taken from an ancient Summerian city located in modern day Iraq returning from exile after calls from the oppressed people of Babylon tormented by their usurper with slavery and human sacrifices. In the tradition of Samson and Hercules prince Nippur has superhuman strength hence overpowering the evil forces to bring freedom and justice back to the empire. Sounds a bit like Anakin SkywalkersDarth Vaders monologue before the climatic battle at the end of Star Wars Episode 3 though the story is a little too interlaced for film of that length. I like this cheesy flicks on a lazy Saturday morning like today especially as I' down with a cold the downside of this movie is that there are way too many characters both good and eviltoo long scenes of sacrifices and random violence against the slaved populace  I mean we get it the bad guy is REALLY bad  and stereotypical scenes where the trapped or chained hero overcomes all odds in a heroic display of his power to jump in for the rescue at the end. It is entertaining no doubts there but with a dozen women wearing same or similar wigs all guys wearing fake beards and armor it's kinda hard to follow the story in detail. You leave for 5 minutes and you don't know what happened cause all throughout the flick new characters are introduced  or killed. The story itself is very interchangeable so if you'd put in Hercules and a Greek polis where this stuff had happened it would have worked just as well. For situations like mine atm where I can't do anything else anyways this film is good would have been perfect if the storyline was more simple but other than that it has most things that makes a cheesy sword and sandal flick so entertaining. Silly costumes bad acting bad fake beards bad wigs random backdrops from obviously various other productions and lots of scenes where a muscle man can show his biceps. 4 or 10 points however quite entertaining.".

Then there is the neighborhood dog who likes to dig up Roger's saplings....Overall I find this to be a fairly underrated little horror movie. It's definitely one of Steve Miner's more innovative attempts and the music reminiscent of the F13 music and performed by the same man Harry Manfredini is thoroughly haunting. Also most importantly the acting is believable. Major points for that. None of this movie is hokey. It could have been...but it wasn't. 710 is my vote.".

Not just the evil ghosts within his house and beyond but his own personal demons. I love that scene where his ex wife turns into that fat monster thing and he blows her away and....well i don't want to spoil it for anybody but it's awesome. The eighties was by far the best for movies especially horror and scifi. We won't see movies like this ever again.

The story and the script are both great thanks to Fred Dekker The Monster Squad and Ethan Wiley House II.  Steve Miner succeeds in creating the atmosphere of an old house and in finding a likable cast as well.  The cast includes William Katt Carrie as the unlucky lead Roger Cobb George Wendt Normie from Cheers and Richard Moll Bull from Night Court.  My favorite cast member is probably the house itself.  It's perfect I think they made it just for this movie.  The effects and makeup are great for the eighties.  Skeleton Big Ben is awesome.  One standout scene is Roger and the minidemons playing tugawar with the little boy Robert Miner's own kid.  The score by Manfredini is highly similar to that of Friday the 13th but I love still love it.  House is a well put together underrated horror movie.  If you're going to buy a house this year make it this one.".

Among these were the House movies which are a lot better than the genre reputation suggests.First and foremost this is not strictly a horror film. There are some sprinklings of light comedy here and there and the monsters are so ridiculous that they don't really scare. It sure makes for a welcome change in a decade full of blood knifings and slayings.Roger Cobb William Katt is a horror novelist suffering from writers block. He can't seem to continue with his latest book a recollection of his tour in 'Nam. The fans are eager but they want horror not some war story. On top of all this he is also dealing with a divorce and coping with the mysterious disappearance of his son. Depressed he moves to his aunt's house from where his son vanished and in which the old lady hung herself. A creepy log cabin in the mountains might be more appropriate as Roger finds just as many distractions here.The first distraction is his neighbour Harold George Wendt who shows up at the worst moments to hassle Roger in the Ned Flanders style. The second distraction is a little more sinister. Monsters burst out of the closet at midnight doors in the house lead into different dimensions and he is haunted by the memories of his best friend Richard Moll whom he betrayed back in 'Nam. Third there is a sexy blonde who bathes in his pool.One of the most appealing things about House is that Roger doesn't respond with any clichd horror movie tactic  running away falling flat on his face hiding under the sink etc. Instead he buys a camcorder and tries to capture the monsters on film to convince Harold and himself that he is not crazy.He even manages to persuade Harold to help him catch a big raccoon which hides out in a certain closet and only shows itself at midnight. Even at this Harold gets scared but not us. The film is only slightly dark and keeps a jovial mood for an hour and a half.Steve Miner Halloween H20 Lake Placid intrigues us as much as Roger as to what the hell is going on. Ethan Wiley's script is the tiniest bit loose but is smarter than you would think and even contains a few little touches that you might miss on the first couple of viewings.It could have been beefier and longer but if it was it wouldn't be as irresistibly charming.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always enjoyed this horrorcomedy when I was a kid and upon viewing it again I still enjoy it. The film just clicks for me and there is a lot going on in this one. I watched two other horror films recently and more happened in this film than happened in those two films combined. Not saying they were bad as one was a horror film from the 70's and there are a lot them that are slow burn and rely on a last disturbing scene to make the film. The other one was kind of bad as it was a monster film that did not feature the monsters much as all. This one shows us monsters has flying tools that want to chop you up and has a Vietnam vet returning from the grave! It also stars a lot of actors that were more known for their roles in television rather than film as it has William Katt known for The Greatest American Hero George Wendt from Cheers and Richard Moll from Night Court. The comedy is pretty good but they still keep quite a bit of horror in this one too. The second film in the series would rely a bit more on comedy and action rather than horror.The story has a man named Roger Cobb who is a writer. He has been having trouble writing since his son turned up missing one day. His aunt kills herself in the home where the boy seemingly disappeared in the pool and Roger soon moves into the old house. He meets his neighbor who is a fan of Roger's and everything proceeds normally enough...for a couple of minutes anyway! Soon Roger is being assailed by hellish creatures in the closet of his aunt's room being attacked by the tools in his shed sees his exwife turn into a grotesque monster and has to deal with many other things in the house full of craziness. All through the movie he also tries to write his latest novel which is a true story about his time in Vietnam. He also has to babysit a kid he doesn't even know and he and Harold the neighbor try to fight off the 'racoon' in the closet.This film would spawn a sequel that would feature John Ratzenberger in a small role so this one featured Norm and then the next Cliff. There is no true part three to the series as they named a completely unrelated film named The Horror Show the title House III for its non U.S.A release but here instead of naming the next actual House film part III they went straight to IV. That film would not be a success but if you have seen it you can easily see why as it has none of the charm of this film or second film and was just horrifically bad! This was the best of the House films I have seen. Never saw the not really a House film Horror Show but considering it was not really meant to be a House film I guess it really does not count. Though I am interested in seeing it if they ever release the full version of it. Apparently its initial cut was so gruesome it garnered an X rating! This one could almost be PG13 as there really is not too much gore in it no nudity and minimal cussing. Still it was a very fun horror film to watch. I loved the whole strangeness of the House as there are monsters in it and strange portals to strange dark realms!".

	schema:reviewBody "House which seems to have gained somewhat of a cult following is a movie I hadn't really heard about much but after reading some good things about it I decided to give it a try. The film opens pretty well  a grocery boy delivering some groceries to an elderly woman in a Victorian house discovers her hanging in her bedroom. Now her nephew Roger Cobb a famous novelist has inherited the old mansion and decides to go stay there for a while to work on his Vietnamexperiences novel after recently suffering through a divorce and the loss of his son who has gone missing. But while staying at the house he is bothered by an odd and rather nosy neighbor who also claims to be his number one fan and begins seeing strange creatures emerging from his aunt's upstairs closet and soon discovers that there is a whole other dimension behind the walls of the house.Not really a bad film at all but also not a really good one House is a unique mixture of horror and comedy but is more humorous than anything else. William Katt who played Tommy Ross in the De Palma classic Carrie plays Roger Cobb in this film and doesn't give a bad performance on any terms. The entire cast really isn't bad either. The story was interesting at some moments but I was a little disappointed there. While this film is distinctly more comic than horrific I was expecting something that was leaning on a more gruesome side. In a sense this film can be seen as very fun but in my mindset I was expecting something different. There are a few creepy moments and the beginning scene was done pretty well with the surprise body that swings on screen. The special effects were kind of campy and the creatures were really funny looking I laughed quite a bit when the woman turned into the sluglooking creature. Not entirely convincing but I wasn't expecting marvelous effects I mean this is an '80s horror film. I'm not really sure about this movie it's hard for me to decide whether I lean towards liking it or not liking it and that's a rarity for me  I usually really like a film or I just don't.Overall House is an unconventional and interesting movie. It leans toward comedy most of the time but mixes in some horror and I'm just not sure the combination worked quite right. I laughed on quite a few occasions but was rarely remotely spooked. I don't know maybe I should have sat down and watched it and expected more humor. Not a bad movie though and recommended for those who enjoy late '80s horror flicks like this and who don't mind their horror with some laughs. I'm on the fence with this so I'll give it half and half. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "A true product of the 80s but does that mean its anything less or far more I don't know but I had trouble not getting caught up in its irresistibly offkilter charm and patchwork ideas. I truly have a soft spot for it. Yeah it's a mess a clueless and incoherent one. However it's goofy nature vivid visual effects and willing performances lend very well to a competent looking production yeah so what if those Vietnam flashbacks looked hokey and it's origins are cheap. This was the third film under the belt of director Steve Miner who a couple years earlier brought us the raw opening sequels 'Friday the 13th' Part 2 and 3'.Miner is joined by producer Sean S. Cunningham the man behind the original 'Friday the 13th'. This time it's far from chilling but it doesn't feel like its trying either well there are moments lightly done though as the angle is focused on the comedy even if it doesn't have you constantly laughing out loud. It remains amusing nonetheless while managing to be unpredictable in a way. We've flooded with ideas artistic lashings and loose writing. William Katt makes for a likable victim to his worrying state of thinking his going crazy due to the traumatic stress war experience missing child and marriage failure or maybe it's the house and its dark devious secrets preying upon his fragile mind.Roger Cobb is a Vietnam VET horror novelist that has tragedy on mind after the strange disappearance of his son Jimmy when visiting his aunt's house. His obsessive quest on finding him takes on a huge toll on his marriage as his wife leaves him and now he wants to write a book about his Vietnam experience despite the growing success of his horror novels. After the death of his aunt he heads back to the house and decides this is where he would write his new book. However he finds out there's more to this house and maybe a chance to find his son again.Sounds like the typical haunted house shenanigans Well to a point. There are monsters creative animation rubber makeup and the zombie soldier design looks awesome stemming from portals to other universes through closet doors and bathroom mirrors. In the end I guess there just wasn't enough of it compared to its boundless sequel 'House II The Second Story'. The psychological aspect yes it tries is muddled and never truly explored because it lets the daftness and convoluted tone take control of anything of importance through its Vietnam slant. Miner keeps a steady pace drawing some minor moments of suspense and unhinged weirdness. The direction can feel a little too staged and planned out in its setpieces due to its change in shifts. Although the execution comes off better than it probably should have and is fairly presentable as just look Mac Ahlberg's polished cinematography as the camera seamlessly glides through the setpieces and Harry Manfredini's score is elastically piercing in its perky arrangement.Like I mentioned up further Katt brings along an honest and capable performance. Around him is a downtoearth turn by George Wendt. Who is good fun as Cobb's interfering neighbour. The stunning Kay Lenz doesn't get a lot to do but her warm presence doesn't look out of place and Richard Moll is imposing as Cobb's Nam buddy. The beauty of Mary Stavin engulfs the few scenes she's in. Another asset you could say and just as part of the film's character is the house itself. A formidable setting but it didn't entirely have the lasting impact like I would've hoped and that's why the atmosphere quite patchy across the board didn't always have the same effect.Loony spontaneous comedyhorror that doesn't entirely hit the mark but does plenty to tweak ones interest.".

Miner keeps a steady pace drawing some minor moments of suspense and unhinged weirdness. The direction can feel a little too staged and planned out in its setpieces due to its change in shifts. Although the execution comes off better than it probably should have and is fairly presentable as just look Mac Ahlberg's polished cinematography as the camera seamlessly glides through the setpieces and Harry Manfredini's score is elastically piercing in its perky arrangement.Like I mentioned up further Katt brings along an honest and capable performance. Around him is a downtoearth turn by George Wendt. Who is good fun as Cobb's interfering neighbour. The stunning Kay Lenz doesn't get a lot to do but her warm presence doesn't look out of place and Richard Moll is imposing as Cobb's Nam buddy. The beauty of Mary Stavin engulfs the few scenes she's in. Another asset you could say and just as part of the film's character is the house itself. A formidable setting but it didn't entirely have the lasting impact like I would've hoped and that's why the atmosphere quite patchy across the board didn't always have the same effect.Loony spontaneous comedyhorror that doesn't entirely hit the mark but does plenty to tweak ones interest.";

Roger Cobb is quite the interesting herothe way he deals with the demons in his house is very odd but hey it's nice to see someone fight back in a horror movie for once. The middle of the movie is just crazy but fun and the last third is very very good. The eerie scene where he is descending by a rope into what is apparently Hell itself is a classic horror movie scene in my opinion. And the climactic ending with the zombie commando is too awesome for words.This isn't a true Horror movie by any means but rather silly 80s cheesebut in that sense it is the best of its kind. 810 stars.".

He moves to his aunt's house to write a book about his experiences as a soldier in Vietnam. The trouble is that his aunt killed herself there in strange circumstances and before long Cobb starts to experience malevolent paranormal activity in the house. House was produced by Sean S. Cunningham the man who directed the hugely influential slasher Friday the 13th 1980 and produced the notorious raperevenge exploitation shocker Last House on the Left 1972. It would be fair to say that with House he was involving himself with something decidedly less controversial. This is in actual fact a horrorcomedy which is not so far off being familyfriendly. While it does admittedly have its share of horror moments such as demonic creatures and some suspenseful events it certainly plays its comedy hand with more certainty. The result is a very likable film.This is a film which is not so well remembered now but it was a sizable hit at the time it was released from what I can recall after all it did manage to spawn three sequels. It benefits quite a bit from very good performances from William Katt as Cobb and George Wendt as his friendly neighbour. Both have good comic timing and work well together while Katt has to be given extra credit for still being capable of acting while wearing the most 80's Vneck sweater I have ever seen. Aside from the two leads there is also a lot of really good 80's effects and makeup for the various demons who plague the house including a monster in the closet which I daresay haunted many a little kid who happened across this flick back in the day. It was also an interesting idea to combine the 80's movie staple of the Vietnam War in with a haunted house scenario. These strange bedfellows are amalgamated pretty successfully I thought though giving the movie a distinctive angle. Ultimately House is a fun movie without ever being an essential one. It does display a certain craft and care though and even if it is a bit limited in some ways it's a film which is difficult to dislike and one which offers a fun 90 minutes for genre fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Six years after producerdirector Sean S. Cunningham released the wildly popular but highly overrated Friday the 13th in 1980 and several years after director Steve Miner helmed the film's two sequels the pair reunited for the 1986 horrorcomedy House. Still another hugely profitable outing for the team House is a more familyfriendly affair blending some effective jolts rubberylooking monsters and a great deal of silliness into a tasty but middling stew. In the film we meet a Viet Nam vetnow a bestselling authornamed Roger Cobb appealingly and effectively played by William Katt. Cobb is going through a decidedly rough patch in his life when we first encounter him. His wife Kay Lenz has just divorced him after the mysterious disappearance of their young son he's having trouble with the writing of his promised war memoirs and his Aunt Elizabeth has recently hung herself. Roger moves into his aunt's supposedly haunted house to get a little solitude to further his writing...too bad however that all those yuckylooking demons in the house will just NOT leave him alone....Anyway though certainly enjoyable House proved to be just a little too tongue in cheek for this viewer. This is a film for the Goonies and Gremlins set and certainly not for the serious horror buff. A little less comedy and a few more scares would have rendered this film a LOT more effective. As it is those comedic elements are practically assured by the inclusion of George Wendt riding high at the time playing everyone's favorite beefy barfly Norm Peterson on TV's Cheers as Roger's Gladys Kravitzlike nosy neighbor essentially he IS Norm Peterson here and by the casting of Richard Moll who was enjoying a similar great success at the time playing the childlike Bull on TV's Night Court as a soldier buddy of Roger's and whose character is seen largely in flashback. The film piles on additional bits of silliness such as the jarring misusage of the great songs You're No Good and Dedicated to the One I Love sadly NOT the Linda Ronstadt and Mamas and the Papas versions as well as an extended babysitting sequence. The picture's script never sufficiently explains away all the spectral mishegas and many instances of illogic and plot holes remain even after the big revelation toward the film's end. House gets by on the charm of its leading man its barely effective FX and on the energy that Miner brings to his project. The film brought to mind two other movies for this viewer 2011's Insidious which also features a father entering a demonhaunted other dimension to search for his young son and of all pictures! 1958's Monster on the Campus which I'd just seen the day before and which also shows us a man cutting his finger on a fish's tooth! I should add that it was nice seeing the beautiful Bond girl Mary Stavin from Octopussy and A View to a Kill again here playing Roger's superhot neighbor. In all House is an entertaining if secondrate 93 minutes at the movies it is supposedly much better than its two sequels however. My psychotronic guru Rob has called the film minor fare but in light of the director's name perhaps we should instead call it minor Miner fare! It is best watched with a few cold ones on one side and maybe your favorite 8yearold on the other....".

The film brought to mind two other movies for this viewer 2011's Insidious which also features a father entering a demonhaunted other dimension to search for his young son and of all pictures! 1958's Monster on the Campus which I'd just seen the day before and which also shows us a man cutting his finger on a fish's tooth! I should add that it was nice seeing the beautiful Bond girl Mary Stavin from Octopussy and A View to a Kill again here playing Roger's superhot neighbor. In all House is an entertaining if secondrate 93 minutes at the movies it is supposedly much better than its two sequels however. My psychotronic guru Rob has called the film minor fare but in light of the director's name perhaps we should instead call it minor Miner fare! It is best watched with a few cold ones on one side and maybe your favorite 8yearold on the other....";

	schema:reviewBody "I know this movie has somewhat of a cult following but I just couldn't bring myself to rate it any higher than I did. It just wasn't scary enough to be a horror flick or funny enough to be entertaining like Evil Dead II. Although I have a pretty wide latitude as to what I'll sit though I just couldn't bring myself to join the bandwagon.Believe it or not William Katt plays the starring role in this mid 1980s horror flick. The storyline had promise but misses on a few fronts. The old aunt seems to be an early key character but then really falls to the background if not totally out of the storyline. The actress wife also plays too small a role inserted here and there throughout the movie. George Wendt adds the comic relief but again as the nosy neighbor is not used to his potential. Finally is the house haunted or is it just Katt himself?The story is basically about a house which is involved in the disappearance of Katt's son years ago. After Katt's aunt commits suicide he decides to move into her house where he had already spent much of his own childhood. He wants to pursue his passion which is writing about his experience in the Vietnam War. It is this war experience that lives at the heart of Katt's weird experiences at the house. Not soon after moving in he starts to hear and see strange things primarily at the stroke of midnight. Monsters and other objects like shovels are soon attacking him. Katt falls back on his military training to battle the house and its inhabitants. We eventually get a happy ending as he finally prevails in defeating the monsters rescuing his son and it appears reuniting with his divorced spouse.Again I know many previous writers enjoy this flick but it just wasn't up to even the low bar I often set for these type of flicks.".

Directed by Steve Miner I thought House was an entertaining  modest little comedy horror. The script by Ethan Wiley based on a story by Fred Dekker mixes the horror  dark humour quite well it keeps the film moving along at a nice pace although one or two sections dragged a little. Things aren't tied up that well though the haunted house goingson are not explained at all was it just Ben using the house as revenge or is the house really haunted? And what connection does Ben have to the house in the first place? House isn't a sadistic film in terms of violence  gore but there is some here  a few fun looking monsters I especially liked the fat female creature in her pink dress  Big Ben's Richard Moll rotting zombie makeup is reasonably impressive  he makes for a cool bad guy. William Katt makes for a likable hero  George Wendt's nosey neighbour Harold Gorton is very funny even though he isn't in the film that much. None of the other characters are developed that much. Technically the film is OK nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either except the Vietnam flashback sequences that were obviously shot in a cheap looking studio set. The special effects while their a little cheesy  aren't exactly going to impress anyone too much these days are watchable enough. Overall I liked House's fun mix of horror  comedy it's a decent enough way to pass an hour and a half  you could do a lot worse. Definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:headline " Average cheesy haunted house film";
	schema:reviewBody "House is a pretty nice cheesy haunted house story.SPOILERSNovelist Roger Cobb William Katt who has a very dedicated horror fanbase who isn't very receptive about his new planned novel about the Vietnam War. His estranged wife Sandy Kay Lenz takes this as a great sign of progress and from her response he decides to rent his recentlydeceased aunt's mansion to get some fresh inspiration. As he starts to work on it he begins to experience strange and ghosts inside which he explains to his neighbor Burt Gorton George Wendt who think he is going crazy. As the visions and experiences start getting stranger he looks to other avenues to fight the supernatural within the house.The Good News This film came out in the mid80s when it was very fashionable to have an amount of cheese in the film that will have an appeal to others outside the horror general. This film is dripping with it. There is a nice cheesy attitude that the 80s movies captured so greatly and it is a wonderful example of that attitude. Perhaps the most pressing part of that is the figure of Big Ben who gets a couple of the best scares in the film towards the latter parts of the film. He has a really creepy look while also maintaining that distinct campy feel to it. The exterior of the house is pretty creepy and the overall design rivals the best. The design of the creatures is nice for the timebeing and the final creature is the scene stealer undoubtedly. The look is really creepy and features some impressive makeup. The latter half of the film with the majority of the action is pretty entertaining and moves along in a great manner.The Bad News Because the movie exists on its cheesy charms it isn't a movie for everyone. It will be something that will be draw up against it. The tone and appearance is quite normal for the kinds of horror films of the same kind. This includes the majority of the early attempts at scares which are just beyond cheesy that don't even scare the youngest child watching the movie. A floating series of garden implements or a fish that suddenly comes active on a wall are some of the failed gags which should've opened this one a lot better than what it really is. In spite of the unsuccessful gags this one still takes way too long to get going with it's story and the only real action comes in the later parts of the film.The Final Verdict It has it's moments of cheese but then again most films from the a later part of the 80s a lot did. It's not the worst haunted house film but there are better ones out there. Take a look if it feels like you might like it but don't be surprised if it is dangerously cheesy at times.Rated R Violence Graphic Language and children in danger".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know when I first saw this movie. I know I was young ten or eleven maybe. I remember being scared and probably had some trouble turning off the light that night but it never traumatized me. I've picked it up every so often ever since and always enjoyed it. It was one of the first R rated horror movies I saw and now I'm hooked on the genre.This is a great film when introducing children to harder horror. For those ready to move on from ScoobyDoo but not ready for Night of the Living Dead or The Exorcist. It's scary and suspenseful but never terrifying. Tension builds and there are plenty of jump scares but the frights never last for long. Take the closet monster for instance. Tension builds as Roger goes to the door and there's a big scare when it comes out. But afterwards it becomes almost silly. Same with the fish and witch. It's a lot like Evil Dead 2 in that it's never too scary to not be funny and never too funny to not be scary.There's also a good story to go along with it. It follows Roger Cobb who grew up with his aunt in a haunted house. He went to war and saw horrible things. His son disappeared at the haunted house and he's separated from his wife. Obviously all this ties together in some way when the aunt dies and he moves back into the house. None of it ever becomes hokey or clichd. The film allows time to get to know Roger before the haunting begins so we like him and understand his plight. There's also an interesting aspect regarding whether all the hauntings are real or just caused by the stress of his life.George Wendt from Cheers plays the lovable neighbor that Roger befriends and helps. He isn't that much different than Norm but provides lots of humorous moments. The only thing I wish they did better is to make the supermodel neighbor more interesting. She's fine for some TA and the house does something with her which I still can never get whether that was really her or if it was just the witch but she never really serves the story well. It's little more than a cameo just to have a model in the movie.Each of the actors do well in their parts. All are great though Richard Moll hams it up just a little too much in his Vietnam scenes. It features William Katt who genre fans would know as the prom date from Carrie. This film certainly shows some range for him. The film is made by the crew who did Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3 and has the same visual style.The special effects work very well for the story. The ghosts are practical effects using puppets like Star Wars which looks a lot better than stop motion. As I said before they look scary at first but grow silly the more they're seen. The walking hand is equally disturbing and funny.The movie may not be a classic of the genre but it's well worth checking out. It's a descent ghost story with plenty of suspense. As I said before this is a good movie to test children before showing them something like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those used to more terrifying horror should know that this isn't the scariest thing on store shelves. It's a good solid Bmovie that won't really disappoint.Regarding the sequel I say skip it. As light as this movie is House II is much lighter and far campier. In fact it's more like Weekend at Bernie's than Evil Dead. It's more of a fantasywestern than horror and never scary. If you're watching this movie and want more go with the Bruce Campbell trilogy.".

Those used to more terrifying horror should know that this isn't the scariest thing on store shelves. It's a good solid Bmovie that won't really disappoint.Regarding the sequel I say skip it. As light as this movie is House II is much lighter and far campier. In fact it's more like Weekend at Bernie's than Evil Dead. It's more of a fantasywestern than horror and never scary. If you're watching this movie and want more go with the Bruce Campbell trilogy.";

	schema:reviewBody "After an old woman is found hung in her creepy old house her nephew writer Roger Cobb played by William Katt decides to move in for some solitude. But the memories of the house come back to him as this was where he lost his son and his marriage began to fall apart. And what is up with all the demons hiding in the closet? The genesis of the film is somewhat interesting. Screenwriter Ethan Wiley was referred to the creators by Fred Dekker who had developed the original concept. Dekker was too busy developing a Godzilla film for Steve Miner so he passed the idea to Wiley who converted it into more of a comedy. Now the Godzilla film ended up in development hell but the positive outcome is a superior House. Dekker's version would have been darker focused more on PTSD while Wiley's version is what makes it so enduring.Although my favorite film in the House series is part two the entire run was respectable. We have some of the better acting for horror films of the time and an interesting and original plot. The biggest flaw really is the poor makeup effects especially on Big Ben but this may have been partially intentional to reinforce that it is less than serious. The Vietnam theme is also played up a bit too much but that was the kernel of the story so it would be hard to remove.Richard Moll Bull Shannon from Night Court appears as Big Ben a Vietnam soldier captured by the Vietnamese. His role is very important although the acting comes across as flat. I do not know if he is a poor actor or if the script simply did not give him much room to work but the entire Ben subplot is a bit lacking.At the same time we have George Wendt Norm from Cheers as a friendly neighbor who has no problem inviting himself in for some pizza and beer. Wendt is wonderful and really makes this film fun just as he would do twenty years later in John Landis' Family. He also starts the trend of Cheers actors in the House series John Ratzenberger appears in part two.The film is fun and a good pace. Nothing very scary here not even the closet that goes straight to what looks like Cthulhu's basement. But sometimes you do not need scares and scantilyclad women. Sometimes you need a little fun and you will find it here and even more in House II. Watch it. You will like it.Arrow Video has released the definitive House set either two films or more depending on your region. For the first film we not only get an extremely informative audio commentary from Steve Miner Sean Cunningham William Katt and Ethan Wiley but we have a brand new makingof documentary which has all of those names plus George Wendt Fred Dekker Harry Manfredini and more. This is the last word on House.".

Do not be scared off by the low rating. The obvious reason all the Gramfans have to vote it down is because as we all know true fans always take the object of their fandom seriously and this film doesn't take itself seriously.

Let me put it this way if you loved Anchorman you probably won't like this. If you're an uberGramfan you probably will hate this.

	schema:reviewBody "It may be about a stolen corpse but Grand Theft Parsons' is anything but morbid.  It's a charming heartwarming tale in which the central living character's integrity and loyalty goes beyond the grave  or rather beyond the desert bonfire.  The film is loosely based on the true story of countryrock pioneer Gram Parsons and his road manager Phil Kaufman.  When Parsons dies of a drug overdose Kaufman is grimly determined to fulfil his late friend's wish to be cremated in the desert  even if that means stealing his coffin and evading a diverse posse of pursuers in a bright yellow hearse driven by an addled hippy. Some have complained about the liberties taken with the true story of Parsons' incineration in the wilderness by Kaufman  but as the real Kaufman makes a cameo appearance in the film one may assume that he didn't mind. In any case the truthbending is clearly acknowledged in captions at the start of the movie.  There are some truly superb performances.  Johnny Knoxville proves that he can be much more than an annoying prankster with a thoroughly convincing portrayal of Kaufman Christina Applegate is magnificently repellent as Parsons' avaricious exgirlfriend and Robert Forster lends a warm weary dignity to the character of Parsons' father.  Best of all though is Michael Shannon's hysterically funny turn as the hapless hippy hearse driver gradually realising the terrible truth about the situation he's stumbled into.It all adds up to a frequently hilarious and delightful film hugely enhanced by a glorious soundtrack featuring plenty of the real Parsons.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a really decent film. I of course was led to it by being a big fan of Gram Parsons. I did hear about the craziness that surrounded his death and burial and was delighted to hear that they made a movie about it. As with most films that are based on a true story a lot of people were bothered by the liberties taken in the plot and the characters. However they do warn you at the beginning of the film. So it's just like those uptight parents that write letters to the FCC if you don't like it change the channel or in this case walk out of the theater or turn off your TiVo or DVR or throw away the DVD. A lot of people were bothered that this film was not focused on Gram's life. Well if you want that watch the Fallen Angel documentary. Either way you were warned so stop complaining and just enjoy this film already.Good I feel better now that I've got that out of the way.First off this film is superbly acted. Johnny Knoxville as Parsons' road mangler Phil Kaufman Michael Shannon as Larry Osterburg the stonedout hippie owner of the psychedelic hearse and Christina Applegate as Parsons' psychotic exgirlfriend after his money all breathe so much life into their characters even if you want to hate all 3 of them for various reasons at various points in the film.Gabriel Macht whom every movie buff would remember from the godawful 'The Spirit' was the perfect choice to play Gram. Compare any photo of Macht to the photo of Gram Parsons on the cover of the 'Grievous Angel' album. It's uncanny I tell ya! Although some jokes are fairly obvious there is plenty of subtlety. This film definitely warrants repeated viewings because you definitely won't get all of the jokes the first time around. One of the funniest scenes is when the hearse hits a road sign and the two are met by a state trooper who then toys with the two by describing that he's looking for 2 guys in a bright yellow hearse with a coffin in the back. Even though it's quite obvious to Phil and the cop that they're as good as screwed the Hippie still tries his best to convince the cop otherwise all the while still trying to remain oblivious to the fact that they just hit a road sign! Priceless!The film has a lot of heart yet somehow keeping the comedy frontandcenter while the most emotionally gutwrenching of scenes take place. If this film can be summed up it's grief over a loss yet finding laughter in the darkest of places. The exchange between Phil and Stanley Gram's father meeting up at the Joshua Tree Motel is a perfect example. They both share their mutual guilt for not being there for Gram which prompts a slightly offthewall speech from the Hippie that ends with a heartwarming revelation about the whole situation.But the real tearjerker moment is when Phil brings Gram to his final resting place and as soon as Phil lights the fire Gram's A Song For You starts playing over the soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant synthesis of music and film that encapsulates all of the feelings of this film in one single blaze of glory! A few minutes of lamentation and joy later and then with another burst of flame we're brought back to earth in an instant. Gram having the last laugh from beyond the desert bonfire.Which brings me to another point. Some films relating to musical figures tend not to use their music for certain reasons. Shoestring budgets unable to get permission or licensing among other reasons. This film seems more authentic because they went the extra mile and got some of Gram's songs 1000 Wedding Return of the Grievous Angel A Song For You among others as well as a superb cover version of Hot Burrito 2 by Starsailor. The soundtrack is also peppered with some other great music of the time Country Joe  The Fish Eddie Floyd Rory Gallagher as well as some other music that may be newer but actually fit the film really well Bruce Springsteen's tune Blood Brothers was made in 1996 as well as contributions by newer bands Primal Scream Soundtrack of our Lives and of course the aforementioned Flying Burrito Brothers cover by Starsailor.So it may not be a film for everybody but for everybody who gets it this will be highly enjoyable. But if you don't get it that's fine too. This may not be your cup of tea. Unfortunately I don't know any other films quite like this one. This is a very unique story done in a very unique way.".

I did hear about the craziness that surrounded his death and burial and was delighted to hear that they made a movie about it. As with most films that are based on a true story a lot of people were bothered by the liberties taken in the plot and the characters. However they do warn you at the beginning of the film. So it's just like those uptight parents that write letters to the FCC if you don't like it change the channel or in this case walk out of the theater or turn off your TiVo or DVR or throw away the DVD. A lot of people were bothered that this film was not focused on Gram's life. Well if you want that watch the Fallen Angel documentary. Either way you were warned so stop complaining and just enjoy this film already.Good I feel better now that I've got that out of the way.First off this film is superbly acted. Johnny Knoxville as Parsons' road mangler Phil Kaufman Michael Shannon as Larry Osterburg the stonedout hippie owner of the psychedelic hearse and Christina Applegate as Parsons' psychotic exgirlfriend after his money all breathe so much life into their characters even if you want to hate all 3 of them for various reasons at various points in the film.Gabriel Macht whom every movie buff would remember from the godawful 'The Spirit' was the perfect choice to play Gram. Compare any photo of Macht to the photo of Gram Parsons on the cover of the 'Grievous Angel' album. It's uncanny I tell ya! Although some jokes are fairly obvious there is plenty of subtlety. This film definitely warrants repeated viewings because you definitely won't get all of the jokes the first time around. One of the funniest scenes is when the hearse hits a road sign and the two are met by a state trooper who then toys with the two by describing that he's looking for 2 guys in a bright yellow hearse with a coffin in the back. Even though it's quite obvious to Phil and the cop that they're as good as screwed the Hippie still tries his best to convince the cop otherwise all the while still trying to remain oblivious to the fact that they just hit a road sign! Priceless!The film has a lot of heart yet somehow keeping the comedy frontandcenter while the most emotionally gutwrenching of scenes take place. If this film can be summed up it's grief over a loss yet finding laughter in the darkest of places. The exchange between Phil and Stanley Gram's father meeting up at the Joshua Tree Motel is a perfect example. They both share their mutual guilt for not being there for Gram which prompts a slightly offthewall speech from the Hippie that ends with a heartwarming revelation about the whole situation.But the real tearjerker moment is when Phil brings Gram to his final resting place and as soon as Phil lights the fire Gram's A Song For You starts playing over the soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant synthesis of music and film that encapsulates all of the feelings of this film in one single blaze of glory! A few minutes of lamentation and joy later and then with another burst of flame we're brought back to earth in an instant. Gram having the last laugh from beyond the desert bonfire.Which brings me to another point. Some films relating to musical figures tend not to use their music for certain reasons. Shoestring budgets unable to get permission or licensing among other reasons. This film seems more authentic because they went the extra mile and got some of Gram's songs 1000 Wedding Return of the Grievous Angel A Song For You among others as well as a superb cover version of Hot Burrito 2 by Starsailor. The soundtrack is also peppered with some other great music of the time Country Joe  The Fish Eddie Floyd Rory Gallagher as well as some other music that may be newer but actually fit the film really well Bruce Springsteen's tune Blood Brothers was made in 1996 as well as contributions by newer bands Primal Scream Soundtrack of our Lives and of course the aforementioned Flying Burrito Brothers cover by Starsailor.So it may not be a film for everybody but for everybody who gets it this will be highly enjoyable. But if you don't get it that's fine too. This may not be your cup of tea. Unfortunately I don't know any other films quite like this one. This is a very unique story done in a very unique way.";

	schema:reviewBody "Grand Theft Parsons is the story of the kidnapping of Gram Parsons' body by Phil Kaufman his friend and road manager to fulfill the country music legend's wish to be cremated in the California desert. Thanks in large part to terrific performances by Johnny Knoxville as Kaufman Christina Applegate and Michael Shannon and side splitting cameos by Mary Pat Gleason Jonathan Slavin and Clint Culp writer Jeremy Drysdale and director David Caffrey manage to pull off the rarest of feats  a factually based black comedy that not only succeeds but triumphs hilariously yet tastefully.The tale begins with Parsons' drug overdose in the cheap motel in Joshua Tree California. Kaufman dupes the reluctant Larry Osterberg Shannon a drug addled yoga practicing hippie to drive the latter's psychedelic hearse to the LA airport to pick up what Osterberg thinks is an empty coffin. The comedic chemistry between these two as they encounter crisis after crisis trying to snatch the body and bring it back to Joshua Tree is perfect  reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. Among the obstacles they have to contend with are Parsons' gold digging exgirlfriend Applegate who needs a death certificate to cash in on an informal will leaving her everything and Parsons' father Robert Forster who has flown from New Orleans to pick up the body.The movie is not without flaws. The Applegate role is purely fictional and Parsons' real father died when he was a boy. But these characters add humor to the plot and depth to the characterization of Parsons like all 70s rock stars he was considered something of a womanizer so they can easily be overlooked in the name of artistic license. And there are some parts of the story that are not credible at all. I doubt that a body could be loaded for transport without a valid death certificate and I've never seen a hotel bathroom that could be locked from the outside. But these are minor cavils.Whether you're a Parsons devotee like me or have never heard of him like my father with whom I watched the film I can just about guarantee that you'll enjoy Grand Theft Parsons.".

So if it deviates from the truth don't blame the filmmakers. Blame Phil Kaufman for not telling it like it was.Really though the accuracy shouldn't make any difference. If we want facts we'd be watching a documentary not a movie. So in the same way AMADEUS took wild liberties with the truth and still made for great cinema GRAND THEFT PARSONS should also be enjoyed purely for its entertainment value.I don't know the first thing about Gram Parsons his music or the bizarre circumstances following his death. But I can tell you I loved this movie. It's basically about a bunch of people fighting over a corpse. But don't expect a madcap comedy like Weekend at Bernies. This has a very subtle style of humour more like the deadpan comedies Midnight Run or Groundhog Day. It's also a bit of a road movie carrying a vibe much like Fear  Loathing in Las Vegas.Some of the gags had me laughing out loud. It wasn't so much what they said as how they said it. With great acting all around not a moment went by that I wasn't enjoying the show.Gram Parsons fans don't expect a movie about Gram.

Finally having read brief snippets about it online and in magazines over the last year I finally got the chance to see it at the Dublin International Film Festival in Feb 2004.This is not a straight biopic of Gram's life nor does it attempt to be. It is a goodnatured affectionate comedy roadmovie that is based on the recollections of Phil Kaufman who was Gram's 'executive nanny' in the last couple of years of his life and who made the strange pact with GP that is the focus of this film.Phil Kaufman is played by Johnny Knoxville in his first lead role. Strange choice you may think? Well I was sceptical too but Knoxville turns in quite a competent performance effectively conveying the close bond that existed between Kaufman and Gram.  But his companion in the coffinthieving escapade steals the show  a hippy going through drug withdrawal played with a subtle comic touch by Michael Shannon.  Some of the characters in the film are fictional not least the father figure of 'Stanley Parsons' and the Christina Applegate character 'Barbara'.  This doesn't detract from the overall impact though.  In order to simplify things the writer and director decided not to incorporate the complicated Parsons family history into the film few people seeing this movie will be aware of the existence of GP's stepfather and his biological father.  So the character we see is really Gram's biological father brought back to life in order to witness the wonderful achievements that his son had made through creating his music.And what about that music in the film? Well I had shivers running up my spine when the full force of tracks such as 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' and '1000 Wedding' came over the sound system in the theatre.  And there was almost a tear in me eye as the coffin went up in flames as 'A Song For You' played. A wonderful moment.Hopefully people who have never heard of Gram Parsons and his music will go to see this movie because Johnny Knoxville is in it or simply because it's a fine lovingly crafted lowbudget comedy drama. And they may well come out converts to GP's fantastic music.  As for us Gram fans well it's a must see  touching funny poignant and a suitably fitting tribute.".

I was recommended this film several years ago and I completely enjoyed it for what it is a highlyfictionalized apparently loose adaptation of a true story that takes many liberties. So I am judging this film strictly on its own merits without knowing the music of Parsons or the man himself.Please take the film for what it is not how accurate it is to the truth. Of which I've heard varying accounts although from what I understand the basics of this film are true but many of the details and secondarycharacters are falsecreated Johnny Knoxville of Jackass fame stars in this adaptation of a bizarre true story about the events that transpired shortly after the death of famed musician Gram Parsons.Knoxville portrays Phil Kaufman Parson's road manager and best friend. When he was still alive Parsons and Kaufman made a pact of sorts the first to die would be taken to Joshua Tree and cremated by the surviving friend in order to set their spirit free. When Parsons suddenly dies from an apparent overdose Kaufman enlists the help of a hippie named Larry Michael Shannon whom owns a bright yellow hearse to steal the body and transport it. Kaufman is able to convince the hippie that it is not Parson's body through various increasingly humorous lies.At the same time Gram's father Robert Forster and psychotic exgirlfriend Christina Applegate pursue Kaufman to get the body for their own reasons. Gram's father simply wants to give his son a traditional burial and exBarbara needs the body for a convoluted scheme by which she wants to inherit his money and recording mastertapes for her personal benefit. Marley Shelton plays Kaufman's girlfriend who tags along with Barbara to find out what Kaufman's up to.Despite some negative reviews and mixed critical reception I found the film very well made. The acting is fantastic. Knoxville surprises and shocks as Kaufman giving a strong emotional performance. A complete 180 turn from his hapless realitypersona on Jackass. Forster is great as a grieving father. Shannon is good as a clueless drugaddled hippie. Applegate is conniving and fun as Barbara. And Shelton is sympathetic and likable as Phil's girlfriend.The direction and writing is also very solid if not a bit simplistic. Helmer David Caffrey does a good job with the material. And the music including many songs by Parsons and a score by Richard G. Mitchell is topnotch.I found this film to be a fun heartfelt enjoyable journey. It's touching and will put a smile on your face. Sure it might not be 100 accurate but it's a good time. 8 out of 10.".

When he was still alive Parsons and Kaufman made a pact of sorts the first to die would be taken to Joshua Tree and cremated by the surviving friend in order to set their spirit free. When Parsons suddenly dies from an apparent overdose Kaufman enlists the help of a hippie named Larry Michael Shannon whom owns a bright yellow hearse to steal the body and transport it. Kaufman is able to convince the hippie that it is not Parson's body through various increasingly humorous lies.At the same time Gram's father Robert Forster and psychotic exgirlfriend Christina Applegate pursue Kaufman to get the body for their own reasons. Gram's father simply wants to give his son a traditional burial and exBarbara needs the body for a convoluted scheme by which she wants to inherit his money and recording mastertapes for her personal benefit. Marley Shelton plays Kaufman's girlfriend who tags along with Barbara to find out what Kaufman's up to.Despite some negative reviews and mixed critical reception I found the film very well made. The acting is fantastic. Knoxville surprises and shocks as Kaufman giving a strong emotional performance. A complete 180 turn from his hapless realitypersona on Jackass. Forster is great as a grieving father. Shannon is good as a clueless drugaddled hippie. Applegate is conniving and fun as Barbara. And Shelton is sympathetic and likable as Phil's girlfriend.The direction and writing is also very solid if not a bit simplistic. Helmer David Caffrey does a good job with the material. And the music including many songs by Parsons and a score by Richard G. Mitchell is topnotch.I found this film to be a fun heartfelt enjoyable journey. It's touching and will put a smile on your face. Sure it might not be 100 accurate but it's a good time. 8 out of 10.";

I thought it would be a descent film about Grams Life and Music but they had to make a film about his death. I am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies i wanted a film about his life not his infamous death. I was very Disappointed. I wish people would look at his life more then his death. The only thing good about this film was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment to any Gram Parsons Fan.";

How dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which they're so clearly incapable of delivering. What were they thinking? Where to start?THE SCRIPT I thought I'd be getting a slice of bittersweet Americana. What I got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich left unturned. Stupid hippy? Check. Stupid fat cop? Check. Awful plot contrivances? Check. Embarrassingly written female characters? Double check. Total disregard for the story which you're trying to portray? Check.After a while you realize that what you're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with Ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville which hasn't moved on much. Scene with Ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one. And so on...THE DIRECTION My friends and I decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy or maybe a particularly poor Dukes of Hazzard. That's how bad the direction was. Terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes. God it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered the director was an Irishman who's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen trust me it's lowest common denominator TV. And then it all made sense...THE ACTING Are we now so critical that when some random guy from the TV decides to give acting a go if he's not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. Her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines I don't know. The 'hippy' in the hearse oh dear oh dear oh dear. Have we not moved on since Cheech and Chong?I could go on but I think you get my drift. What I would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for The Byrds The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They knew nothing about the American road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology. This film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to...oh wait I didn't quite make the end. And I suggest you stay away too.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a teenager in the 1970s I was a frequent visitor to an art gallery in Liverpool called the Open Eye. When they started a film club promising to show all the stuff I had read about but would never otherwise get a chance to see I signed up like a flash.It was a humble affair a bare room with temporary blackouts on the windows a makeshift screen at one end a projector at t'other and a dozen or so illassorted chairs inbetween but I loved it. For me it was a magic grotto a portal to another place of endless fascination and discovery. It was here that I had my first exposure to the works of Buuel Renoir Fritz Lang Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera the experimental shadowgraph animations of Man Ray David Lynch's Eraserhead  and unforgettably Cline et Julie vont en bateau.Even for one as keen on Art cinema as I was Cline et Julie was a bit of a challenging prospect a lowbudget French thing about godknowswhat by a director I'd never heard of that we were warned would run over three hours without interval. Little did I know as the opening credits rolled that from then on time would mean nothing and I would be held captive enthralled the hours slipping by unheeded as when dreaming.It is this quality that for me makes this film so special. European especially French cinema is full of works that lay claim to the label Surrealist. I have to say that in my opinion most of them have little to do with the truly surreal at all. More often than not they are simply a cocktail of absurdism and social satire.Cline et Julie on the other hand is a genuinely surreal film  possibly the ONLY genuinely surreal film ever made !  insomuch that its narrative and hence the experience of watching it unfold is uncannily dreamlike. From the outset the viewer is drawn inexorably forward by a teasing sense of curiosity. Frequently along the way there seems to be far too much going on that is unexplained and little hope of fitting it all together yet one cannot help but remain in the story. In time we become aware that our mixed sensations as viewer are mirroring those being experienced by Cline and Julie  and thus we find ourselves in that familiar condition of the dreamer of being simultaneously both onlooker and protagonist in our own drama. Afterwards I was left feeling curiously elated yet struggling to recall its details with any precision. The impressions it had left behind were powerful and thoughtprovoking yet intangible and recalled but imperfectly in the manner of one who has just awoken with a frustrating uncertainty as to exactly what had occurred to whom and in what order. Any attempt to explain it to a third party was equally doomed. Just as with a halfremembered dream the very act of telling caused the peculiar paralogic of the narrative to disintegrate and I'd be left speechless.It's been part of me ever since. Over the last 30odd years the themes and images of this film have in the nicest possible way haunted me lurking in the shadows of consciousness beyond the clumsy reach of rational query quietly informing my imagination to appear unbidden in subtle and unexpected ways in my own creative output.The whole strange business has been made all the more uncanny by the fact that throughout those 30odd years the film itself has been lost to me. Having experienced it the once I was never able to find Cline et Julie again nor any reference to it even in the pages of famously trusted and supposedly 'comprehensive' movie guides. Likewise whenever I mentioned the film in conversation I could never come across anyone who had ever heard of it. Having worked its mischief the contrary creature had melted back into the halflight leaving no trace of its existence.Then in October of 2006 a miracle there it was right in front of me listed in the TV schedules! Film4 was showing it  at the suitably unconscious hour of 3am. Unwilling to risk losing it for another 30 years to the vagaries of my video recorder's dodgy timer I sat up my finger hovering nervously over the Record button...A few days later having found an afternoon in which we were free of commitments my partner and I settled in to watch it she with some scepticism that she would be able to maintain her interest for the whole 3 hours and me both aquiver with anticipation and privately praying that in the hard light of reality this thing of treasured halfmemory would not prove itself to be The Worst Load Of Pretentious Tripe Ever Made.I needn't have worried. No sooner had I hit Play than that fragrant familiar magic began weaving itself all over again. I am delighted to report that Cline et Julie is just as powerful an experience now as it was in my youth.What I had forgotten or perhaps never noticed at all on first viewing was just what a roughedged homespun creature it is in technical terms. It was shot entirely on location on 16mm and with a very small crew and it shows. The soundtrack is patchy in places and frequently prey to whatever ambient sounds were present when the camera rolled usually Parisian traffic noise. Now and then the acting is selfconscious and some of the reaction shots are clumsily done. In the end though none of this matters a damn. Indeed it is the film's very lack of studio polish that gives it much of its special flavour. Cline et Julie is an imperfect creation but an honest one. It is also charming playful and frequently hilarious. As such I recommend it unreservedly.".

It had long been my suspicion that all secrets of life would be revealed in a film over three hours long and in French.Indeed Celine and Julie is just that film. But it conceals as it reveals which is to say that its great mysteriousness results from its floribundance of revelation. Yes my friend a floribundance!  I never even thought of such a word until seeing Celine and Julie.Critics have been unable to explain what it's about. I cannot. I can't explain the plays of Shakespeare or the poems of Emily Dickinson but I am moved by them. Attempts to understand them can lead to intense mental spasmodics but the pain if the work is good can be great.Those who've seen the film will remember the hard magic candy the women savored on their own path to understanding. Vision giving the candy became an addiction to them. Once is never enough and hasn't been for me. I have seen Celine and Julie three times and thought of it many more.My favorite scene is where Celine performs her weird magic act in a nightclub where as far as I can tell the customers are all convicted poets. The atmosphere there is fascinating. Time stops while she does her act which is beyond words indescribable. The whole feeling in that scene of a kind of super sophisticated moment of comedy and sex and mystery all shared by a group of people in silence is one that I find marvelously inspiring. Surely some clever entrepreneur in San Francisco where I reside could open such a club. Oh I suppose it won't happen but at least one can dream.Really it's the importance power and pleasurepain of dreaming that this film reawakended me to when I saw it months ago. To be like Celine and Julie with their minds moved by candy is a state I aspire to daily.When I was briefly without a place to live I thought of this film and was taken to a sunny day in Montmarte a house where the living and unliving mingle a library where stalkers and smokers meet.

	schema:headline " What we miss most about our childhoods distilled in a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "A PERFECT SHARED IMAGINATION something we become entirely incapable of evoking in our adult lives. As children it's still possible to create an allengrossing parallel existence played out in symbiotic harmony by two individuals calling themselves best friends. With an uncluttered and unfettered creativity these friends are sucked into their inner story to a point that time place and the mundane habits and duties of one's routine no longer exist or rather are incorporated andor adapted to fit what then becomes one's main existence  the imagined one. What makes this movie so convincingly evoke the yearning for the magic of childhood is exactly this the fact that this imaginative world is shared so perfectly by two friends and not just cultivated within an isolation and individuality typical of adult age. No other movie has made me think back at my childhood best friends as vividly as Cline and Julie Go Boating!Hours spent in a room surrounded by familiar objects turned into so many powerful talismans. Earnest magic rituals punctuated by benevolent mutual derision in the little moments in which one risks getting too serious or devoid of irony. Convulsive giggling fits which end in snorting noises. Relaxed spontaneous touchyfeely languid poses making two friends feel like they fit each other's company like a glove. Living the present so perfectly that one is momentarily blissfully freed of any baggage from the past or the insecurities for the future that stunt one's spontaneity in the present. This isn't just a definition of perfect childlike friendship but also of a simple uncluttered state of pure happiness. Rivette captures the spirit of all these things  childhood and happiness  in a movie unlike any I've seen before. Or rather  the movie may have seemed familiar thematically but the execution and spirit of it was something else altogether.As other users have commented here Cline and Julie Go Boating is inspired by both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Henry James as well as being reminiscent of Buuel  not just his surreal movies but also That Obscure Object of Desire. In the latter Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina play the same character interchangeably. Cline and Julie do the same when they both interchangeably play the nurse in the closedcircuit storyinthestory involving the man the blonde woman the brunette woman and the little girl in the haunted house  this story's plot is being played out over and over again in the two protagonists' heads as they strive to both figure its intrigue and the dark heart of its mystery out all the while deriding the stuffy rhetoric of its melodrama delightful!. There are clear echoes of Bergman's Persona as well as Cline and Julie stand in for each other  namely Cline pretends to be Julie when she meets her childhood sweetheart and cousin Guilou while Julie stands in for Cline when she attends the magician's audition. Touches of Buuel and Fellini are also evoked by the dream sequences with their typical fragmented rhythm which mixes in dreams reality thoughts and imagination. Though innovative and timeless Cline and Julie Go Boating does also belong to the decade in which it was made as it has a recognisable 1960s70s surrealist aesthetic and an interest in inner landscapes not for their own sake but for what they say about the psychic goings on of human beings. Purely thematically this movie also brought to mind Peter Jackson's 1994 movie Heavenly Creatures. However though the latter was made exactly 20 years later than Cline and Julie it is decidedly more misogynistic in spirit to be fair perhaps not consciously or intentionally so. Why am I calling Jackson's movie misogynistic?

	onyx:emotionText "A PERFECT SHARED IMAGINATION something we become entirely incapable of evoking in our adult lives. As children it's still possible to create an allengrossing parallel existence played out in symbiotic harmony by two individuals calling themselves best friends. With an uncluttered and unfettered creativity these friends are sucked into their inner story to a point that time place and the mundane habits and duties of one's routine no longer exist or rather are incorporated andor adapted to fit what then becomes one's main existence  the imagined one. What makes this movie so convincingly evoke the yearning for the magic of childhood is exactly this the fact that this imaginative world is shared so perfectly by two friends and not just cultivated within an isolation and individuality typical of adult age. No other movie has made me think back at my childhood best friends as vividly as Cline and Julie Go Boating!Hours spent in a room surrounded by familiar objects turned into so many powerful talismans. Earnest magic rituals punctuated by benevolent mutual derision in the little moments in which one risks getting too serious or devoid of irony. Convulsive giggling fits which end in snorting noises. Relaxed spontaneous touchyfeely languid poses making two friends feel like they fit each other's company like a glove. Living the present so perfectly that one is momentarily blissfully freed of any baggage from the past or the insecurities for the future that stunt one's spontaneity in the present. This isn't just a definition of perfect childlike friendship but also of a simple uncluttered state of pure happiness. Rivette captures the spirit of all these things  childhood and happiness  in a movie unlike any I've seen before. Or rather  the movie may have seemed familiar thematically but the execution and spirit of it was something else altogether.As other users have commented here Cline and Julie Go Boating is inspired by both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Henry James as well as being reminiscent of Buuel  not just his surreal movies but also That Obscure Object of Desire. In the latter Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina play the same character interchangeably. Cline and Julie do the same when they both interchangeably play the nurse in the closedcircuit storyinthestory involving the man the blonde woman the brunette woman and the little girl in the haunted house  this story's plot is being played out over and over again in the two protagonists' heads as they strive to both figure its intrigue and the dark heart of its mystery out all the while deriding the stuffy rhetoric of its melodrama delightful!. There are clear echoes of Bergman's Persona as well as Cline and Julie stand in for each other  namely Cline pretends to be Julie when she meets her childhood sweetheart and cousin Guilou while Julie stands in for Cline when she attends the magician's audition. Touches of Buuel and Fellini are also evoked by the dream sequences with their typical fragmented rhythm which mixes in dreams reality thoughts and imagination. Though innovative and timeless Cline and Julie Go Boating does also belong to the decade in which it was made as it has a recognisable 1960s70s surrealist aesthetic and an interest in inner landscapes not for their own sake but for what they say about the psychic goings on of human beings. Purely thematically this movie also brought to mind Peter Jackson's 1994 movie Heavenly Creatures. However though the latter was made exactly 20 years later than Cline and Julie it is decidedly more misogynistic in spirit to be fair perhaps not consciously or intentionally so. Why am I calling Jackson's movie misogynistic?

There is the venerable Un Chien Andalou and there is Celine et Julie vont en Bateau and that might well be the lot.  Celine et Julie has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it in the 1970s because it is hypnotic thoughtprovoking mysterious and funny all at once.  Its overall style could be described as magical realism in which the quotidian life of Paris serves as a mere background for the magical fantasy life of the protagonists two young women on a psychic journey which may or may not end in madness vont en bateau which literally means go boating is also slang for go crazy.The film is made of moments that seem to happen outside of time.  In fact the passage of time the succession of events in everyday life becomes an intrusion on the increasingly shared inner life of the two women and each takes hilarious action to prevent those intrusions from continuing. They determine in effect that they must return as adults to their childhood in order to change the past.  This may sound like a boring Freudian nightmare but there is no heavyhanded psychologizing in the movie it is all play lighthearted yet beautifully composed.  The soundtrack is particularly effective almost hyperrealistic with no background music.  The click of heels on pavement or the motor of a taxi loom out of the silence as in a dream which the movie may be at its heart.I give this one a 10.  You probably know already whether you would like it. If so see it in a theater if you can and on video if you must but don't miss it.".

Over 3 hours long but I got so absorbed in the story that I didn't even notice it was that long. I wanted it to be longer in fact! Kinda hard to describe... sort of a cross between a Bunuel and a Rohmer movie... starring a French Laverne and Shirley. The plot takes its time getting started... but once the premise became evident I was totally hooked! Our 2 heroines take turns going into a strange house. They emerge some hours later totally disoriented and with no recollection of what happened inside. Later they are able to recall certain events... but not the whole story. This goes on day after day... the exact same scenes take place with the 2 women taking turns playing a nurse to a sick child... who it turns out may have been murdered by someone else in the house! But who? The girls keep going back into the house to find out the secret. The 2 women who play the leads are EXCELLENT! They start out not knowing each other but become close friends as the events unfold. They are both slightly kooky and enjoy playing pranks on each other... at times taking over the other person's life while that person is busy in the house. Some of the later scenes in the movie... when the 2 girls go into the house together... are HILARIOUS! I was actually laughing at loud at stuff... but I fully admit that normal people don't always see the humour in the same things that I do. 8 Wow I need to see this movie again! Will someone PLEASE release it on DVD with a decent picture? This grainy bootleg just doesn't do it justice.".

The experience of a lifetime by New York's critic David Thompson Celine and Julie Go Boating 1974 is all of the above but first of all it is incredible fun to watch. This magic candy of a movie tells the story or rather plays with the story of two friends Julie a librarian and Celine a magician. The film starts one sunny summer day in Paris when Julie follows running through the park and losing her stuff all over a scarf a shoe Celine exactly like another girl in the English country side one sunny summer day had followed a White Rabbit into a world of her imagination. Two girls became friends and soon with the help of a magic memoryinducing candy they both will be the observers and participants in a bizarre soapopera like drama that takes place in a mysterious house. It involves two stunningly beautiful women a blonde and a brunette who are in love with the same man. The man is a widower with a young daughter who had promised his wife that he would not remarry as long as their daughter is alive. When the blonde and the brunette become desperate enough to try to do something about the situation it is up to Julie and Celine to come up with the plan and to rescue the young girl. Will they go boating? Well you will have to stay with them for all 193 minutes to find out. Yes Rivette takes his time but his movie never seems slow or boring. Playful yet complicated mad and funny Celine and Julie is a magic movie. It grabbed me from the opening scene  which is of course the opening chapter of Alice in Wonderland  and it never let go. Buniel would love this movie I think. It also reminds me of Mullholand Dr and even Persona but in the absolutely different mode. Simply DELIGHTFUL.".

This was a time when I was very interested in the depiction of modern women in films some were quite original and revealing and this was indeed one of them dealing with the creative process and women's imagination. Made in 1974 it had a similar origin as that of 3 Women in which the female cast Juliet Berto Dominique Labourier Bulle Ogier and MarieFrance Pisier worked with director Rivette and writer Eduardo de Gregorio on the script. It is also a story of female bonding and solidarity but instead of relying on dreams it uses magic and literary sources Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland being the first to come to mind. Librarian Julie Labourier becomes intrigued by weird rabbitlike magician Cline Berto but soon one is after the other. They become friends or sort of and exchange roles in each other's life but nobody seems to notice the difference. Then Cline reveals she frequently goes inside an old house where a melodrama is repeated on and on based on Henry James' The Romance of Certain Old Clothes and The Other House enacted by two women Ogier Pisier who are both in love with a very pale man filmmaker Barbet Schroeder. In the old house there is also a little girl Nathalie Asnar who is in danger so Cline and Julie become the phantom ladies of the title including Fantmas outfits to rescue her. This postmodern movie is a puzzle and the audience is intellectually involved in the making. Critics went crazy and called it the most important film made since 'Citizen Kane'. I don't know if it is but I love it it is funny demanding entertaining and sometimes boring in the best tradition of Satie's repetitive Vexations. Reworked as Desperately Seeking Susan without acknowledging it.".

There's no humour or verve or flair or great lines or classic scenes not even sad attempts at those things only a forced drollerie that falls flat in every scene There is endless silly giggling scenes such as those in the nightclub that are just tiresome to watch fantasy sequences that are presumably meant to look like a corny TV sitcom but lacking any scrap of humour the point is entirely lost and the actors flounder. The girls try far too hard to be cute and only succeed in being cloying. And I'm waiting for a director to grasp this simple truth that giving the actors free rein does not make the action more spontaneous and natural only more strangulated more selfconscious more unnatural and cringeinducing than if they were following a consistent and meticulous script.After a while you realise Rivette is just playing silly buggers. Fluffed lines are left in characters glance inadvertentlydeliberately at the camera. Rivette will be saying 'Regard c'est un film that is pas un film we're deliberatement toying avec your illusions'. I'm saying Vous etes un wankeur.Why three hours? A Senses of Cinema article is eager to explain 'The tradition of rigid adherence to the 90 minute to 2hour time frame enforced by the laws of free market capitalism is exploded by Rivette. As a filmmaker Rivette refuses to confine himself to these arbitrary lengths or to the even more arbitrary if unspoken rules about demands on subject matter and miseenscne in films of epic length. Instead Rivette extends the lengths of his films to a point beyond necessity where it is understood that the film's length in and of itself is a statement about the system he works in and rebels against.' 3 hours simply to defy capitalistic?? convention? Wankeur.The audience are the dupes here  poked fun at for trying to apply reality to what is selfconsciously only a film. This is not New Wave. I'm gazetting Rivette as a hangeron a copyist. He wants to shoot in the style of Rohmer but he hasn't got Rohmer's indefinable deftness. He wants to break the rules like Godard but he has not got Godard's indefinable style or charisma. He wants to say something meaningful in an offhand way like Truffaut but he hasn't got that indefinable intellect for it. All he can do is try. You can feel him trying. It boils down to a single lame joke that isn't funny and a single idea that isn't clever. Three hours of filmflam tiresome beyond belief.".

Fluffed lines are left in characters glance inadvertentlydeliberately at the camera. Rivette will be saying 'Regard c'est un film that is pas un film we're deliberatement toying avec your illusions'. I'm saying Vous etes un wankeur.Why three hours? A Senses of Cinema article is eager to explain 'The tradition of rigid adherence to the 90 minute to 2hour time frame enforced by the laws of free market capitalism is exploded by Rivette. As a filmmaker Rivette refuses to confine himself to these arbitrary lengths or to the even more arbitrary if unspoken rules about demands on subject matter and miseenscne in films of epic length. Instead Rivette extends the lengths of his films to a point beyond necessity where it is understood that the film's length in and of itself is a statement about the system he works in and rebels against.' 3 hours simply to defy capitalistic?? convention? Wankeur.The audience are the dupes here  poked fun at for trying to apply reality to what is selfconsciously only a film. This is not New Wave. I'm gazetting Rivette as a hangeron a copyist. He wants to shoot in the style of Rohmer but he hasn't got Rohmer's indefinable deftness. He wants to break the rules like Godard but he has not got Godard's indefinable style or charisma. He wants to say something meaningful in an offhand way like Truffaut but he hasn't got that indefinable intellect for it. All he can do is try. You can feel him trying. It boils down to a single lame joke that isn't funny and a single idea that isn't clever. Three hours of filmflam tiresome beyond belief.";

Story of mysterious house in which strange things happen is marred by silly pastiches of unexplained and often absurd actions two leading ladies undertake in an effort to solve the mystery that has a self serving purpose same as the movie which is trying too hard to be incomprehensible in order to be different.

Difference is coherent uniqueness difference is Kubrick Teshighara Clouzot Truffaut Kaurismki. Surrealist is Bunuel Cocteau Ferreri... Distinctive is Polanski Allen Melville Hitchcock Welles.

Like Cline and Julie I was young in 1974 there was magic in the air dressing up with floating scarves and feather boas brought performance into everyday life fashionable dalliance with the magic symbols beloved of the Surrealists contrasted brightly with the still fairly recent drab postwar world. Rivette's film had more than a little of l'air du temps. So would I be disappointed over 30 years later seeing the film subtitled in English in London's National Film Theatre in May 2006? Emphatically no. Rivette's genius is to recreate a timeless magic which weaves seamlessly through city streets and gardens and which is to be accessed in a more condensed form in the cinema symbolised here by the rather more wooden and conventional story within the film .This is a film for those who can sit for hours on a park bench in Paris or at a caf table unaware of the passing of time but entranced by the details of the surrounding architecture and the glimpsed lives of passersby. Over three hours long it is not a film for the person impatient for the plot to race to its conclusion when every question is answered and every mystery solved.Magic is the magic of Paris itself. Lingering shots of cats hold our focus on the magic of the prosaic while also reminding us of witches' familiars. Magic exists in the performance of the magician Cline. The viewer is also reconnected to the magic of childhood. We see Cline in the children's section of the library and it is with the solemnity of small children that the two girls are happy to substitute the perfume L'Air du Temps ultimately just air for the element of air in their magic potion. The whole adventure can be seen as a return to childhood an old photo in a toy box giving us a clue as to the origins of the mysterious house in which the girls alternately act the part of the nursemaid.It is a film with layer upon layer of allusions. The magic sweets echo the madeleines with which Proust's Marcel regained with immediacy memories of his childhood just as they echo the magic potion in Alice in Wonderland.Humour abounds. Try if you understand French to follow the wordplay in the original sometimes necessitating inaccurate translations as when the punning pair of words persil parsley esprit are rendered as clover clever. Delight in the natural exuberance of the two girls as when fearful of being discovered as one and the same nursemaid in the mysterious house they almost literally fall about laughing as they try to disguise themselves as mirror images of themselves.Mirror images and symmetry shape the film and are extremely satisfying to the viewer. This time round I noticed many details that I hadn't noticed before. In the penultimate scene for example both girls are wearing identical boating jumpers. We have to wait for the last scene for the patterns of identity to come full circle.I think this will always be my favourite film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I approached this movie for the 1st time with few preconceptions. The title was vaguely familiar and I'd recently seen Paris Nous Appartient which at least set me up for Rivette's obscure and allusive style of filmmaking. That was a film which I admired for its atmosphere and direction rather than its nowdated cold war paranoia schtick. The chief drawback for me is its treatment of the lead characters none of whom one can really feel any engagement with or interest in. When the action peters out one is left intrigued but ultimately rather empty. Perhaps that was Rivette's commentary on the blankness of the society of the time  the grim late '50s. It's evident that with certain directors a macro perspective of their movies serves one better than attention to matters of plot and character. It's certainly true of Celine et Julie vont en bateau. Don't look for a tight narrative plot exposition or credible character motivation you'll find all that in dimeadozen movies that will be forgotten before the popcorn's been cleared away. Celine and Julie is a child's adventure enjoyed by two adult and rather beauteous women. It's not a lesbian love story although the intimacy of the characters would normally suggest this. Indeed sexuality is noticeably eschewed and even scorned here. Naturally because it has no place in the imaginative world of the child which requires freedom not the slavery of innate bodily desires. I found it a pure delight  original okbut for dollops of Lewis Carroll human engaging and fresh with only a vague taint of early 1970s whimsy despite its age. As with many of the other posters here watching this movie was a revelation like the first time you taste a really good wine or hear Nick Drake. And after 3 and a half hours of patience you feel so glad you didn't get served a typical denouement and that you have like the main characters been treated to such a wonderfulwonderful experience. Never mind that all of it is illusory. After allwhat else is a movie but an escapist jaunt around another's imagination. Undoubtedly the film's principal theme is childhood innocence and how the child's imagination transforms mundane reality. Inherent in Rivette's treatment is an understanding though that the imagination and reality cannot coexist for long. One is essentially the enemy of the other and C and J become progressively removed from reality ending up closseted in their darkened room with their transforming psychedelic boiled sweets and magick potions. Their mission is to save the young girl in the mansion from harm but this is surely heavily symbolic really they are intent on preserving their own inner child their innocent separatism from an evil and unattractive adult world peopled with sleazy club impresarios and Julie's bandes de maquereaux. Feeding one's imagination thus even a deux is basically masturbatory however it has no life of its own and the reality it feeds on soon sickens and dies just as visibly do the 3 characters in the ghostly lovetriangle who have become grey and mute by the end of the film. C and J's gauche and unpractised interventions in saving the imperilled young girl remind us that we cannot enter our own dreams without seeing their fundamental flimsiness they are our creation but are less sophisticated than us  simplified and unreal. The blueremembered hills are much greyer when seen closeup. The joyous finale tells us that nevertheless another adventure always beckons even if it does simply recycle old elements for new. I'm not sure if Rivette's is a sad or an uplifting message  what do you think?".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I don't really know where to begin. I am totally at a loss as to why this is considered a great film. In my opinion the movie isn't even a good film let alone great.No matter how I approach the film I can't really think of anything good to say! Let's start with the cinematography Big nothing. There's nothing about how this film was shot that would make it stand out in any way. In fact I'd say the film was poorly shot.The lead actresses Neither of the two lead actresses in my opinion brought anything of substance to their performances. Forgetting the fact that neither actress was in any way physically interesting to look at...nothing special in the looks department nor did either actress at least have just an interesting style or some quirky feature that one could at least debate...like say the American actresscomedian Sandra Bernhard...Nope..just plain janes with no style or anything. Nor did their performances strike any kind of note..simply blah. It's as if the director had taken two women from a bar one night and said You can star in my movie! The plot Meandering at best. And I love movies that don't necessarily have a strong plot. Films of Michael Anonioni come to mind where not much happens yet Antonioni brings so much subtext  mystery  atmosphere to his films whereas this film...well forget it. Actually the plot reminds me as nothing more than an amateur attempt at making a home movie.The actual writing No great memorable lines. No style to speak of. A junior high school student could have written the screen play for this movie.Editing Frankly I don't think the movie was edited. Except for a couple of times in the movie where he inserts a quick cut here and there I think all the director did was put together everything he shot and called it a movie.So what is this movie about? Well it's really not about much of anything. Two women meet  move in together and have lots of boring conversations then they start to kind of have these weird fantasies. You can read the other reviews for more detailed info.So why then does this movie have the reputation it does? I think a lot has to do with what the movie was trying to accomplish. The intellectual aspirations of the movie in my opinion blinded the critics at the time. I think they were so pleased to see a movie attempt to be more than a simple narrative that they praised it way more than the film deserves. And certainly in the late 60s early 70s there was this sensibility that simply being different not mainstream gave a film a certain cache.A notable film from the same time period that also had a surreal bent to it and does deserve its reputation is le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie made by Luis Bunuel in 1972. Of course Bunuel started the whole surrealism game back in the 20s with his Un chien andalou.So I don't really know what to say about this film. I mean one of my favorite films is 2001 A Space Odyssey which is notoriously slow and lacks much dialog at all yet is hailed as a masterpiece which I agree with.I really do think the fact that it was considered cutting edge for it's day and yes dare I say that is was a FRENCH film I think a lot of critics really felt embarrassed not to jump on the praise parade.Don't feel bad if you miss this flick or if you do happen to see it and can't see what all the fuss is about.This film really is much ado about nothing.".

There's nothing about how this film was shot that would make it stand out in any way. In fact I'd say the film was poorly shot.The lead actresses Neither of the two lead actresses in my opinion brought anything of substance to their performances. Forgetting the fact that neither actress was in any way physically interesting to look at...nothing special in the looks department nor did either actress at least have just an interesting style or some quirky feature that one could at least debate...like say the American actresscomedian Sandra Bernhard...Nope..just plain janes with no style or anything. Nor did their performances strike any kind of note..simply blah. It's as if the director had taken two women from a bar one night and said You can star in my movie! The plot Meandering at best. And I love movies that don't necessarily have a strong plot. Films of Michael Anonioni come to mind where not much happens yet Antonioni brings so much subtext  mystery  atmosphere to his films whereas this film...well forget it. Actually the plot reminds me as nothing more than an amateur attempt at making a home movie.The actual writing No great memorable lines. No style to speak of. A junior high school student could have written the screen play for this movie.Editing Frankly I don't think the movie was edited. Except for a couple of times in the movie where he inserts a quick cut here and there I think all the director did was put together everything he shot and called it a movie.So what is this movie about? Well it's really not about much of anything. Two women meet  move in together and have lots of boring conversations then they start to kind of have these weird fantasies. You can read the other reviews for more detailed info.So why then does this movie have the reputation it does? I think a lot has to do with what the movie was trying to accomplish. The intellectual aspirations of the movie in my opinion blinded the critics at the time. I think they were so pleased to see a movie attempt to be more than a simple narrative that they praised it way more than the film deserves. And certainly in the late 60s early 70s there was this sensibility that simply being different not mainstream gave a film a certain cache.A notable film from the same time period that also had a surreal bent to it and does deserve its reputation is le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie made by Luis Bunuel in 1972. Of course Bunuel started the whole surrealism game back in the 20s with his Un chien andalou.So I don't really know what to say about this film. I mean one of my favorite films is 2001 A Space Odyssey which is notoriously slow and lacks much dialog at all yet is hailed as a masterpiece which I agree with.I really do think the fact that it was considered cutting edge for it's day and yes dare I say that is was a FRENCH film I think a lot of critics really felt embarrassed not to jump on the praise parade.Don't feel bad if you miss this flick or if you do happen to see it and can't see what all the fuss is about.This film really is much ado about nothing.";

Celine and Julie Go Boating is difficult frustrating and over long. However it is also the kind of film that after seeing it you wonder what other people have to say about it.I didn't enjoy it much. Visually it is not terribly special. The relationship between the two women and the haunted house is what keeps us watching but the scenes come very slowly.Several people have said it unfolds like a dream. Others have pointed out the lesbianfeminist side to it. Another possibility is that the two women represent two personalities of a schizophrenic nurse who committed an unspeakable crime. That would explain the repetitive cutting between one woman as the nurse and then her counterpart switching in. The two sides of the same madwoman angle possibly explains why the story includes the woman who is a performance amateur subbing for the experienced magician.Between Celine Juliet Berto and Julie Dominique Labourier I think Labourier is the strongest here. Labourier has a lot of charisma too bad Rivette has her often just laughing directly into the camera.The characters in the haunted house are interesting. MarieFrance Pisier is a favorite of mine and she is very mysterious here.If the scenes didn't unfold so sluggishly and if the narrative were tighter I think it would have been great. Unfortunately it is too much work to recommend.".

By impersonating one another Celine chases Julie's boyfriend away Julie foils Celine's plans for a vaudeville tour in the Middle East.This is the first half of the movie delightfully carefree and radiating with improvised discovery. It plays a lot like the Czech film Daisies from '66. Unlike Vera Chytilova's film though that riffed on a simple feminist rebellion this is complex structured stuff that delves deeper.Nested inside the one fiction is another which the two girls taking turns explore inside a mysterious house. This second narrative is a parody of soap opera itself an unintentional camp about adult responsibility hysterical stuff about obsession and illicit love involving a husband mistress and the presence of a dead wife. The two girls watch from outside as though shaping the story. They guffaw at the overwrought histrionics or become distracted by boredom more importantly they participate.So having persisted in this magical childhood world here they devise the circumstances that will permit them to assume responsibility for saving a young daughter an inner child from a suffocating household life. Circumstances of a boring life that perhaps begat the imaginative flight back into childhood in the first place.Eventually we surface back to the level of reality where true to the cyclical rule of selfreferential fiction it all starts again.

	schema:reviewBody "In the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die there are some easy titles to remember and also some titles that mislead or confuse you into what they may be about and this French film had a bit of both and I did watch it from director Jacques Rivette La Belle Noiseuse. Basically Julie Dominique Labourier is reading a book about magic spells and a woman Celine Juliet Berto walks past dropping various possessions and she follows her picking them up and seeing where she goes at one point she loses her but they catch up with each other. Eventually Celine has moved in with Julie and they go out to various places using each other's identities including Celine meeting Julie's childhood sweetheart and Julie filling in for a cabaret audition for Celine. They are also seen separately visiting a quiet and walled off mansion seemingly empty and these visits become repetitive each entering and disappearing for some time one of the times they somehow get a special kind of candy. This candy enables Celine and Julie to transport into the house and an alternative reality seeing the lives of supposedly the house residents and as they suck the sweets and try to solve a mystery concerning the people. Besides seeing all this stuff Celine and Julie relax by going boating on a placid river with young girl Madlyn Nathalie Asnar but by the end of the film you find out that Celine did not leave the bench she was sitting on at the beginning it was all an Alice in Wonderland style dream and Julie does walk past again so she picks up her possessions and presumably it will all happen again. Also starring MarieFrance Pisier as Sophie Barbet Schroeder as Olivier Philippe Clvenot as Guilou and MarieThrse Saussure as Poupie. Lebourier and Berto give interesting performance my only problem with this film is that I had pretty much no idea what was going on it was really confusing it is only afterwards I can see some of the resemblances to Alice in Wonderland and I can't agree with the critics' five stars. But there were certainly moments to catch your eye I would say this is for those who really pay attention to things but it is not a bad experimental supernatural drama. Worth watching in my opinion!".

Lebourier and Berto give interesting performance my only problem with this film is that I had pretty much no idea what was going on it was really confusing it is only afterwards I can see some of the resemblances to Alice in Wonderland and I can't agree with the critics' five stars. But there were certainly moments to catch your eye I would say this is for those who really pay attention to things but it is not a bad experimental supernatural drama. Worth watching in my opinion!";

I knew it was too good to be true. Shortly after the film falls in a series of common places robbing us from the possibility to be surprised engaged or even care. I wonder why it is that we  in Italy I mean  feel the need to visit the past though the same identical paths. To tell you the truth I'm sick and tired of it. Can we tell stories that live out of its own strength. Politics intellectual reflections without any real base on reality. We are known for protesting at a bar table maybe go to a demonstration but at the end of the day we are going to do what we're told. Honestly or dishonestly. Could it be that this relentless film revisions is a tacit way to justify the fact that we've been so ineffectual in real life. We've been through everything and more but nothing has really changed. We're better identified by the Alberto Sordi characters like the one in La Grande Guerra by the great Mario Monicelli. My question is If I as an Italian couldn't care less about the political mismatch of two Italian brothers imagine the rest of the world. How confusing and ultimately annoying way to tell a story. There was a sort of uproar today knowing that this film had not been selected for the official selection at the Cannes Film Fest. Hey come on think again. Why should it be? There is absolutely nothing new in it. Nothing! Riccardo Scamarcio continues to sleep walk through his film roles. He is beautiful but not nearly as magnetic as Elio Germano. I hope we'll wake up soon and realize that we won't change the past by revisiting it. That we are who we are and should look ahead to see what happens.".

	schema:headline " More of the same from Italy's new filmmakers";
	schema:reviewBody "There's this much to be said for this movie from the ranks of Italy's new young directors and actors The quality of the acting was at least one notch above the usual fare which almost never transcends the clichd facial expressions and intonations we expect to find in TV dramas and sitcoms. This new generation of actors and directors was raised on US television imports telefilms and LatinAmerican soaps and it definitely shows in the uninspired and uninspiring quality of their work. And one gets the impression that 90 of them come from Parioli a very welltodo neighborhood of Rome that would be the rough equivalent of coming from Santa Monica Lake Forest IL or Westport Connall those perfectly groomed faces coming from families of the Italian haute bourgeoisie with unlimited funds to advance their children's acting career. If it weren't for Elio Germano as Accio as well as Luca Zingaretti as Accio's fascist mentor and Anna Bonaiuto as his wife this movie would probably fall into the same category of banalized filmmaking with all the rest. But Germano's performance is not enough to salvage a film that fails to rise above a rating of mediocrity . Certainly it was an interesting idea to situate the action in Latina a city built from scratch by Mussolini's fascist regime after it had drained the surrounding swamp land the bonifica that was one of Fascism's highly touted achievements. All of the city's architecture was inspired by fascist monumental design.Regrettably Luchetti has done little of interest to exploit this setting for his family drama other than to bring up the same old clich of opposing extremisms the thuggery of the neofascist right vs. the banditry and targeted terrorism of the extraparliamentary left. And the drama of the conflict between these two extremisms is used altogether too much to drive the plot forward. Some Italian commentators disliked this film because it seemed to go over the same old ground in the same old waywhen it was time presumably to move on to new subjects. But the problem was not that it rehashed Italian historythe problem was the hash. Bellocchio after all did a wonderful job of reinterpreting to Italians the experience of the Red Brigades in his BuongiornoNotte. But here the audience is simply given a choice between fascist hooliganism and a lunatic left when actually the situation in Italy in the 60s and 70s was much more complicated and nuanced. Millions of Italians belonged to parties and movements that were seriously committed to a progressive transformation of Italy that did not involve kneecappings and assassinations. And so Luchetti ends up confirming perhaps despite himself the AmericanBerlusconiano vision of the world Forget about ideologyit's all about individual freedom and authenticity in your personal relationships. And finally we can see the effects of Berlusconi's TV stations and their ilk also in the movie's script. After 20 I stopped counting how many times the characters said Ma Che Cazzo Dici?What the fk are you saying?. It is a measure of the moronization of the Italian public under the sway of Berlusconi and Berlusconian media that the scriptwriters think that they can get a laugh out of an Italian audience with this phrase each and every time it is saidand sadly they're probably right.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's this much to be said for this movie from the ranks of Italy's new young directors and actors The quality of the acting was at least one notch above the usual fare which almost never transcends the clichd facial expressions and intonations we expect to find in TV dramas and sitcoms. This new generation of actors and directors was raised on US television imports telefilms and LatinAmerican soaps and it definitely shows in the uninspired and uninspiring quality of their work. And one gets the impression that 90 of them come from Parioli a very welltodo neighborhood of Rome that would be the rough equivalent of coming from Santa Monica Lake Forest IL or Westport Connall those perfectly groomed faces coming from families of the Italian haute bourgeoisie with unlimited funds to advance their children's acting career.

	schema:reviewBody "MY BROTHER IS AN ONLY CHILD 'Mio fratello  figlio unico' is a title that may confuse the casual movie viewer but it is an apt summation of the rigorous story that this excellent Italian film by Danielle Luchetti adapted from a novel by Antonio Pennacchi represents  the coming of age of two brothers in the confusing and turbulent 1960's and 1970's in Italy. While the film deals with the myriad political factions that disrupted life especially among the students of that era the main focus of the story is the indomitable brotherly love that bonds the two main characters. Accio Benano Vittorrio Emanuele Popizo as a child is a mischief maker who has entered seminary to become a priest but his innate search for truth and meaning soon finds him returning home to his little family in a Mussolinifabricated town called Latina a village built on promises of communal wellbeing a housing project was built but the poor villagers are refused access to it but languishes in the poverty of lost hopes and deflated spirits. Accio's father mother younger sister and older brother Manrico Riccardo Scamarcio are making ends meet but are frustrated with the political oppression of the working class. Time passes and the older Accio Elio Germano comes under the influence of Mussolini's 'idealism' with the tutelage of his older friend Mario Luca Zingaretti and embraces Fascism while Manrico has aligned with the communists and it is this dichotomy of belief that sets Accio apart from his brother as well as his family who are communist sympathizers. Accio's personality places him in harms way with the law with women he has longings for the women in both Mario's and Manrico's lives and ultimately with turns of events that threaten to pit brother against brother. The resolution of these conflicts makes for a fascinating study of familial ties brotherly love and a keenly observed sociopolitical history of Italy that is as enlightening as it is entertaining. While Germano and Scamarcio are the obvious stars of this well acted film the supporting cast including such fine actors as Angela Finocchiaro Massimo Popolizio Alba Rohrwacher Anna Bonaiuto and Diane Fleri is uniformly strong. This epic film demands full attention to the script Italian with English subtitles to follow the various political differences but the tenor of the film is one of the excitement and concomitant love of two brothers coming of age in the best Italian style! It is a joy to watch and a lesson in history about which we should all be aware. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Good Italian movies are few and far between  the last I saw was Zefferelli's Tea with Mussolini and before that Life Is Beautiful. It seems that Italian movies good or bad are rare. If the list in Wikipedia is anything to go by Italy produces about ten to fifteen features a year far less than Australia.This one is about growing up in a postMussolini postwar world as a working class Italian. The narrator Accio Elio Germano bright but temperamental is not the most pleasant of people his name means bully. At 13 he is sent off to a seminary by his longsuffering and pious parents but even though it's a fairly humane regime he doesn't last long. So it's back to the family's tiny crumbling flat to grow up with his older brother Manrico Riccardo Scarmarcio. Rejecting religion Accio comes into the orbit of the local fascists though he is more interested in action than ideology. The handsome charming Manrico becomes a communist and beds Francesca Diane Fleri an attractive middle class girl who has joined the comrades. Naturally Accio gets interested in Francesca as well.The story covers the period 1962 to 1968 and plenty of reference is made to the turmoil of the times but basically it is about a textbook case of sibling rivalry. Acco and Manrico cannot keep their hands off each other  in order to fight that is. Acco however does manage to reach some sort of maturity at the end.The story moves along at a good pace and there are plenty of funny scenes. The best one is the occupation by the communist students during the 1968 disturbances of the Rome conservatory where they perform Beethoven's Ode to Joy with the words changed to communist slogans and are then invaded by the fascists crying Don't mess with Beethoven actually the original words were from a poem by Schiller. The switch of actors Vittorio Propizio plays the younger Accio is accomplished in a particularly neat fashion using a method I last saw used in Conan the Barbarian where the older actor is substituted in midscene.In the background is Mussolini's legacy an angry confused and humiliated nation without a clear sense of direction. His 1930's new towns like Latina on the Pontine marches jerrybuilt and badly designed were crumbling already by the 1960s. Replacement housing had been built but corrupt local officials were holding up its allocation. There is a very satisfying moment at the end of the film when Accio no stranger to causing a ruckus takes remedial action.Not being Italian I probably missed a lot but the film held my attention for its full length despite Accio not being a particularly nice lad then neither was Genghis Khan and he had an interesting life. The film is bright fresh and fastmoving though I'm not sure about the climax which is rather on the melodramatic side. If the Italians can bring themselves to make more movies of this quality I'll come along to watch.".

Accio Benano the rebellious younger one who drops out of seminary very quickly gives in to the constant indoctrination of a much older bus driver pal named Mario Luca Zingaretti and joins the fascist party. Then he falls in love with Francesca Diane Fleri the girlfriend the first of a series of his Lothario older brother Manrico blueeyed dreamboat Riccardo Scamarcio. Manrico becomes a leftist leader in '68 and moves on to terrorist activities in the Seventies. Accio's blackshirt cohorts cause their share of bother too of course but they are depicted as both inept and betraying Accio's confidence. Eventually the latter realizes he's a leftist too at heart. He only adopted fascism because he wanted to be contrary. This change in Accio comes almost in time to save Manrico from big trouble.It took me a while to adjust to the shift in actors when Accio goes from early to late teens. No doubt Elio Germano was an inevitable choice for the older Accio because of his sweet ironic presence he's a lovely actor. But the younger actor Vittorio Emanuele Propizio and the incidents Accio's involved in early on project a spirit of fun and craziness that I missed thereafter. In fact the promise of the early sequences gets dissipated in what becomes an increasingly plodding and overly telescoped series of events as Accio's and Manrico's politics love lives and family involvements crisscross over the years.Reports from those who've read Antonio Pennacchi's amusingly titled novel 'Il fasciocommunista' say the movie lightens things up but Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli who collaborated on the screen adaptation seem to have gotten bogged down and too literally followed the story after those lighthearted and promising beginnings. Mind you Petraglia and Rulli are no slouches they also scripted the recent 'Criminal Romance' veteran actor Michele Placido's 2005 directorial debut which also features Scamarcio as well as the highly successful theatrically released TV miniseries 'The Best of Youth' whose decadesweeping plot this film's somewhat echoes.A memorable set piece shows Manrico introducing a '68 reworking of Beethovan's 'Ode to Joy' with revolutionary lyrics. During the performance Mario's fascist hooligans move in and their targeting his own brother leads to Accio's final break with the right.The family's base is Latina a town created by Mussolini south of Rome which makes an everpresent reminder of heavy Italian legacies. Mario represents the element who refuse to erase or forget the nation's fascist past. He argues among other things that there's a worthwhile legacy of architecture. Indeed fascist architecture does have a certain kitsch charm one ought not reject too easily and an inability to come to terms with the fascist past is surely one of the main reasons for Italy's muddled selfimage. This story is a stab at dealing with that psychological issue in a healthy way.'My Brother Is an Only Child' which was rejected by the Cannes jury for Official Entry status lacks the fluidity of Gabriele Muccino's 'Io come te nessuno mai' which though very different comes to mind for its blending of coming of age family conflict and politics but it has a kind of vernacular vigor. It's true Italian cinema continues to go through a largely lackluster period and Italian filmgoers appear to have been bitterly disappointed with Luchetti's latest. That's a bit of a shame because there is a lot of charm and humanity here and for anyone interested in Italy and its modern history this should be required viewing.Seen during a limited run in Paris October 17 2007.".

I particularly liked Accio's description of personal relationships between the brothers as well as the intriguing political evolution. I thinks that Scamarcio's presence could also take a younger audience to this movie something which would be very good as some stories are just worth remembering I can't stand the let's forget about it and move on towards modernity approach awfully dangerous for a civilized society. Back to the cinema factor all actors fit well in their roles although the Accio's sister was kind of lame at times. Zingaretti's performance as a hardcore fascist on the other hand was made even more intriguing by his close association with the everdifferent character of Commissario Montalbano in the popular TV transpositions of Camilleri's novels which by the way I strongly recommend to anyone interested in Italian written fiction.".

	schema:headline " Good Italian 1960's coming of age story";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last month at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. This is a good offering from Italy and directorwriter Daniele Luchetti who cowrote the screenplay with Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli based on the semiautobiographical novel Il Fasciocmunista by Antonio Pennacchi. The story takes us from 1962 to around 1977 and as it begins we follow Accio Benano Vittorrio Emanuele Popizo who is a scrappy little mischiefmaker who loves to fight and ends up in a seminary to study for the priesthood. This falls through and he returns home to his mother and father and older sister and brother. They live in a small town that was created by WWII era fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The family home and most others in town are falling apart and the community awaits long promised new government housing from the current series of governments but the housing that is already constructed sits unoccupied. The older Accio Elio Germano has grown into an even more mischievous and rebellious young man and through his friendship with Mario Luca Zingaretti a Mussalini sympathizer who longs for the old days he joins the local Fascist party. This is in direct contrast to his family who are communist sympathizers and Accio older charismatic and handsome brother Manrico Riccardo Scamarcio has joined the local communist party and is involved in organizing workers at the factory where he works. Accio has an eye for Manrico's girlfriend Francesca Diane Fleri and Mario's wife Bella Anna Bonaiuto has a Mrs. Robinson kind of attraction to Accio. This is a drama with plenty of smart comedy. An excellent cast and director Luchetti get the most out of them. It's a simple story that never bogs down and keeps moving with good dialog interesting situations. I would give this an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the groundbreaking Best of Youth My Brother is an Only Child Mio fratello  figlio unico covers a key period of political turmoil in Italian history seen in a relatable context from the perspective of an ordinary family. Daniele Luchetti enlists the screenwriters of the earlier successful TV miniseries Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli and manages to bring the same sense of passion and urgency to Antonio Pennacchio's original novel and the autobiographical elements that inspired it.My Brother is an Only Child covers a more condensed period of political turmoil from 1962 to 1977 that had an intense impact on a generation not only in Italy but in many parts of Europe and the USA. There's something about the Italian experience however that manages to bring the swirl of forces at work into even greater focus particularly in the way that they impact on the Benassi family living significantly in the recently built town of Latina founded by Mussolini in the fascist style. Developed entirely in eight weeks the cracks however are now beginning to show.The times they are achanging and the former adherence to authority  mainly religious in the Benassi family  is being challenged by their two sons Accio and Manrico. The older brother Manrico has already developed leftwing revolutionary tendencies and it doesn't take more than a revealing photo of actress Marisa Allasio to cause a crisis of faith in his younger brother Accio who has gone into a seminary in 1962. Accio however also has a crisis of faith in the Communism following the Cuban missile crisis and turns instead to Fascism recognising or believing that the ideals and achievements of Il Duce weren't all bad.That's quite an ideological split in the Benassi family and it's compounded by the fact that they are quite a bunch of headstrong hotheads. Particularly the young Accio who is still thrashing around for something to believe in leading him down some very dark alleys but Manrico also takes his activism to extremes. As dissatisfaction spills over onto the streets in the late sixties in mob violence this results in some pronounced family tensions but there are also romantic complications that reflect the film's treatment of the theme of loss of innocence.Daniele Luchetti's pacy direction holds the wide dynamic of the film together well getting right to the heart of the Italian passions and its fervour for life. Avoiding any kind of artificial 60s70s period recreation of the kind seen for example in Bertolucci's The Dreamers and eliciting engaging performances from a young cast My Brother is an Only Child has a wonderful naturalistic freshness and immediacy that speaks about love and youth about ideals and disillusionment that speaks about life rather than making any political points specific only to Italy.".

Everyone seemed to have fixed ideas which they discussed violently. We laughed at the communist 'let everyone state their views' meeting. These days condominium meetings are exactly like that. 2 Italians meet and you get two political parties! The film may not be the best one ever but even the scratchy quality of the film reminded us of that era.

This revealed a porn section I did not even know existed and is very interesting definitely confirming your site once again as the best in its class.However firstly this title is as porn as many movies seen in any alternative film festival in the past 7 or 8 years. Secondly what's with the voting? When I first opened this title a week ago to see your site's view to compare with the very positive view in the local conservative newspapers which nevertheless revere anything with the v. Trier name and the glossy attractive entry in the Mix Brazil catalog I was shocked to see that all 18 votes were 1!Now how can this happen? I thought this site had some filtering system to avoid one or two people having 18 or 20 votes certified votes calculated. That two even one user can have 20 accounts I don't doubt that. But I thought there was a control by computer address or cookies for this type of abuse. Also what sicko would vote a 1 18 times for a socalled porno flick and then not even submit a comment using one of his aliases? Has he no desire to justify it since he's spent his time voting 18 times for the same film. Well if this is the case this guy is sick anyhow. Go figure how his mind works.The other remote hypothesis is that maybe there were 18 very dissatisfied users since this film is not a porn flick at all again it is not even in the top 5 or 6 most graphic sex scenes in recent serious and straight festivals I've attended. And it is GAY possibly causing a backlash by straight porn addicts.Anyway DON'T be misled. I will not give this film a slanted review I'll just state facts. This though they may not be read after the initial 18 or 20 one ratings cause a potential viewer to rapidly close the page especially after having to pass the porn hurdle and ask the site to upgrade your preferences to those of a porn viewer.The film is a video but shown theatrically at many festivals. Here alone close to a dozen times at a total of 3 large cities. It consists of 6 scenes depicting 6 worlds 6 desires. Lars v. Trier's prestigious production company presents a new world of male gods or men as gods. These new male gods seek to redefine the ancient sex gods found in Greek mythology Roman orgies more recent bondage and domination legends and so on. SEE FOR YOURSELF WHAT YOU THINK OF IT! You're unlikely to find this title in a PORN SHOP though you ARE likely to see it at a film festival with rigorous selection processes as I happened to find it.".

Sort of a postmodern overview of homosexual iconography throughout the 20th century it presents viewers with six vignettes of varying intensity tied together by American writerpoet Ron Athey an impressive one man collection of body art who also supplies a brief solo scene while voicing his longing for a distant lover straight out of Jean Genet.Influences include Greek mythology as represented in PINK NARCISSUS Kristen Bjorn's ecological rain forest romps SMtinged beat poetry Tom of Finland's swaggering machos David Hockney's swimming pools and Greek orgies. All of these scenes are shown against semiabstract videogenerated backgrounds appropriate to the theme. This means that the film ends up having both a unifying style and a lack of visual variety. Save for Athey and bodybuilder Billy Herrington a former Colt model and therefore already an icon in his own right models are Scandinavian unfamiliar to fans and sadly somewhat interchangeable as none of them are given voices. They simply strut their stuff to a thumping techno beat. Director Knud Vesterskov a Danish underground filmmaker with titles like A MOTHERLY PEEPSHOW and URBAN DISSONANCE on his record who previously helmed Zentropa's maiden porn effort CONSTANCE keeps a cool distance throughout scrutinizing his cast as bizarre anthropological artifacts rather than living and breathing human beings making this perhaps more of a performance art installation for the jaded hipster crowd rather than a really hot gay porno flick. The initial fascination generated by this approach wears decidedly thin over a 95 minute running time. Predictably only the American performers manage to break through these barriers that separate the audience from the spectacle. Herrington's exaggerated pumpedup physique makes him the pictureperfect Master in an elaborate and relatively extreme domination sequence with two slender slaves the movie's undisputed erotic highlight and I'm sure we could all have done with a lot more of the amazing Athey whose deep droning voice adds further authority to his already imposing appearance. As it currently stands HOTMEN COOLBOYZ is a movie best taken one segment at a time to avoid sensory overload or viewed with the bemused pretentious posing of an art critic at an exhibition's opening night. Disregarding publicity hype to the contrary this film is not on a par with truly groundbreaking gay pornographic films of the '70s when directors like Jack Deveau LEFTHANDED Peter De Rome DESTROYING ANGEL and Fred Halsted L.A. PLAYS ITSELF explored and exposed a community they were part of. Vesterskov remains determinedly outside looking in on a scene he gives little evidence of understanding.".

His performance of the famous Friends Romans countrymen speech is a marvel of clarity and is the linchpin that makes all of the other action of the play make sense.James Mason is I think perfect as Brutus. He is very much like Shakespeare's Hamlet  mulling over every possible facet of every problem he faces and agonizing to reach a decision. He was a master at portraying a person's ability or inability to reach a painful decision. The awesomeness of his responsibility and the consequences of his actions after all they are plotting to kill a king are beautifully shown in his performance.John Gielgud is my favorite Shakepearean actor. If you had ever had the privilege of seeing him on stage you would have gotten the full force of his ability to control the character the language and to reach out and hold the audience all at the same time. It doesn't quite come across in this film but I still think he shows that underneath Cassius' treason there is definitely an element of selfdoubt and possibly shame at what he is about to do.I have to disagree with most of the comments about Louis Calhern's Caesar. Several people have said that he didn't capture the majesty and military bearing that Julius Caesar would have had but we have to remember that Shakespeare intended this as drama not history. The whole point of the Roman senators' wish to get rid of Caesar is that he is no longer the Caesar they remember he has become a smug selfsatisfied politician who thinks he is a king while Rome is still a republic. I think Calhern captures this smarmy oily arrogant quality very well. Rome wanted a general and this Caesar gave them a highpriced car salesman.I own a copy of this film and I watch it often. I think it would serve perfectly as an introduction to Shakespeare. By the way I remember an anecdote related in the memoirs of John Houseman the producer of this film. He said someone of importance in British theater I now forget who  possibly it was Geilgud had observed Brando's performance in the making of the film and asked him to come to London to star in a Shakespeare festival. Brando said sorry I can't. I have to get back to Nebraska to help my father get the crop in. Imagine if he had said yes.".

	schema:reviewBody "50 years after the fact the most interesting angle on Mankiewicz' 'Julius Caesar' is perhaps the blend of acting styles that characterizes it. With Mankiewicz dialogue is all and it is a source of endless fascination to me how he manages to make this a uniformly brilliantly acted film.Mankiewicz doesn't strive to open up the play and make it naturalistic but he does allow his camera to roam freely creating space around his characters. But it is in his directing of the actors that he excels the way that he shows the fragile dynamics in the crowd of conspirators before and after their stabbing of Caesar even more than in the famous monologues. Will history frown upon them? Or applaud their act? That we shall die we know all else is uncertain.Of course the key scene of the film and Shakespeare's play takes place right after Caesar's assassination. The rabble has gathered at the Capitol to hear Brutus explain himself and James Mason in a refreshingly unactorish way beautifully defends Brutus the wellintentioned butcher laying bare the dilemma of the noble assassin. It was not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more and he sways the crowd with his rhetoric.Then Brando takes the floor speaking up for his benefactor the slain Caesar Friend Romans and countrymen lend me your ear he says having carried the bloodied corpse out in his arms. His speech gradually builds in momentum and the sheer excitement of watching Brando's performance today is reason enough to watch the film. How elegantly deftly he speaks treason against Brutus and the new wouldbe rulers. They are honourable men he says and the discrete colouring of the adjective makes it obvious how Mark Anthony really feels about it. If you have tears prepare to shed them now indeed. There are layers in Brando's performance that warrants more than one viewing just the tolerant halfsmile when he is playing the rabble for suckers. Ah how you weep. His unfathomable halfsmile turns up again near the end and it speaks volumes.Of course John Gielgud as Cassius is volatile and very rooted in the British thespian tradition which doesn't lend itself easily to film in my opinion. Film actor Edmond O'Brien is great as the ambitious and untrustworthy Casca but unfortunately the women have little to do. Brutus' wife Portia is played by Deborah Kerr who never looked more stunning than here and she delivers her few lines with conviction. Greer Garson is Caesar's wife warning him against making an appearance at the Capitol on the fateful day but she is hardly given any screentime.The film is not the last word in Shakespeare in any sense of the word but it is entertaining and true to what it sets out to do. And the acting styles blend together wonderfully.".

It all stayed very natural and believable. Of course there must be historical inaccuracies in this story but was Braveheart so accurate. I think when you start watching a movie written by the Shakespeare you shouldn't expect a documentary on the life of Julius Caesar but a lyrical tale about ancient political Rome.The photography was great with its glorious Black and White footage.Although the text can be offputting for some who are not at the least a bit interested in the language the Bard wrote in.A must for Shakespeare fans.810".

The director truly made his vision come to life!All the actors were great again kudos to the director. Marlon Brando was just superb as Antony. His funeral oration was an indescribable masterpiece. I didn't expect it to be that good! Among the othersJames Mason did quite a good job as Brutus. Louis Calhern though had a small bit didn't fail to leave an impact as the great and mighty and ambitious Julius Caesar. I also liked Greer Garson as Calpurnia.Coming to the actors Octavius Caesar was a disappointment I blame the editor of the script for this. Octavius was supposed to be brought out as the heir of Ceasar. The prevalence of Caesarism which was not properly brought out in the movie.The dialog is picked up directly from the play but quite a bit has been cut off.....which was the only other disappointing thing in the movie. Shakespearean language is not all that difficult to understand in the movie mainly because we can see it being enacted out. All that you simply fail to understand is simply not all that important.Overall the movie was great and I will not forget to watch it a day before my tests! Julius Caesar was a great feat in the history of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "1953's JULIUS CAESAR was a milestone in it's time and still is perhaps the finest American production of a Shakespeare play ever recorded on film. Until Joseph L. Mankiewicz's production only Laurence Olivier's British versions of HAMLET and HENRY V had truly displayed the power and poetry of the Bard's work. Hollywood seemed content to either truncate it in miscast allstar extravaganzas A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and ROMEO AND JULIET or turn it into a weird kind of carnival sideshow Orson Welles' MACBETH performed with incomprehensible Scottish accents. Perhaps American film makers were afraid audiences would be put off by Shakespeare's text with its archaic words or felt that a British cast and the confines of a stage were 'required' to do a 'proper' rendition. For whatever reason the British seemed to have a 'lock' on filmed versions of the Bard.But Mankiewicz understood that Shakespeare was both universal and timeless and in his capacity of director and uncredited screenwriter he 'opened up' JULIUS CAESAR eliminating the 'studio' feel of key scenes and with producer John Houseman gathered together an impressive array of talent with British actors John Gielgud as Cassius James Mason as Brutus Greer Garson as Calpurnia and Deborah Kerr as Portia and stagetrained American actors such as Oscar winner Edmond O'Brien in supporting roles.Where the greatest gamble and payoff came was in the casting of Marlon Brando as Marc Antony. While Brando was already being hailed as the finest American actor of his generation there were critics prior to the film's release who called his acceptance of the role an ego trip and expected him to fall on his face. Were they ever WRONG! Brando gave the role a power a physicality and charisma that stunned critics and audiences alike. With a flawless British accent he easily held his own with the veteran cast and displayed a magnetism that is still enthralling over 50 years later. His performance became the keystone of the film's success.Not that JULIUS CAESAR is without faults it is occasionally stagy and artificial the pacing is a bit too slow and deliberate at times and as the title character Louis Calhern is woefully miscast he looks and sounds more like a jaded grandfather than the charismatic despot who both enthralled and frightened the Roman world. Still the film is so strong and dynamic that subsequent versions such as Charlton Heston's ambitious 1970 production pale in comparison.Hollywood finally got it 'right' and we can be grateful that a truly unforgettable presentation of JULIUS CAESAR is available for us and future generations to enjoy!".

For whatever reason the British seemed to have a 'lock' on filmed versions of the Bard.But Mankiewicz understood that Shakespeare was both universal and timeless and in his capacity of director and uncredited screenwriter he 'opened up' JULIUS CAESAR eliminating the 'studio' feel of key scenes and with producer John Houseman gathered together an impressive array of talent with British actors John Gielgud as Cassius James Mason as Brutus Greer Garson as Calpurnia and Deborah Kerr as Portia and stagetrained American actors such as Oscar winner Edmond O'Brien in supporting roles.Where the greatest gamble and payoff came was in the casting of Marlon Brando as Marc Antony. While Brando was already being hailed as the finest American actor of his generation there were critics prior to the film's release who called his acceptance of the role an ego trip and expected him to fall on his face. Were they ever WRONG! Brando gave the role a power a physicality and charisma that stunned critics and audiences alike. With a flawless British accent he easily held his own with the veteran cast and displayed a magnetism that is still enthralling over 50 years later. His performance became the keystone of the film's success.Not that JULIUS CAESAR is without faults it is occasionally stagy and artificial the pacing is a bit too slow and deliberate at times and as the title character Louis Calhern is woefully miscast he looks and sounds more like a jaded grandfather than the charismatic despot who both enthralled and frightened the Roman world. Still the film is so strong and dynamic that subsequent versions such as Charlton Heston's ambitious 1970 production pale in comparison.Hollywood finally got it 'right' and we can be grateful that a truly unforgettable presentation of JULIUS CAESAR is available for us and future generations to enjoy!";

It goes along with the events very accurately and if you've read Shakespeare's book you'll see it's like having the very thing acted out on screen. I also might add that the acting is excellent especially Gielgud who was my personal favorite. However all the actors were wonderful from Ceasar to Lucius. Even the battle scene reminded me a bit of some of the scenes in Spartacus...There's just something about this movie that is very appealing. The powerful and sometimes funny Cassius is the most captivating character. A lot of the times I could just feel his anger Brutus of course is a very melancholy character but for him I didn't feel as much as I did for some of the others. Marc Antony was superb and his presentation of near insanity Okay so he's crazy! that builds up throughout the movie is breathtaking.You must read the book or else you probably won't be able to follow this movie. Really all you need to do is go through it with someone who knows how to translate it into easier terms and then it's like learning a language and you'll know exactly what the people are talking about and feel very smart!

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people don't like Shakespeare much. Maybe they're intimidated by the language or the complicated plots. It's understandable. The Bard came up with some real clunkers Comedy of Errors Love's Labour Lost. And it's hard to read the plays in the raw because you're liable to understand one word out of every three and lose most of the topical references. If anybody's going to read the things they ought to use the Signet paperbacks that have footnotes on every page explaining the more arcane content. But good performances of the better plays are different and this is a good performance of a better play. The dialog itself is sometimes lifted wholesale from Plutarch's Lives... but WS put them together well. Caesar is full of lines that have entered our everyday vocabularies even if often corrupted. Beware the Ides of March. The fault dear Brutus lies not in the stars but in ourselves. The coward dies a thousand deaths the valiant die but once. Et tu Brute? The most unkindest cut of all. It was all Greek to me. And fanfare here please the unforgettable Friends Romans countrymen  lend me your money. No that can't be right. Well it will come to me. Reminds me of the story of the woman who left a performance of Hamlet unimpressed saying I don't know what's supposed to be so good about it. It's all made up of old quotations.At that this version of Julius Caesar is chopped down a bit to make it shorter and eliminate some redundancies and other infelicities. In the play Brutus hears the clocks chime whereas all the Romans had for clocks were water wheels. And Brutus is twice told of his wife Portia's death and each time reacts with surprise and Stoicism. He really WAS a stoic which is a nice philosophy if you can actually make yourself believe it. The performances are uniformly delightful for one reason or another. John Guilgud of course is superb born for the part of Cassius. I don't care if his voice DOES throb. In fact all the UK actors come across as fitting the roles very comfortably. Something about those impressive Brit accents. Even Greer Garson who hams it up shamelessly as Calpurnia is no more than slightly embarrassing. What makes this film such a fascinating experience aside from the seductive poetry is that the cast list is filled with people from the MGM stable whom we would never associate with Shakespeare. Okay George MacReady is there but he always sounded vaguely British anyway. But Edmund O'Brien bringing his workingclass New York accent to the role of Casca? And doing a good job too? Tom Powers as one of the assassins? He's the old grouch who got murdered in Double Indemnity. And the Senator who talks Caesar into going forth and then stabs him? He played in a Twilight Zone episode Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up? He was the Martian with THREE ARMS. Yet he's good too. And the guy who acts as Mark Antony's messenger to the assassins? He's the stupid hillbilly from Tennessee who helps snare Robert Ryan in Crossfire. Even Ned Glass is in here as a cobbler. And Michael Pate and Michael Ansara who played gangsters or Indians. Brando is in a league of his own. His Brit accent comes and goes but he's never less than wily and impressive as opposed to James Mason's rational and honorable Brutus. The key to the plot lies in Mason's and Brando's speeches to the crowd after the murder. Mason is apologetic logical. Brando on the other hand is a really phony and manipulative SOB. What a rabble rouser. He fakes tears appeals to the mob's greed instead of their brains and every time he refers to Brutus as an honorable man his voice grows more sarcastic and angry. At one point he turns away from the mob and smiles slightly pleased at his own villainy. What an admirable piece of work although it's not perfect. There are times when Brando should be humble and a little scared but he still comes across as sullen and angry as if he were Stanley Kowalski forcing himself to endure Stella's insults at the dinner table.It's well mounted too on stylized sets not pretending to much realism. If they did it today it would cost four hundred billion dollars. This is probably one of the two or three easiest and bestpaced versions of a Shakespeare play I've ever seen and the one I enjoy the most. Yeah it's a curiosity Douglas Dumbrille the blackhatted Western villain in Julius Caesar? but it's gripping and it's a grownup story in the sense that nobody is truly evil or entirely good. I can no longer bring myself to watch the tragic climax. This isn't on TV very often but if you have a chance do catch it. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Beware the Ides of March Caesar.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well the Ides of March has come to General Julius Caesar Louis Calhern in Joseph Mankiewicz's 1953 film version of William Shakespeare's play based on the real life Roman figure. The movie is the story of how Julius Caesar met his fate with the Senators whom fears the worst can come to Rome as his dictatorship come into play. Brutus James Mason is a man stuck in the middle between his beliefs of being loyal to Caesar and the peer pressures of the Senators lead by Cassius John Gielgud whom wants to get rid of Caesar. Brutus emerges as the most complex character in the film and is also the play's tragic hero. In his soliloquies the audience gains insight into the complexities of his motives. He is a powerful public figure but he appears also as a husband a master to his servants a dignified military leader and a loving friend. Brutus's rigid idealism is both his greatest virtue and his biggest flaw. Public Self versus Private Self term plays in Brutus's mindset. Much of the play's tragedy stems from the characters' neglect of private feelings and loyalties in favor of what they believe to be the public good. Similarly characters confuse their private selves with their public selves hardening and dehumanizing themselves or transforming themselves into ruthless political machines. He wants to do what is good for the people but questions himself if it means getting rid of the man that help him on the way to power. John Gielgud is magnificent as Cassius and James Mason is a fine Brutus. But Marlon Brando more than anyone or anything else compels attention. Brando's casting was met with some skepticism when it was announced as he had acquired the nickname of The Mumbler following his performance in A Streetcar Named Desire 1951 but he prove them wrong with his role as Mark Antony. Just watch his two speeches. One is the 'Cry Havoc! Let slip the dogs of War' and the other is the speech to the public. Brando had little or no experience with verse and there are points in this speech where more such experience would have served him well. But his fierce passion transcends all that. Brando's passion surpasses any rules he misses with this piece this is the type of acting that can excuse the rules of Shakespeare. He is so alive and real you know he created some great circumstances to get through those lines! Antony's rhetoric and delivery is over 9000. Now I see why Marlon Brando was legendary. He is a powerful speaker. There are certain things that the film does do right. Julius Caesar gives detailed consideration to the relationship between rhetoric and power. The ability to make things happen by words alone is the most powerful type of authority. Words also serve to move hearts and minds as Act III proofs. The movie is powerful but it's does have faults. One of the biggest things I wish the movie had was color rather than black and white. It's not like they couldn't do it at the time as many movies were in color. Don't get me wrong I like Black and white movies but this movie has an epic Roman Era theme that could have work better than Director Henry Koster's Biblical swordandsandal epic The Robe that also came out that year. The Roman Empire in this film seem lost in black and white with its bland look. Technicolor could have the sets props and costumes and production values would have been shown off to much greater advantage in color like its predecessor Quo Vadis 1951. The movie also suffers from a lot of misinterpretations and misreadings that confused the audience with its text. It's really hard to understand what they are saying if one does not read a lot of Shakespeare. Shakespeare did this on purpose so that confused the characters in the story speaking to each other but also cause a lot of people to shake their heads wondering what does he mean with that? At less in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar it manage to avoid any cheap good or evil scheme like in Richard III but does justice to all the characters and their motives. I would give it a watch for any Shakespeare fan but it's not for everybody. Movies like this are acquired taste. No way was it better than Orson Welles's Macbeth but it's still a great watch.".

	schema:headline " MGM Does Shakespeare";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an admirable attempt by MGM to do Shakespeare. The studio cast a range of great actors to fill the roles and the result is generally very agreeable. Great production values set design and costuming set off a quite fine Shakespeare production.The film is probably most memorable to today's audiences because it features Marlon Brando in a rather atypical role. Proving his astounding acting talent Brando mastered the language of the Bard and is truly excellent as Marc Antony. Yet James Mason as the quiet thoughtful Brutus is even better. Mason's subtely and underplaying perhaps makes audiences forget how great he truly was. As someone one said he could suggest a whole range of emotions in his relatively passive calm face. Mason is a brilliant Brutus and it is a performance that ranks amongst his best.John Gielgud brings his classical English stage training to Cassius and Gielgud is as fine as ever. Louis Calhern at first seems an unusual choice for Julius Caesar yet he brings a great sense of dignity to his role. Edmond O'Brien shows what a great actor he really was in playing Casca and although Greer Garson and Deborah Kerr are wasted in subordinate roles they are a welcome presence. I also liked George Macready as Marullus. Macready's sinister Ballin Mundson from GILDA is forever burned into my brain and he is again memorable here.Overall I liked the film Mankiewicz was a very able director and he handles Shakespeare well. The only problems I have with it is although the MGM sound stage looks as fantastic as ever it is perhaps too glossy. It also very moves slowly and I think part of the blame lies in Shakespeare's play itself. JULIUS CAESAR is not a perfect play and it does have one big flaw it loses dramatic tension after Marc Antony's big speech. So I think many of the film's faults are attributed to MGM and Mankiewicz trying to film the play verbatim. Unlike the Olivier films the play here is not really adapted for the film medium different from the stage and a few different techniques could have been used to bring the themes across. Nevertheless its still very worthwhile.".

	schema:headline " The Fickle Finger of Public Opinion";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always thought that Bill Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar as a kind of contrast between the society he lived in and the Roman society of Julius Caesar and his contemporaries. With all their problems Elizabethan England was struggling to be a society of laws and not men. Julius Caesar is the story of the death of a tyrant a benevolent tyrant to be sure in some eyes but a tyrant nonetheless. And Caesar was a tyrant with several good virtues in his character.But the society he got to the top in involved him creating a private army and coming out on top of a bunch of other guys. Actually George MacReady sets the tone for the play in his minor role of Marullus. The play opens with the populace of Rome hailing the return of the all wise and beneficent Caesar. MacReady reminds them that at one time they had hailed Caesar's last rival Pompey in just such a fashion. Public opinion is indeed fickle back then as well as today.Caesar played by Louis Calhern is back in triumph but there's a group of conspirators who have a variety of motives for wanting him dead. Chiefly they include John Gielgud as Cassius Edmond O'Brien as Casca and James Mason as Caesar's trusted aide Marcus Brutus. They plot to kill Caesar in the Senate on the infamous Ides of March.The deed having been done the conspirators have to deal with public opinion of the Roman citizenry. We don't have any courts as we know them or as they even knew them in Elizabethan England to deal with these people. They bid for the favor of the mob as does Mark Antony another of Caesar's trusted aides. Of course with that famous 'Friends Romans Countrymen' introduction it is Antony who sways the populace.Marlon Brando got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and this is a different Marlon Brando. He's talking in a clear and concise English which you could hear at the Old Vic instead of from the scratch and mumble school of acting. Our man Brando was one versatile dude. Antony is so much different a part than either Stanley Kowalski or Don Vito Corleone. Brando got the only nomination in the acting category but my favorite in this production has always been James Mason. He's moved by a genuine concern for the fate of the Roman Republic with Caesar being granted this dictatorial power. He's a worldly sophisticated sort and I think he borrowed a bit from Leo Genn in Quo Vadis and Mason reprised a bit of the Brutus character in The Fall of the Roman Empire as Timonides. It's a consummate portrait Mason should have gotten Oscar consideration as well.I don't have any information to prove it but I would bet that after the fall of Cromwell's Lord Protectorate with Oliver Cromwell as a 17th century would be Caesar this play was very popular during Restoration Great Britain. I have no doubt the Stuarts wanted to drive home the message of the evils of military dictatorships. And of course the theater was forbidden during the Puritan rule there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film exploring the life and death of larger than life Julius Caesar wastes no time engaging the audience. With Louis Calhern in the titular role and Marlon Brando as his faithful friend Mark Antony the film goes into great detail about what gets Caesar killed by associates of his and even greater detail of the thirst for power after his death. Julius Caesar the film goes down a dark road proving Nietzsche's Will to Power lives within even the most trusted of our allies. Caesar is enjoying more praise than ever when he returns to Rome after defeating Pompey. During a victory celebration Caesar attends with his most trusted allies Cassius John Gielgud and Brutus James Mason he is warned by a Soothsayer to beware the Ides of March. Caesar ignores the warning and goes about the celebration unknowing that conversations are taking place regarding his rise to power. They believe Caesar to be untrustworthy and think he will become a tyrant. Fueled by lies and anger a plot is masterminded to murder Caesar. On the 15th day of March Caesar prepares to go to the senate his wife Calpurnia Greer Garson begs him not to go due to a vivid dream she had in which Caesar was murdered. Caesar scoffs and goes anyway being warned by another Soothsayer along the way. Ignoring this second warning Caesar makes his way to the senate where the conspirators circle him and begin to stab him one by one. Upon seeing his dear friend Brutus among the murderers Caesar succumbs to his wounds and dies. Mark Antony Marlon Brando who was led away from Caesar on the fateful day under false pretenses joins with Caesar's adopted son and successor Octavius Douglass Watson to avenge his death. They achieve their goal with Cassius and Titinius John Parrish being killed in the war that ensues leaving only Brutus left alive of the conspirators. Seeing death as inevitable Brutus kills himself and is pardoned by Octavius as acting in what he believed to be the best course of action for Rome. Audiences are immediately engaged in the film from the very beginning. A gripping speech in the opening scene catapults the audience to ancient Rome bringing it alive through the production design mimicking Roman architecture and language. For one Caesar dies at almost exactly halfway through the film. I personally love a movie that will throw the audience for a loop by killing off its main character. Of course being familiar with the play Julius Caesar I knew he would be killed but I did not know he would be killed so early on leaving half the film to deal with the aftermath of his murder. Likewise Marlon Brando's Mark Antony was hardly in the first half of the movie being a fan of Brando's I was initially disappointed about this however he more than makes up for his absence with a strong second act. The costumes and production designs were an absolute treat recreating ancient Rome and making me feel like I had gladiator sandals on. The film was more than deserving of the Oscar it received that year for Art Direction encompassing set decoration. I am shocked however that it wasn't even nominated for a statuette in the Costume Design category. The ghost Caesar that haunted Brutus was a directorial feat considering the time in which the picture was filmed. Its looming presence agonized Brutus leading him to believe that Caesar was not at rest. The film was a stunning achievement of its time and one that I recommend be enjoyed by all. Personally I have a yearly tradition of watching this film every year on the Ides of March and it has yet to get old.".

	schema:headline " What about James Mason?";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course the most talked about actor of this movie is Marlon Brando but what about James Mason? He deserves just as much recognition and appreciation for his role in this movie and in my opinion he's also being the actor in the movie and perhaps also plays the biggest role in it.This is a very old fashioned movie and I'm not talking 1953 old but Shakespeare kind of old. The movie is filled with long and difficult to follow dialog like only Shakespeare could had wrote it. You obviously need to be able to appreciate Shakespeare in order to enjoy this movie otherwise you'll probably have difficulties finish watching it.Best things about a Shakespeare movie next to its writing are always the acting performances. A good Shakespeareperformance can make or break a movie. No risks were taking with this movie as the movie its cast is being filled with some big name actors. Besides Brando and Mason the movie also stars the likes of John Gielgud Edmond O'Brien Deborah Kerr and many other actors that had already made name at the time of this production both in theater and in movies.The movie is one about betrayal loyalty and idealistic motives. It focuses on the assassination of Julius Caesar and its conspirators who committed it. One the one side we have the senators who are afraid of Ceasar's growing power and idealistic motives while on the other we have Mark Antony loyal to his leader and friend Caesar. After the assassination both become opponents. The movie and its story are mostly being based on historical facts as they got documented during and after the first Caesar's reign.Of course the movie foremost is being a stageplay brought to the silverscreen. This means that the acting is very stagy and also the movie its sets often look like they come straight out of the theater. This however very rarely matters for a Shakespeare movie fore the movies are all about its writing and acting performances from the leading actors.Simply a great Shakespeare adaptation with a first rate cast.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Mank was a writer himself of course and though that didn't stop him butchering a Scott Fitzgerald script he clearly had more respect for Shakespeare and shot a more or less faithful version of the play so long as you're not too familiar with it. Gielgud is on hand to show how it's done and it's difficult for the other actors to come close to his inchperfect reading but most of them make a decent stab sorry about that at it with people like Eddy O'Brien who went on to give an Oscarwinning performance as Oscar Muldoon in Mank's very next film The Barefoot Contessa really shining. At the time 1953 it's a safe bet that Brando was the focus of all the PR and critical response and whilst he doesn't disgrace himself as Marc Anthony neither does he find anything new in the role. James Mason does his best as Brutus and has the advantage of a distinctive voice and Louis Calhern is an impressive Caesar. No one is going to touch Welles of course in adapting Shakespeare for the screen  his Chimes At Midnight is the finest filmed Shakespeare by a country mile  but Mank turned in a respectable effort here a worthy 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " See for yourself why Shakespeare remains The Immortal Bard";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever a really good film based on a work of Shakespeare appears we can immediately see why he has been called The Immortal Bard'. Even 400 years later and presented in a medium which Shakespeare himself could never have imagined these films are as dramatic and powerful as the best contemporary works. Actually the cinema is in some respects a better medium for his works than a contemporary theatre with a distant stage which may appear only as if seen through a tunnel. Olivier's in his superb film of 'Henry V' showed this clearly. The presentation started on the stage of the Globe theatre  a typical Elizabethan theatreintheround. When the viewer had had time to become absorbed in the story the scenario opened up to show the English Court and later the French countryside. It was easy to get the sense that the viewer at the Globe theatre was continuing to watch the stage there and all the remainder was filled in by imagination. This impression was reinforced by the return to the stage setting for the final scenes of the film after the drama was over and the play was winding down. But such a successful film of a Shakespearean play is not a trivial achievement. Our speech today includes many monosyllabic phrases  'yes' 'no' 'maybe' and it is difficult to present metered verse as ordinary conversation in a convincing way. For Elizabethans a visit to the theatre was often an all day outing. Shakespeare's play are complex usually with about five subplots and uncut will often run for well over three hours with five distinct acts providing intervals for the audience to visit the vendors and individual entertainers that in his day would have been present in large numbers. To create a successful film of these plays there are three basic requirements first a scriptwriter who can abbreviate the play to about a two hour presentation  not an easy thing to do with all the subplots usually present. second a cast capable of speaking metered verse intelligibly and without the loss of its original emotional impact and finally a Director who has a clear idea of his ultimate objectives and will let nothing get in the way of his determination to get there eventually. Measured against this objective Mankiewicz's film of Julius Caesar stacks up extremely well.No formal credit is given for the screenplay but Mankiewicz appears to have at least supervised its writing. When directing he never makes the mistake of believing spectacular settings or over opulent production can do anything to compensate for inadequate acting  essential in a film such as this where there are few action scenes and everything has to be carried by dialogue delivered in metered Elizabethan English. His settings are minimal sometimes even simplistic but his cast drawn from among the finest actors in both America and Britain are uniformly superb and he has paid close attention to ensuring they can effectively combine in presenting the play free of modern British or American accents with a very close approximation to Shakespearean English at its best. This gives the film a tremendous impact and it is unfortunate that it is only in monochrome  this does not spoil the film but one must recognise that it would have had a vastly larger audience if it had been in colour and few films deserve this more. Its subject matter the appeal of authoritarian government even to a society that has long practiced representational government remains very contemporary. The four leading actors Marlon Brando John Guilgud Louis Calhern and James Mason  playing Mark Anthony Cassius Julius Caesar and Brutus respectively not only give great performances but show a wonderful chemistry when acting together. The supporting cast who include Greer Garson and Deborah Kerr are also consistently excellent. The film emphatically comes into the NOT TO BE MISSED category.".

The cast I find is very good from top to bottom the music by Miklos Rosza especially with the original prologue he wrote that sets up his magnificent score purposefully restored and the production is in BW impressively mounted and flawlessly photographed. The credit for the beauties of this wellpaced and absorbing production must go to Joseph L. Mankiewicz the director and producer John Houseman. MGM Studios gave these gentlemen their best artists and technicians for this A production. The sets were done by Hugh Hunt and Edwin Willis the cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg the fine costumes by Herschel McCoy and the art direction by Edward Carfagno and the legendary Cedric Gibbons. This is of course a fictionalized historical biography without large battle scenes or much outdoor work at all so it depends on dialogue exchanges soliloquies welldelivered lines and thoughtfullyrealized characters. Thankfully many of the cast members are memorably good. James Mason deserved an award nomination for his intelligent Brutus Marlon Brando was handed one for a charismatic but imperfect Antony. John Gielgud repeated what onstage would have been a fine Cassius but here it a bit stagey at times others who came across well included Edmond O'Brien Greer Garson Deborah Kerr Alan Napier John Hoyt Douglass Dumbrille John Doucette Lawrence Dobkins Thomas Browne Henry and Dayton Lummis. Many others in the cast had few lines but contributed to the final effect very professionally. It is remarkable to a writer or an actor to see how well this speechheavy presentation survives a goodenough performance but not excellent by Louis Calhern as Julius Caesar and one by Douglass Watson as Octavius and still manages to be a very powerful experience I saw it eight nights running back in the 1960s and never tired of its excellences. The story as developed by the Medievalminded Shakespearean Poet whoever he was necessarily plays on Caesar's pretensions to divinity and on Brutus's being wrong to move against a head of state he had to say this because he lived in a pseudoChristian monarchy and no one was safe in advocating republicanism in government or the deposition of a state head by force. Yet apart from this warping of Brutus from defender of Roman justice to a man duped into acting too much for his own honor by Cassius the character relationships the confrontations and the poetic lines are all faraboveaverage cinematic qualities. This is a very fine and deservedlylonglasting film production of a wellplotted and ethically challenging theatrical dramatization the story of a man worth writing a work of fictionalized biography about.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very easy in this day and age of seemingly rotelike movie renditions of the works of Jane Austin Henry James and of course the Bard to produce a film that just goes through the motions  without anything much to say no interesting spin on the subject matter and with dull prettyboy and girl hamhanded actors speaking their lines or some other catch like state of the art FX or some other gimmick like the infamous Nude Macbeth version of the play that was filmed back in 1969 being the offering.To my mind however this particular rendition of Shakespeare's Juliuys Casear is THE defintive one ever filmed.  Frankly I just read the comments by Signet posted on March 20th  and I don't really know what on earth he is talking about.  Dull?  If he has on his mind Bruce Willis and the Die Hard films as by his own comments it is clear that he does well yes than anything that does not have to do with rocket ships or blazing machine guns or steriodladen super heroes rescuing scantily clad wellendowed women might seem dull.  But frankly Signet such being your defintion of what is exciting and interesting I really don't know why you would even bother checking this film out or any work of Shakespeare for that matter in the first place!This JC film plays out like a taut wellplaced political thriller  showing the machinations of scheming politicians of their egos and jealousies and a quite simply SUPERB Mark Antony funeral oration scene. Now to me brando has never seemed to be the most subtle of actors in his performances but the way he plays it here is perfect!  He shows the absolute mastery of reverse psychology of how sharp demagogues from him to Hitler are able to sway the masses to do their bidding.  It is simply an amaziug scene to my mind one of the very best scenes ever put on film.The acting from Mason to Geilgood to O'Brien is firstrate throughout.Again if you are looking for a classic and to me definitive version of this particular Shakesplay watch and tapebuy this film.  And if you're more interested in WWFstyle rock 'em sock 'em action lpease don't.And if you are in the later thrillseeking camp just don't watch a Shakespeare film and then post your juvenile comments to this web site. It merely serves to embarrass you.  Becuase you obviously just don't get the Bard.  And you never will.".

But frankly Signet such being your defintion of what is exciting and interesting I really don't know why you would even bother checking this film out or any work of Shakespeare for that matter in the first place!This JC film plays out like a taut wellplaced political thriller  showing the machinations of scheming politicians of their egos and jealousies and a quite simply SUPERB Mark Antony funeral oration scene. Now to me brando has never seemed to be the most subtle of actors in his performances but the way he plays it here is perfect!  He shows the absolute mastery of reverse psychology of how sharp demagogues from him to Hitler are able to sway the masses to do their bidding.  It is simply an amaziug scene to my mind one of the very best scenes ever put on film.The acting from Mason to Geilgood to O'Brien is firstrate throughout.Again if you are looking for a classic and to me definitive version of this particular Shakesplay watch and tapebuy this film.  And if you're more interested in WWFstyle rock 'em sock 'em action lpease don't.And if you are in the later thrillseeking camp just don't watch a Shakespeare film and then post your juvenile comments to this web site. It merely serves to embarrass you.  Becuase you obviously just don't get the Bard.  And you never will.";

The film has a very melancholic taste to it for me at least born in 1954. And AnnSofie Kylin would have absolutely been a girl I would have totally fallen in love with. The film is funny too at times like when Prs' macho moped gets overtaken by a bicycle rider eating an icecream. Lovely film just lovely!".

Although this film is far more realistic that the later films by Roy Andersson it still has an absurd feeling especially in the final part but also before. But as a young person this was at least for me the way the surrounding appeared to be. You saw things heard things people cried and did things for reasons which you did not fully grasped or cared about. The unhealthiness of your family and everyday had become like a too wellknown background noise which you only got aware of later in life. Therefore all the partially touchedupon subjects in this film which never are fully resolved or explained are a strength not a weakness I think.The film is also political. The class society in welfare Sweden is shown. It is not the upperclass vs. servant class but rather it is the quest for prestige of the everyday among working and middle class that is portrayed and always in a subtle but critical tone. But all this is through the selective gaze of the two young persons in love hence never is the film becoming dogmatic in its political sense.A very good film also with a beautiful photo. As a portrait of society this film is excellent. And please don't confuse it with Ingmar Bergman's films. They are good in some respects but this one is more Swedish than Bergman ever gets.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review A Swedish Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I attended a World Cinema Series screening at the National Museum and this 1970 film by Roy Andersson making his feature film debut with A Swedish Love Story was an opportunity to head back to soak in yet another important film in the history of cinema and a film that perhaps is making its premiere in Singapore as well. Presented by Ben Slater he managed to confirm with a Swedish member of the audience that En k rlekshistoria means just that in English something which I thought probably would have translated to something more sophisticated rather than to seem as if it's differentiating itself from the Ryan O'NealAli McGraw American romance movie Love Story.And sophisticated this film may not be at all on the surface at least. Being a film made in the past there was this scene that brought back some nostalgia and giggles from the audience for what we would now take for granted with the proliferation of digital technology in photographic cameras. In an instant we can take a picture with our loved ones as easy as 123. Back then when a camera still requires film focus and plenty of patience to frame your subject the icing on the cake was the lack of a timer and autoshutter relying on a stick long enough to click a picture for posterity.This romantic tale follows teenagers Annika AnnSofie Kylin and Par Rolf Sohlman from courtship to the consummation of a young relationship. Like all great romances they meet by chance in their respective family outings before actively pursuing each other through the games people usually play. One thing's for sure that basic human attachment and attraction for another follows a relatively set path and these young lovers have their fair share of ups and downs passionate expressions of love and passive tiffs. Andersson had succinctly captured the exhilaration of such passion that probably wouldn't even begin due to their shyness and initial reluctance relying on proxies to help each other communicate.Some standard practices if I may like the visiting of each other's parents also got into the narrative and will likely strike a chord with many viewers. As will the way the teenagers are decked out with their bikes and leather jackets which initially I felt leapt right out of the musical Grease made much later of course. There were plenty of smoking as well which I can't help but notice  I think almost every character here lights up at some point  where cigarettes and booze seem to be the norm for the teenagers seeking a good time.I felt AnnSofie Kylin probably got an easier role as compared to Rolf Sohlman as her opposite. Hers somehow got stuck to a single minded pining for a guy who for some reason is terribly attractive to her never mind that Andersson had made him somewhat of a wimp being unable to stand up to a bigger sized bully. That arc though mysteriously disappeared other than eliciting a oneline from Pr to want to seek revenge probably because the message here is of love and not war even at the expense of not being able to redeem some face back when being outslapped in the playing fields in full view of his peers.The film was nicely bookend by the involvement of family. At the beginning we see how the families then strangers had one party visibly and audibly perturbed by the other's barking dog. But that didn't turn out to be Romeo and Juliet feuding proportions of course and Fate has this wicked sense of humour to allow both families to come together again this time over a party atmosphere thanks to the friendship of the teenage lovers. There's a healthy dose of cynical humour in the last act which stood out because it was rather out of place given everything else up until then not infused with similar comedy.Not all's fine and dandy too as there were ample moments throughout the film and especially the end where it seemed everything got squeezed together where there was a sudden outburst of frustrations as if being the mouthpiece of the director echoing some sentiments felt from being a lowly employee to class division and earlier on in the film even the brand of a car received a swipe.A Swedish Love Story retains its romantic angle for the most parts which took a backseat really in the last act after they have more or less firmed their relationship giving way to a shift in focus to family members on both sides. With excellent landscapes and beautifully crafted scenes I love that bike ride in the twilight it goes to show that Love as a human condition and theme for a film well made will resonate amongst audiences regardless of time and location.".

In an instant we can take a picture with our loved ones as easy as 123. Back then when a camera still requires film focus and plenty of patience to frame your subject the icing on the cake was the lack of a timer and autoshutter relying on a stick long enough to click a picture for posterity.This romantic tale follows teenagers Annika AnnSofie Kylin and Par Rolf Sohlman from courtship to the consummation of a young relationship. Like all great romances they meet by chance in their respective family outings before actively pursuing each other through the games people usually play. One thing's for sure that basic human attachment and attraction for another follows a relatively set path and these young lovers have their fair share of ups and downs passionate expressions of love and passive tiffs. Andersson had succinctly captured the exhilaration of such passion that probably wouldn't even begin due to their shyness and initial reluctance relying on proxies to help each other communicate.Some standard practices if I may like the visiting of each other's parents also got into the narrative and will likely strike a chord with many viewers. As will the way the teenagers are decked out with their bikes and leather jackets which initially I felt leapt right out of the musical Grease made much later of course. There were plenty of smoking as well which I can't help but notice  I think almost every character here lights up at some point  where cigarettes and booze seem to be the norm for the teenagers seeking a good time.I felt AnnSofie Kylin probably got an easier role as compared to Rolf Sohlman as her opposite. Hers somehow got stuck to a single minded pining for a guy who for some reason is terribly attractive to her never mind that Andersson had made him somewhat of a wimp being unable to stand up to a bigger sized bully. That arc though mysteriously disappeared other than eliciting a oneline from Pr to want to seek revenge probably because the message here is of love and not war even at the expense of not being able to redeem some face back when being outslapped in the playing fields in full view of his peers.The film was nicely bookend by the involvement of family. At the beginning we see how the families then strangers had one party visibly and audibly perturbed by the other's barking dog. But that didn't turn out to be Romeo and Juliet feuding proportions of course and Fate has this wicked sense of humour to allow both families to come together again this time over a party atmosphere thanks to the friendship of the teenage lovers. There's a healthy dose of cynical humour in the last act which stood out because it was rather out of place given everything else up until then not infused with similar comedy.Not all's fine and dandy too as there were ample moments throughout the film and especially the end where it seemed everything got squeezed together where there was a sudden outburst of frustrations as if being the mouthpiece of the director echoing some sentiments felt from being a lowly employee to class division and earlier on in the film even the brand of a car received a swipe.A Swedish Love Story retains its romantic angle for the most parts which took a backseat really in the last act after they have more or less firmed their relationship giving way to a shift in focus to family members on both sides. With excellent landscapes and beautifully crafted scenes I love that bike ride in the twilight it goes to show that Love as a human condition and theme for a film well made will resonate amongst audiences regardless of time and location.";

	schema:reviewBody "En krlekshistoria A Love Story is very much better than anything I have read about it would lead me to expect and the reason it is so much better is something many who otherwise love the movie criticize it for that it is NOT just a love story. It is NOT just about the two ethereally innocent and lovely pubescent lovers but about the ugly adults who surround them.If this movie HAD been only about Pr and Annika it would indeed have been an extraordinary and breathtakingly beautiful love story and it would have fulfilled the promise of its title and the hopes of very many viewers. But it is a Roy Andersson movie and even as a freshoutofschool twentysomething making his very first featurelength movie his genius for cutting through illusion to the hardness under the surface of life was fully in evidence.Those who see En krlekshistoria as being radically different from his recent movies  Songs from the Second Floor and You The Living  and even from Giliap made only a few years after En krlekshistoria are wearing blinders choosing to see only the loveliness on its surface and denying the hard reality under and all around the loveliness.ALL of Andersson's movies are like this one. ALL of them are beautiful on one level and devastatingly harsh on another. That is what makes him such an extraordinary moviemaker and his movies so extraordinarily rewarding to watch. Without the hardness under the surface the beauty on the surface would be empty and of only minimal temporary value. It might entertain and delight us but it would not teach us anything about our own world or change us in any way. We would have been made to feel good for a few minutes but we would not have gotten anything of lasting value from the experience.So the ugly adults HAVE to be in this Love Story because without them this is nothing but a daydream a fleeting glimpse into the world of young love a world that is open to us for only a few months as we are making the astounding transition from childhood like butterflies emerging unsteadily from our cocoons. That innocent pure and lovely love is not available to adults or even to adolescents. Once the cocoon has been sloughed and the wings dried and warmed the butterfly flies off into its real life and our fragile emerging innocence is gone forever.The adults in En krlekshistoria give its love story the context it needs call our attention to and accentuate its purity and loveliness and show us how transient that loveliness is. The point only one of many Andersson is making and we do not want to see is that Pr and Annika are going to turn out to be just like their parents and other relatives hard selfish stupid abusive and ugly. They cannot turn out any other way because  like it or not  that is how we adults are.By showing us what Pr and Annika will be like in just a very few months the bully who beat up Pr is only slightly older but already like the adults Andersson gives us an invaluable frame for the lovely snapshot he took of them at their loveliest. That moment that loveliness is just as real as and certainly more pleasant to look at than the other adult reality but the two sharply contrasting realities need each other to make life tolerable. That contrast is what makes En krlekshistoria a work of genius and power much more than just a sweet but vapid story of young love.".

Now that I finally got round to this early film of his I can only confirm that I am no longer in love rather that I definitely love this director.Krlekshistoria is a cinematic experience very much different than his later work and at the same time to a considerable extend related to it. This apparent ambiguity lies in the different realistabsurdist relations. While SngerDu levande present very real aspects of life in all their absurdity in Krlekshistoria it is content rather than form that is dominantly absurdist. In this particular film you will not meet a colourful cast of noname people painfully engaged entrapped into their miserable lives that do not seem to go anywhere. No old people dragging their dogs in the street or weirdlooking strangers in bars. However this is not to say that that brand of cinematic opulence is absent from En krlekshistoria. Quite the contrary the characters do indeed feel the same things do the same things fail at the exact same things. In fact I would go so far as to imply that both his earlier and his recent films revolve around the same the dramatic irony that represents the essence of failed human condition.The prominent love storyline is set in the only context possible childhood. This storyline is dominant in terms of screen time as well as in terms of soundtrack you basically watch two teenage souls fall in love or something akin to it if at times too much aided by music. At first the setting did not seem very Anderssonesque though almost alien to the image I'd remembered and cherished the director. What is more I will concede to being slightly annoyed at the whole construction of the film. Naturally after some time I acknowledged how misled I was.Actually it was not until the last half an hour of the film that it at long last started to dawn upon me when En krlekshistoria's subtle and darker implications started unfurling. I felt like a stranger to the world of adults as opposedjuxtaposed to the world of the young love birds that I got to know and relate to. Mayhap I was too distracted at that point to fathom it or to even recognise its presenceomnipotence but at any rate I am quite sure this narrative device is deliberate. The music I believe served to push the boymeetsgirl story to the fore leaving the adults to mind their own business and consequently the viewer not to.Bottom line should be the tagline. Moments of truth. It is also worth mentioning that this is one of the few titles whose taglines actually do a pretty darn good job at announcing what it will be about. It is precisely about the moments of truth about the cracks in one's life details that at some point overload one demanding one's full and undivided attention. En krlekshistoria gives one the dots but at the end it is one who is left with the job of finding and connecting them into a whole. Once you accomplish that the magic and the potency of this film is sure to follow.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen Roy Andersson's latest film Snger frn andra vningen 2000 before I saw this. Both were highly acclaimed in Sweden. I had expected quite a different film this time after all it was a love story and since the director were younger when he made En krlekshistoria I thought it would be somewhat more easygoing. That wasn't at all the case.There are several similarities between the two. There is a main plot about a 15 year old boy working as a car mechanic assistant who falls in love with an even younger girl. But that isn't the only thing this movie is about. Rather it seems like Andersson shows a pessimistic view of the general problems of love in our society lonely people couples that quarrel marriages that break up. Similar to his later film it is shot slowly and very beautifully and with a dominant depressive mood floating over it. This particularly depressive feeling which I dare to refer to as a mood characteristic of the whole Swedish society. The conversations are also very Swedish. It could be seen as criticism of the society or just a twisted documentation of it with black humour probably more plausible.I couldn't stand that the topic of love was described in this way. Love is the highest source of happiness. This film is completely without exaltation. Again very Swedish.35.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had seen Roy Andersson's latest film Snger frn andra vningen 2000 before I saw this. Both were highly acclaimed in Sweden. I had expected quite a different film this time after all it was a love story and since the director were younger when he made En krlekshistoria I thought it would be somewhat more easygoing. That wasn't at all the case.There are several similarities between the two. There is a main plot about a 15 year old boy working as a car mechanic assistant who falls in love with an even younger girl. But that isn't the only thing this movie is about. Rather it seems like Andersson shows a pessimistic view of the general problems of love in our society lonely people couples that quarrel marriages that break up.

A Swedish Love Story is my all time favorite Swedish movie and not just because 99  of the Swedish movies are complete garbage.This film gives a honest view of the teenagelove compared to the adultlove. Where the youth love is almost problem free where the teenagers have communicationsissues and the adults have problems that they are some what stuck in their relationship.. Roy creates a beautiful contrast there. Another thing that is very nicely captured are the class differences between Pr and Annika's family's. The dialog in the movie is also very simple and are likely to happen in real life. And at last the music the perfect music in this film and for that we will have to thank Bjrn Isfeldt! It is a shame that this film haven't got more attention like Bergmans movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the debut of a fresh faced Andersson in his mid twentys. Young love lingers in his mind and he seeks to make this the core of his first feature film. But remarkably for a young debut there is also a tinge of cynicism in the world removed from the two lovebirds. The contrast of the naivety of Par and Annika with the pessimistic adulthood is not afforded a whole lot of diversity or nuance but it is grim. In the near end where the adults party and the teenagers frolic Par and Annika are locked in the same wordless embrace as they have been for the majority of the film completely certain of their feelings. And the adults drink and drink and egg each other on snidely take jabs at each other's livelihoods and class until it becomes uncomfortable to watch and ramble drunkenly on their live's woes while no one really listens. There's a suggestion here from Andersson that the youth too will inherit this universal despair aimlessness and quest for status  that these memories that are ingrained so strongly will become wisps in the wind as they age. It is fair to say that this issue is tackled better in his later more iconic trilogy about the trials and tribulations of being human. But what he does nail is the young love. AnnSofie Kylin and Rolf Sohlman are appropriately cast with the right amount of jitteriness  almost as a direct contrast to the now modern preference of casting adults as teenagers. At first it is just glances glances that are all too familiar. They linger for just a brief moment longer and the camera does too  a bit of exposed skin a hint beneath a skirt. They put on a brave front which Andersson betrays by displaying their age see the bravado of Par's motorcycling riding only to be humorously overtaken by a icecream licking bicycle rider. And when they get closer their gaze becomes focused on their own insecurities and they can barely move at all. The music by Staffan Stenstrm of Atlantic Ocean is just perfect  in that sweaty scarletinfused club they dance aimlessly and try to make their glances discreet all while brushing past significant hazy figures in the foreground teenagers know what they want. The bassline is heavy and the vocal is practically begging them to come together. And when they don't because at this age we are rarely direct they instead communicate via their friends to try and gleam some insight into how the other feels. Anyone who has been young and in love will remember this little trick and then some. And when they finally become a couple they bury their heads into each other's shoulders as if was the last comfort in the world and conversation is scarce  why talk when their bodies already radiate what their desires are? When Par is beaten up by an older boy Annika descends into sobs as if thinking he no longer cares for her. Par is horror stricken that he has been shown up and is no longer worthy of being with her. They make up in that iconic pose on the basketball court and it is as if it never happened the next day. The seesawing affections and dramatic bliss of young love. In the beginning Par watches a friend demonstrate his karate moves and poses shouting in an exaggerated manner as if he was Bruce Lee himself. Women like big bad fighters he says. If only it turned out to be that simple.".

The parents sometimes act in ways that I cannot described in any other way but crazy'. If Andersson wanted to show unstable adults around emotionally immature kids  then he has but the scenes at the Krftskiva crayfish parties are so weird as far as the human emotions displayed that it makes little sense and still does not show the surrealist or absurd undertones that were probably what Andersson wanted to show.The 70's look is a real one  it was shot in the 70's of course and that is indeed a source of some enjoyment. But personally I found the film to be quite outdated and not too interesting as a whole.".

If Andersson wanted to show unstable adults around emotionally immature kids  then he has but the scenes at the Krftskiva crayfish parties are so weird as far as the human emotions displayed that it makes little sense and still does not show the surrealist or absurd undertones that were probably what Andersson wanted to show.The 70's look is a real one  it was shot in the 70's of course and that is indeed a source of some enjoyment. But personally I found the film to be quite outdated and not too interesting as a whole.";

Madly in love they see the world through idealised eyes everything's gold. Watch them dance.Novice actors Rolf and Kylin lend the film a rare fragility. They're awkward confused their characters' romance conveyed with amorous glances and simple exchanges. Andersson's direction is low key. Very low key. The film moves like a whisper a teenage dream moments of whimsy and bounce periodically giving way to adults who grumble and grouse. Damn them. Damn those pesky adults with their problems and their baggage. Why they so blue? Humanity is composed of a bunch of bastards one grotesque adult grumbles. Money is all that matters another moans.But Par and Annika don't notice. How can they? They're like dandelion dust fluttering playing in an adolescent funyard touching bodies experiencing one another probing and prodding and basking in all that is adolescent and awkward and oh so soft and gentle and my oh my there's my first kiss. To Andersson Par and Annika are creatures still in a state of innocence. They're Adam and Eve before the fall. Lif and Lifthrasir in their secret forest though around them the mundanity of maturity heaves its massive bulk. It's coming. But will our young couple turn into monsters? Will they be like daddy and mommy and their dour aunts and uncles? Of course not. They have hope and zest and look good in miniskirts tight jeans and when posed ontop motorcycles. They're rebels baby. They've got things figured out. The world's their oyster. Blue jeans and push up bras. They're the future and the future is bright.Yeah right.Interestingly while Andersson's going for a balancing act  the shipwreck of adulthood juxtaposed with the blissful naivety of youth  for the purposes of advocating youthful optimism the effect is the opposite. You want to slap these kids. You want to tell Annika to stop dressing like a hooker and Par to stop trying to look like James Dean. You ain't cool kid.Incidentally though perhaps not surprisingly once you see how it aestheticises youthfulness copies of the film frequently turn up after FBI paedophile raids. And whilst Andersson's films frequently counterpoint jaded maturity with blissful ignorance A Swedish Love Story's youngold binary is a bit too simplistic. Often it's pessimists who are the most optimistic and the blissful who in their self absorption are truly pessimistic. And of course adults are as delusional as kids if not more so and indeed are directly responsible for the delusions of the latter.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " A barely adequate film with some charms some laughs and lots of groaners";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not that Trust the Man is a bad movie. It's not without some merit. But it's a film that could have been better had some time been taken with the script and with the direction. Spain's great filmmaker Almodovar complained this week that American movies have year by year become worse and worse because of their scripts. This film serves as a great example of what Almodovar is referring to.The problem is that we're no longer writing characters in scripts we're writing what I call Oddities  characters with a onedimensional problem that makes them kooky but leaves them being just a type. It's more of a freakshow approach to storytelling step right up and see the sex addict step right up and see the woman who desperately wants to get married and have babies etc. Here we have four great actors who are all playing oddities. Duchovny is the sex addict whose addiction is tempered by the fact he's a Mr. Mom and a great one too. His wife played by Julianne Moore isn't all that interested in sex for some reason which is not really made clear in the film. She's definitely attracted to him and the two seem to have a rather physically intense romantic relationship. But hey Screen writing 101 says conflict is necessary so if the husband is a sex addict let's make his wife frigid for no apparent reason.Likewise with the Gyllenhaal and Crudup characters. He's obsessed with being single so guess what let's make her obsessed with being married. As you can see this is a rather unclever film.But there are funny moments. There are some great lines spread throughout the film. But it's long boring and you'll cringe as everyone seems to have a scene in which they break down and cry their eyes out in an almost childish spat.This is the other main dysfunction of the film. Instead of making things believably come from the characters the film just pushes us this way and that way making things happen because it might be funny or it helps tie up loose ends but it doesn't work with the stark realism of the New York setting. For instance Duchovny's character starts to have an affair even though it's so clear that he's in love with his wife. We never for once think he is that sexually starved that he'd risk infidelity. Likewise we never for once believe that Julianne Moore's character is that disinterested in sex. She even takes out her friend after a breakup for some hot sex with an attentive man. She goes as far as to admit having a threesome back in college. Does this sound like a woman who has no sexual interest whatsoever? And there's some question of whether she was having an affair too though it seems like something was left on the editing room floor that would have explained that a little further.Oh and for some reason Billy Crudup starts following around his therapist. Once again for no reason.And the ending is just bad. It doesn't seem believable to begin with and comes off like sweetened sacchrine. Which is a shame because these two couples actually have chemistry.It just takes too much time and sags around the midpoint of the 2nd act.Plus for some reason there's a scene with Duchovny and Crudup talking where Duchovny ends the scene by suddenly announcing I have to go and then leaving. It's a rather poorly directed moment that seriously bothered me. Why does a character have to announce that they're leaving the scene? Just have them walk away. I think the audience can figure that out. Look for the moment it's really odd.I went to a preview screening of the film and I wish I could have talked to the director afterwards because with about 25 minutes of trimming they could have had a much tighter oldstyle Woody Allen sort of film.Sadly Almodovar is right. American scripts are at their lowest. Look at Superman Returns Miami Vice and now even this independent work. At least Fox Searchlight is also releasing Little Miss Sunshine at the moment. That movie is phenomenal and might be one of the few gems that refutes Almodovar's theory. But there's far too much to prove it.I ask filmlovers out there. Why are we still accepting adequate films today? Why don't we hope for something more. Why don't we raise the level and say give us good films. Adequate just ain't good enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film seems to seek only to be exactly what it seems to be on first viewing and manages that superbly. And all this is is just one more 'relationship' movie showing the problems faced in modern life by 'trendy' couples in New York.The film portrays two couples living in New York a brother and sister and their respective partners who have the typical problems with each other. One couple has Julianne Moore and David Duchovny in a marriage gone stale unimaginatively shown through the medium of having Moore's character repetitively refuse her husband sex and the other has Maggie Gyllenhaal desperate to further both her career and relationship with a boyfriend who is terrified to commit apparently because of a fear of dying.Not exactly original is it. Throughout the movies I just found it to be simply leaning on the stable stereotypes and ideas of every other film of this genre before it but with little or no effort to flesh out the characters to an interesting level something vital in a film of this kind. None of the characters in this piece are interesting and you just cannot bring yourself to care about them. I really expected more from Duchovny and Moore who we know can do this sort of thing well if they try and the only one here who vaguely manages to come out of this well is Gyllenhaal who somehow manages to work through the material and give Elaine a level of naivety and a hope to improve on her lot to make us root for her.This is where I felt the movie like many others like it missed the point these characters have problems they're not happy and their relationships are falling apart but they don't seem to want to bother doing anything about it. In fact 'helping yourself' is actively mocked. Tom and Rebecca go to marriage counselling once a year as a joke to wind up their guidance councillor. When Tom joins a sex addicts group apparently if you're wife refuses to have sex with you ever and tells you this to your face if you still want sex yourself it means you're a sex addict. No one wants sex once you have children! What a freak! we just get shown an amusing group of weirdos with stupid and amusing fetishes involving power tools.What this shows to me is just one more love story of how New York once again shown as a seeming example of the epitome of American society drains people and makes them miserable and alone. How everyone is miserable but trying to improve your lot is pointless and laughable so just get over it and you'll get the inevitable happy ending where both couples get what they wanted from the start not because they've actually changed or started liking each other but because we've got the end of the film and need to wrap it up for that cathartic happy ending that the audience wants. The moral don't bother trying to change your life if it's not working it'll all work out in the end if you pretend your happy.".

How everyone is miserable but trying to improve your lot is pointless and laughable so just get over it and you'll get the inevitable happy ending where both couples get what they wanted from the start not because they've actually changed or started liking each other but because we've got the end of the film and need to wrap it up for that cathartic happy ending that the audience wants. The moral don't bother trying to change your life if it's not working it'll all work out in the end if you pretend your happy.";

The story lines leading up to this predictable ending were beyond unrealistic and yes as someone mentioned above there were multiple story lines that were not wrapped up. Elaine would never have been interested in that ridiculously fake French accent guy and why on earth would she not have had a stronger reaction to her potential publisher kissing her on the street?? What did either couple do learn discover realize or discuss that would have brought them to a reconciliation?? Shouldn't THAT have been the meat of the story?? The final scene in the theater was sheer nonsense! What an insult to the viewer! Just another disappointing film whose best and only good lines are in the trailer. A few saving graces for this film David Duchovney was very good the nod to 'The Graduate' at the end was cute Gary Shandling was funny and unfortunately that's about it!".

I was getting prepared for an intimate look at how sane educated people handle adult relationships. Then the opening credits ended and there's David Duchovny talking to his son while he the son is on the toilet and explaining how a fart can be better than a poop. It didn't get any better from there.Not counting porn this is the worstwritten film I have ever seen. Now there are plenty of badlywritten movies out there but they don't pretend to be anything other than a crude vehicle that gets you to the CGI stunts andor bloodshed. This is even worse than those because Bart Freundlich thought it was going to be about something important and it's just absolute junk. The characters in this movie do not exist in real life. They have no depth or dimensions or personalities. They are all completely unlikable. I started applauding when Duchovny tells Billy Crudup's character to shut the hell up. You and me both David. They don't talk or think like anyone I've ever come across. They float from wildly expensive restaurant to wildly expensive restaurant and whine about their problems without ever stopping to think that they are the cause of them all. Would you want to sit through an hour and 40 minutes of rich pampered pretty white people living in a bubble and complaining about how much their lives suck? I didn't think so.But wait there's more. The script makes Maggie Gyllenhaal look like a sniveling whiny privateschool sorority girl. That alone is an art crime against humanity. But considering Crudup is reduced to a onenote deathobsessed Neanderthal and Duchovny ends up speaking jive during a particularly bigoted note in the script and the whole thing wraps up like a teen drama on the CW I think I'm on pretty solid ground with my assertion.Yes it only deserves 1 star. I thought to myself Was there anything of value that I could take from this movie and justify giving it maybe 2 or 3 stars? There might have been but the movie was such an insult to me and other smart people that I decided it wasn't worth it to figure out what they were.".

It is more drama than comedy.The film is often slow and fails to grasp the attention of the viewers. I get the impression that events in the film happen just for the sake of happening. I can see no reason why the events happen that way. Maybe it really was because my attention deficit that I do not even recall seeing David Duchovny's character having any evidence of having an affair at all apart from his self confession.I think this film could have been good with a better plot but the plot is quite a mess and does not make viewers interested in what happens next.

Maybe it really was because my attention deficit that I do not even recall seeing David Duchovny's character having any evidence of having an affair at all apart from his self confession.I think this film could have been good with a better plot but the plot is quite a mess and does not make viewers interested in what happens next. The ending is artificial and seem forcefully put together. I would not recommend this movie!";

Even more astonishing is that he got an actress as luminous intelligent and talented as Julienne Moore to not only appear in his hack films but to marry him to boot! I'm guessing there's an onset love child reason behind this. She's probably responsible for gathering the rest of the usually talented cast to participate in what amounts to be a subhigh school level wannabe's attempt at a Woody Allen homage. Freundlich does not know drama does not know structure couldn't write a script if it were ghost written for him and directs with a hand so leaden it's amazing the audience can walk out of the theater afterward in full consciousness. His films are just mindnumbing. This guy is no auteur. It must have been a slow year at Sundance when Myth of Fingerprints slipped through with such shining notices and for God's sake how did he assemble THAT cast? Such talent so wasted. What he needs to do for the sake of his craft is take some episodic TV jobs. Learn how to tell a story. And quit relying on your wife to get your sorry films made.".

	schema:headline " An occasionally funny romantic comedy although it's mostly a nonengaging ride";
	schema:reviewBody "Tom David Duchovny is a stayathome dad married to a popular actress Julianne Moore while his best friend and her younger brother Tobey Billy Crudup has lived for eight years with the hardworking Elaine Maggie Gyllenhaal but won't commit to the relationship by marrying her. This is what happens when these four New Yorkers decide to explore other options.At a glance Trust the Man seems harmless enough but it's actually fake and a bit too insignificant to really have an impact on the viewer. The script was simple and it wasn't hard to figure out where things were going. The dialog was okay although some of it was a bit unnatural. I'm not from New York so maybe this is actually normal behavior but a lot of the conversations were just awkward and none of it felt real. All of the characters spoke in the same way so the movie got a little irritating because it was just the same personalities on screen and there was no variety. However some of the dialog and scenes were pretty funny.The characters weren't particularly interesting and most of them were unlikable. In the beginning their situations were interesting to watch and then the film ditched the laughs and got all serious. The sudden change of tone invited the viewer to feel sorry for these people even though most were onedimensional and pretty selfish. So the first half of the movie was decently funny and consistent. The second half was serious and just not very interesting. The one thing I did like about the movie was the setting and Bart Freundlich did a good job at creating a realistic area. It's too bad he couldn't use some of that realism with the script and characters.Out of the leading cast Billy Crudup gave the best performance. His character was pretty selfish yet still engaging and funny. David Duchovny was very wooden and not interesting at all. This was probably the intention although I didn't like the idea of his character at all and his performance was unbearable at times. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but she can do better and she didn't seem to really be trying. Julianne Moore had a couple of good scenes although she was a bit over the top and fake. Out of the supporting cast Eva Mendes was surprisingly funny although she was only on screen for about ten minutes maybe a little less. She was the only one who stuck out from that group. Overall Trust the Man had a decent story although it couldn't generate genuine sympathy due to it's shallow and fake storyline. If you like any of the actors it might be worth a rental although they all have better work out there. Rating 510".

But all in all I thought it was a jumbled mess.Billy Crudup woefully miscast as Tobey a 36 year old slacker comes off as an effeminate what was that silliness with Eva Mendes's character in the restaurant??? selfcentered jerk who only acts like a decent person when his girlfriend Elaine a cute and perky Maggie Gyllenhaal rightfully leaves him. But her new boyfriend is a stereotype of the European pseudointellectual who is one of the most unlikeable characters ever to grace the screen in this decade. Given the choice between the Sprocket and her lovesick obsessed exboyfriend it's no wonder she chooses to go back with a guy who at one time refused to drive her to work because he didn't want to move his car from the opposite side of the street.Julianne Moore plays Tobey's sister Rebecca a successful but insecure actress who is married to David Duchovny's stay at home husband Tom. Duchovny who is a terrific actor doesn't have much to work with and his character is so schlubby and whiny you wonder why a gorgeous divorce another stereotypical Manhattan newly divorced single mom on the prowl just waiting to pounce on Mr. Mom and a glamorous actress would want to spend even ten minutes in his company. The irony is that this seemingly asexual man is actually a sex addict who joins a support group called stereotypically of course Sexaddictsrus. Of course he makes a mockery of his first session making up a preposterous story about being wrapped in deli meat in order to be satisfied. Oh and of course he uses a fake name. Eventually he does come clean and admit that he has a real problem because he can't have a meaningful relationship with his sexy and dynamic wife and his affair ends just like that. Naturally his wife forgives him after he pulls a crazy stunt on the opening night of her play and Elaine dumps her Eurotoyboy after Tobey screams out his undying love for her in the theater on the very same night. None of the issues are ironed out on screen and a sweet and tidy ending is in store for the viewer who dares to stick it out.The film was supposedly modelled after the Woody Allen films like Annie Hall and Manhattan but it's light years away from them because it's boring and the characters are completely unlikeable. The conversations are totally pretentious with the characters making sweeping generalizations about the nature of their relationships and very existences.Overall it's a lousy stereotypical movie that is a 4 out of 10.".

After watching it I wish I had forgotten about it completely for there is almost nothing redeeming about this cinematic catastrophe. The cast has no chemistry the writing and directing is amateurish and cinematography is murky.However the picture's biggest fault is the tone. Trust the Man drifts uneasily from dirty sex comedy to tepid romance to boring drama from scene to scene making for not only an extremely frustrating viewing experience but an uncomfortable one as well. It's as writerdirector Bart Freundlich didn't know what genre he wanted his movie to fall under during shooting thinking that he would decide later in the editing room. Apparently that didn't work out either as it seems there are numerous scenes missing or incomplete. Other scenes go on far too longthe scenes with Billy Crudup in his car are perfect examples. There wasn't a single scene in Trust the Man I found effective funny or well done. The plot is a huge mess gaping with holes. The only reason I give it a 1 as opposed to a zero is I reserve zeros for only those films that I find morally offensiverepugnant or without any artistic value whatsoever. 110".

Paul Giamatti can pull it off. These actors appear uncomfortable and really boring trying to be regular people in unusual situations but even the situations are not that usual. The minority of people watching movies are actors or authors or whatever so these situations don't ring true and as the most annoying of all Maggie Gyllenhall comes across as giggly and stupid something that is sad to watch given how talented she is.

Overall the plot is incredibly slow the dialog seems to revolve around 'sex' the WHOLE time do people not discuss anything else in Manhatten??? The 'jokes' are not funny I can't quite figure why they pegged this as a comedy... Drama maybe comedy a resounding NO. The acting is OKish also not what I would think considering who is in the cast  It's not worth wasting your money on!".

As such Nasser and his immediate family live more than a comfortable lifestyle and he flaunts his riches whenever he can. Meanwhile his brother alcoholic Ali once a famous journalist in Pakistan lives in a seedy flat with his son Omar. Ali's life in London is not as lucrative in part because of his left leaning politics which does not mesh with the ideals of Thatcherism. To help his brother Nasser gives Omar a job doing menial labor. But Omar with bigger plans talks Nasser into letting him manage Nasser's run down laundrette.

	schema:reviewBody "A classic film in my book My Beautiful Laundrette is the story of Omar a young restless Asian man caring for his alcoholic father in Thatcherite London. Escape comes in the form of his uncles many and varied business ventures...Anyone who experienced anything of life in '80's Britain will recognise the craving for instant financial success. Similarly I am sure Asian viewers will recognise the struggles inherent in finding an identity in a country which is your home but which can never feel quite like your real home.Omar dreams of success so works to achieve it...along the way he meets up with old schoolfriend Johnny who has betrayed him by falling in with a group of neonazi's. Omar soon has Johnny working for him and his uncle. Turning the tables on him as he is made to rely on the very people he has been taught to hate. The chemistry between Omar and Johnny is palpable and their relationship handled totally matteroffactly.  About the only part of the film not trying to score any political points is the gay relationship. There is a sowhat attitude and noone comes out at any point. And why should they?Tension in the film is far more the result of socioeconomic and racial inequalities. The whole thing is handled with grace charm and wit. Anyone remotely familier with British film in particular will note the starry casting of supporting roles though Danial Day Lewis is  now  the biggest star of the show. Here he shows the real substance behind his fame  more so than in any other film of his seen to date. The cast is universally excellent and the unique shooting pacing and dialogue quite quite brilliant.Some of the shots in this film could be used as a template for brilliance...An unexpected kiss in a dark alley is easily the most erotic single shot I have seen in a film.Despite a few reviews I have read claiming otherwise I don't believe you need to be gay or Asian to get something out of this picture. Living in Britain may help though it's a lot less than essential.......And hey! Wouldn't you love to throw your knickers into the washing machines of a neonlit musicfilled laudrette from heaven run by two insatiably young and energetic lovers?Well I would anyway!

	schema:headline " What A Laundrette!";
	schema:reviewBody "'My Beautiful Laundrette' takes a look at the 80's local life within the Asian communities in England and between the British Southeast Asians and the British Caucasians. What I loved about this film is that it presents its themes without going overboard to explain or to resolve anything. When we see a relationship develop between Omar and Johnny one would expect to see them get attacked for it and then expect a preachy message like gays have rights too but there is nothing like that. There are scenes where the British Asians are being humiliated but this too does not lead to a bloodbath of sorts. It is all downplayed and subtle. It's about the characters rather than a social message but that's there too.'My Beautiful Laundrette' mainly centres around Omar and his relationship with Johnny. Hanif Kureishi is known for telling tales about unconventional relationships and I thought it was great that both characters were shown to be open about their relationships in spite of their background. I mean they weren't screaming from the roof or anything but these two individuals did not care what others would think concerning their relationships. Frears deserves full marks for telling the story in such a raw real humorous and coherent way. The humour too is subtle and dry and flows well through the story.The renovated laundrette too plays a crucial role. It is a place of comfort for Omar and Johnny kind of like a home they built and decorated. The customers are amused by the beauty of it. A fascinated Nasser dances with his girlfriend while the customers eagerly wait outside. Thus it becomes a place of comfort for many.The characters are well etched. Both their strength and fragility is well displayed by the actors. Daniel DayLewis and Gordon Warnecke are excellent as Johnny and Omar. DayLewis brilliantly brings out Johnny's vulnerable and passionate side while on the exterior he appears as a tough and scary guy. Likewise Warnecke too effectively portrays Omar's determination and passion. A charismatic Saeed Jaffrey is phenomenal as the cheerful helpful uncle who goes through his own transformation. Rita Wolf is wonderful as the daughter who's in search of her own identity. Roshan Seth is good as the whiny father. The rest of the cast do well.Pretty much all the characters are in search of something except that Omar and Johnny find what they want and Nasser loses what he had. The film does not end by providing a solution for everyone. And that is one of the many brilliance of it as it reflects that everyone has their own life to deal with and questions will arise but life goes on and it is up to us to choose the answer.Simply great.".

	schema:reviewBody "It bugs me that this movie is the gay movie just like it bugs me when a movie with black people is labeled the black movie. What about Mafia movies? Are those for people who are involved? What about Seven I guess that's a cult classic for serial killers. Come on a good movie is a good movie. Trust me I identified with Omar  and I'm a straight hispanic girl  probably more than I have with any other character in a movie. This movie is about homosexuality like Charlotte Gray is about hair dye.This movie is definitely one of my favorites. It is a look a young man a gorgeous Pakistani named Omar who basically tries to balance being Pakistani and British at the same time. He wants to have a business and be successful in that Western capitalist way and yet he wants to be good to his family and his father in that sense of family loyalty that only those of us from other cultures really understand. Omar asks his uncle to tell stories about his family in Pakistan yet he doesn't understand his people's language  Urdu I believe it is. This is a little insight for our white friends about what us inbetweens have to go through. Too ethnic for the white people too white for our own people. It's nice to show the ethnic people looking down on the poor whites because we do we look down on low class white people we have our snobbery too. It may not be right but it's the truth. It's nice to show the sort of affectionate annoyance Omar found his Papa and Nasser for trying to help him. White people see that as overbearing something to escape from like Tania who was the whitest of them all Ethnic people have a sense of humor about it because we know it means love and like Omar most of us just choose to quietly listen and ignore their advice rather than make a scene. Omar never makes a scene.That's what Johnny represents I think the part of us we keep to ourselves our passions and desire and those things that are too special to share kind of like a spiritual belief. It makes their love seem almost sacred because it's too special for them to bring out and expose to the criticism of less enlightened people. It's worth noting that it's Johnny who kisses Omar semiopenly in the street and it's Omar who doesn't tell his family why he can't marry Tania. I dont think it's so much homophobia as it a cultural difference as to what should be kept private. I could sort of see Johnny in the future demaning Omar tell his family.Their love scene is gorgeous. When you first see Johnny he seems so rough and coarse and low class but as he begins to seduce Omar while Omar talks about the past he suddenly seems powerful and sophisticated and . . . and just to see them getting it on on the table. It's very sweet and tender with the frantic kissing and the champange but my god is it hot.This certainly is a romantic and more importantly positive movie where two men are in love yet have a real conflict between them and obviously gay men are right to love that but hey it works for informing white people making minorities laugh British people who grew up during that time showing idiot homophobes that gay people are just the same as everyone else DDL fans. Don't just slap the gay label on it and dismiss it!".

	schema:headline " Not just a gay love story!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film works on a number of different levels. Firstly there is the love affair between the two main characters Omar and Johnny brought to life by brilliant performances from both Gordon Warnecke and Daniel DayLewis. The audience remains mostly in the dark about the history shared by the lovers... were they lovers before their chance meeting and subsequent rediscovery or were they just friends as children and lovers as adults? Clearly though there has always been a close bond between the two which has remained in tact even after Johnny had abandoned his friend to join a group of NeoNazis. This is where the real complexities of the story lie. The fact that Omar and Johnny embark on a gay love affair seems almost incidental. Rather it is the power relations between the two that is important. Class ethnicity kinship and community are central in shaping the way in which each character perceives their role within the world. Thatcherism and the 'entrepreneurial spirit' has fuelled Omar's ambition to make something of himself in 80s Britain. Conversely Johnny seems to have resigned himself to his downtrodden status since society has done nothing to help him so why should he do anything for society? Thus class is very much an issue here. Ethnicity too is key as the roles of the downtrodden and oppressed seem to have been reversed with the white workingclass Johnny being the 'victim' of the system rather than the Pakistani middleclass Omar. Despite all of the differences however essentially it is their love for each other that keeps them together. There are occasions when Omar questions whether he and Johnny can really be together in the longterm such as when he contemplates marriage whilst Johnny seems to be subordinate almost passive towards Omar because of his love for him. Despite all of their differences they both seem to have a profound respect for one another which will hopefully enable them to continue their relationship although the ending is left rather open. The main thing when watching this is to view it not only as a gay love story. It also provides a snapshot of 80s Britain and an illustration of the fluidity of identity and of the different life chances that people had which is clearly still as relevant today as it was back then.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film works on a number of different levels. Firstly there is the love affair between the two main characters Omar and Johnny brought to life by brilliant performances from both Gordon Warnecke and Daniel DayLewis. The audience remains mostly in the dark about the history shared by the lovers... were they lovers before their chance meeting and subsequent rediscovery or were they just friends as children and lovers as adults? Clearly though there has always been a close bond between the two which has remained in tact even after Johnny had abandoned his friend to join a group of NeoNazis. This is where the real complexities of the story lie. The fact that Omar and Johnny embark on a gay love affair seems almost incidental. Rather it is the power relations between the two that is important. Class ethnicity kinship and community are central in shaping the way in which each character perceives their role within the world. Thatcherism and the 'entrepreneurial spirit' has fuelled Omar's ambition to make something of himself in 80s Britain. Conversely Johnny seems to have resigned himself to his downtrodden status since society has done nothing to help him so why should he do anything for society? Thus class is very much an issue here.

But it's also a very funny film sharp and romantic. Neither Omar nor Johnny are meant to succeed in this particular world.

But both actors are really believable in their roles both playing complicated real human characters driven and held back by multiple forces.Kureishi tells the searing unapologetic truth always. With a great eye for character he knows how to make what people really say work dramatically. Check out his TV series The Bhudda of Suburbia if you can find it. Frears is one of the small handful of great British directors check out his very funny The Snapper.Films like this helped shape my world as a teenager a Brit classic.".

His ambition is to renovate his uncle's rundown laundrette. He gets in his white mate Johnny Daniel Day Lewis to give him a hand and the two guys fall in love.My Beautiful Laundrette completely encapsulates the zeitgeist of 1980's Britain tackling everything from racial tension immigration generation differences class differences Thatcherism and homosexuality. I say 'tackle' it's presented but the viewer is allowed to make their own minds up. This is primarily a comingofage film and on that level it can appeal to everyone.As for the arguments that you can only like this film if you fit into one of the criteria portrayed here or the period it was set in they're completely ridiculous. So we can only like Schindler's List if we're a Nazi or a Jew and were alive in the forties? Come on people. The only criteria I fit in with this film is that I live in Britain not even London where the film's set.What a lot of people dislike about the film is that it portrays a lot of the tensions happening in Britain but it does so on a very human level. No character is just a victim of the state. It's a light romantic comedy that lets us see the violence and racism but doesn't linger making it more powerful when things do happen.As for the relationship between Omar and Johnny it's portrayed very tenderly and very sexily though tasteful. What is rare for a 'gay film' a label given to any film that has gay characters in is that the characters aren't tortured over their sexuality or punished. It's just portrayed as a normal loving relationship and the two actors both straight are very convincing.Now Daniel Day Lewis has bagged his third Oscar breaking the record for Best Actor how does he fare in a very early film in his career? I really enjoyed his performance you can see there's something about him even at this age. His facial structure is outstanding he looks very striking. And there's none of the mannerisms you might expect from an actor destined to do well. He comes across as a fresh talent which he was.".

Issues around the pressure for Omar to get married by arrangement are very relevant both as in being Pakistani and homosexual.For my money there are just too many small characters doing little things that we never see again they do not contribute to the film and if anything dissolve its strengths. I'm also not keen on Gordon Warnecke's Omar performance his monosyllabic recital of his lines show no depth. Omar may actually have spoken like that but it fails to convince.The romance element is boosted by the way that the refurbished laundrette is to be launched as a dreamy magical palace with a razzle dazzle showbiz look and can be seen as the aspiration for people who have little to make a life for themselves.I first saw My Beautiful Laundrette about when it was released and knew friends in the gay community  and have watched the DVD a couple of times since. Those friends saw it more of a championing beacon to their cause and lifestyle and less of a political and economic barometer. Almost no such films were made almost thirty years ago and whilst I'm sure many did just see it as a progay drama that it was and remains a good film is a huge bonus.".

The plot did go through following some weird script but the problem was that they probably had cut away a lot events that were not central. Scenes would end abruptly or jump to a totally different scene or atmosphere. It made the characters and events a tad too hard to follow. At many points during the movie I was baffled at why the characters did what they did. However if the point was to depict the chaotic life of people living on the streets and how they supposedly don't behave rationally this movie succeeded in that goal.The movie is defined as comedydramaromance. There were a few funny things I laughed I admit but not nearly enough to warrant a comedy definition. Mostly the movie was drama and romance. The drama was OK all the characters had problems with life and so on and they tried to cope with the difficult and unfair situations they encountered themselves in. The romance part...well not my thing here. I guess the movie tried to be provocative and probably was back in 1985 when it was first released but now it was just a bit silly. There was this dangerous love element in it and it just didn't work out. The script was no good and the actors quite stiff.Also the sounds were horrible. I don't even know how you can fail with 80's music but this movie did just that.If you are looking for a movie with such a love theme as this one I guess the movie will be OK for you as my wife informed me that the movie was OK but for me it was a pain to watch through.".

I don't even know how you can fail with 80's music but this movie did just that.If you are looking for a movie with such a love theme as this one I guess the movie will be OK for you as my wife informed me that the movie was OK but for me it was a pain to watch through.";

Ignominiously pensioned off he puts these strengths to good use in plotting a daring millionpound robbery.As an exmilitary man Hyde is aware that his operation cannot succeed without putting together a squad of the very best experts.

	schema:headline " A heist for the fun of it";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a heist film that really rises above the ante of its genre due to the motivations behind the main characters. The characters are all former army officers who were dismissed due to misconduct on their behalf with the exception of the mastermind behind the robbery who brings them all together. His name is Hyde and he was halfway to becoming a full colonel before the army forced him into retirement. He is separated from his wife and without army life he has nothing left to do. So for the fun of it rather than the money he organises a heist.The acting in the film is superb. The expressions that Jack Hawkins uses when playing Hyde signify that he is in it for the thrills rather than the loot. He looks on with joy rather than stern careful consideration as he and his men organise everything that they need to do. He is in power again since he is the head of the operation and since he knows that everyone who he picks will want to go along. All of his men are not only crooks but ones with financial problems. And as the only one with plenty of money and no criminal record he enjoys the idea that he can duck out at any time.The supporting actors also show in the end that they are enjoying their work. While initially in it for the money the return to army regulations  by which Hyde runs the operation  excites them. Nigel Patrick and Bryan Forbes are particularly good as the more suave members of the heist team. One problem though is that we never get to know the characters really well. They are defined by what we are told about them rather than their actions particularly with the Padre played by Roger Livesey. A former quartermaster he shows excitement at being able to take up the job again but he is given very limited screen time and his involvement with acts unbefiting a priest is oft mentioned but his personality rarely shows anything more than that he is just another one of the men.I find it rather odd that the film is marketed as a comedy. There is one section when they raid the army that is bouncing with humorous touches and Gerald Harper as a nervous army captain gives off an excellent performance. The rest of the film though only has the slightest edge of humour from Hyde badmouthing his wife to a rather awkwardly inserted cameo by Oliver Reed as a homosexual performer. The comedy is not important though and the plot is intriguing enough as it is but it does make the raiding the army section stand out as it jars the film's mood and style.If not flawless it is still a very well made film. The rousing grand music score is excellent not just because it fits well over the action but because it is sort of a parody of the scores of old war movies. The film looks great in black and white and some of the sequences are very well shot. One example that stands out in memory is a shot where the camera goes through the walls of two different rooms crabbing to the right and swooping a little bit almost like a person trying to not bump into a vase as he passes through a wall. The visual look of the film and the audio are just excellent and well suited to the interesting screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "Think of it as a fullscale military operation says involuntarily retired Colonel Hyde Jack Hawkins to cashiered exmajor Race Nigel Patrick. What chance has a bunch of ordinary civilians have against a trained armed and disciplined military group? Hyde did not for one moment like being forced into retirement after 25 years in the British army. He spent the last few days of active duty doing some research among personnel files. Now Hyde plans to get a bit of his own back...and Race along with six other former officers are going to be the means. The League of Gentlemen is a cynical stylish witty film about a bank heist carried out with the precision of a Swiss watch all thanks to Hyde's meticulous research. Among the seven men he recruits are Race charming shrewd imperturbable and a reliable secondin command...even if he does tend to call people old darling. Race was forced to resign his commission because of a bit of black marketeering. Mycroft Roger Livesey was a superb quartermaster who was discovered in a bit of gross indecency in a public place. Lexy Richard Attenborough a talented and crooked mechanic and whiz with radios was found to be selling secrets to the Russians. Porthill Bryan Forbes is always resourceful and is now a gigolo but was discovered to be shooting prisoners in Cyprus. The others all had problems with being weak or being discovered as one of those whose love dare not be spoken of or of being responsible for the deaths of men under them. But as Hyde points out they were all superbly trained officers and they all need money. Hyde brings them together with an anonymous invitation to lunch in the Maple Room of the elegant Cafe Royal. Included in the envelope is a copy of a book The Golden Fleece and half a fivepound note. After a fine lunch with a decent wine brandy cigars and the other half of the fiver Hyde gets down to business. The mission? They will rob a very big and well protected bank in the heart of central London make off with at least 100000 British pounds each and then live happily ever after. It will be called Operation Golden Fleece. With just a little reliance on greed selfinterest and perhaps a hint of coercion he recruits them. Before long we're deep into training and organizing setting up communications and stealing transport. In an amusing tense sequence almost good enough to be a movie itself they also bluff their way into an Army base and steal a substantial amount of arms. Do they actually pull off this complex heist that calls for splitsecond timing nerves as cold as ice and flawless teamwork. Well of course and we get to watch it happen. Do they get away to lead a life of leisure? You'll need to see the movie. Be prepared for a very funny appearance by a twit of an old comrade of Hyde's Bunny Warren Robert Coote and a twist which is handled with a stylish dollop of jaunty ruefulness. Jack Hawkins with that rough voice and nononsense face does a fine job as Hyde a man who can see the amusement in having few illusions. There is quite a collection of firstrate British actors in the men around Hawkins and they all are excellent. Bryan Forbes also wrote the screenplay. He was a clever actor who wrote and directed some fine movies among them The LShaped Room Seance on a Wet Afternoon and King Rat.".

	schema:headline " Great caper movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie fifty years ago. I loved it then and after seeing it on TCM love it now. The plot a disaffected English Army officer recruits other vets to pull off a heist. The Gimmick They are all exofficers of HisHer Majesty's armed forces so the caper is pulled off with military planning. Bonus Humor The lampooning of military life. I suspect that this film greatly amused many a British vet in 1960 just as Ocean's Eleven amused US audiences that same year. Fifteen years after WWII ended many men were having second thoughts about the value of service and the nature of honor and duty. The men carrying out this caper and this is a Caper Film like Topkapi or the Italian Job are all disaffected some turned to criminal ways. Jack Hawkins' character is not a criminal but has just been declared redundant by the British Army and forcibly retired after twentyfive tears of service. Add a failed marriage to that nicely drawn in a few lines of dialog and you have a man seeking some kind of satisfaction in his battle with Society just some kind of recognition that he is more than a nonentity. During the heist as Hawkins' car rolls down the street the camera shoots up to show us the buildings belonging to the great English newspapers of the day. Without any direct comment the camera has revealed some of Hawkins' motivation. This is a tight script written by Bryan Forbes the motorcyclist in the League even at two hours but all the stuff that wasn't developed is lightly traced in. I think that movie makers could study this work with profit.

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw this movie fifty years ago. I loved it then and after seeing it on TCM love it now. The plot a disaffected English Army officer recruits other vets to pull off a heist. The Gimmick They are all exofficers of HisHer Majesty's armed forces so the caper is pulled off with military planning. Bonus Humor The lampooning of military life. I suspect that this film greatly amused many a British vet in 1960 just as Ocean's Eleven amused US audiences that same year. Fifteen years after WWII ended many men were having second thoughts about the value of service and the nature of honor and duty. The men carrying out this caper and this is a Caper Film like Topkapi or the Italian Job are all disaffected some turned to criminal ways. Jack Hawkins' character is not a criminal but has just been declared redundant by the British Army and forcibly retired after twentyfive tears of service. Add a failed marriage to that nicely drawn in a few lines of dialog and you have a man seeking some kind of satisfaction in his battle with Society just some kind of recognition that he is more than a nonentity. During the heist as Hawkins' car rolls down the street the camera shoots up to show us the buildings belonging to the great English newspapers of the day. Without any direct comment the camera has revealed some of Hawkins' motivation. This is a tight script written by Bryan Forbes the motorcyclist in the League even at two hours but all the stuff that wasn't developed is lightly traced in. I think that movie makers could study this work with profit. As slow as some of the action might seem to American audiences now lots of dialog few explosions there is hardly a line or a shot that doesn't serve a purpose.

It's not only entertaining it also provides a fascinating glimpse of its era.However I do have a few niggles some of which constitute definite spoilers so if you haven't seen the film and don't wish to note them please read no further.At the lunch early in the film Hyde accuses all the assembled Gentlemen of being crooks of one sort or another. While most of them had certainly been up to no good during their time in the army and been punished accordingly the word crooks is hardly appropriate in their later civilian lives. Mycroft certainly and possibly Race and Lexy but Weaver and Porthill seem to be more or less blameless if in the latter case a bit disreputable and RutlandSmith's only crime anywhere seems to have been to have run up some embarrassing mess bills. Stevens' implied indulgence in homosexual acts while illegal at the time the film was made would hardly justify his being labelled a crook even then. I feel that some more convincing criminality could have been devised  perhaps beating up Hyde en masse after he had gone round the table insulting each in turn! To my mind the only real weakness in the film is the way they were caught. There are two reasons for this one regarding plot and the other structure. Firstly if I am correct they were rumbled because the policeman who visited their warehouse recorded for some unexplained reason the number of Hyde's car which the latter later used in the robbery. Its number was then noted by the small boy near the crime scene. Would such a meticulous planner as Hyde really have committed such a faux pas? The stolen car after all had its number changed so why not his? Or preferably would it not have been better  indeed obvious  not to have used his car at all? Secondly the sudden appearance of the boy taking car numbers jarred.It clearly had some relevance otherwise there was no need to include it and it indicated fairly clearly that it would somehow lead to the plan's ultimate failure.Something that has always worried me and which has doubtless occurred in real life certainly in the GTR of 1963 but which the film does not address was the fact that the taking of huge numbers of used notes inevitably led to the group taking their share of the loot in that form. We were not told how much was eventually seized but on the basis of the estimated million divided by eight it would be 125K each. Nowadays depending on which inflation index one uses that would need to be say around 2.5 million and would need rather more than one suitcase each see my later comment on a remake but even the 1960 amount of physical cash would have posed difficult logistical problems for the robbers. Where to store it in the meantime and then how to deal with it for instance. Even allowing for client confidentiality banks and other financial institutions would knowing that a huge robbery had taken place be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at sudden appearances of large sums in previously threadbare or nonexistent accounts. Few would mind the problem but it would need to be solved.Others have criticised the film for not allowing the crime to succeed though most accept that the moral climate at the time would not have permitted it. I think that that is true but I also think that it was not the only reason. If the film had stopped at the postheist party with Oh well thanks for everything gentlemen enjoy the money THE END it would hardly have met the need for a strong ending. Really they had to be caught if only for dramatic effect.Finally I can accept Colonel Hyde grubbing around in the sewers surrounding the bank sadly that manhole cover has gone now in order to check on the subterranean situation but would he really have done so in evening dress and with his Rolls parked over the road advertising his presence? Oh wait though. He was very careless with his car numbers wasn't he? Finally finally! I note the tediously inevitable call for a remake. For heaven's sake why? TLOG ain't perfect but what film is? PLEASE think of that ghastly remake of The Ladykillers and leave well alone.".

They're all in urgent need of funds. And they all got into some kind of trouble in the British Army during or after the war. He enlists their aid in a complicated bank robbery something along the lines of earlier Ealing comedies like The Lavender Hill Mob but not at all slapstick.It's an amusing movie. Much of the humor is subdued. You need to listen carefully. The musical score during the mostly silent robbery for instance sounds like it's ripped off from the dramatic chords of Miklos Rozsa in The Asphalt Jungle. But the film is most engaging in its clever dialog by Bryan Forbes.When Hawkins first calls the robbers together for a meeting Your presence here confirms my disbelief in the goodness of human nature.And when Hawkins is climbing the stairs past the portrait of a beautiful woman one of the conspirators asks if that's his wife. Yes. Is she dead? No. I regret to say the bitch is still going strong. It reminded me at times of the TV series The Avengers although without the whimsy and not nearly so stylish. In the opening shot a manhole cover on a filthy wet street is slowly moved aside and Hawkins emerges from it in an immaculate suit crosses the street steps into his Rolls and drives away. Yet it hangs together better than The Avengers because the plot is grounded in reality and the narrative builds on itself. It's all done according to military procedures. First the objective is outlined then the guns must be stolen then the vehicles and so forth. The ending is a downer because although all these fellows are flawed in some way and Hawkins himself seems a little nuts at times we've gotten to know them and want them to succeed. Of course they can't.Impressive cast too. None of them get to do much except gentlemanly things. There are small parts for Nigel Greene and Oliver Reed does a brief but hilarious number as a nancy boy.".

Roger Livesey is a part time deviate who was kicked out of the service for gross indecency. Hawkins as Hyde throws a luncheon for this group and some others that will make up his gang. In a great sequence he demolishes the facade each of his gang have built to shield themselves from their past. The rest of the film concentrates on a daring bank robbery the group planned.".

On the American side was Ocean's Eleven the first and best of the Rat Pack film where Frank Sinatra and his ringading army pals try to rob five casinos in Las Vegas. And on the British side was Jack Hawkins recruiting The League Of Gentlemen for a caper of his own.We never learn the reason why Hawkins is so disgruntled but I'm sure it was a good one. And unlike Sinatra who recruited friends Hawkins did some meticulous research and came up with seven total strangers all of whom had disgraced the uniform in some manner. With all their resumes in front of him Hawkins is sure he's found his crew. And they include Nigel Patrick Roger Livesey Richard Attenborough Bryan Forbes Kieron Moore Terence Alexander and Norman Bird.Ocean's Eleven depended on the chemistry of the players and since all there were buddies in good standing with Sinatra it had a casual kind of feeling even during the scenes of the actual robbery. In The League Of Gentlemen it was a different kind of chemistry as Hawkins forges a unit together. Not without problems because these guys are by definition individualists who did not take kindly to military discipline in the first place. Besides Hawkins who seemed to like the idea of being back in the army so to speak the best performances were from Nigel Patrick as the most individual of the lot who gives Hawkins some reasonable concern and Roger Livesey. I don't think Livesey's character would have been allowed on the American cinema as the Code was still in place. He plays a disgraced and defrocked chaplain. When we meet all of them in their dwellings as they get the mysterious invitation to join Hawkins at his club we see they don't exactly have the best domestic situations going. Part of why they were easy to recruit.This one has to rank as one of Jack Hawkins's stellar cinematic efforts. And it holds up very well for today's audience.".

Why? When one looks at these films a person with any foresight can see that the project is one difficult to make interesting.It sounds interesting when five or six friends talk about the idea but to the smartest in the group it will look like what it is a dead end.It's just hard to make something like this interesting.Five Against the House was fairly dull. Sinatra's original Ocean group was worse than boring. It was the pillar of tedium. And we know there were many charismatic actors in that film. It isn't the actors it is the idea that is lame and it requires superb writing and directing to make it even partly bearable.Hawkins and crew are an asset. This role really fits a presence like Hawkins more than a charismatic everyman like Sinatra.The writing and directing are what make this a success though. In an urban situated film it is extremely hard to find settings that aren't dull. Ocean's 11 failed horribly there.Here we get some better scenery. Even the city shots are quick moving with not too much emphasis on the ordinary or traffic. And much of it is during the dramatic smoke screen.The characters are way more interesting than Ocean's characters. And the plot is written better. We never knew what was going on in Ocean but here there is a logical even if far fetched course.In Ocean we were expected to exalt some characters for no reason. It was as though they were in their own little world. The audience had to exalt them because they were Sinatra Davis Martin Silva.But here the characters don't put on airs unless it is demanded. They come across as much more alive and identifiable and a million times more interesting. Men of mystery are men of mystery because they don't act mysterious. Those who do look like goofballs.So while Ocean's goofballs fail this group conjures up a bit of interest. You can actually watch the film start to finish. You can't do that with Ocean.".

	schema:reviewBody "Today most films have a structure so simple you can abstract it in one mere sentence. Diva is not such a film it has so much plot that I don't know where to begin. Maybe I'll begin with the two tapes the film is all about. Tape one is the bootleg record of the beautiful aria Ebben ne andro lontana from Alfredo Catalani's opera La Wally taped during the recital of the famous opera singer Cynthia Hawkins. On tape two Nadja a prostitute discloses who is the man behind a prostitution ring. The man who possesses these two tapes is Jules a postman tape one because he's the one who recorded it for private use only of course tape two because Nadja slipped it into his bag just seconds before she's killed. Not really knowing why Jules finds himself fleeing from the police and from the mob because of the latter tape  and since Cynthia Hawkins always refused to make tape recordings of her voice two guys from the Taiwanese mafia who sat just behind Jules when he recorded his bootleg see their chance to make a fortune with it try to get it and blackmail the diva.Meanwhile Jule becomes friends with Cynthia Hawkins when he brings her back a dress he stole after her recital but not after having sex with a hooker wearing it and they spend a day together. He also encounters Alba a nice glib girl with a talent for shoplifting she developed a technique that makes you wish you're the guy behind the counter and Gorodish the man she lives with two people who will help him a lot in the course of the film. All this is handled by director JeanJacques Beineix with virtuosity. But I'm only talking about the twisted plot here whereas Diva is so much more.It is its popart style it is its unique genremix of Thriller and Romance it is Jules' apartment which looks like combination of a studio and a garage it is its two killers who look like they escaped a Jeunetfilm and indeed Dominique Pinon who plays one of the two killers went on to star in Delicatessen La cit des enfants perdus and Amlie it is that wonderful chase scene where Jules drives down the stairs and takes the Mtro with his moped it is that absurdly funny scene with the blue Beethoven bust it is Thuy An Luu playing Alba as a cheerful girl that makes you wish you had a girlfriend like that it is Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez a reallife opera singer in her only film role playing a wonderful Cynthia Hawkins how I love that look she gives when someone reminds her of her age it is Gorodish ingeniously solving two problems at once it is its wonderful ending I will not reveal her with the perfect last words Shhhh listen...... I could go on with this list forever. With its hilarious story its beautiful images its weird characters and its joyous direction Diva could open the door to the cinema of the rest of the world for those whose Top 10 list consist only of films as Pulp Fiction Taxi Driver Goodfellas The Usual Suspects or The Godfather. It is a film I immensely love and could watch over and over again.".

	onyx:emotionText "Today most films have a structure so simple you can abstract it in one mere sentence. Diva is not such a film it has so much plot that I don't know where to begin. Maybe I'll begin with the two tapes the film is all about. Tape one is the bootleg record of the beautiful aria Ebben ne andro lontana from Alfredo Catalani's opera La Wally taped during the recital of the famous opera singer Cynthia Hawkins. On tape two Nadja a prostitute discloses who is the man behind a prostitution ring. The man who possesses these two tapes is Jules a postman tape one because he's the one who recorded it for private use only of course tape two because Nadja slipped it into his bag just seconds before she's killed. Not really knowing why Jules finds himself fleeing from the police and from the mob because of the latter tape  and since Cynthia Hawkins always refused to make tape recordings of her voice two guys from the Taiwanese mafia who sat just behind Jules when he recorded his bootleg see their chance to make a fortune with it try to get it and blackmail the diva.Meanwhile Jule becomes friends with Cynthia Hawkins when he brings her back a dress he stole after her recital but not after having sex with a hooker wearing it and they spend a day together.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched 'Diva' the other day for the first time in at least fifteen years and it really held up. Long regarded as a pivotal 1980s art film it has influenced many subsequent film makers in advertising and music videos. I'd say Ridley Scott was aware of it when he shot 'Blade Runner' and that opens up a whole can of worms. One could argue that 'Diva' though by no means science fiction was a strong influence on William Gibson and other cyberpunk writers. Director Beineix is probably best know for the erotic classic 'Betty Blue' but this is a much more original and interesting movie. Beineix uses every trick in the book to make this movie visually stunning but the plot is also strong concerning the confusion between tapes of an Opera singer who abhors recordings and evidence which can nail a corrupt cop. A young messenger Frederic Andrei gets caught up in this mistake and his life is soon at risk. Along the way he also comes to have an odd relationship with the singer in question Wilhelmenia Fernandez as well as a strange art student cum shoplifter Thuy An Luu. Nothing is straightforward in 'Diva' but it is consistently watchable. Keep an eye out for JeanPierre Jeunet regular Dominique Pinot as a cool looking punk thug and also the outstanding motorcycle sequence. A very good movie. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanJacques Beineix's first film is a quirky colorful pop mixture of action romance music and fairy tale that is based on a pop novel by Delacorta. The story concerns a young French postal delivery boy named Jules who is also an opera lover  a big fan of the beautiful eccentric African American diva Cynthia Hawkins who is performing in Paris when the movie opens. Ms. Hawkins played by opera singer Wilhelmenia Fernandez refuses to sing for recordings and this quirk of hers is what sets the action of the movie moving. Jules decides to tape Hawkins in performance after which he goes backstage to meet the diva and promptly steals the gown she wore at the concert which he sometimes uses as a scarf when its not hanging in a shrine he has made to her in his large loft filled with disgarded cars. The plot really gets tangled when Jules while on his way to a delivery witnesses the murder of a barefooted young woman who is carrying a tape that has a lot of plot and secrets on it. Who is she and why does she wind up with an icepick in her back is one of the movie's many enjoyable plot devices that slowly unravels as the film goes on. While on her way to the icepick the lady drops her tape unknown to him at the timein Jules delivery pouch and the chase so to speak is on. Jules charmingly played by Frederic Andrei is not only in danger from the very creepy killers of the lady but also from two shady Japanese record producers who want his pirated tape of Hawkins beautiful aria from La Wally that Jules recorded. Very much influenced by American crime thrillers  film noir but very much it's own film Diva is a delight from the very beginning to the beautiful ending which takes place on an empty stage and always moves me to shed a few tears. One of the terrific things about Diva is it's lively cast of characters all wonderfully played. Thuy An Luu as the young  sexy Vietnamese model Alba is most winning as the companion of the strange  seemingly very wealthy recluse played by the great Richard Bohringer. These are characters and performances to embrace they make one feel good. There are many wonderful set pieces including a quite amazing chase on motorbike through the Paris metro a stroll in the early morning hours around Paris with Jules and Hawkins and of course the gorgous singing of Ms. Fernandez. Beautifully photographed by Philippe Rousselot this is one of the highlights of 1982 and among the very best of the decade. The newly released and happily restored DVD does justice to the film both in the quality of the picture and sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Diva I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night years later and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much.Diva is a very stylish very esoteric very French film. So if any of those descriptions scare you you might end up hating it. On the flip side beware if you're a hardcore art film fan because this movie is also a straightforward crimeaction flick. So if the phrase action flick makes you cringe you might end up hating it also. In other words Diva straddles the worlds of Godard Contempt and Michael Bay The Transformers. And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme.The plot based on the 1979 novel Diva by Daniel Odier is about a young mopedriding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The Diva in the title is an opera singer who is played and even more impressively sung by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of La Wally as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape which is wanted by the corporate suits who are chasing our hero who is also running from gangsters who want a different tape he has.If the plot sounds tricky perhaps comical that's because it is. There are a lot of twists turns crisscrosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags there are some bits of humor and overthetop characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be I hate cops I hate Beethoven I hate parking decks and so forth stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes.But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic stylish presentation. Directed by JeanJacques Beneix this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s known as cinma du look. This style is characterized by nonnaturalistic selfconscious aesthetics notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery artificial redpink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a highcontrast Kubrickian white.Everyone in this movie is cool. Like toocoolforschool cool. It glorifies classical music fans gangsters hipsters rich folks poor folks Americans Koreans French kleptomaniacs prostitutes good guys bad guys and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control.Add to that the creative camera shots for example lots of reflections in the bad guys' sunglasses or in the hubcap of a car etc and there you definitely have stylish.The music is artistic but artistic in a very 80s sort of way almost pop a little bit cheezy at times but still cool. And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from La Wally is gorgeous and the film opens with a generous musiconly scene where we can truly enjoy it.So upon my 2nd viewing I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece Betty Blue 372 le matin which digs much deeper into poetry and character development while sacrificing the intense plot that Diva has.I would compare Diva to the more plotoriented films of Wim Wenders Faraway So Close Until the End of the World End of Violence and Ridley Scott of the 80s Black Rain Someone to Watch Over Me ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one singing La Wally. With Diva's exaggerated colors and large sets I might also compare it to the visual stylevisuals onlyof JeanPierre Jeunet City of Lost Children Amelie Tom Tykwer Winter Sleepers Run Lola Run and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno Ritual. There might even be a dash of Kieslowski The Double Life of Veronique Three Colors. If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned you should give Diva a shot. And if you hate it the first time be sure to try it again a few years later.".

And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from La Wally is gorgeous and the film opens with a generous musiconly scene where we can truly enjoy it.So upon my 2nd viewing I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece Betty Blue 372 le matin which digs much deeper into poetry and character development while sacrificing the intense plot that Diva has.I would compare Diva to the more plotoriented films of Wim Wenders Faraway So Close Until the End of the World End of Violence and Ridley Scott of the 80s Black Rain Someone to Watch Over Me ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one singing La Wally. With Diva's exaggerated colors and large sets I might also compare it to the visual stylevisuals onlyof JeanPierre Jeunet City of Lost Children Amelie Tom Tykwer Winter Sleepers Run Lola Run and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno Ritual. There might even be a dash of Kieslowski The Double Life of Veronique Three Colors. If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned you should give Diva a shot. And if you hate it the first time be sure to try it again a few years later.";

As a viewer I was submersed in a new and different reality one that was visually stunning intriguing and edgy.  The submersion was achieved both visually and with the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.The colors man the colors... Diva included many beautiful shot scenes with intense colors and dramatic lighting.  There are several shots the stills of which could be turned into farmable artwork.  At the time I was thinking they would make great dormroom posters.I think Diva has had a lasting influence on cinematography.  You may have noticed that movies TV shows and especially advertisements have moved to be very color intense.  Dramatic lighting showing sharp contrasting hues are the norm.  Diva was the first film I can remember with rich color saturation made intentionally to make this type of artistic impression.Another movie whose cinematography was likely influenced by Diva is Betty Blue 1986.".

Previous French films in the 1970's were darker and moodier more pretentious in many ways and a lot more philosophicalintellectually serious in their arthouse endeavor. But Diva is a combination of arthouse comedy and thriller made up in a colorful fabric of cinematography nuanced acting beautiful music and an engaging story. It's deluxe look employs many of the advertisement gimmicks from popular 1980's French magazines. It's a slow moving movie so for anyone seeing it for the first time it should feel as long as any foreign film usually does. The topping on the artsy cake is Italian opera  the constant use of the soprano aria Ebben N'andro lontano from Catalani's La Wally is forever linked to this movie. The French cultural signature is on this but it's nothing heavy. It does lead up to a climatic finale and has all the ingredients of the typical thriller fiction  detectives trying to locate the bad guy and bring him to justice. There are chases both by car and foot attempted murder and a murder and the seedier side of Paris prostitution drugs white slavery poverty despite the genuine goodness of the lead characters. It's a movie that seems to want to emulate modern American movies especially in its touches of comedy and comic relief and in the attitudes of the characters who despite being youth of the 1980's also seem to be reminders of counterculture from the 1960's and 1970's free spirited hippieintellectuals.Set in President Mitterand's early 1980's Paris the film follows what appears to be an episode in the life of a poor bohemian dreamer and postal worker Jules Frederic Andrei. His romantic obsession for the AfricanAmerican opera singer Cynthia Hawkins Wilhelmenia Fernandez leads him to secretly tape record her singing voice at a Paris concert. His intentions are pure. He wants to keep a memento of her and to have access to her beautiful voice from his own home. He also boldly steals one of her expensive gowns this out of sexual longing like stealing a woman's panties. But before long he finds himself involved in a plot involving a murdered prostitute two police detectives and the head of a drug cartel and prostitution ring. The recording also featured the confession of the prostitute who was murdered who had sought to expose a corrupt Police Captain who had been operating as prostitution ring from Africa and Paris. This forces Jules to become involved in a sticky situation and he's soon being hunted by both the cops and the baddies each trying to get that tape that's in his possession. It also calls for the eponymous diva who has long refused to make recordings to consider finally recording her voice to save herself.Among the characters that compose the good guy group are Gorodish Richard Bohringer and his Vietnamese lover Alba Thuy An Luu who is a kind of chic thief and bohemian girl. Gorodish is a loner lives in a large but unfurnished loft where he is constantly meditating to lowbass New Age music and thinking of strange things like trying to stop the ocean waves. Jules is himself an artist and collects through theft various objects which he uses for artwork a la Andy Warhol. Strangely enough it's this strange poor prophet who saves Jules' lives when it's endangered by the Mafiatype men who seek to destroy the tape he made. But even these bad guys Gerard Darmon and Dominique Pinon are straight of comedy as Le Cure constantly expresses his hatred of garages police and everything. The comedy is in the perfectly timed dialogue scenes. This is also a cop movie. Jean and Nadia Jacques Fabbri and Chantal Deruaz are a malefemale detective duo who are hot on the trail of the men responsible for killing the hooker and eventually discover the police Captain's corrupt alter ego.Perhaps the most touching aspect of the film is the romance. Jules and Cynthia Hawkins have a connection  opera. Jules is an opera connoisseur and admires Cynthia so much he followed her from Paris to Munich always on his mini bikemotorcyclemobilette. He is physically drawn to her but they don't engage in sexual activity not even after what seems to be a romantic date. Cynthia is a proud black artist probably modeled after real life 80's divas like Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle who believes that business ought to work its way around art. She has integrity and refuses to be part of a commercial enterprise and to sell out. A more romantic and yet restrained and sober relationship on film you'll be hardpressed to find. I enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to any French culture class. This is one of the early masterpieces of French cinema du look from the 1980's.".

As it turned out Pinon seems also to have had an almost as healthy working relationship with another French maverick filmmaker JeanJacques Beineix. Pinon's grumpy taciturn nononsense characterization of a hitman named Priest is just one of the considerable pleasures gleaned from this entrancing film.Anyway I was happy to confirm that Beineix's famed featurelength directorial debut is every bit as good as its reputation would suggest. I'm no fan of opera but the repeated lyrical song in the film and the formidable rendition of it by reallife opera singer Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez becomes its emotional core. It must be said that DIVA does move at a deliberate pace and the complex plotline which at times involves six different people chasing our hero! needs the viewer's full attention but the film is nevertheless an exciting funny romantic and at times magical experience conducted with a disarming touch of irony and flawless flair by Beineix apart from featuring a couple of breathtaking chase sequences and a plethora of other thrills it manages to perfectly capture the drudgery of the life of an obsessive fan who at first is content simply to live in the shadow of his diva compulsively listening to his pirated recording of a live performance he had attended but as the film progresses gets increasingly enmeshed not only in the private life of his idol but also in the sleazy Parisian underworld of drugdealing prostitution hit men and police corruption. As I said before DIVA delivers not only in the action stakes  including the murder of a barefooted key witness that must surely be a nod to Cloris Leachman's turn in Robert Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY 1955  but also deliberates on the perennial battle between the integrity of an artist and the commercial exploitation of art and the illusory starfan relationship to which us avid filmgoers are certainly no strangers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned this movie flirts with several but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic full of corruption and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings and when word gets out that such a recording exists different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden considering that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clichs buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non convention. It puts character before character type and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing and I've been there. One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet execpt when necessary. This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a nonHollywood thriller Diva is exceptional but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted not too messy but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture but it ain't a dull one either.".

A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings and when word gets out that such a recording exists different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden considering that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clichs buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non convention. It puts character before character type and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing and I've been there. One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet execpt when necessary. This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a nonHollywood thriller Diva is exceptional but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted not too messy but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture but it ain't a dull one either.";

	schema:reviewBody "If one considers this as a whiteknuckle thriller contingent on its narrative coherence DIVA Beineix's groundbreaking feature debut is not a qualified specimen but by retrospect it is a pioneer piece of work which commences a specific style in French cinema from 1980s CINMA DU LOOK where a lurid visual approach presides over the essential narrative exemplified by Luc Besson Leos Carax and of course Beineix himself.To each his own but there is a difference between foundering on fabricating a plausible storyline and discarding the conventional narrative arc in preference to its stylish extravaganza. Unfortunately I consider DIVA is a case of former not just because the source material Delacorta's novel is firmly grounded in its entangled involvements of two tapes an intrepid postman Jules Andri who is a fervid opera fan of singer Cynthia Hawkins Fernandez a drug cartel and prostitution ring in Paris the inept police department a Taiwanese gang who deals with pirate tapes and a mysterious man Serge Gorodish Bohringer with his young Vietnamese lover Alba Luu who phlegmatically keeps the upper hand of the dangerous game. More critically it is a film deceptively imposes itself as an intriguing police procedural and catandmouse chaser only during the creative process as if Beineix had lost the competence to juxtapose these paralleled happenings and commotions with a probable consistence so he would opt out of the imbroglio and execute a visuallyimpressive strategy instead to dispatch the task in order to shift the focus from viewers. The sentimental but fickle affinity between Jules and Cynthia is virtually has no bearing in the main plot at all yet it is the most enthralling part as the title infers we are more tempted to peek the highstrung temperament of a real diva than a shoddily concocted heroic actioner to disintegrate a criminal cartel established by an evil police officer.The reallife American soprano Ferandez's rendition of Alfredo Catalani's LA WALLY the only masterpiece he made during his shortened lifespan is divine and instantly keeps audience hooked but as a drama actress her bent is pretty limited the rest of the dramatis personae is no better save the enigmatic Bohringer Serge is a badly written character in the story ludicrously becomes an omnipresent lastminute saviour and a crafty criminal himself but what is his backstory? Living in a huge apartment with an eyeopening parade of postpop art one might want to watch an entire movie solely based on his exotic way of life with Alba.Equipped with a neonlit pizazz its fixation on opera and female nudity all I can say is that DIVA deserves to be a niche in a time capsule for epitomising the zeitgeist of its time when most of us have no mood to revisit in spite of being obtrusively garish and full of far fetched whims in its vein.".

The sentimental but fickle affinity between Jules and Cynthia is virtually has no bearing in the main plot at all yet it is the most enthralling part as the title infers we are more tempted to peek the highstrung temperament of a real diva than a shoddily concocted heroic actioner to disintegrate a criminal cartel established by an evil police officer.The reallife American soprano Ferandez's rendition of Alfredo Catalani's LA WALLY the only masterpiece he made during his shortened lifespan is divine and instantly keeps audience hooked but as a drama actress her bent is pretty limited the rest of the dramatis personae is no better save the enigmatic Bohringer Serge is a badly written character in the story ludicrously becomes an omnipresent lastminute saviour and a crafty criminal himself but what is his backstory? Living in a huge apartment with an eyeopening parade of postpop art one might want to watch an entire movie solely based on his exotic way of life with Alba.Equipped with a neonlit pizazz its fixation on opera and female nudity all I can say is that DIVA deserves to be a niche in a time capsule for epitomising the zeitgeist of its time when most of us have no mood to revisit in spite of being obtrusively garish and full of far fetched whims in its vein.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jules Frderic Andri doesn't need any of the assorted divas that the world bows down to. The other lonely young men of the Earth's population have Donna Summer Diana Ross Cher. He could laugh at their mainstream appeal their obsession with dancingvoguing the night away at the nearest discothque. But he's much too shy and straight for that nonsense. Instead of waiting for a Madonna of some kind to help him shimmy down the dance floor for the rest of his young life he opts for Cynthia Hawkins Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez an opera star renowned for her glamor and exquisite singing voice. Cynthia is a diva no doubt but she is Jules' diva. As she hates the idea of the business side of music she has never recorded a performance or heaven forbid an LP. So one only has the option to see her live. The few that know of her don't just listen watch they change as a human. They leave a concert with a completely new romanticized outlook on life.At least that's how Jules regards her. A massive poster of Cynthia's stunning face rests next to his bed acting as guidance when she holds a recital near his home he not only steals one of her dresses  he also captures her performance on a professional quality audio recorder. These acts are not out of malice but of desperation. He lives the life of a lonely postman having little to cling onto besides his beloved diva.As the film opens nothing is at stake. Cut just a few minutes into Diva though and you'll find Jules going from nobody to human target in a dramatic flash and bang. Attending the very same concert are two Taiwanese gangsters who takes notice of Jules' cunning. He becomes a danger to himself as they would do anything to get their paws on the priceless recording. But things don't end there. The following day when performing his usual mail route a prostitute Chantal Deruaz killed moments later drops a cassette in his moped's carrier pouch. That cassette as it so happens bears a story that could spell the death sentence for an important law enforcement figure. Also complicating Jules' situation are a flirtatious Vietnamese gigi Thuy An Luu and her mysterious lover Richard Bohringer who have decidedly unclear motives.On its surface Diva appears to be a De Palma meets Godard visual orgy but after you cut through its many layers of innovative celebratory stylistic cues you'll find yourself infatuated with its quasiconvoluted yet simple story of intrigue. Here is a film deserving of applause for its nearperfect courtship of style and story. Diva is an obvious cinematic enchilada of all your favorite thriller delicacies but it is also so much more than that. Though it was the directorial debut for the now cinema du look defining JeanJacques Beineix it is so assured in its every decision that we feel as though our lives are being manipulated by something akin to a roller coaster safety controlled but also headspinningly unpredictable.Beinix likes to toy with us and for once obeying the puppet master proves advantageous. Look at the climactic wildly implausible moped vs. police car chase for instance. It takes detours down stairs through narrow alleyways and into the subway. It's all fantasy pulp but Beineix's extravagant fondling of the camera makes it all seem possible. That's a sign of a good film making sheer artificiality seem real. He is a visual poet of the highest common denominator.His images speak louder than words. The opening focusing on the concert flips back and forth between the complexions of Jules through medium shots Cynthia through awestruck closefar angles and the gangsters. We know that Jules will be the hero Cynthia the lovely female lead because cinematographer Philippe Rousselot handles their faces their bodies with transfixed appreciation. The criminals by contrast are only judged by their sunglasses which the camera sees as a defining feature. The scene contains no dialogue unless you count Fernandez's soul stirring voice. But it develops the characters slyly and imaginatively. And other characters such as the childish Vietnamese girl and her boyfriend or loverfather figurespiritual leader? live in a loft defined by its blue saturation and sparse furniture. The way their motives remain foggy throughout the movie how they retreat in the apartment as though it were a rich pop artist's oasis away from the European world makes them seem otherworldly completely invincible ageless.Though Diva is extremely stylish it contains a staggering amount of evocative performances. Andri possesses a youthful quality that makes him indefinable and difficult to dislike Fernandez in her only film role lives up to the title of the diva and acts as an impossibly knowing appealing obsession. Luu is agreeably strange and pixieish while Bohringer stays simultaneously trustworthy and untrustworthy  he is stupendously enigmatic.Some have said that Diva has better visuals than it does actual story but such an assumption undermines Beineix's mastery. He finds a deft balance between artistic and tonal strength through his visual ticks and plot implausibilities. It is a wild ride a thriller ready to delight through its giddy unconformity.".

It has a complex plot that is followed and achieved by quirky sometimes inexplicable characters but most importantly it has 'the look'.  Because of this it is difficult to see this film as what it is today a dated onceshiny nowworn toy that provided memorable hours of challenge and amusement many years ago.  The visual aesthetic of 'Diva' is flawlessly crafted and smooth yet perfectly selfconscious.  And it provides a curiously interesting background for a slightly bizarre plot that maintains its strange allure on subsequent viewings.  The film that is composed of these elements then is one that is wellremembered and for good reasons. There are few films that I have seen that have such a sleek appearance yet manage to interest beyond the superficial and even fewer that manage to maintain this interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following on the release of The Ark of Truth Continuum is the second Stargate SG1 movie to come to DVD. Unlike Ark of Truth Continuum is not potentially weighed down by having to overtly tie up loose ends left by the series. While in fact it does tie up a few loose ends rather nicely it also does something else it brings Stargate SG1 full circle.The plot is classic SG1 the last of the system lords Ba'al played by the ever villainous Cliff Simon is about to be executed with SG1 and Jack O'Neill in attendance. Suddenly people start disappearing and SG1 members Daniel Jackson Samantha Carter and Cameron Mitchell flee through the Stargate to a world where the Stargate never made it to America just before World War II thanks to Ba'al meddling with history. After facing alternate versions of people they know and being dismissed Earth comes under attack from Ba'al his queen Qetesh aka Vala and his first prime Teal'c. The team must find out how Ba'al changed history and put it rightor else. Writer Brad Wright brings together two of the series' best threads time travel and the threat of Goa'uld invasion together to bring the series not only full circle but what could also be called SG1's greatest hits.One of Continuums biggest pluses is that it brings the original cast back together. Richard Dean Anderson appears once again as General Jack O'Neill and while he does not appear in the entire film his presence his certainly welcome and makes for a great addition to the film. Also returning for this film is the SGC's original leader General Hammond. The late Don S. Davis makes his final appearance as Hammond in the film's alternate time line and while it's a shame that he doesn't know the team in those scenes his appearance like O'Neill's is a welcome addition to the film.The big thrill of Continuum is watching familiar characters in the alternate time line. It is here more then anywhere else that the film brings the series full circle. We get to see the Goa'uld system lords back together again even SG1's first nemesis Apophis in a surprise appearance. On top of the alternate versions of Teal'c Vala Hammond and O'Neill we get to meet alternate versions of Hank Landry and President Henry Hayes. Landry is played masterfully by Beau Bridges who is able to make the lines between the real and alternate Landry's almost indistinguishable. Hayes played by William Devane and last seen in SG1's seventh season finale Lost City is much the same as the real version we've met before skeptical at first and then forced to face the incredible with a brave face. Their appearances are what separates Continuum from Ark of Truth and marks an improvement.The film also makes a fine blend of the cerebral and action sequences. While ostensibly an action story Continuum also takes moments to explore on the personal level the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different. Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG1 could be at its best intelligent and yet action packed.The standout aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography special effects and music. The location filming in the Arctic done in below zero temperatures is amazing beautiful and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively lowbudget film it's an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale. Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film's highlights the special effects. From dozens if not hundreds of Goa'uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets the special effects in Continuum continue SG1's proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen. Then there's Joel Goldsmiths' score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film. Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the directtoDVD scifi films released all the time.Continuum is not only an excellent addition to SG1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography effects and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure. Continuum may well the end of SG1 and if it is Continuum is it going out on top.".

While ostensibly an action story Continuum also takes moments to explore on the personal level the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different. Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG1 could be at its best intelligent and yet action packed.The standout aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography special effects and music. The location filming in the Arctic done in below zero temperatures is amazing beautiful and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively lowbudget film it's an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale. Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film's highlights the special effects. From dozens if not hundreds of Goa'uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets the special effects in Continuum continue SG1's proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen. Then there's Joel Goldsmiths' score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film. Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the directtoDVD scifi films released all the time.Continuum is not only an excellent addition to SG1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography effects and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure. Continuum may well the end of SG1 and if it is Continuum is it going out on top.";

The verdict? Two words people.It's Good!Continuum redeems the whole SG1 movies idea. True Ark of Truth wasn't such a hard act to follow but this goes above and beyond the better than the first film label. It's a true SG1 story like we used to get'em in the first seasons. Plenty of adventure they can't seem to get a break throughout the whole film interspersed with the small moments we loved throughout the series the oneliners yes Jack's got some lines but most come from Mitchell the technobabble Sam still doesn't get to finish a phrase wo being interrupted the hard choices. And a taste of the good old Goa'uld arrogance we all know and love to boot.The characters each get their spotlight moment. Mitchell shines throughout indeed this seemed to be a movie made to show he well and truly belongs to SG1 outside the Ori arc as well. Daniel gets his moments as well as Sam and we get to see both of them interact with Jack once again! On the Goa'uld front we are treated to a whole parade of former system lords pretty much anyone you can think of. Baal of course is his usual charming evil self. And we get a great new villain in the person of Quetesh who personifies the perfect Goa'uld queen subservient doublefaced deadly. Almost wish she'd been there for the first seasons of the show! The quality is very good most scenes would have done very well on a big screen. Effects great but then that's nothing new. In short this movie delivers what it promised an epic SG1 adventure and a great character show. I'd originally given it 8 stars but by comparison to Ark of Truth it gets an extra one. Totally worth the money can't wait to own the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "You may find reviews of 'Stargate Continuum' inflated because of its contrast to the preceding 'Ark of Truth'. Whereas 'Ark' was in many ways but not completely a huge disappointment 'Continuum' is and does everything 'Ark' failed at the plot genuinely grips you and is in no way linear it surprises you twists unexpectedly rolls back on itself and weaves several arcs together just like any good story should there's genuine fantastic character development and a deepened attention to detail and realism. Take your pick on one of the best ever 'Stargate SG1' episodes and imagine it being given the royal featurelength treatment. 'Continuum' finally realises this notion without the symptoms of a clumsy transition between 42minute episodes and an attempted epic that 'Ark' suffered from.For any of you who are new to the Stargate franchise I will provide a brief explanation  but thankfully 'Continuum' doesn't make 'Ark's mistake of being incomprehensible for someone who hasn't watched Stargate for 10 years. The Goa'uld are a snakelike race of aliens who implant themselves inside humans thereby taking total control of their bodies. Some of these aliens have amassed huge power controlling vast fleets of ships and armies of Jaffa warriors by using various technologies to give the impression that they are gods. Known as the System Lords they have been conquering the galaxy for millennia. Near the end of 'Stargate SG1' the System Lords were all but defeated  except for the most cunning Ba'al who managed to clone himself in an attempt to render himself unstoppable. 'Continuum' picks up after our heroes SG1  the primary fivestrong team taking orders from the U.S. Government to counter such intergalactic threats  believe they have the last Ba'al remaining.But Ba'al is tricky as ever and as ever Cliff Simon plays him with a delicious mix of scheming genius elaborate malice and exuberant vanity that has made Ba'al the villain we love to hate and hate to love. Indeed Cliff Simon gives his singularly best performance of Ba'al to date and is without a doubt the star of the show. In one dedicated extended excruciatingly well written and delivered sequence Ba'al's character is really given a playground with the featurelength treatment he's always deserved if you know Ba'al already you won't be able to stop grinning if you don't you will fall hopelessly in love. This scene is rivalled only by one of the tensest hostage sequences I've ever seen on a film.In 'Continuum' SG1 probably faces the toughest trials it ever has causing the usually gentlemannered Daniel Jackson to exclaim in profanities twice throughout the film. Initially this shocked me as care is usually taken to ensure Stargate productions can be watched by all ages  but actually this elevation of maturity really added some welcome grit to the story and is matched by a handful of graphic gory killings. This grittiness is enhanced by the aforementioned attention to realism that a fulllength movie allows time for. In your typical Stargate episode being stuck in an ice cavern isn't all too bad  you'll find your way out soon enough. In 'Continuum' this entails that there's no light you can't light a fire your fast hard breaths billow visibly through the air you're shivering uncontrollably and eventually you'll get frostbite with dire consequences.At its heart 'Continuum' is a timetravel story  a staple of science fiction and certainly of Stargate  but handled much better than usual. Whereas the 'SG1' episode 'Moebius' thought it could hush the time paradoxes it generated aside 'Continuum' deals with them headon. However like the best scifi it doesn't attempt to deliver you pseudoscientific explanations it just highlights the puzzles for your attention  they're interesting issues as questions alone. Of course the timetravel itself is no real focus of the film but more of a device to shake things up in a sense 'Continuum' is one big Stargatethemed What if? Characters are tested to extremes are forced to interact with completely different roles and the opportunity is seized to throw in more guest appearances of old characters than you can count.Besides all this praise there are some things 'Continuum' really lets itself down with. Some very awkward dialogue between the SG1 members at the beginning reeked of the writer not really knowing what else to say  although there is an extremely bold speech from Vala which is impressive purely on account of the boldness of writing it in. Some crucial plot moments are swept over far too quickly  how quickly do you think you could be persuaded that your mortal enemy is actually your friend if you'd never met him before? Well pretty damn quickly 'Continuum' seems to think  although again there is enough material for the hardcore fan to explain away this kind of problem. It was also disappointing that Joel Goldsmith's score was disappointing  many scenes that really needed a strong sense of drama are overplayed by bright bouncy music which slightly jars one thinks Aren't people dying here? That said it equally has its moments of grandeur.'Continuum' seems to have proved that both Stargate and sciencefiction as a whole have moved on for the better. Whereas 'Ark' was written and directed by veteran Robert C. Cooper 'Continuum' was the work of original developer Brad Wright with the direction of the more recent Stargate talent Martin Wood. And it really shows  watch out for an extended tracking shot in the first few minutes of the film that climaxes with the entrance of the heroes and which would give 'Atonement' Joe Wright 2007 a run for its money. Whereas 'Ark' doesn't at any point seem to know quite what it's doing 'Continuum' really takes you for a ride with perfect pacing and just the right emphasis placed on every part of the plot the people behind this were right on the cutting edge of what Stargate is today.".

There is a bittersweet joy to see the late Don S. Davis for the last time. That we also get to see so many of the System Lords speaks well for the friendly personal relationships that the makers of SG1 must have with the actors. Yes it is a simple story of good versus evil but so are all stories in which many of us have any interest. I was very surprised to find myself thinking of how important Cam Mitchell became to SG1 he seems to be indispensable.

Richard dean Anderson's cameo well more of a bit player was great he never ceases to amaze me. The whole cast returns and pays homage to Australia in one of the jokes which was hilarious!. Amanda tapping looked extremely beautiful in the movie. Beau bridgeClaudia black Ben browder Christopher judge and of course one of my favorites next to Richard Michael shanks. CGI was amazing! one liners were perfect and the story was awesome! action humor and Gould threatening to enslave humanity what more could you ask for. Bring on NUMBER 3!";

The old cast is back to a large degree. 3. Fills SciFi gap that seems to have opened in the entertainment industry. 4. Has plenty of woah ho ho ho! Look at that! moments 5. Keeps a good healthy pace Cons 1. There are several points where the characters just let things go as mentioned in the other reviews and it lends a feeling that the writer was redpen marking things out just to fit a time constraint. 2. There's a new and overthetop addition of swearing to the movie which we could have done without. I watched this with my 10 year old an avid SG1 fan and had to stop partway through. It didn't add anything even angst to the movie. 3. The ending was anticlimactic and tied up a little too fast. 4. Tealc has hair.Overall I think casual fans like myself will love this addition while hardcore fans will blow it off as just another milking of the cash cow. There's a palpable dearth of good scifi programs on anymore cry and this really hit the spot. RIP Don Davis btw.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the conclusion to the Goa'uld arc for pretty much any fan out there this movie is fantastic to watch. For nonfans it's still a great experience as it embodies what was at the heart of Stargate when it began and takes the greatest characters from its past to make a thrilling film.The story starts off with the execution of Ba'al the last of the Goa'uld System Lords. The group is rejoicing with their enemy finally coming to an end. However within seconds the Tok'ra base where the execution is occurring is being destroyed within seconds people are disappearing into thin air and Ba'al appears to have escaped. Col. Sam Carter Daniel Jackson and Col. Mitchell manage to escape the Tok'ra planet and find themselves stranded on an alternate Earth after traveling through the Stargate.After learning that the history of the Earth has been altered and the Stargate program never having been started they deduce that Ba'al somehow changed the past and using his knowledge of the future has taken over all of the System Lords to become the supreme ruler of the entire Goa'uld fleet. Vala never lost her symbiote as the Tok'ra were annihilated and remained Qetesh the queen of Ba'al while Teal'c who still strives for the freedom of the Jaffa has decided to serve Ba'al in order to obtain it on his likely false promises. Despite all of this the US government refuses to allow the team to change history back to what it was and forces them to resume civilian lives. After about a year of living this existence the team is recalled due to an imminent massive attack on Earth by Ba'al who seeks to dominate the planet and rule it through an insidious fear using the governments of the world as his pawns.The acting is far better than what was found in Ark of Truth with Christopher Judge taking the role far more seriously and with plenty of cameos General O'Neill General Hammond President Hayes and enemies that had fallen off the map or were killed like Cronus and Apophis. It was more of a cinematic experience with gliderMiG dogfights and a glassing of the Earth.A mustsee for any fan. 810".

Well the Stargate series has come to an end mostly because Richard Dean Anderson who lives in California didn't want to keep making the trip to Vancouver where the series is shot. Most cast members have moved on to the Stargate Atlantis TV show. And Richard Dean Anderson does make short appearances on that show. I mention all this because this Stargate series itself was one ClassAct the cast was excellent the stories got better and better and one of the things I liked best about the series was the humor that Richard Dean Anderson insisted on from the very beginning.Someone not familiar with the TV series will still enjoy this movie and it may even prompt them to watch the DVDs from Season I. I envy those people. They are in for a real treat. Some show storylines never left Earth and others had us going thru the Stargate to distant planets where in many cases different life styles ideas and governments ruled the day. Nothing kinky though. Never. In this movie we get to see characters that faded out of the series for one reason or another and oh yes sometimes they were brought back in those TV shows and those were really good times when we saw them again. And it wasn't always about Aliens going to attack Earth.There is a classic show based on the repeating concept in the movie Ground Hog Day and one can watch that one over and over again. There were others like that too. Like the time the SG1 Crew was forced to consult in a Hollywood movie Spoof about people fighting aliens. And the time when an ordinary man had visions of the SG1 team fighting for Earth and no one believed him but this did cause concern among Stargate Command and SG1 of course. And the one about multiple SG1 teams getting caught up in a time warp displacement and all trying to get back to their Earth and the way they interacted with each other was pure gold. I could go on and on.In this movie we see Ba'al Simon a System War Lord considered a god who is about to be rendered as a mere human for his crimes against the Universe use a trick up his sleeve to change time and because of this some of the SG1 Team are forced back in time and try to warn Earth about Aliens invading etc. Everything is good the acting dialogue cinematography the CGI and it was over too soon for me. I miss the TV series. I miss it all. Yes watching people in a story go back in time and interact with those they knew in another timeline is really fascinating stuff.

	schema:reviewBody "After having watched the buildup to this release and finally seeing the movie I find I am quite deflated. I read another comment on here that Continuum is better than Ark. I disagree. In comparing the two the plot line of Ark while having to overtly tie up loose ends from the series was more complex requiring the use of your brain. Ark made you stop and think. Continuum is just fluff.Once they are found in the Artic it goes right off the rails into insert your word for nonsensical foolishness here. Mr. Wright did not remain faithful to his series and the spirit of the show itself. While they all end up back in the right time line again the road to get there was paved with serious sinkholes. It lacks so much of the real SG1's gumption. They quit which surprised me with Mitchell's quitter talk line actually being just before the fiasco. The SG1 I have come to know and love would never have taken being separated and told what they could and could not do like that lying down. They would have found a way to get around it even with the opposition they encountered with O'Neill Landry Hayes and Hammond that if you say so line was so not good. Granted they were in a time line where the Stargate program never happened even so SG1 got out of worse messes in the series. I also get the sense that the actors also knew it and so their hearts either were not in it or they actually did not know how to make their characters be quitters.While I purchased the DVD because I have the entire collection it will most likely gather dust.".

Continuum is just fluff.Once they are found in the Artic it goes right off the rails into insert your word for nonsensical foolishness here.

Along the way Ivanhoe encounters some obstacles that may endanger his own life and threaten the future of England. Everything about this movie is enchanting. The movie is very colorful the score is outstanding and it's exciting to watch the battle scenes. I really enjoyed seeing one of my favorite actors George Sanders playing yet another villain. It was also great to see the always ravishing Elizabeth Taylor at a very young age who plays a jewish maiden. I liked the way the movie demonstrated the persecution of jews living in England at the time and how they were looked down upon in spite of the different ethnic groups that made up the English population. Above all I really liked the endingit was awesome. Interestingly this movie which is from 1952 is more entertaining than and not as theatrical as some of the historical dramas that were made AFTER this movie.".

They are also both very photogenic to say the least. The performance of George Sanders intrigued me the most. Though a villain he actually became more sympathetic to me as the movie progressed.

And that's what this movie is all about  good clean fun and pure 100 entertainment.I'd like to mention something about the musical score. Miklos Rozsa was one of the great movie composers and his score to this movie is truly great. No composer today could write a score so lush and full of beautiful melodies. Each of the main characters gets their own theme and all themes are gorgeous especially those written for Rowena and for Rebecca. Ivanhoe's theme heard first over the main titles is one of Rozsa's greatest pieces. In fact its worth watching this movie and concentrating listening to the music rather than the dialogue.".

I always felt that his scores so rich in textures would be a prelude to his Oscarwinning score in BenHur. 1959The film deals with the ongoing fight between the AngloSaxons and Normans the latter having ruled England since the infamous Battle of Hastings in 1066. While fighting in the crusades Richard the Lionhearted has been kidnapped and held captive in Austria. This has been done with the help of the Austrian emperor Leopold and Prince John Richard's evil brother who assumes the throne in his brother's absence.I laughed at the beginning of the film when Robert Taylor who plays Ivanhoe loyal to Richard asks someone for a translation as he doesn't read Austrian. Didn't they mean German? While it is true that Germany did not become a unified country until 1871 following the FrancoPrussian war the dialect spoken in the entire region was German.Taylor rallies to the aid of his people. Hurt he is given refuge by the Jewess Rebecca played with warmth and skill by Elizabeth Taylor. Her father Isaac the Jew played by the always serious Felix Aylmer promises to help pay the ransom for Richard so that his people can have religious toleration in England. Naturally Rebecca loves Ivanhoe but so does Lady Rowena played by a much reserved Joan Fontaine. Her guardian the father of Ivanhoe in the film is portrayed by Finlay Currie who played in numerous bible films.The Technicolor and cinematography are breathtaking in the film.A story of love and devotion especially that of George Sanders who sacrifices all for Rebecca.".

The rest of the cast includes some all time favourites as Felix Aylmer Rebbeca's father Finlay Currie Cedric the Saxon Robert Douglas as Sanders's sidekick Sir Hugh de Bracy and in a typical role for him Guy Rolfe as the treacherous and ambitious Prince John this guy was born to play villains.The tournament in which Ivanhoe challenges the five top Saxon knights and the assault on Front de Beuf's castle by Robin of Locksley and his men are very well achieved action scenes and even more if you consider it was the early 50's. And the final duel between Taylor and Sanders is a great climax for the film notice they chose war axe and iron ball and chain instead of the usual swords.A most enjoyable film in its genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the four films that Robert Taylor called his iron jockstrap movies Ivanhoe is probably the best. Filmed on location in Great Britain with a classic mixed cast of American and British players Ivanhoe is a film for those of us who like their heroes strong and true and their causes noble ones.It's a noble cause in every sense of the word. King Richard the Lion Hearted is held captive by Duke Leopold of Austria on a return from the Crusades. Leopold's demanding a hefty sum and Prince John who is regent over in England ain't in no big hurry to pay it. So it is one Wilfred of Ivanhoe a Saxon knight on Crusade with the Norman King who takes up the burden of raising that ransom.As Walter Scott wrote the story Ivanhoe is a pretty virtuous fellow who takes those chivalry vows quite seriously. If this had been made at 20th Century Fox Tyrone Power would have been Ivanhoe. But MGM had a perfect actor for Ivanhoe in Robert Taylor especially with the success Quo Vadis had previously.Joan Fontaine is the prim and proper Lady Rowena and Elizabeth Taylor is the lovely Rebecca ready to be martyred for her Jewish faith. She's the key to this whole film. She's crushing big time on Ivanhoe but it is Norman knight Bois Guilbert who has it bad for her.George Sanders who plays Bois Guilbert has the most complex role in the film. He's genuinely in love with Liz Taylor but all she sees is the oppressor of her people in him. Of course by his reasoning the Normans are enjoying the spoils of conquest in England which they've been doing since 1066 even though it's over 120 years at this point. Nevertheless he's a brave knight and a worthy opponent of Ivanhoe.Guy Rolfe as Prince John has an interesting part as well. Except in a Doctor Who episode I've never seen a good characterization of Prince later King John. Guy Rolfe is no exception. When Elizabeth Taylor is on trial for witchcraft and sorcery and Ivanhoe challenges the verdict of the court with a wager of battle Rolfe knows how Sanders feels about Taylor. Yet in an act of supreme cruelty he chooses him as the court's champion. I suppose the idea was for Rolfe to get some kind of sadistic amusement at Sanders's discomfort. It costs Rolfe dearly.Other good performances come from those four reliable players Finlay Currie as Cedric of Ivanhoe Felix Aylmer as Isaac of York Robert Douglas as Hugh DeBracy and Emlyn Williams as Womba the Squire.In that 19th century romantic age of literature Walter Scott did much to elevate the ideals of chivalry to what we popularly accept them today. Of course back in the day those knights weren't all that chivalrous all the time. But this film heeds to that bit of philosophy about American popular myths when the legend becomes fact print the legend.Or film it as the case may be.".

	schema:reviewBody "The difficulty with bringing a piece of revered literature to the big screen has more to do with pleasing the fans of the work than in making a pleasing movie. Those who hold Walter Scott's classic Ivanhoe in high esteem will deem any adaptation to a largely visual medium unworthy no matter how much care and devotion are given to visualizing the original source.This version of Ivanhoe holds up well and remains one of the more realistic films dealing with the myth legends and pomp of the High Middle Ages. The pictorial representation of Judaism at a time of widespread persecution of that religion throughout Europe by Christians who continually used the Jews as scapegoats was noble indeed for 1952 the height of the McCarthy witch hunts. The audience of the day undoubtedly overlooked this point when Rebecca is accused of witchcraft in order to insure conformity and stifle opposition to Prince John's tyrannical rule of England in King Richard's absence.From a historical perspective this film is about as accurate as any of the numerous Robin Hood tales prevalent at the time in the movies and on TV. Ivanhoe's father is correct when he remarks that Richard would be no better than John as far as the Saxons were concerned. Both Richard and John were ineffectual rulers. Prince John later King John has received a bad press as a result of the lionization of Richard the Lionheart. At least John stayed home and attempted to rule England whereas Richard was always traipsing about Europe and the Near East on a Crusade or leading his knights in battle mainly for personal gain. His ransom as a result of falling into the hands of the Germans was costly for his realm. Neither Richard or John was the skilled administrator their father Henry II proved to be one of England's greatest monarchs. Neither inherited the diplomatic skills of their mother Eleanor of Aquitaine one of the great women leaders in western civilization.The division between the Saxons and Normans as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066 is at the crux of the story Ivanhoe being Saxon the royal family being Norman descended from William the Conqueror. Nothing is said about those who lived on the British Isles before either the Saxons or the Normans the Celts first then the conquering Romans.A highlight of Ivanhoe is the jousting tournament leading to rivalry between Ivanhoe Robert Taylor and Sir Brian de BoisGuilbert George Sanders a rivalry that extends to winning the hand and heart of Rebecca. The alluring nineteenyearold Elizabeth Taylor who portrays Rebecca is at the peak of her beauty and loveliness. George Sanders and Robert Taylor were much older than Elizabeth at the time. Taylor was uncomfortable making love even on celluloid to one so young especially since he recalled her as a child in the early days of his movie career.The brilliant Technicolor cinematography is bewitching even by today's standards. Adding to the eyecatching color are the action scenes especially toward the end of the movie. The besieging of the castle is directed with lan by Richard Thorpe who learned his trade well from directing action packed B films.The acting is top notch throughout with Guy Rolfe as the loathsome Prince John stealing every scene he's in. The weakest is Emlyn Williams who plays Wamba a chattel who becomes Ivanhoe's Squire. Wamba apparently is supposed to supply comic relief and is given some good lines by the writers but Williams tends to overplay the part to the extent that at times the character becomes an obnoxious loudmouth.".

I obtained a VHS tape some time ago and despite the annoying buzz that has crept into the sound track I played it again last night and enjoyed it yet again. For acting the young Elizabeth Taylor plays a good Rebecca beautiful and loving a strong enough act to bring real sorrow when we learn that that Ivanhoe cannot marry her in the last reel. He has to settle for Rowena Joan Fountaine who plays a good role but Elizabeth Taylor's Rebecca is better. Robert Taylor Ivanhoe is good looking noble brave and buckles a good swash. His best line delivered to evil Prince John That would be an even meaner death Sire has his face hidden inside a jousting helm. His love scenes could be stronger. Brian de Bois Gilbert is well played good enough to make us feel sorry for him when Ivanhoe kills him in the trial by combat in the end of the flick. Ivanhoe's search for King Richard that opens the movie is actually historical. Only in real history it was the famous minstrel Blondel who searched all of Europe rather than Wilfred of Ivanhoe. Locksley Robin Hood as a Saxon rebel helping to raise King Richard's ransom is an addition to the Robin Hood legend by Sir Walter Scott which has become part of the now accepted Robin Hood canon. Robin Hood is a medieval legend still popular and still evolving. For instance Kevin Costner's Robin Hood becomes a Third Crusade Viet Nam veteran yet another addition to the legend.For medieval costume drama Ivanhoe is about as good as it gets.".

He remembered being asked by some publicist why he did such dangerous things. He replied that he looked down from the great height imagined he saw his pay check lying there and took off! I suggested that he should write his memoirs. He said he had started and had spent a long time writing it all out by hand and had almost finished when his manuscript was stolen from if I remember correctly his car.

What a great villain he was! I thought his Sir Brian was actually far more realistic than Ivanhoe because he fell really hard for Rebecca which made a lot more sense to me.But anyway this is a great swashbuckler very entertaining and colorful. I am now so old that I can just let it carry me along and take me back to my childhood for a couple hours.

	schema:reviewBody "This splendid version of Sir Walter Scott's classic epic tale starts in 12th century when Saxon Knight Wilfred of IvanhoeRobert Taylor a suitable noble having fought for Richard the LionheartedNorman Wooland during the Crusades goes back to England. He aware king Richard has been taken prisoner and gets a letter written telling the following  'To the people of England . I am here held captive by Leopold of Austria. My brother prince John has knowledge of it yet he has denied my ransom. One hundred and fifty thousand marks of silver. I fear he does conspire with certain Norman knights to seize my throne. People of England speed my deliverance. Your kingdom is at stake'. In order to regain his freedom Ivanhoe attended by a likable squireEmilyn Williams confronts Prince JohnGuy Rolfe and his lieutenantsin this case George Sanders and Robert Douglasand he's also drawn to Jewish healer RebeccaElizabeth Taylor IsaacFelix Aylmerof York's daughter. Meanwhile Ivanhoe woo maidens as his childhood sweetheart Saxon heiress RowenaJoan Fontaine.Prince John now John Lackland will stop at nothing to assume the throne. Ivanhoe join forces with Robin Hood and his Merry man who attack the stronghold.This enjoyable film displays romance chivalry knighthood daring jousting and lots of action with spectacular castle attack. This one proved notable hit as well as the others two Robert Taylor's forays into English history 'Quentin Durward and Knights of the Round table' produced and directed by similar crew Pandro S Berman and Richard Thorpe. The film packs a glamorous and luminous cinematography by Freddie Young and evocative musical score by Miklos Rozsa. The picture is excellently handled by Richard Thorpe.The film is partially based on true events. Although Ivanhoe didn't exist John Lackland was king of England from 1199 to 1216. Few monarchs have been subject to such appalling publicity as John Although by no means lovable he was an able administrator and spent more time in England than his predecessor and elder brother Richard I but he was jailed by Leopold of Austria returning from Crusades. Besides appears Robin Hood also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations. If Robin Hood did exist it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon  though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland.".

	onyx:emotionText "This splendid version of Sir Walter Scott's classic epic tale starts in 12th century when Saxon Knight Wilfred of IvanhoeRobert Taylor a suitable noble having fought for Richard the LionheartedNorman Wooland during the Crusades goes back to England. He aware king Richard has been taken prisoner and gets a letter written telling the following  'To the people of England . I am here held captive by Leopold of Austria. My brother prince John has knowledge of it yet he has denied my ransom. One hundred and fifty thousand marks of silver. I fear he does conspire with certain Norman knights to seize my throne. People of England speed my deliverance. Your kingdom is at stake'. In order to regain his freedom Ivanhoe attended by a likable squireEmilyn Williams confronts Prince JohnGuy Rolfe and his lieutenantsin this case George Sanders and Robert Douglasand he's also drawn to Jewish healer RebeccaElizabeth Taylor IsaacFelix Aylmerof York's daughter. Meanwhile Ivanhoe woo maidens as his childhood sweetheart Saxon heiress RowenaJoan Fontaine.Prince John now John Lackland will stop at nothing to assume the throne. Ivanhoe join forces with Robin Hood and his Merry man who attack the stronghold.This enjoyable film displays romance chivalry knighthood daring jousting and lots of action with spectacular castle attack. This one proved notable hit as well as the others two Robert Taylor's forays into English history 'Quentin Durward and Knights of the Round table' produced and directed by similar crew Pandro S Berman and Richard Thorpe. The film packs a glamorous and luminous cinematography by Freddie Young and evocative musical score by Miklos Rozsa. The picture is excellently handled by Richard Thorpe.The film is partially based on true events. Although Ivanhoe didn't exist John Lackland was king of England from 1199 to 1216. Few monarchs have been subject to such appalling publicity as John Although by no means lovable he was an able administrator and spent more time in England than his predecessor and elder brother Richard I but he was jailed by Leopold of Austria returning from Crusades. Besides appears Robin Hood also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations. If Robin Hood did exist it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon  though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland.";

	schema:headline " Beautiful chivalric story and well made medieval epic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although the story of Ivanhoe has been brought to screen several times this is the version that I have always considered outstanding. Yes I admit that it is a free adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's novel much is changed. I also admit that it is a clearly Hollywood production of the early 1950s with cast elites of the time. Yet IVANHOE is extremely entertaining as an epic movie.MIDDLE AGES ON SCREEN The picture of the medieval England of the 12th century is very appealing. Viewers get a right impression of the lifestyles believes and values of the time. And it is not only because of the costumes and sets... the film is supplied with such moments that allow us to travel in our imagination to the distant Middle Ages. I loved the tournament for instance when the knight with the hidden face Ivanhoe is supposed to prove his courage. Here a mention must also be made of the castle siege and the very natural action. Another important medieval aspect that is developed in the film is man's chivalric love to a woman. Ivanhoe comes back to his homeland and refers to the vows of chastity he has made with his beloved Lady Rowena Joan Fontaine. This delicacy combined with straightforward love and courage with sacrifice are very beautiful...and very medieval consider this aspect in Gibson's BRAVEHEART as well. Finally funny moments are accurately embedded in the context. The scenes with humble Squire Wamba Emlyn Williams constitute the heart of the movie's humor.PLAYERS The cast give very fine performances. Although these are mostly great stars of the early 1950s and may be not that famous to the general audience at present Robert Taylor is absolutely amazing as Ivanhoe. He perfectly expresses chivalric courage purity of intentions and honor. I also liked young Liz Taylor who is noticeably not that professional on screen as she later was. Yet her girlish beauty in the role of a Jewish girl Rebecca is magnificent. Except for Taylors Joan Fontaine in the role of the virtuous Lady Rowena is terrific  real Lady yet a bit boring. There are also such mainstays of epics like George Sanders Felix Aylmer and Finlay Currie. Who can forget their roles in QUO VADIS? or SOLOMON AND SHEBA? Thanks to the famous cast the film can be placed in the accurate cinema period. Yes it cannot be forgotten that IVANHOE was made in the early 1950s and thanks to this awareness you partly know what to expect from such a film. However the movie's old age talks even more for its value. IVANHOE is just standing a test of time.EPIC PROPORTION FILM IVANHOE is also filled with spectacular scenes. The first one worth consideration is the opening scene when Ivanhoe is traveling through Austrian valleys and hills looking for the captured Richard the Lionheart. Mind the excellent colors' selection and the sunset by the castle at Durnstein where the king was kept for ransom. The cinematography is outstanding. Another beautiful scene is the feast that Cedric Finlay Currie gives to his guests. This luxury of medieval cold castles the hospitality of the Saxons and the manners of the wealthy are in focus. But these moments are not there for nothing...they serve the purpose to supply the viewer with a unique atmosphere.What more to say? IVANHOE by Richard Thorpe in spite of its 54th birthday is a great medieval epic that I would recommend to everyone. For me it is one of those films that I have seen several times and still dream to see once again. I am always in a very nice mood whenever I see this movie 710".

King Richard is the rightful King of England whose crown has been stolen by his evil brother John. The men are discussing how Ivanhoe is a coward because he simply vanished in battle. However Ivanhoe is sitting at the table listening to this conversation. He later talks to his father Cedric who disowned Ivanhoe because he went to fight in the crusades. Ivanhoe tells his father that he vanished from the Crusades in order to deliver a letter to England telling those loyal to Richard that he is being held for ransom. King John knows this but will not raise the ransom because he wants to keep the crown. With the help of the Saxons and the Jews Ivanhoe makes it his job to raise the ransom. A Rabbi Isaac says that he will collect 1000 marks of silver from the Jews in York and Sheffield to help free Richard. Isaac's daughter Rebecca Liz Taylor is in love with Ivanhoe who is in love with Lady Rowena. John gets wind that Ivanhoe is trying to free Richard so he sends his knights after Ivanhoe and his friends. Robin of Locksley also known as Robin Hood warns Ivanhoe that John's knights are tracking him down. Cedric Isaac Rebecca Rowena and Wamba Ivanhoe's squire try to escape before John's knights find them. Ivanhoe joins Robin Hood in the forest. Ivanhoe's friends are captured by John's knights and taken to a castle where they are help captive by Sir Brian de Bois Guilbert. Ivanhoe offers himself in exchange for his father's release however he is fooled and is captured by Guilbert as well. Robin hood and his many many bowmen surround the castle and free Cedric Isaac Rowena and Ivanhoe. During the battle Wamba is killed and Guilbert takes Rebecca to John's court. Rebecca is accused and found guilty of witchcraft however Ivanhoe challenges this. The movie ends with Ivanhoe killing Guilbert in a duel for the Rebecca's life and Richard being put back on the throne.I thought this movie was fantastic. It has everything that one would associate with the Middle Ages great battle sequences chivalry knights in shining armor and damsels in distress. Although not completely historically accurate it portrays the NormanSaxon conflict and the treatment of Jews in this period quite nicely. The acting was great the plot was always moving and it kept me on the edge of my seat. 4 out of 5".

Joan Fontaine and Liz provide the sighs and heaving bosoms and a cast of English character actors provide the right accents and atmosphere. As Sir Walter Scott proved never letting historical accuracy get in the way of telling a good story has proved financially rewarding provided the story you're telling your audience buys into.

The fact that a peasants life was brutally miserable whether under Saxon or the Norman conquerors makes no difference. Richard the Lion Heart and Prince John and their vassals spoke Norman French they didn't know or care to know what those dirty beggars spoke only as long as they obeyed. To rise to knighthood Ivanhoe would have to learn that languagemannersand ways of warfare familiar to the dominant class. In other words it was the Normans who shaped Angleland into Great Britain. History lesson and opinion over the best aspect of the film and why I say it was George Sanders not Guy Rolfewho walked away with the best actor award was the FORBIDDEN ROMANCE of the Christian knight and the Jewish Princess. Miss Taylor just sighed and looked puppyeyed while Sanders actually whether worrying about real life issues or actingplayed a conflicted yet heroic character.

Only JOAN FONTAINE as Rowena seems to know what her role is all about and plays it with a delicacy and warmth that are refreshing and natural.The main fault is the script which is a tedious thing. Nothing has been spared to give the production all of the handsome values one expects in a film of this sortbut none of it is compelling or even believable.The most redeeming factor is Miklos Rozsa's interesting musical score which underscores the action scenes.

Still it works at its own level as a great story about a young Saxon knight who has pledged loyalty to King Richard. In the book and the film Ivanhoe's father has disowned him because Ivanhoe has betrayed his Saxon roots. Scott's hero is as much Richard the LionHearted as it is Ivanhoe. The movie is all Ivanhoe played by Robert Taylor.. Both book and novel are really about the fact that two women love Ivanhoea Saxon woman Rowena played by Joan Fontaine and a Jewish woman Rebecca played by Elizabeth Taylor.The casting is where the movie gets into trouble. Scott's Ivanhoe is a young man and both Rowena and Rebecca are young women. However the studios wanted marquee names and that's what they got. Youth is what they didn't get. When the film was made Robert Taylor was 41 and Joan Fontaine was 35. Not exactly over the hill but not the youthful lovers Scott or we envisioned.Taylor on the other hand was only 20. After all the scandals and the loss of her youthful beauty it's easy for us to forget what she looked like at age 20. Just to remind everyone she was impossibly achingly beautiful. When she's on the screen we don't see anyone else.This is a movie to see because it has a wonderful rousing invented fight scene at the end and because Taylor has to be seen to be believed. Don't expect a subtle intellectual movie and you won't be disappointed.".

He only touched on his feelings about digital synthesisers. What about the 80s and the DX7 and Moog synths falling massively out of favour. What about the comeback in the 90s  initially selling his analogue circuit designs to other companies who produced synths like the MIDI Moog and the SE ATC1. What about his FX pedals? Finally the soundtrack left much to be desired. All the live performances were badly recorded the synths were far too loud compared to the backing. I know the synth was the instrument being demonstrated but I found it uncomfortable to listen to. The content of the music was nearly all progressive rock musicians and various lesser known modern electro acts bar stereolab and DJ spooky.

What about electropop which was founded on the early affordable synths like the Moog Prodigy? These are just the first 2 genres that spring to mind that were missing  I could go on!

The film maker never gets to grips with the guy in any way shape or form but what I find more frustrating than anything is his choice of music to represent the moments in history. Perhaps he was on such a low budget that he couldn't afford certain rights but when Bob Moog talks about 'Switched on Bach' as being a ground breaking album changing the public perception of what electronic music could offer there isn't one single note from the album played. There's not even the mention of the composer's name. How can you have a documentary about Moog and not even mention the name Walter Carlos ? Quite unbelievable. The 'Switched on Bach' moment is quickly passed over for some reason and rushes into a short Keith Emerson clip. I also seem to remember that Tangerine Dream are never mentioned or any of their music played. All in all there are so many holes in the production it limits both its appeal and historic interest. Shame really because it queers the pitch for someone else who may want to do the job properly.".

Watching this film was probably not the best way to try and find out more about the man the instrument and its impact. As many others on this internet site have already pointed out director Hans Fjellestad does a really average job of doing anything in this film.The one thing he does appear to be good at selling himself to potential subjects because the film does have a reasonably good array of people on hand to discuss what they do with it and particularly Fjellestad has Moog pretty much on tap throughout the film. It looks like the plan has been to point the camera at whoever is talking film it and work out the detail in the edit. Sometimes that works and of course with reality shows and the like that is pretty much all you can do but in the vast majority of cases it is a recipe for disaster. So it is here in a film that lacks structure to the point that if Moog wants to ramble endlessly while pottering round his garden then that makes the cut but hardly anytime can be found for many artists that one would associate with the synthesizer. OK maybe rights to the music or access to the artists was an issue due to the low budget but this is not much of an excuse.Astonishingly the film is barely over an hour long and it is testament to how poor it is that it feels like it never ends. God help us if we ever see an extended cut of this because imagine the footage that they didn't feel worthy of making it into this version! Anyway I stuck with it but ultimately there is almost nothing of value here my mind was open to learning more about the impact this instrument had had but it falls down in this regard with a lack of structure and aim that must be laid right at the doors of the director and producers.

I would also liked to have seen exclusives such as people playing rare synths etc. Also there was no narrator which I feel was greatly needed.

	schema:reviewBody "This film calls itself a documentary but it documents nothing. Look I play keys and have a Moog. I love the old modular recordings with W. Carlos and D. Hyman and of course all the stuff that was done with the Minimoog. I wanted to learn more about how Moog came about the competition how the company went out of business what he did from the late 70's when he left Moog to when he started Big Briar and the new Moog Music in the late 90's etc. It also would've been cool to have interviews with some iconic Moog players like Bernie Worrell Chick Corea Dick Hyman Wendy Carlos Wakeman Emerson and the like.Instead it looks like we get a director who just ran his camera for a hour or so at Moog's factory Moog's victory garden and backstage at a Moogfest concert picking up banter between Moog WOO and Wakeman a reminiscing with Emerson and a few whacked out bay area groups making weird noises with there Moogs.Even though it runs about an hour I had to break it up into two viewing sessions because it was so boring. What sucks is that Moog is an interesting guy the history of his company is a great story and the iconic Moog artists all mostly colorful characters. This director had a goldmine on his hands and could've made a fantastic compelling awesome movie where you are entertained and actually learned something. Instead he squandered his opportunity and made a real snoozer of a film.Someone from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to confiscate this director's camera.

	onyx:emotionText "This film calls itself a documentary but it documents nothing. Look I play keys and have a Moog. I love the old modular recordings with W. Carlos and D. Hyman and of course all the stuff that was done with the Minimoog. I wanted to learn more about how Moog came about the competition how the company went out of business what he did from the late 70's when he left Moog to when he started Big Briar and the new Moog Music in the late 90's etc. It also would've been cool to have interviews with some iconic Moog players like Bernie Worrell Chick Corea Dick Hyman Wendy Carlos Wakeman Emerson and the like.Instead it looks like we get a director who just ran his camera for a hour or so at Moog's factory Moog's victory garden and backstage at a Moogfest concert picking up banter between Moog WOO and Wakeman a reminiscing with Emerson and a few whacked out bay area groups making weird noises with there Moogs.Even though it runs about an hour I had to break it up into two viewing sessions because it was so boring. What sucks is that Moog is an interesting guy the history of his company is a great story and the iconic Moog artists all mostly colorful characters. This director had a goldmine on his hands and could've made a fantastic compelling awesome movie where you are entertained and actually learned something. Instead he squandered his opportunity and made a real snoozer of a film.Someone from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to confiscate this director's camera. They must have a hyperactive hall monitor over there who'd be willing to do it for mankind. I mean this doesn't need to be The King of Kong or a long drawn out Ken Burns doc just somewhere in between.If you love synths and Moogs this is of some interest as it shows Moog as a down to earth nice guy and it is worth a viewing.

This mishmash of a documentary feels like a collection of outtakes from a better work. I don't need to see Robert Moog talking about pepper plants and Money Mark diddling around on a synthesizer. MOOG demonstrates that sometimes it's best to not rely on the subject of the documentary as the subject matter expert of the film. Robert Moog is not the most wellspoken advocate and historian of his life's work. Likewise showing the electronic guts of his machines doesn't do much to explain how they work or why Moog's work is important to the music world. When utilizing archive footage MOOG works. Unfortunately these moments are few and far between leaving MOOG a mumbling muttering mess for its interminable seventytwo minutes. Moog and electronica deserve better.".

It seems like the director didn't really even bother to edit the film at all presenting a collection of rambling nonsensical conversations between Moog  various musicians or semirelevant ramblings with Moog by himself. It really is unfortunate because he seems like an incredibly intriguing  intelligent person but is presented in such an uninteresting way that seems to indicate that the director not only doesn't really care about him but doesn't really care much about music in general. There are scenes where Moog is talking about the sounds the instrument can make and the musician's options in terms of how they can manipulate the sounds but the director doesn't bother to insert any examples during that scene making it actually aggravating to watch. I found most of the various performances not really all that interesting to watch either as some of them barely showed the artist using the Moog Stereolab or focused more on other musicians in the performance Money Mark's d.j. I also really didn't learn much about Moog's life or the real history  development of the instrument. It may have only been 70 minutes long but i was barely able to sit through the whole thing. It really doesn't do the man justice in the least. If you want to see a great documentary about an inventor of an incredibly influential electronic instrument watch THEREMIN. Not only is THEREMIN incredibly informative but also rather touching. Truly a beautiful documentary.".

	schema:headline " Moog Misses The Mark";
	schema:reviewBody "I must say that this documentary is a rather poor tribute both to Robert Moog and the Moog synthesizer for a myriad of reasons. Perhaps you might watch this as it is being aired this month December 2007 on The Movie Channel HD for the same reason that I did and that is to see what this documentary had to say about the man and his instrument philosophy and some of the history behind the Moog synthesizer's and company's development however the total impact of this piece greatly suffers both from what was included in the film and what was left out.Granted it is obvious that this film was not intended to be a complete historical review of the Moog's development. The same applies to the music musicians interviews and other footage including Robert Moog's own comments about himself his instrument and those who used the instrument commercially or in performance. The soundtrack is also quite disappointing especially in terms of what was chosen as representative examples of Moog performances over the years. I suppose you would have to be wellversed in the history of the synthesizer as I am to fully understand this.I agree with other reviewers in that WalterWendy Carlos was only briefly mentioned during this documentary especially when it applies to the Moog modular system as recorded on SwitchedOn Bach The WellTempered Synthesizer SwitchedOn Brandenburgs Tron and others which were perhaps the first and most influential recordings of the Moog synthesizer of all time. Also missing were such artists as Isao Tomita Dick Hyman Herbie Hancock Tony Banks Genesis and many more who recorded and performed with the Moog synthesizer during its early years. Instead the focus of the piece centered around Keith Emerson Rick Wakeman Bernie Worrell and some of the early partners and friends who worked with Moog towards its development Herbert Deutsch and other contemporaries and personal friends of the late Dr. Moog. The interview with Wakeman and Worrell was taped in a noisy hallway and could have been more effective at the very least by being taped in a quieter setting.The commercial use of the Moog synthesizer centered around a rather dated beer commercial. I was expecting perhaps an interview with Suzanne A. Ciani who was infinitely more prominent in this area. In other cases the interview location city was titled but not the name of the person speaking with Bob Moog and that was also disappointing.I also agree that certain comments were repeated especially Bob's comment on having a feel of what was going on within the Moog's circuitry when he played it. Since he also discussed the Theremin which seemed to be a major portion of this documentary it would have nice to included some commentary about Miklos Rozsa and the role the Theremin played as the only recognized synthesizer as an orchestral instrument. I am referring to many film score recordings which featured the Theremin such as Hitchcock's Spellbound and many others in the suspense and SciFi genres. There was little discussion about the other Moog synthesizer models outside of the modular system and the MiniMoog such as the PolyMoog MemoryMoog and others.The inbetween footage music and performances were rather disappointing and disjointed. I think the director could have planned a better tribute to a wonderful person inventor instrument social and historicallysignificant musical technology. I think to really do justice to both the man and his machine you would have to present at the very least about a 2 to 3hourlong documentary.On the plus side it was interesting to see the Moog in production and some of the performance and interview footage but not all. Actually much of the footage is somewhat comical in nature when you look back at how it was presented back in the early days of synthesis.".

All in all though it was nice to have a real up close interview with the creator.I didn't care for the experimental music even though experimental music was largely influenced by the Moog. I find that type of music to be scattered and annoying. I also refuse to listen to the classical approach to the Moog. What Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson do on the moog are what impresses me.

I've read many things by and about Bob Moog over the years and was looking forward to seeing this documentary. But sadly it's a missed opportunity. First of all the video quality looks like an 8mm home movie from the 1970s rather than a 2004 production. Secondly it's very amateurishly done. For instance when you have Bernie Worrell Rick Wakeman and Moog together to talk about synths do you think you could possibly pull them into a quiet room instead of holding a 10minute interview in a busy hallway with so much background noise that the voices are hardly audible? There are interesting bits here including archive footage of the Moog assembly line and Gershon Popcorn Kingsley with his Moog Quartet. But there's a lot of BAD synth music too and poor visuals. If you're a diehard Moog fan like myself you'll put up with it. If you're not skip it.".

But Birds of America manages to break the mold and feel fresh and alive from the outset delivering a warm funny zany tender and compassionate film that left the audience smiling and satisfied.Morrie Matthew Perry is an uptight university professor anxiously seeking tenure which requires the approval of his department head who lives next door. Morrie and his wife Betty Lauren GrahamGilmore Girls live in a house he inherited at 18 years old after his mother died and his father committed suicide. As a result Morrie raised his brother Jay Ben Foster and sister Ida Ginnifer Goodwin both of which grew into their problems. Ida is substanceabusing and promiscuous and Jay a deeply gentle and sensitive soul whose actions are almost completely unfettered by advanced thought. They reunite in the family home when Jay gets run over by a car he was laying in the road and Morrie who still feels more parent than brother asks him to move in for a while. Without asking permission Jay invites Ida to join them stressing Morrie and Betty's relationship and jeopardizing his career with their outrageous behavior.Matthew Perry is surprisingly good in his deadpan portrayal of an overwrought brother who cares deeply for his siblings often at his own expense. Goodwin is a pleasure as well as the addictive personality with the carefree spirit. But Ben Foster 310 to Yuma is great and despite having such a naturally funny role manages to never play Jay for laughs creating an endearing and memorable character. Growing up without parents these three have formed an unbreakable bond with unconditional love and acceptance and a tenderness and compassion unlike any I can remember in movies. Elyse Friedman has crafted a remarkable script and Sundance veteran director Craig Lucas Secret Lives of Dentists The Dying Gaul brings it to life with a funny but lighthearted and gentle touch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though the title is derived from Audubon's priceless book and there are several references within the film corresponding to the title it also serves as a metaphor. The film centres around a dysfunctional family and each member is like a bird. Morrie Matthew Perry is a bird who's lived in a cage for so long that he's finding it difficult to break free. His wife Bettie is like a bird who desperately wants to create a nest and nurture children. His brother Jay is a gentle young bird who keeps flying. And similarly his sister too keeps flying only that she's flying away from having to deal with her problems.While movies about dysfunctional families are becoming redundant these days though they haven't tired me 'Birds Of America' feels refreshing. It's a funny at times hilariously outrageous heartwarming whimsical poetic and humane little film. While these siblings who have grown up without stable parents have their own problems their unconditional love for one another is strong and genuine it is sensitively demonstrated by the actors with compassion. They do feel like a real family.Friedman's writing is superb as the dialogues are authentic symbolic and humorous and the poetry of the story comes across very well. The characters are very real with a gentle touch of humour. Lucas's direction is equally good as he stays focused on the main story telling it with sincerity and clarity. In addition Yaron Orbach's playful cinematography and Ahrin Mishan's whimsical score are excellent and they beautifully enhance the mood. Eric Kissack's editing is crisp. It is a very short film but it's rounded up well.The performances are outstanding. It was great to see Matthew Perry in a serious role with a comic touch. He just proves what a versatile actor he is and his effective portrayal comes across as very genuine. Lauren Graham is just as fantastic as the desperate housewife desperate to have kids with the husband she loves. Ben Foster is brilliantly restrained and very likable. He does not have to rely on overt gimmicks to draw laughter. Ginnifer Goodwin too is excellent as the promiscuous carefree and addictive sister Ida. Hilary Swank springs a pleasant surprise as the pompous 'perfect' neighbour. It's a role that any star of her caliber would turn down without second thought and it's not a role that one would expect an accomplished actress to play but Swank does a fine job nonetheless and it was great to see her as part of an already magnificent cast.It's a light hearted film and it's basically about lightening up and not to take every single thing in life so seriously but at the same time to respect other's boundaries. To quote a friend 'it's about the invisible boundaries of social norms both breaking and respecting them and it's about the importance of loving and respecting people who care for you family and real friends versus sucking up to others only because they might give you a promotion or a 'better' social status'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly I found this movie to be a very enjoyable experience. The pacing was fantastic the whole time I wanted a character to do this or that but they didn't so I'd get frustrated. But then a half hour later they'd do something twice as satisfying then what I had wanted them to do and with perfect timing. The movie starts off a little slow but let yourself get to know the characters try to understand their points of view and guess how they became this way. By the end of the film everything is understood and it makes those first few scenes even better now that you understand why the characters where acting the way they were.Elyse Friedman's writing feels genuine. The characters are rich and the story plays out very well in getting to know those characters. At times you think you have one figured out and then you learn something new that changes who they are in your eyes. I love when a film can do that affectively and this one does. It feels like a character piece but unlike most who overdo the story this film is entertaining enough just getting to know the characters.Craig Lucas does a great job directing the camera to support the performances. This film has a genuine indie feel. It's not forced it just fits.The performances are also very appropriate for the feel of the film. Matthew Parry was a fantastic choice for his role. He acts by not overdoing it. He keeps his performance inside and in turn it seems more real on the outside. Ben Foster is perfect. He nails the character in a way that few actors could have pulled it off. He makes me want to meet Jay and have a conversation with him. I want to hang out with him and ask him about his perspectives on life. Lastly but certainly not least was Ginnifer Goodwin. I want you Ginnifer I want you so bad. She delivers a performance that is fantastic in its combination of both subtle and not so subtle moments. At times you have to look closely into her eyes to figure out what the character is feeling other times it's displayed in her every expression and gesture.I really am a tough critic most of the time but I was just so surprised by this film that it sold me. I love it. I won't recommend it to all my friends because it is a film for people who love film and don't just want to see car chaises and sex scenes.".

It was good acting the camera work was good but it just lacked luster and imagination...I understand that the Birds thing in the title is a metaphor. No need to throw it in my face with constant pictures of birds and an annoyingly fake bird call track playing throughout the film.Lauren Graham should have had a bigger part in the film. She was a good character but she needed developing a lot more. She seemed a little onedimensional at times. For any friends fan I will quote Perry's character  she's like a mother with no baby. This subplot needed to be developed more as well  felt like all of that was just skimmed over. Graham is an amazing actress and her character deserved to be as good as she is.Perry as always was simply fabulous. He managed to make a pretty annoying character the slightly OCD won't have a baby until he gets tenure etc etc into a likable lovable one. His wit and charm as a person shines through to all of his characters and he made this movie what it is in my opinion.The other actors were good as well albeit a little unbelievable at times. I especially liked Ida I've forgotten the actress' name I apologise.I really really wish I'd loved this movie. I was looking forward to it so much and had pretty high expectations seeing as Perry and Graham are two of my favourite actors. But it was a bit of a disappointment.I would recommend watching it but go in with low expectations because it's not a fabulous film.".

	schema:headline " The One About The Dysfunctional Family With A Shaky Storyline";
	schema:reviewBody "Birds of America is a quiet independent film that managed to get big names to star in it. I'm not sure what drew Matthew Perry Lauren Graham Ginnifer Goodwin and last but definitely not least twotime Academy Award Winner Hillary Swank to star in this film because the story went from taking plots and characters similar to movies I've seen before to going in weird and confusing directions that make you go huh?. Such directions are aided by random subplots.Matthew Perry plays Morrie a college professor who had inherited his parents' house after his father fell out a window and his mother died from cancer. The problem was he was just completing high school when it happened and he still had two younger siblings to take care of. Those siblings grow up to be Jay Ben Foster a borderline psychotic who likes laying his head on concrete waiting for cars to come by and Ida Ginnifer Goodwin a promiscuous party girl who is a little less crazy than her brother but still hard to handle.The movie doesn't bother to even begin to explain how they got this way. All we know is that Morrie is still living in that house is married to Betty Lauren Graham playing yet another distraught housewife and random subplot alert has not had a bowel movement in a few months. When this point is revealed the next scene you see is Perry sitting on a toilet seat with a Microsoft laptop in front of him and a MacBook on his left side. When seeing this scene I thought to myself Why movie why?. It's a good thing Morrie isn't a germaphobe.Things get messy when Jay and Ida have nowhere to go move into the old house and continue to test both Morrie and Betty's patience. Morrie can't just dump them on the street because I guess they're family. However the character of Jay to me seemed to be better off in a mental institution given his suicidal tendencies. Why that option never occurred to Matthew Perry's character at any point in this film is beyond me. Goodwin was good in her role as a misfit and the film could have easily just kept her. It's not that Ben Foster didn't do a good job in his role. He did. Jay just seemed too heavy a character for this movie to handle and could have been utilized better in another movie.It also surprises me that Hillary Swank took on such a thankless role as the suburban dbutante next door to Morrie and Betty who happens to be married to Morrie's boss Paul Gary Wilmes. Swank turns in a onedimensional performance here that could really have been played by anyone. In fact for some reason her character reminded me of a less over thetop Babs That boy is a PIG Pig! from Animal House 1978. Since she's not only a twotime Oscar winner but an Alister at that it surprises me that she played a role this small. They could have gotten a noname actress and it would have cost a lot less.This movie suffers greatest from being a hodgepodge of subplots all of which don't tie together well or resolve originally. In fact the title of the movie Birds of America comes from a first edition book Morrie also inherited from his father. In the beginning of the film it's revealed that Jay ripped it to shreds for reasons the movie never explains. Is the book referred to again? Not until the closing credits where you see L.L. Beanesque pictures of birds from this aforementioned book. These credits only remind you that the movie could have made a metaphor that made sense using this book but didn't even try to do so.And speaking of useless subplots with shifty solutions remember the bowel trouble Morrie has? If you've seen Me Myself and Irene 2000 you can probably guess how it's going to resolve itself. This movie tried but the plot felt messy unrealistic and forgettable at the same time. I can't give it a stronger recommendation.".

This little tale of a dysfunctional family was written by Elyse Friedman a Canadian novelist and screenwriter Then Again Long Short Story Waking Beauty whose works are summed up by the author If I had to sum up my characters in one word I'd say 'outsiders.' There's not one particular source from where I get my inspiration. It comes from different places. I get it from life and ideas pop into my head. I file them away and sooner or later it's time to deal with them whether in screenplay book or poem or whatever it happens to be. Craig Lucas Longtime Companion Prelude to a Kiss The Dying Gaul joins Friedman in bringing this strange little story about outsiders and insiders all living together under one bizarre roof. Morrie Matthew Perry is the older brother who raised his freespirited siblings Jay Ben Foster and Ida Ginnifer Goodwin after the death of their parents. Their lives have gone in different directions Morrie is a professor in line for tenure that happens to be at the mercy of his fellow academician Paul Gary Wilmes who lives next door to Morrie and his sturdy but 'it's time to start a family' wife Betty Lauren Graham. Paul and his obsessive compulsive gardening wifenewmother Laura Hilary Swank do all the right things a trait Morrie and Betty try to emulate to assure Morrie's getting tenured a move that will assure Betty that motherhood can be approached. Into this strained atmosphere drops Jay recovering from an accident he lay on the freeway and was hit but not killed. Alone he is married to a young girl Gillian Zo Kravitz but does not share this information at first Jay moves into Morrie's attic and continues his strange life pattern imposing his Vegan style on the family and eventually inviting his equally looney sister Ida to move in too Ida takes the basement. The two siblings proceed to cause minor crises and dilemmas for Morrie more or less resulting in Morrie's being alienated from his 'important' neighbors. How Morrie and Betty adjust to their new found way of life and its consequences provides an ending to the story. The film is slight and begs indulgence in some of the sidebars that are less than contributing to the film as a whole but the cast is very good Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin continue to impress as they polish their acting skills. The story is a little on the crazy side but it does provide another way of viewing a dysfunctional family. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little apprehensive going into this movie as Matthew Perry has not had much luck choosing successful films. While his television career has been critically successful with friends and studio 60 he is usually a victim of poor writing. In truth although he will always be Chandler Bing as will the rest of the Friends crew he does have talent for the dramatic. This is shown in Birds of America Being a future independent filmmaker I chose to enter this movie with loosening my predisposed judgements and this helped me find the depth in the film. When watching independent cinema you must always expect the unexpected and allow yourself to think outside the box.This film was significant as it dealt with the importance of family connection and being true to oneself. As well it brings out the question Is honesty always right. This has been a topic that has been debated for years. Honesty has always been thought of as a necessity but what happens when it takes precedence to kindness? This is all dealt with during the film.In terms of the performances I believe that the two strongest links in this film were Ginnifer Goodwin and Ben Foster as the problem siblings. Ginnifer Goodwin's mannerisms and subtle facial expressions really captivate the screen and for me although Matthew Perry's character is considered the father figure in the story she really is the central link of the sibling connection. Ben Foster was great as well. It's refreshing to see that some people in Hollywood are not encapsulated by money and fame and are just in acting for the material. Matthew Perry was very good as the older brother father figure but I found my attention drifting to the other characters performances when he was sharing scenes. Finally Lauren Graham who is also very talented and needs to make wiser choices than Evan Almighty was great as the desperate wife trying to get her husband to have a baby with her. In one scene she makes washing clothes seem like such a luxury and with her subtle nuances makes the audience truly feel for her.I thought the film was very good but there were some slip ups. First off Hilary Swank was wasted playing a stepfordwife type which truth be told could have been played by anyone. She is far better than that role. As well although somewhat important to the theme of the film I found the feces aspect of the film rather distracting and with exception to one humorous scene took away from the storyline.It sometime amazes me that cinematography can be far superior in films with independent budgets. I really appreciate the nature aspect that the cinematographer incorporated into the setting and I found that it really highlighted the themes of kindness and connection. The only complaint I have about the cinematography and lighting is that some scenes were very dark and it was difficult to truly connect with those scenes.All in all it was a very good movie and I recommend it as a lazy Sunday afternoon type movie".

If you like those you'll probably feel that this movie might be something for you.I actually would like to compare it to the TV Show Six Feet Under. And if I and you do that than in comparison this lacks quite a bit. The dysfunctional but still kinda working family thing has worked better there. And almost every episode is better than the movie is as a whole. So if you want good drama watch Six Feet Under if you haven't already.The movie itself isn't bad but a few things just don't work out. Like the relationship between Matthew Perry and his wife. While things are being said and shown there is nothing to ground those things. On the other hand there are a few scenes that are genuine and very good. Like the foot thing. That is very good observation. Or an adlib from Matthew Perry where he's doing the exact same thing his brother did 3 or 4 times. And while it could have been an annoying and plain stupid scene Matthew elevates it with his choice and adds an extra flavour to it.Those scenes are few and far between though and cannot entirely save the movie. Still not a complete waste of course".

Lauren Graham has nothing much to do except towards the end and though her character doesn't have much of an arc she acquits herself well. Swank has a bit of a thankless job in this one and like other reviewers have mentioned anyone could have performed in this role. She might have taken it up since this did not require her to do any heavy lifting and that would have meant a welcome change from all the other heavy stuff she's been know to do. Seeing her in this supporting role sometime took me out of the movie since its quite a distraction.Perry the leading man can quite carry things off and its strange that he hasn't done more roles either in Indies or in the mainstream. Hopefully that will change since this is an example of him taking chances with the material he does and could be known for. Foster's good as always but needs to play characters who can lighten up a little bit  all the intensity might just be putting him in a typical mould and that's not good for any actor who's capable of range.Having said all that this is a pretty decent watch for once and is quite similar to various other movies having been made about dysfunctional families in the recent past in a good way.".

It stops short of being preachy or overwritten. It is perfect! The casting is excellent too. Each character has great depth or shallowness that is magnificently represented by the actors chosen for each role. The pacing is also very well done as is the score and the camera work.

I really enjoyed the movie. Ben Foster portrayed an odd guy who has some type of sentiments about life and people. His character reminds me Frank Ginsberg in Little Miss Sunshine played by Steve Carrel. Lauren Graham annoyed me while the whole movie. First she acts like a good tolerant wife who wants a better life and more money. Then at the end of the movie she changed and just wanted to be a mother and a real good wife. However what are the reasons that changes her I really don't know. Hillary Swank has a role which is not a great role considering an Oscar winner. I think anybody can play her role. I give 810 to this movie. The only thing that I did not like in this movie Betty Tanager character was not well written. Ben Foster and Matthew Perry are great in acting. My suggestion if you liked Little Miss Sunshine you will love this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "After I watched The Ron Clark Story and Numb I started to think Matthew Perry is a really good actor besides Friends. This movie is another proof to my hypothesis. I really enjoyed the movie. Ben Foster portrayed an odd guy who has some type of sentiments about life and people. His character reminds me Frank Ginsberg in Little Miss Sunshine played by Steve Carrel. Lauren Graham annoyed me while the whole movie. First she acts like a good tolerant wife who wants a better life and more money. Then at the end of the movie she changed and just wanted to be a mother and a real good wife. However what are the reasons that changes her I really don't know. Hillary Swank has a role which is not a great role considering an Oscar winner. I think anybody can play her role. I give 810 to this movie. The only thing that I did not like in this movie Betty Tanager character was not well written. Ben Foster and Matthew Perry are great in acting. My suggestion if you liked Little Miss Sunshine you will love this movie.";

One of the people to who she tells her story is Dempsy Police Detective Lorenzo Council a black man. That story is that she was just carjacked by another unknown black man when she took a shortcut that she had never traveled between the Armstrong housing projects where she works at the Rainbow Club a children's center and her home in Gannon New Jersey. Her emotional distress is because her four year old son Cody was asleep in the back seat of the car and is thus now in the hands of the carjacker. Brenda's brother Danny Martin a police detective in Gannon cannot help but get directly involved in the investigation despite he operating outside his jurisdiction.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit I read the novel a few years ago and I was a big fan of it. So I went into the theater already wanting to like the movie. I wasn't as concerned with plot details as some other viewers apparently were. Since I knew what was going to happen I simply focused on reliving the story and seeing how the filmmakers interpreted it. It's such a dense novel with so much going on I think Richard Price is the only person who could've adapted it and still kept the spirit of the original material. Now all that being said...was it a good movie? In my opinion yes it was. I felt empathy for all the characters except Brenda's brother who I felt contempt for. I was surprised that I was able to empathize with Brenda's character but I credit Julianne Moore for that. She gave a performance that was filled with pain and confusion and fear and all the emotions I would have imagined Brenda would be going through. Samuel Jackson played Lorenzo just as I hoped he would. Not over the top with a bunch of yelling and fist pounding. But as a man who realizes all too well what can happen when a white woman points the finger at a black man and yells He did it! The biggest problem I have with the movie is the way that it's being marketed. If I hadn't read the book I would've never gone to see it based on it's trailer. It looks like just another missing child thriller. So I can understand why some viewers felt cheated when they saw the movie and realized that it's much more complex than that. It's about the politics of race and how they can be manipulated. It's about the uneasy truce that exists in some communities and how quickly a fuse can be lit to ignite tension. And most importantly it's about people making choices that they regret and the aftermath of those choices.If you're looking for a missing child thriller or a theatrical version of a CSI episode this probably isn't for you. If a tough examination of race and class makes you uncomfortable then don't bother with this one. But if you want to challenge yourself as a viewer and get inside the minds of characters who are trying desperately to hold their worlds together then I think you'll get something out of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Freedomland will not be a popular movie. The movie doesn't have enough action and the action is does contain is more to promote a message than to titillate. Its message is basically about inner city racism. Its about the fuss made over a missing white child in a black community. The story is about a white women who was carjacked in a housing project and unknown to the jacker her 4 year old son was in the car's back seat. You'll have to see the movie to see the rest since revealing the story would completely ruin the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the performances by Samuel Jackson William Forsythe and Ron Eldard were realistic and affecting. One standout was Edie Falco. She played a very unglamorous role and was powerfully affecting. She should get an Academy Award nomination for this role. She was fabulous. Another standout was Julianne Moore who was very miscast. I did not like her in this role. She played a very weak flawed and emotionally stunted individual whose behavior at times turned my stomach. I did not like the character. The character was not written to be liked maybe pitied and I think that aspect is what Ms. Moore was trying to evoke. I think she did too good a job at making her character weak and flawed and missed a toughness that the book's character had. To live in the environment that she did she would have acquired more emotional survival skills than the movie's character portrayed. Ms. Moore's character looked like she wandered onto the set from a suburban mall. Her looks and demeanor next to the strong Black women characters made her appear too weak and her obstinacy appears to be more stupidity. I think Edie Falco could have played this role better with her strength and then the revelations and breakdown when the toughness crumbled would have been more effective. The movie is unfortunately being advertised as a thriller and audiences expecting action and things blowing up will be disappointed. Freedomland is one of those movies that Hollywood doesn't get or know what to do with but it is a very worthwhile movie to see. I gave it a 7 out 10. I downgraded it slightly because of Ms. Moore's performance.".

The movie fails because Joe Roth is a terrible director. He tries to handle a bunch of different issues and he just doesn't mix them very well. He also introduces different characters and subplots but he doesn't build on them. Also for a movie tackling serious issues it was pretty unrealistic. The whole lockdown scenario was completely over the top and unnecessary. The kidnapping story had a bunch of holes and the way the cops handled the situation was pretty irresponsible. All the characters were stereotypes and most of them were unlikable. There were a lot of scenes dealing with racism but the film never actually dealt with them or settled them. The ending was total letdown and very little was actually settled making the whole movie experience pointless.The acting is the film's only strong point with Samuel L. Jackson giving the best performance. His performance felt a little familiar but it was still effective and his emotions never felt forced. Julianne Moore went completely over the top with her performance. She was annoying and completely unrealistic. Also it was hard to feel sorry for her character because she was so unlikable and her actions were just terrible. Edie Falco came out of nowhere and she gave a pretty moving performance. She played the only likable character in the film and it was easy to feel sorry for her. The rest of the supporting actors were below average and no one else broke out.Along with the acting there were a few other good things about the film. There were a couple of engaging scenes that could have been better if the director had built on them. The script was also decent and it could have been turned into a good film. The movie also had an interesting style to it and at least it sort of engages the viewer. While the film was pretty messy it held my attention until the end. Of course the performances helped with that but the storyline had a chance to build. Unfortunately it didn't and the movie ends with a whimper. In the end Freedomland is an annoying melodrama with very few redeeming qualities. Rating 410".

There were a couple of engaging scenes that could have been better if the director had built on them. The script was also decent and it could have been turned into a good film. The movie also had an interesting style to it and at least it sort of engages the viewer. While the film was pretty messy it held my attention until the end. Of course the performances helped with that but the storyline had a chance to build. Unfortunately it didn't and the movie ends with a whimper. In the end Freedomland is an annoying melodrama with very few redeeming qualities. Rating 410";

From an acting standpoint it's great with solid performances from Samuel L.

Edie Falco is also pretty good with a role that's anything but Mrs. Soprano. The writing or dialogue however is absolutely terrible. I think 'Freedomland' actually wouldn't be a halfbad movie if the screenwriter put as much work into the character's conversations as he did the creativity of the racial epithets spewed throughout the film. 'Freedomland' annoyed me in a sense that the movie trailers made it out to be something it's not  a taut mysterythriller when in reality it's a film about racial and economical tensions. 'Freedomland' is pretentious in that it thinks it's an Oscarcaliber film when in reality it's a slightly aboveaverage suspense film filled to the brim with tired clichs. 'Freedomland' is enjoyable if you can see through it's smug undeserved sense of brilliance. Grade C .screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 Phoenix Arizona 22005".

	schema:headline " Honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Freedomland falls flat in every possible way a movie can. The story is boring the viewer does not care about the characters and the movie goes nowhere. The film is set in 1999 which is odd because nothing during the course of the movie makes it necessary for it to take place during that time period. The story begins with Brenda Martin Julianne Moore walking into a hospital with wounds on her hands after being carjacked. Detective Lorenzo Council Samuel L. Jackson is called in to ask her further questions. Brenda then tells him the story and blames the carjacking on an unidentified black male. It also then occurs to her that her son was also in the stolen car. Brenda's brother is detective Danny Martin Ron Eldard of a neighboring police department. Trying to find his nephew quickly he puts the all black neighborhood where the carjacking took place under lock down. Since no one is allowed to leave the residents of the area start to get upset and unruly.To diffuse the situation Detective Council rushes to find Brenda's son before riots break out in the neighborhood or Brenda's son is found dead. As the story unfolds we find that there is more to the story then we know.Freedomland tries to deliver a twist ending at the end but everyone in the audience can see it coming. Ironically the movie openly tells you many times what the ending is going to be. Though when the truth is told we are supposed to be shocked and amazed.Even this strong cast of actors cannot save this movie from being totally lost. Samuel L. Jackson really underplays his role as Detective Council. Jackson is probably the loudest actor in Hollywood and the one role that needs it he does not deliver. Julianne Moore on the other hand overplays her role as Brenda who instead of a grieving mother comes off as a lunatic. By the end of this movie the viewer has no sympathy for her character because she is so annoying and irrational.The true shame about this movie is how it poorly tries to bring in themes of racial inequality. It seemed like an original set up by using the characters in the black neighborhood in lock down. Unfortunately the points the film is trying to make take a back seat to the boring story of Brenda and her missing kid. The racial ideas are then never fully developed and just fall short as a type of afterthought.Also what happened to this movie being a supernatural thriller? Every advertisement has shown the movie involving the child going missing for some mysterious reasons. The real story has nothing to do with the supernatural. The movie should not even be considered a thriller because nothing exciting or suspenseful ever takes place. Instead we just dragged along with these characters knowing exactly what is going to happen at the end.Freedomland is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It really should be an educational video of how not to make a movie because there is nothing good about this film.".

The previews also made it seem like the story could center around this creepy abandoned children's home named Freedomland but maybe 10 minutes of the whole movie took place there. Julianne Moore was just very frustrating because she couldn't get a complete thought out at ANY point in the entire movie. Her son goes missing which is sad but I feel more like I'm watching a druggedup woman rather than a grieving mother. Also frustrating were the 72 other subplots that were going on. Some characters are introduced but the reasoning for their introduction is never made clear. I felt like it was just too many bits and pieces that didn't amount to much.

In the rare occasions in which the message is clear the subject matter feels dated we've heard all this before . . . and in much more entertaining and insightful ways. The movie opens with some dramatic promise but it quickly winds down  becoming more stale and boring as the minutes tick by. Don't hold yourself hostage in a theater seat for this one if you're curious wait until the DVD release  but you most likely will not see it through to the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought the Forgotten sucked. This movie was easily the worst movie I've seen in years. I would rather have been a victim in a Saw movie than be subjected to an hour of a half of Julianne Moore being crazy. How can you establish a character to be respected in the community and trusted to care for children when she is borderline psychotic and is completely relying on the good graces and patience of others to find her son? This is not one woman's battle to find her son against all odds. This was one woman's plea to have a nap while one cop did stuff a black Reverend stirred up descent in his community against a ridiculously staged imprisonment of an inner city slum by cops who looked very surprised when the inevitable race riot started. There was not one redeeming thing in this movie other than it was good to see working again. It's about racism. I get it. But the premise was so utterly absurd I can't believe it could be followed through. It's a story true enough but in my mind there are so many other ways to do it. Do cops play favourites with white and black issues? Maybe. Would cops shut down an entire projects to shakedown a community into giving up a potential car jacker with worldwide media covering the story? Maybe in China. Julianne Moore the grieving mother who so obviously obstructs any effort to find her son while at the same time subjecting the audience to how much she loves her little boy can only foreshadow the inevitable twist which was hypothesised within the first twenty minutes. Then the twenty minute wailing speech that somehow tries to justify or redeem one of the worst depictions of a mother I've ever seen. Then the movie still carries on for another ten minutes or so. Don't open it. Don't rent it. Don't start watching it. It's like a train wreck. You may want to see it through to the end and when it's over you'll be angry. Remember those stupid commercials the studios put out telling us not to pirate videos that it's against the law that it's stealing? I think I just got robbed of my rental fee.".

	schema:headline " Cheap Race Hustling Movie Trying to Be Profound";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a crock from the start. The writer Price is some white liberal who anointed himself as an interpreter of inner city blacks to us ignorant white yahoos. His previous venture was the better Clockers which was made into a lame movie by Spike Lee. In a country where the two latest racial flaps were a black whore falsely accusing 3 frat boys of rape and that case dragged on for a year in spite of the fact EVERY shred of evidence pointed to their innocence and the woman changed her story with the weather. Don't forget how every white academic liberal and their black studies cohort spewed venom on the students based on the old antebellum slaves being raped by massa myth which goes against reality where there are 112 black on white rapes for every case of the reverse. Or the Jena 6 case where six violent black youths beat a white kid silly. But since some nooses were hung months earlier which had nothing to do with either race or the kid they beat the black power movement and the white liberal drones descended on Jena to exonerate the punks and excoriate the town. But in their defense I do add that attempted murder was too steep a charge but those Jena 6 punks belong in jail not addressing the NAACP or appearing on BET.Back to the movie this wigged out white mother Julianne Moore claimed she was carjacked and her kid was taken from her and this happened in the projects. She is no racist as a matter of fact she works in the same project in the day care center along with her son who is in the class. So naturally everyone goes haywire trying to find the kid. There are shades of the 1994 Susan Smith case the murdering Southern mom who killed her kids then tried to blame it on a black man. But as I remember the police never bought her story and never shut down a project either. Her brother is a white cop in the neighboring working class suburb. Natch he's a racist and angry as heck. Yet even he thinks his sister is a loser who is hiding something. So the suburban cops buffalo themselves into the city and shut down the project This is the first bit of unreality. As if the city and the mayor are going to put up with this. As if ten thousand lawyers civil rights protesters Sharpton rabble rousers and Nation of Islam thugs wouldn't descend on this city in a matter of hours this in the middle of New Jersey not the Sudan in 1999 not 1949. That alone makes most of the other racial drama superfluous. Then there is the other persistent whine about Our black kids go missing and you do nothing but when a white kid goes missing.... like the black on black crime whineas if black on white crime is acceptable this falls on deaf ears to me since it is the criminal street code of silence and the horrid conditions of black inner city families that hinder solving and creates the conditions for those crimes and tragedies.The movie quickly devolves into an almost father  daughter relation between Detective Council Sam Jackson and the distraught mother Brenda Martin played by Julianne Moore. Credit must be given to Ms. Moore for her thankless performance of a really messed up woman as well as to Edie Falco who played a woman who finds lost children and helps crack the case.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was a crock from the start. The writer Price is some white liberal who anointed himself as an interpreter of inner city blacks to us ignorant white yahoos. His previous venture was the better Clockers which was made into a lame movie by Spike Lee. In a country where the two latest racial flaps were a black whore falsely accusing 3 frat boys of rape and that case dragged on for a year in spite of the fact EVERY shred of evidence pointed to their innocence and the woman changed her story with the weather. Don't forget how every white academic liberal and their black studies cohort spewed venom on the students based on the old antebellum slaves being raped by massa myth which goes against reality where there are 112 black on white rapes for every case of the reverse. Or the Jena 6 case where six violent black youths beat a white kid silly. But since some nooses were hung months earlier which had nothing to do with either race or the kid they beat the black power movement and the white liberal drones descended on Jena to exonerate the punks and excoriate the town. But in their defense I do add that attempted murder was too steep a charge but those Jena 6 punks belong in jail not addressing the NAACP or appearing on BET.Back to the movie this wigged out white mother Julianne Moore claimed she was carjacked and her kid was taken from her and this happened in the projects. She is no racist as a matter of fact she works in the same project in the day care center along with her son who is in the class. So naturally everyone goes haywire trying to find the kid. There are shades of the 1994 Susan Smith case the murdering Southern mom who killed her kids then tried to blame it on a black man. But as I remember the police never bought her story and never shut down a project either. Her brother is a white cop in the neighboring working class suburb. Natch he's a racist and angry as heck. Yet even he thinks his sister is a loser who is hiding something. So the suburban cops buffalo themselves into the city and shut down the project This is the first bit of unreality. As if the city and the mayor are going to put up with this. As if ten thousand lawyers civil rights protesters Sharpton rabble rousers and Nation of Islam thugs wouldn't descend on this city in a matter of hours this in the middle of New Jersey not the Sudan in 1999 not 1949. That alone makes most of the other racial drama superfluous. Then there is the other persistent whine about Our black kids go missing and you do nothing but when a white kid goes missing.... like the black on black crime whineas if black on white crime is acceptable this falls on deaf ears to me since it is the criminal street code of silence and the horrid conditions of black inner city families that hinder solving and creates the conditions for those crimes and tragedies.The movie quickly devolves into an almost father  daughter relation between Detective Council Sam Jackson and the distraught mother Brenda Martin played by Julianne Moore. Credit must be given to Ms. Moore for her thankless performance of a really messed up woman as well as to Edie Falco who played a woman who finds lost children and helps crack the case. Samuel Jackson played the requisite strong black guy who sets all the racist whites as well as his brood in the projects straight. He even had a chance to quell the requisite racial confrontation in the end by telling everyone the case was solved but that would have been too simple. I wonder if all those black cops in New Orleans the ones who looted and abandoned their posts during the flood or committed violent crimes on the side should invite him in as a role model?

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen my share of bad movies. This one rates way way way down there. First off it is misrepresented by the ads. The trailer makes it look like a supernatural thriller recalling Moore's then recent and also poor release The Forgotten. There are NO supernatural elements in this movie. If you expect any you will be disappointed. Second the performances left something to be desired. Especially Julianne Moore. I am not her biggest fan but this was an especially poor performance on her part. She seemed to just be acting stoned or something. She would meander around the set rock back and forth and stare off into space when she was not babbling in a phony beyond belief accent. The rest of the cast does not come off much better. Motivations seem to shift wildly between scene transitions. Actions are taken from out of nowhere without any logical progression.I think the first problem is the script. This is based on a novel and apparently the story was a bit too complicated to bring to the screen. That is the story is pretty straightforward and bonesimple. What made the book worth reading was how the author did it. That does not translate easily to the screen.Probably the biggest flaw for me was the titular Freedomland. In the novel Freedomland referred to an abandoned amusement park which was the scene of an extensive search as well as a reference to the people being locked into their own homes part of the plot which was short changed IMO. The whole racial thing was there but never explored or addressed really. The whole movie you were given reminders of the tension that was supposed to be building but it never ever pays off. In the movie the name was transfered to some abandoned orphanage. Once again the trailer leads us to believe falsely. The trailer made it sound like this Freedomland would somehow play a major role in the plot like some dark secret was held here or something. That is not what happen. SPOILERS What happens is the detective and rescue volunteer seem to be thinking the mother had killed her child and took her there in a ploy to get her to confess. And it worked. END SPOILERS This of course makes no sense but the seemingly random character actions are to blame.Most of this can be blamed on the editing. Most screen actors would stink up the room if you use everything they do. It's the editor's job to make sure they use the best performances and cut the film so that character actions make sense etc. This just didn't happen here. Freedomland may still have not been an especially good movie but it could have been a lot less bad if the editing had been up to snuff.On the plus side I think Samuel L Jackson is wearing the same hat Gene Hackman wore in The French Connection.".

	schema:headline " CSI Freedomland";
	schema:reviewBody "An OK movie if you like crime drama such as CSI any version Starsky and Hutch the original show not the silly movie Dragnet NYPD etc. etc.. I'm pretty sure I've seen this entire story played out on TV at one time or another. I think Starsky and Hutch the original show might have done that story and CSI Las Vegas have done similar stories.The thing that annoyed me the most was the section about Freedomland itself... which... as far as I could gather was the orphanage from hell or youth center not sure where kids were tortured and abused blah blah. etc. I'm a bit tired of orphanages getting such negative press. Obviously there is supposed to be some sort of symbolic function of a hellhole named Freedomland but its not clear to me what its symbolic function was... as far as I could tell its function in the story was to 1 drag out a rather thin story worthy of a typical CSI episode where it would compete with 1 or 2 other subplots into a movie length production 2 to torment the dippy blond into confessing the truth.Do American cities typically have large wooded areas in their midst with unused derelict buildings? At the very least you'd think it would be filled with squatters and street people.For a movie about racial stereotyping and racial tension why do they so freely use a racist images of whites? The white trash dippy blond stereotype for the female lead? The bigoted brutal police officer of her brother? This is in noticeable contrast to Crash which was also about racism but where all the stereotypes are challenged where the bigot becomes a hero to save a black woman and the antiracist kills a black hitchhiker because he thinks the hitchhiker is drawing a gun etc..I also did not like the main characters attitude towards the case  he was very insensitive. Yes he was right but suppose he had been wrong? Why does the main character have to be right all the time! The story would have been better if he had been convinced that she was telling the truth and then there would be a little tension when the truth comes out but we all pretty much know that she was faking it because he told us so because she was not freaked out by meeting a black cop why does he assume she should be racist? And why are all the whites in the movie idiots or bigots? The dippy blond hysterical mother thing was really annoying but I can't conceive of an actual mother reacting in the way she did to an accidental poisoning... duh call 911 get the kids stomach pumped out  death by overdose of medicine especially children's medicine is typically a slow affair. Yes too much medicine can be poisonous yes but they are not so toxic that death comes so easily as it apparently did in the film and if he is given it every night to get him to sleep he would have a tolerance to it. The police would have no way of knowing she wasn't there and would likely not be able to charge her with neglect even if she was in their with him the kid could still poison himself. Egad I can't imagine someone getting a kid to take cough medicine every night because most of it tastes horrible except for children's Tylenol or Jack and Jill and those are so mild and come in such small bottles I think it would take more than one bottle to kill a kid. Related to that the movie does not explore the possibility that the kid might well have been alive but unconscious when buried its mentioned but not followed up on... a little drama after the autopsy which was never discussed might have been called for soil in the lungs.... I buried him alive sob sob... and then kills herself or is executed would have been a better ending.How could she dig a grave in a park in the city without anyone noticing? How could they cover up the grave so well that no one noticed standing right over it except the missing child expert? How could a mother leave her loved kid in an unmarked grave in a park? Why hadn't stray dogs dug up the corpse  was the grave the required 6 feet deep to prevent animal from digging up the corpse? How did they dig such a grave? Why didn't the forensic people CSI look at the earth samples in her finger nails and determine that she had been digging how deep subsoil and identify the approximate area by the mineral content or whatever  don't these movie producers watch CSI? But again if you like crime drama its a decent time waster. But its an old fashion drama Dragnet Starsky and Hutch NYPD where confessions and hunches solve the case rather than evidence. I'd like to have seen more focus on the evidence in the case as in CSI rather than on the soppy confessions of the distraught mother or the hunches of the police detective. The main characters reason for doubting her story was her reaction to him... it should have been the dirt under her finger nails.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caught an advance screening a week ago the same one attended by the other reviewer.It's a sad day when a movie is made with its sights set on an Oscar award AND box office at the same time. For me the mere intent can undermine a good idea  what to say of a bad one? That's what happens in this botched and overblown attempt at a dramathriller some may say a cross between a 70's racial drama and The Forgotten  on speed. IT IS a bad idea from the start  everyone in Hollywood knows the trouble that is adapting a lengthy book to the screen. But when you couple that with Oscar aspirations  for acting I suppose  you have a recipe for disaster.The basic story line is that of a single mom that gets carjacked while lost in a public park and then proceeds to tell the police after much emotion that her son is still in the car with the criminal. Pretty much what all thrillers are about right? Well everything is kosher except that she is white and the park where it all took place happens to be right in the middle of a poor black neighborhood.As the viewer would have guessed the main topics here are the racial conflict  violent white cops versus angry black mob  and the desperate search for the kid.As director and screenwriter tried to keep every single thread present in the book things eventually get extremely confusing. We never get a feel for the characters or a sense of fulfillment. Many of the threads feel incomplete and others seem like mere sketches that went along for the ride.More so Joe Roth's directing style is frenetic and restless. I'd say he could do a great action flick but here so much movement ends up wasted and actually annoys the viewer.Finally to keep this short the acting goes from OK to histrionic. I truly feel sorry for Julianne Moore  she is a great actress trapped in a recycled role. Samuel Jackson is another casualty his talent is wasted on another empty character an amalgam that doesn't work despite his visible effort. Many dislike the score but I did enjoy it for some obscure reason.Well as you guys can see Freedomland is a disappointment and I would highly recommend a DVD screening for this one since it is my personal belief that we should see a little bit of everything in a protected environment.".

I'd say he could do a great action flick but here so much movement ends up wasted and actually annoys the viewer.Finally to keep this short the acting goes from OK to histrionic. I truly feel sorry for Julianne Moore  she is a great actress trapped in a recycled role. Samuel Jackson is another casualty his talent is wasted on another empty character an amalgam that doesn't work despite his visible effort. Many dislike the score but I did enjoy it for some obscure reason.Well as you guys can see Freedomland is a disappointment and I would highly recommend a DVD screening for this one since it is my personal belief that we should see a little bit of everything in a protected environment.";

	schema:reviewBody "For me a film doesn't have to be good to be worthy if it is part of a journey I share with an artist. I just saw Vacuuming Nude by Boyle. Its a fantastic failure but one you register against contexts you bring to his successful projects. Some artists are worth the investment. Its as simple as that. You need to walk with them through the dark areas and get cut also.Julianne Moore is one of the few actors for whom I've made that decision. Its because she had a period in there of extreme ability probably acquired. She was a nothing then participated in some amazing workshops in layered techniques producing the Vanya on 42nd Street a sort of masterpiece. Then followed some years where she was in the CateKate class. Inexplicably she became involved with a man who is cinematically even dramatically dull and some years of ordinariness returned. She's bright enough to know this which is why she attached herself to this. As originally planned it would have been by Winterbottom one of an elite group of serious filmmakers committed to seriously exploring the form while respecting an actor's aspirations. For reasons unknown to me he left. I suppose that a lessor man would have lived with some compromise or another. In this case it may well have been the acceptance of Jackson and the muddle of context that's presented here.His flaws are all too manufactured. He's got a son in prison and an absent wife. He's in the middle of a theatrically centered struggle in the police force. He's a delicately balanced agent in some simple racial dynamics. He's a good man sketched in incomplete ways. All this is supposed to introduce some complexity as he gets engaged with Moore's character.But this situation is incoherent so the world in which we see Moore's character simply doesn't exist. Winterbottom could have made it work probably with a real actor one who finds characters instead of reuses his own.So we are left with a bunch of scattered dramatic toys surrounding what Moore is doing. But what she's doing is enough for you to spend time with this. She's attempting to re engage with that level of being that she as an actor once had. Like her character the surrounding circumstances don't help. She's alone in her struggle to connect. She's figuratively killed her child.The way she approaches her character is different than anything she has done before. She's very physical. She moves her upper torso and particularly her mouth in ways that we've never seen before. She allows herself to become possessed by some controlling being not in her domain external. It doesn't work in the story of course because the story doesn't work. But the character is darned effective. We do see at least two beings in there merged in a way that seems to matter. We do see some of her seeing other elements of herself fighting and negotiating coexisting in dynamically changing ways. There's an internal story we can glimpse.One scene does work and its the one the title hangs on. Another woman structured in the same way but more in control is helping Moore's character search for her lost son. They are in an abandoned institution for lost children called Freedomland. There's an outer negotiation between the two that mirrors what Moore's created internally. Its brilliant. Its supposed to I guess be the dual of similar connections Jackson's character cannot make.See it. See a soul lost to us struggle to swim back.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Not that i expected any miracles but i though there was more to be had with this cast.Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses. When given the proper material she can be brilliant Samuel L. Jackson might not be of her caliber but he is without a doubt a very competent actor. Both these actors are sorely wasted here. Apparently director Joe Roth has produced a large amount of films and directed very few. Seeing this movie i'm convinced that he should stick to producing. The script is also part of the problem here but lacking direction is a major issue.The story revolves around a missing child the actions of the police and the racial tensions that leads to. Or at least that is what we are told the story is about. But when the movie starts the racial tensionsbit is almost completely removed for a long time returning in the end almost as an afterthought. This movie tries so hard to play the emotional chord that it's almost painful. Painful because it doesn't work that is. What we have left is completely unfit smothering music from James Newton Howard and excruciatingly slow scenes that seem to last forever.What i wonder is why Julianne Moore seems to be caught in these sniveling wreck of a womanparts nowadays. She has way too much skill for that. Of the cast i thought Edie Falco was the one who managed best perhaps because her character had a point not to be sentimental. Honestly i found this movie to be almost unbearable. Slow shallow and wanting to say so many things about so much without having any idea how to do it. The same things have been done so much better so many times before. This movie is simply... unnecessary. Neither touching nor thoughtprovoking.".

Brenda is about as mixed up as cake batter. We first get introduced to her as she walks blocks to the nearest hospital and wastes copious amounts of time before revealing that she was carjacked and that her young son was in the backseat of the vehicle and is now somewhere in the hands of the black man who pulled her out of her car.Enter one Lorenzo Council the usually reliable Samuel L. Jackson. Lorenzo is the detective that gets assigned Brenda in the hospital and he stumbles when he hears the news about the missing child. In fact his actions would be how Benny Hill might react to the same situation. He asks the same questions twice over and gets so excited that he needs a shot in order to calm him down and regulate his breathing. If this wasn't sign enough that Brenda just got assigned the most inept cop to try and find son just wait a couple of scenes and watch how Lorenzo doesn't notice that there is a large red truck following him around  that is until such time as the plot requires the reveal.So with the blind leading the blind the story takes on many avenues. First we get introduced to Danny Martin Ron Eldard who is both a cop and the uncle of the missing child. He quickly gets the men in uniform to scour the black neighborhood and has the power to set up barricades to ensure that the poor and impoverished are in a modern day lockdown. He beats up potential witnesses and runs interference to Lorenzo's more tranquil and relaxed investigation.Next we get introduced to Edie Falco as Karen Collucci a mother who lost a child herself and offers her counseling and organization skills to help in the search for the young boy. Her keen acumen leads a group of searchers to Freedomland  a forest on the outside of town  which in turn provides us with the pivotal reveal of the film.I could ruin the reveal to you  and I should just to spare you from wasting your time and money on this dud  but what the hell knock yourself out with the rental when it becomes available in about 5 weeks.What I can reveal is that Freedomland is awful. A movie with Moore Jackson and Falco directed by onetime studio boss Joe Roth who comes off one of last years worst in Christmas with the Kranks should have been on the mustsee list. Instead we have a movie that is so convoluted and disorganized that it is hard to believe that Richard Price took his own novel to produce this mess of a screenplay.Hmmmmm. Maybe that was the problem. Maybe the novel had so many characters and ideas that as screenwriter Price didn't know what to leave off while keeping himself happy while maintaining the integrity of the chapters. Who knows. All I know is that I don't care.Freedomland is a disaster. From beginning to end it plays the race card unconvincingly whenever it wants and the big showdown between Moore and Jackson went on so long that I kept looking on the armrest for the converter to fast forward the scene.Look for Freedomland to hit my Worst of List at the conclusion of the year.

This movie while have some manbashing elements is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor depth and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful selfabsorbed men do exist. However as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with love just happens. We cannot choose who we love. Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too ".

	onyx:emotionText "I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie while have some manbashing elements is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor depth and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today's world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie I think that it's important to realize that unfaithful selfabsorbed men do exist. However as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with love just happens. We cannot choose who we love. Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too ";

It's nice to see that black women had a movie about them and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn't that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she's a singer.  If she wasn't a famous singer nobody would say anything bad about her acting. IMO she acted very well just like in all her movies she's not an oscar caliber actress very few are but she definitely has screen presence charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she's a singer unlike Madonna or Mariah Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people and she hasn't had flops  horrible movies.".

	schema:headline " Double Standard";
	schema:reviewBody "So I finally got around to watching Waiting to Exhale on Encore the other night and I don't understand why this became a hit.Note spoilers ahead As far as I can tell the basic premise of this film is that all men are insensitive callous and unfeeling especially towards women.Okay well and good. That is the storyline? Fine. Men suck got it.But there is a huge double standard here two of the women are dating married men and clearly we are meant to be sympathetic about their plight as they whine and cry about not having their man with them at night in bed.How about this? STOP DATING MARRIED MEN! Maybe that's your problem in the first place.Now on the flip side Angela Basset's character is abandoned by her husband for another woman. Yet if you pay attention even this character is not completely innocent. When her husband informs her he is leaving the things she says makes it clear she's known about his lovers for years but ignored his infidelities. Why? Obviously because he's so wealthy.She liked all the stuff a little too much to have confronted him about it. Again she's made her bed here not as completely as the two who are actively cheating but still. She spends the rest of the movie being so angry that he left her you never really grow to like her. Strangest of all is the man whose wife is dying of cancer he sleeps with the Angela Basset character after they run into each other at a bar. With their clothes on which apparently means it's ohsoplatonic and sweet. Then he writes her a letter months later thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off he'll contact her again.Did anyone else think this was more than a little sleazy? I would hope if I were dying of breast cancer that my husband wasn't out sleeping around and I do mean just sleeping with other women. Sweet platonic whatever I think it's pretty horrible.Bottom line the characters you're supposed to connect to are unlikable and the ones you're supposed to hate are just pathetic. Not very enjoyable. However I did give it three stars for the music which didn't suck too badly and the clothes and style. It's a nice little snapshot of how things looked in '95. And the print wasn't very faded. That's about it though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It's not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria  even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger Holly Hunter Alfre Woodard and others.Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight insecure nononsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight but she was the only one who found it and deserved it. She was the only one who didn't sleep around wasn't a man basher set a good example for her son and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face  look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie.Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package  beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life  she could now start her catering business she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end.Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men.Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same  Whitney Houston being well groomed pretending to be well spoken and classy and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise although she might have been too young. The character had to tell us she was smart  in a phone conversation with her mother she said I'm smart I'm a good person and I work hard. Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director as Forest Whitaker didn't tell this story properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were.Also was it me or was everything in this movie either orange or blue?".

As for Miss Houston when I was watching her act well Chesty Morgan's performance in Deadly Weapons came to mind for some odd reason as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle and wasn't going to last for too long..

As for Miss Houston when I was watching her act well Chesty Morgan's performance in Deadly Weapons came to mind for some odd reason as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle and wasn't going to last for too long.. All in all I wasn't really disappointed in the film it just slid off...";

It's nice to know that someone has made a movie with four strong independent AfricanAmerican women. But when I saw it  and maybe this is me ranting because I being a white male am not part of the target audience  I was annoyed by all the whining especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping withgetting divorced from were leaving them for white women.I can understand them being upset even furious with all of the philandering. But they act as if it would be OK if the men left them for other AfricanAmerican women. Not to make light of the issues of racism adultery or divorce but I can image Bernadine saying Hey Savannah I see that you're sleeping with my husband. Care if I join in!? Apologies to those who may take offense.Speaking of Savannah why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job  not to mention is MARRIED. I guess that any man who isn't married is a loser to Whitney. Having not read the book I realize that this is merely an adaptation  or for Terry McMillan's sake I hope it is. I'm not knocking any of the acting. Angela Bassett Whitney Houston Lela Rochon and Loretta Devine as well as the supporting cast are all talented and do commendable jobs. And Forest Whitaker proves himself to be a talented director. It's just that the lion's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic. I realize that I'm merely scratching the surface but I've wasted enough time on this movie. Why Do Fools Fall In Love the movie which describes Frankie Lymon's battles with the recording industry and liasons sp with three different women one of which is Rochon is a far superior movie and worth at least 5 of the 6 that I paid to see it.  I give this one 2 out of 10.".

Waiting To Exhale Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it's star Whitney Houston. However as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.Waiting To Exhale had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately in the end the movie is a repetitive drone.It tells the story of four AfricanAmerican females played by Angela Bassett Whitney Houston Loretta Divine and Lela Rochon as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem in the world of this movie men are nothing but complete assholes who wouldn't know the word feelings if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.For the first 45 minutes the film is slightly enjoyable. However as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like dejavu.

Slightly soothing enjoyable and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. Waiting To Exhale in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast.

Good solid movies about sisterhood are probably needed now more than ever but not at the cost of shortchanging the good upright decent brothers out there whom this movie largely forgets about with some notable exceptions  Gregory Hines for example.And the frustration doesn't end there. Both Savannah and Robin manage to find themselves involved with the most shady characters a married man and a dope fiend respectively yet they complain about the lack of good men out there. I suppose it would be silly to question just where they've been looking even though it might hold the answer. The sad thing is that there are fellas out there who have little to no regard for women the scum of the fking earth to quote Savannah and women who fall for fellas like that for the most silly shallow reasons.If it wasn't for Bassett Devine and Babyface's score this movie would barely be watchable.

	schema:reviewBody "It feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria  even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger Holly Hunter Alfre Woodard and others.Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight insecure nononsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight but she was the only one who found it and deserved it. She was the only one who didn't sleep around wasn't a man basher set a good example for her son and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face  look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie.Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package  beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life  she could now start her catering business she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end.Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men.Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same  Whitney Houston being well groomed pretending to be well spoken and classy and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise although she might have been too young. The character had to tell us she was smart  in a phone conversation with her mother she said I'm smart I'm a good person and I work hard. Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director as Forest Whitaker didn't tell this story properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were.Also was it me or was everything in this movie either orange or blue?".

I don't have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger Holly Hunter Alfre Woodard and others.Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight insecure nononsense business woman and mother. She didn't think she was worthy of love because of her weight but she was the only one who found it and deserved it. She was the only one who didn't sleep around wasn't a man basher set a good example for her son and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face  look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent good man and I'm glad this was addressed in the movie.Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package  beauty and talent. Her character wasn't perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life  she could now start her catering business she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end.Lela Rochon didn't display any acting talent here and wasn't quite up to the job of conveying Robin's vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn't seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer's disease. I don't feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn't seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men.Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same  Whitney Houston being well groomed pretending to be well spoken and classy and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise although she might have been too young. The character had to tell us she was smart  in a phone conversation with her mother she said I'm smart I'm a good person and I work hard. Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn't have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn't like at all and doesn't even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills doesn't really seem interested in her friends'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director as Forest Whitaker didn't tell this story properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn't get a strong sense of who they were.Also was it me or was everything in this movie either orange or blue?";

I suppose that in 1995 the angst of dealing with infidelity did not make one want to watch a movie that includes a lot of infidelity. In the end as became my lesson in life the movie is about four different women dealing with male problems in different ways. So watching this movie some two decades after going through a healing process I could laugh at the realities that were portrayed while celebrating that being alive leads us through various situations because we are indeed different as men and women. The movie is therefore while old and not a break down the door to see event worth the watch.... as a chick flick or a guy 'bin there and was arrogantinsensitive like that' reflection".

I feel that these situations are very well shown in this movie.The movie in my opinion shows motivation and support to those that are in situations like these that you don't have to be miserable and you CAN be strong and pull yourself together and Exhale instead of putting yourself in a stressful environment feeling unable to take another breath.Yes there may be characters that may are a bit extreme but there are also plenty of people in this world the exact same way.I do agree with ones previous comment portraying the image that if it were a black woman he cheated on her with it would be OK was a bit too far but then again there are still those that still to this day are against other races. Although not too many people agree with it as I don't there are some that do.I believe it does show great strength as strong women taking a stand for themselves to pull themselves together and stay strong and realize they have the ability to make themselves happy no matter the situation they are in.

I remember going to see it twice at the time and laughing all the way through it amazed that British comedies could be this good.It has a huge amount going for it with intelligence cracking lines and some highly stylised photography by Adrian Biddle.Curtis' semiautobiographical script is based on his own days as a fall guy for Atkinson and the result is well worth a look.".

The result is The Tall Guy probably the greatest comedy of 1989. I remember going to see it twice at the time and laughing all the way through it amazed that British comedies could be this good.It has a huge amount going for it with intelligence cracking lines and some highly stylised photography by Adrian Biddle.Curtis' semiautobiographical script is based on his own days as a fall guy for Atkinson and the result is well worth a look.";

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Curtis has written some impressive romantic comedies Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill Bridget Jones Love Actually and had his hand in the writing of some of the top British TV comedy of our time Mr Bean Not the 9 O'Clock news Blackadder. This was one of his first scripts to be turned into a feature film.He wrote this script about his own experience playing straight man to Rowan Atkinson on his early tours. Curtis was frustrated in real life with being under the shadow of Atkinson but the script obviously makes a caricature out of this by turning Atkinson into a terrible nasty villain. But Rowan fans beware this is not as fun as it sounds. The unkindest touch of all was added by Rowan himself. He makes himself appear completely unfunny. He plays his backstage self without a touch of humour or subversion  one would almost swear that Rowan just really was a nasty bastrd.But anyone who's seen Rowan's stage shows or Not the 9 O'Clock News knows that Rowan can play a bastard with ironic humour where we know he's only kidding  on stage Rowan specialised in bastards like the vicars and schoolmasters he's played and nobodies like Mr Bean. Here Rowan knew it was important for the story for Rowan to not actually be funny and the straight man to actually be funny. Plus we need to root for the straight man played by Jeff Golblum. Rowan's being a villain is the story's main source of conflict and dramatic tension. Without it there isn't a story. So Rowan has ironically done a brave and humble thing by agreeing to play it completely straight humourless and cold  and he shows himself a really good dramatic actor though the experience may be disheartening for Rowan fans.So if you're a Rowan fan this will not be for you. If you're a Richard Curtis fan this is a fairly simple and conventional script but its quite a fun romantic comedy nonetheless. Emma Thomson is suitably cold and severe and Jeff Golblum makes a good everyman. 610.".

I can't recall a film that treats the act in such a spontaneous slapstick and totally hilarious manner as it's done here.

One's taste in comedies is a highly personal thing and not everyone will find this movie to their taste but if you like the inimitable flavor of British humor as I do and enjoy Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson you will probably find this movie to be extremely rewarding  that is hilarious and perhaps a bit touching.It's got its flaws of course.  There are plenty of spots where nothing really happens the music is pretty uneven and a few gags fall flat.  There are one or two key plot points that are a little hard to follow especially the scene with Emma Thompson on the television.  And surprisingly the last quarter or so turns a bit grim and comes a bit close to losing sight of the whimsicality which is so much of this movie's charm.But I'll gladly put up with all that for what this movie has to offer.  It's incredibly hard to make a good comedy and all too many comedies nowadays are either too tame or too scatological...too cruel or too meek...too earnest or too smug in their irony.  The Tall Guy proves that there is ground between these extremes and what fertile ground it is!  I don't know if one could make this movie in America  the entire film is permeated with a uniquely British sensibility that makes it irresistible.  And in the midst of all this Jeff Goldblum is absolutely spoton as the bemused American his facial expressions and reaction shots in this movie are priceless.  It's a pity that so many of his recent roles have been in action movies  at his best Goldblum is a fantastic comic actor and this movie depends completely on his charm wit and expressiveness.One of the centerpieces of the movie by the way is a musical based on The Elephant Man.  It's a tourdeforce of parody brilliantly satirizing the tastelessnesses and mediocrities of modern musicals  indeed I wish we could get to see even more of it.I recently revisited The Tall Guy for the third time watching it sidebyside with There's Something About Mary and I can't begin to tell you how much the latter movie suffered by comparison.  They have a few traits in common  both movies revolve around the pursuit of a beautiful woman by a misanthropicbutoddlyhandsome male Jewish lead both have a strong sexual element to their humor and both feature a prominent handicapped character a blind man in the Tall Guy a man on crutches in Mary whose misadventures are played for laughs.  But where There's Something About Mary is coarse mean and obvious The Tall Guy is witty absurd and completely goodnatured  and in my opinion far superior.I suspect there are a fair number of people who won't get The Tall Guy and that's a shame.  But if it sounds like it's on your wavelength rent it if you can find it.  It's an incredibly sweet and funny movie that is well worth the watching.".

Both are playing very much against type and in Atkinson's case that is a deliberate self parody and part of the joke. He is funny by being as unfunny as it's possible to be.So what about the film specifically? The story is a fairly simple one except with some clever role reversals on sexual stereotypes. Shy boy worldly wise girl evil boss hard times survived good times lead to temptation and betrayal and finally a denouement which echoes back to the role reversed attitudes that cemented the relationship in the first place.The show is funny and well though not perfectly paced. The straight and personable acting enhances the comedy as do the moments of real drama.

Thinking to myself that this was an interestinglooking cast I stayed with it and was later also introduced to Emma Thompson and much to my surprise extremely small oneline roles for Angus Deayton Robin Driscoll and Charles Augins.It was fun while it lasted. Rowan Atkinson has some more memorable scenes as a snide unlikeable character and Jeff Goldblum is actually quite fascinating in romantic loveme mode. Considering it was very late at night I hope I can be forgiven for not regurgitating the plot correctly here but I seem to remember that Goldblum played a reluctant straightman to Atkinson in his stage show and decided to step out on his own which eventually led to him getting the lead role in a musical production of The Elephant Man. I'm not sure if it was all as corny as that sounds but it was roughly it. It was certainly enough fodder for a few laughs and a few smiles all around. I wouldn't mind viewing this film again while fully awake but I'm sure it would be just as entertaining. I give this one three stars out of five.".

I'm not sure if it was all as corny as that sounds but it was roughly it. It was certainly enough fodder for a few laughs and a few smiles all around. I wouldn't mind viewing this film again while fully awake but I'm sure it would be just as entertaining. I give this one three stars out of five.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1989 this is a work in progress movie for both writer Richard Curtis and Director Mel Smith. Both were to move on to much better things! That said there are weak signals of Curtis's talent later to be fully realised in Four a Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill and Love Actually. But a few good lines does not a coherent movie make and the plot is shallow and the characterisation sketchy at best. Jeff Goldblum's Dexter seems bewildered by everything  not least his subservient position to comic superstar Ron Anderson played with believable malevolence by Rowan Atkinson. Emma Thompson then just 30 looks lovely and shows her developing talent as a comic actress. The best thing in the film by some way.Mel Smith's direction drags a bit and it is only in the very funny mock musical Elephant  based improbably on the Elephant Man  that the film comes to life. The musical is a chance for Smith to satirise the musical genre of the time with references to Les Miserables and especially to the LloydWebber songbook. A Sarah Brightman lookalike does a number straight out of Phantom and it's very funny.The film is quite daring with an explicit sex scene between Thompson and Goldblum that is so energetic that they destroy the former's bedroom The relationship between the two is a forerunner of Curtis's boygirl romances in later movies. Always a slip or three between cup and lip! This is not a great film nor even a very good one. It is worth study as an exercise in how Richard Curtis's talent was first applied in a movie rather than television for which he was previously known especially for Blackadder.".

I decided to stay and watch not just because I had already seen A Night on Earth several times but because I was curious when I saw Wallace Shawn  Andre Gregory on screen together in a film other then My Dinner with Andre.Don't be fooled and think that this film is simply a sequel to My Dinner with Andre because it is far from it.  What you have here is a screen version of the stage play Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekhov but with a twist. The cast is doing a rehearsal of Uncle Vanya in a rundown theater in the middle of NYC to an audience of the director Andre Gregory and a few others.  The film also includes breaks in the play for stage direction acting as an intermission for the cast as well as initial dialogue before and after the rehearsal.  This also includes an amazing opening scene in which we see all the actors walking down 42nd Street in NYC heading toward the theater literally appearing out of the crowdedness of NYC.In addition to just seeing a fantastic version of Uncle Vanya you get some of the best acting performances in some time.  Julianne Moore Boogie Nights gets top billing being the best known cast member but the film features some of the best performances by Wallace Shawn My Dinner with Andre Brooke Smith Series 7 The Contenders Larry Pine Dead Man Walking George Gaynes Police Academy films and stage actress Phoebe Brand.  Even though I only mentioned a few the entire cast is fantastic.If you are in your local video store looking for something a bit unique I highly recommend that you check out Vanya on 42nd Street for night of theater without leaving your house.1010".

His skill wasn't apparent to me on first viewing especially in the first scenes where all players are on stage and the nonfocus actors have to be invisible. But on repeated viewings one can see his mastery his shifting forehead! Maybe he could have been a Dostoyevsky. The two young women should be celebrated to the heavens for what they do together. I never believed so many giggles and gasps and stutters and excited silences could be so finely woven tossed so lightly.This is really really good stuff very smart.

	schema:headline " Hey the guy who plays the professor in this film was Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy Series!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay okay. Now that I've got that out of my system I can actually review the movie.Vanya on 42nd Street is pretty much a perfect film just like its predecessor My Dinner With Andre. Both films have the same three cooperative creators Andre Gregory Wallace Shawn and Louis Malle. Both these films have revolutionary structure. My Dinner With Andre is a film about two people who sit down to dinner and an extended conversation. Nothing else. For nearly two hours two people talk interrupted occasionally by a waiter delivering food. It is one of my favorite films and only two films rival its depths that I can think of offhand 2001 and Citizen Kane. All three of those films are so layered and have so many levels of interpretation that their value is priceless. Vanya on 42nd Street is a film about the first complete rehearsal of an English translation of the Anton Chekov play Uncle Vanya. The camera shows us actors acting on an undecorated stage with their street clothes on. And it pulls us in just as well as if we were sitting in the front row opening night perhaps even more I will explain why further down the page. I was entirely involved in the play throughout the whole film and at one point Vanya Wallace Shawn grabs a cup which he wants to put water in. Emblazened on it I heart NY. It yanked me out of feudal Russia in a heartbeat. It wasn't there on accident of course. The bright red lettering faces straight on towards the camera and is in the very center of the picture. This cup is pure braggartry screaming THERE! You were entirely involved in something that was in no way real. Look just how well we are fooling you! Of course it didn't take another second before I was completely absorbed with the play. About fifteen to twenty minutes later at the end of act three tears were streaming down my neck.Okay now my reason for my claim that I experienced this play better in this film than I could ever experience it in the front row of a professional production of it. My reason stems from my fundamental dislike of theater. When one is acting in a play one must shout or rather as a theater teacher might correct me Project! for the audience to be able to hear you. People do not shout their deeply emotionaly words. They grumble them or murmur them or whisper them or moan them. Dialogue released in a groan or a grumble does not project all that well. Therefore all dialogue in a theatrical setting has always seemed well phony. Also the complex facial expressions are entirely lost on every person sitting in the aisles at a play. All except for the most pronounced and overwrought. The same goes for gestures. Gestures are not always large in normal human communication but on stage they simply must be for them to be communicated. The actors in this film are so so so so so so so good especially in their facial expressions. You could never get a proper feel for them sitting beneath them in a playhouse. The medium of film allows subtlety as little as that quality is used in most films. That is why I feel film is superior to the play. Well then if I believe that plays are awful and conversely that films are great then why don't I believe that Uncle Vanya would have been easily adapted into film. Well because it was written for the stage I believe though I'm not 100 sure why I'll honestly say. To actually see these actors moving around inside a house or even worse since it's not in the actual play on a farm would have seemed unrealistic. Normally plays just feel stagey when they're put to film. There have been few exceptions that I can think of. I can tell almost instantly when a play is translated into film. The only really great film to be made from a play is Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? easily one of the best films ever made. It never lacks the feel of a film. You can tell it was once a play but it never feels like it has to be a play like Uncle Vanya would if it were adapted straight from play to film. I attribute most of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'s success as a film to the perfect acting and the superior cinematography by Haskell Wexler.The play to film thing even bothers me when it is Shakespeare. I have seen very few Shakespeare films adapted straight to film that have worked for me. Zafferelli's Romeo and Juliette was the best. But the two Shakespeare works on film which have really intrigued me are direct descendents of Vanya on 42nd Looking for Richard I cannot believe Al Pacino did not see Vanya and Shakespeare in Love okay maybe this isn't directly inspired by Vanya. Both of those films place the play on an inner level of the film's overall plot and thus they try to teach us the inner workings of the plays themselves and acting as an art on the whole. Anyway since I am tired and no longer in control of my thoughts per se I will just say 1010 goodnight everybody!".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay okay. Now that I've got that out of my system I can actually review the movie.Vanya on 42nd Street is pretty much a perfect film just like its predecessor My Dinner With Andre. Both films have the same three cooperative creators Andre Gregory Wallace Shawn and Louis Malle. Both these films have revolutionary structure. My Dinner With Andre is a film about two people who sit down to dinner and an extended conversation. Nothing else. For nearly two hours two people talk interrupted occasionally by a waiter delivering food. It is one of my favorite films and only two films rival its depths that I can think of offhand 2001 and Citizen Kane. All three of those films are so layered and have so many levels of interpretation that their value is priceless. Vanya on 42nd Street is a film about the first complete rehearsal of an English translation of the Anton Chekov play Uncle Vanya. The camera shows us actors acting on an undecorated stage with their street clothes on. And it pulls us in just as well as if we were sitting in the front row opening night perhaps even more I will explain why further down the page. I was entirely involved in the play throughout the whole film and at one point Vanya Wallace Shawn grabs a cup which he wants to put water in. Emblazened on it I heart NY. It yanked me out of feudal Russia in a heartbeat. It wasn't there on accident of course. The bright red lettering faces straight on towards the camera and is in the very center of the picture. This cup is pure braggartry screaming THERE! You were entirely involved in something that was in no way real. Look just how well we are fooling you! Of course it didn't take another second before I was completely absorbed with the play. About fifteen to twenty minutes later at the end of act three tears were streaming down my neck.Okay now my reason for my claim that I experienced this play better in this film than I could ever experience it in the front row of a professional production of it. My reason stems from my fundamental dislike of theater. When one is acting in a play one must shout or rather as a theater teacher might correct me Project! for the audience to be able to hear you. People do not shout their deeply emotionaly words. They grumble them or murmur them or whisper them or moan them. Dialogue released in a groan or a grumble does not project all that well.

It is dear to me and I have some rather definite ideas about what it is and what it should be.Having said that...I must say that while I really liked how the actors were filmed coming into the rehearsal area from the streets of NY and thought that several deviations from Chekhov were appropriate and even inspired and though I was awed by the acting of Shawn Larry Pine and especially Brooke Smith ...I had a few problems with this production.Above allI had a problem with Yelena played by Julianne Moore as a giggling airhead. Was this the idea of Moore or director Gregory or of David Mamet who altered the original play? It certainly wasn't Chekhov. Yelena certainly is in some respects empty false hollow. But having her giggle in response to Vanya's confessions of love is completely at odds with what Chekhov had in mind. She may not be entirely serious but she does take other people seriously and her reaction here is more like pity and disgust than like levity and thoughtless dismissal. Yelena is not an airhead valleygirl. The other problem arises from how the play is shot as a movie. As noted by zetes below theater and film are different media. Obviously Chekhov who died in 1904 was writing only with the stage in mind. Hence some dialog is bound to be either too weak or too strong probably the former. And sure enough while Brooke Smith is absolutely WONDERFUL as Sonya throughout her final speechwhich in the original play is rousing inspiring really upliftingcomes across as way too understated. On the stage Sonya should give her We will find peace! speech at full pitch packed with emotion but if Smith had given such a delivery here with camera in a closeup shot of her as she spoke the effect would have been completely overthetop. Her delivery is the best it can be given the medium but it's not what Chekhov intended.All this aside there is a lot to like here and I'm glad I was able to find this at the video rental store.".

So thrilled to own it and to be able to dive back in now and again and experience the work of gifted and deep people doing something beautiful and rich. Magnificent. Highly recommended! Wallace is just miraculous as is everyone else. This is what artistic work is about. Everybody in the arts wants to make a Citizen Kane and a Sgt.

Andre Gregory's direction and goal seems to be to find a level of communication and depth in the work that is both heightened and yet ultra realistic at the same time in the end analysis the film therefore is affecting in a way that many productions aren't. He achieves this by working on a smaller scale yet allowing the actors all the room they need to get big when the play demands it. It reminds anyone involved in the arts that the process is everything. Doing good work with all your heart mind and soul down to the smallest detail is all we can ask of ourselves. Within that there will be artists able to push through and be a part of something transcendent. This film is a lost gem. It didn't and it won't make a big noise. It doesn't matter it has everything it needs to have to remind anyone who is able to take it in what the arts are all about especially the theatrical arts. Forgive the sermon. Watch it.".

Luckily there's more to look at than just Shawn and Gregory  there is at least Julianne Moore. The rest of the cast are mostly familiar 3rdrate faces giving rather good performances all the while presided over by Gregory with his prayer beads.Malle seems to be trying to explode the prevailing notion that actors should look good if they are to arouse our complicity. Aside from Moore none of these actors has a particularly watchable face. And Wallace Shawn has a speech impediment.The mistake I believe that Malle and Shawn and Gregory have made is trying to make this beautiful play sound like it was written yesterday about people we live next door to. Nowhere is there the slightest belief that we the audience are capable of the act of imagination that watching Chekhov unadulterated i.e. a play written and set in early 20thcentury Russia requires. The only thing the film illuminates is what a falling off was there what Hamlet says of the contrast between a portrait of his father and one of his uncle. How terribly little Shawn and Gregory have made these wonderful people seem!

	schema:reviewBody "Now here's something you don't see everyday a movie that opens as if like a documentary then going right into a cast of characters doing a full rehearsal of a Chekhov play Uncle Vanya with only a few little breaks here and there to fully remind the audience hey this is still a bunch of 'real' people not even putting on but preparing to put on a play. Vanya on 42nd Street is something of a revelation in translating theater to film or rather theater AS cinema or viseversa. As an audience watching an adaptation of a play we're often used to seeing a play taken from its roots on the stage to film its realistic recreation presented live to an audience as an event where the spontaneity of life occurs from moment to moment without a break fleshed out by way of the devices of the cinematic language lighting different focal points and shots editing music cues.In the case of Vanya on 42nd Street we're watching a play take shape at first slightly awkwardly since I had never read or seen the play performed I wasn't even quite sure when the characters were starting to talk in the Chekhov language out of their own actorsplaying characters voices and we should be drawn in like a usual theater crowd. And we are or at least I was thanks to the very powerful and moving performances and the inherent wonders to be found in Chekhov's text. But Louis Malle plays around a little bit or rather more than just a little bit. Because of the placement of the camera in certain scenes and as it is a play rehearsed in a decrepit theater on 42nd street we see an actor here and there in the background watching as a scene which is supposed to be taking place with just two of the characters in play and something like this small touch creates something else to the process. The process of doing this play even as a rehearsal is kind of in the background of how the movie works as a movie not as theater.If this sounds a little complicated a dissection it should be noted that Malle a man who made many films and had this as his final film before he was taken away so suddenly knows the essential thing is important put on a great production of a play. And it works fully we're sucked into this story of a family in Russia torn apart by their love or disconnect from it mistrust loneliness bitterness despair and moments that ponder the very reason why we even go on living when things look to be the worst the final speech given by Vanya's daughter played by Brooke Smith should be considered a minimasterpiece of the written word with it starting with All we can do is live.. It's about wasted lives or chances that have gone by for some like Wallace Shawn's title character for over half of a lifetime.So Chekhov fans of whom there are quite a few in the theater world won't be disappointed in the least by the presentation. It's a bestofbothworlds piece of art we get the wonderful essentials of what it all comes down to in the world of theater as actors such as Julianne Moore and Shawn and Smith who are all fantastic sometimes nearing genius totally in tune and prepared with this heavy work of intelligently gutripping familial drama are revealed though Malle's careful and sometimes very subtle documentary approach. It's a double edged sword we're watching a play yes but there's something else about watching theater as process as something that evolves along that is captured as well which is something rare maybe one other film Bergman's minor but great work After the Rehearsal has this quality.But at the same time Louis Malle is directing a film that is fictional and we are forced to still see things a certain way to see real film lights hitting on what is supposed to be a realistic setting and editing directing our eyes where to go in a big confrontation and with actors and their eyelines and the 180 degree rule and so on. There's even a very tricky moment I wasn't sure at first that I liked in the second half there's a moment where Moore's character is thinking something to herself about getting angry about saying something she feels to Vanya or someone i.e. the mermaid bit. Up until now we've seen these actors relatively in naturalistic conditions in terms of their own audience the actors' dress rehearsal is being seen by a few guests but this suddenly takes into consideration narration and we're reminded it is all really a film.I'm still not sure if this completely fits but it's such a bold moment that I respect it all the same. Vanya on 42nd Street is an immensely stimulating experience both as pure drama and as an intellectual rendering of what theater and film represents as art forms. And as a final feature from a director like Malle is a very fine achievement I'm tempted to say that even imperfect as it is it's sort of timeless in its approach to a 19th century Russian play. 9.510".

An interesting comment made to me by a Russian authoress whom I know At the end when Sonya tells Uncle Vanya that in the bye and bye everything will be alright God will take pity on us...and we will rest in this FrancoAmerican production Sonya seems to believe her own optimistically comforting words whereas in a Russian production she  and Vanya  would know that any hope is only an illusion.".

An interesting comment made to me by a Russian authoress whom I know At the end when Sonya tells Uncle Vanya that in the bye and bye everything will be alright God will take pity on us...and we will rest in this FrancoAmerican production Sonya seems to believe her own optimistically comforting words whereas in a Russian production she  and Vanya  would know that any hope is only an illusion.";

The cast is uniformly excellent  with the exception of Wallace Shawn  whose obvious choices and broadly comic persona make us aware that he's attempting to ACT while everyone else seems to truly inhabit their characters. Particularly notable are Julianne Moore Larry Pine and Brooke Smith. This is a heartbreaking version of a difficult play thank goodness for closeups  the extended scene between Sonya and Yelena would be torture onstage  it's brilliant onscreen.

It may be better than any Chekhov anyone has seen but it still had the artifact of any translated play particularly Russian ones of dialogue which is impossible to make sound anything but theatrical actors reading lines.

It just doesn't sound natural  so no  i don't think it works completely as action and therefore i was always aware of the artifice the performance  and the value of this very quickly wore off and i got very bored.

Thus passed this time they meet again. She tries to avoid him by all means. But he stalks her and eventually manages to gain her attention with the intention of revealing the secret that he alone can unfold. They set a meeting a dinner where she expects that all will be revealed. During dinner she now a widow awaits the expected revelation what he had told her husband while he was mute and paralytic because of a gunshot wound fired by a lover of hers.

De Oliveira builds up an amazing tension round what is finally going to happen between the two characters and that makes the meal at the end an example of suspense based not on action so typical of the thriller but rather on the word which in Oliveira's films acquires the stature of protagonist.

Now that I've watched the film for myself  which is remarkably brief a mere 68 minutes for this day and age!  I realize that Severine played now by Bulle Ogier who had herself been delightful in Bunuel's THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 isn't really the main role here but rather Husson a returning and still bemused Michel Piccoli where he seems to have gotten over his perennial feeling of coldness by becoming an alcoholic! for the record Piccoli had himself been a regular of Bunuel's 7 films and by this time also of Oliveira's 6 films.Anyway though the film unsurprisingly omits the seamless blurring of dream and reality that made BELLE DE JOUR so fascinating it works better than a sequel to an undisputed arthouse classic 40 years after the fact has any right to  or I would ever have imagined myself given my oftdeclared admiration for Bunuel's oeuvre. That said we do find in here some definite nods to his past achievements  which clearly emerge to be among the most pleasing elements in the entire film not only the retrieval of the famously mysterious buzzing box displayed by the heroine's Japanese client in BELLE DE JOUR itself though one can't quite fathom how Husson was even aware of it in the first place this was certainly a nice touch the sardonic waiters during the 'climactic' meal recall their defecting counterparts in THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962 which has happily just been officially announced as a 2Disc Criterion edition for next February! Severine's fate can ultimately be seen as a reversal of that experienced by VIRIDIANA 1961 going from lasciviousness to piety rather than the other way around plus of course and just as accidentally the sheer fact that the leading lady of the original has now 'morphed' into a different other recalls the duality of the female protagonist of THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE 1977.There is plenty of interesting character detail and amusing situations besides Severine's constant and nervy attempts at avoiding Husson she still hasn't forgiven him for spilling the beans on the girl's cathartic vice to her nowdeceased husband Piccoli's revealing conversations with a young sympathetic barman  played by Oliveira's own grandson and frequent actor Ricardo Trepa  where in spite of his obviously advancing age Husson's erudite distinction still catches the eye of two lonely prostitutes regulars of the spot Husson's fascination with the goldtinted statue of a female warrior on horseback in a Parisian square not to mention lovely views of Paris by day and night which are employed throughout as transitions between scenes. Eventually the mismatched couple do get to run into each other  though somewhat perversely we're kept in the dark as to their actual initial exchanges they at least make an appointment for a candlelit dinner which is consumed in utter silencebut then the two gradually open up. Still Husson's evasiveness  giving a cryptic reply to Severine's query which has continued to haunt her ever since about the exact nature of his confession to her husband all those years ago in order to determine the meaning behind the tears she had noticed on Pierre's cheeks soon after  so infuriates the woman that she storms out in disgust!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to view both this film and the film Belle Du Jour upon which it is a sequel for the very first time in 1 sitting. I was impressed beyond expectation with the first film Belle Du Jour directed by Luis Bunuel only the second film I have seen of his after the very well done the young one and am convinced of how great a director he was. That being said despite the fact that I was very intrigued by the premise of this movie Belle Toujours where 39 years later a sequel was made in which the same characters and one of the original actors meet after so many years to relive their experiences this movie proved to be everything I feared it would be a stagey contrived mess filled with pseudo intellectual dribble contained within unrealistic overly dramatized situations and at best having no real purpose or unique value of its own.The movie begins with lengthy excerpts in a concert hall which last roughly 8 minutes at which point Henry Husson notices Severine in the audience. You cannot go wrong in opening a film with classical music in this way though it has been done countless times before. It could have even been very poignant if the two main characters had met outside of the theatre. There are at least three 30 second scenes of shots of Paris with classical music playing which MIGHT have been poignant if they had first met at the theatre but which transparently comes across as filler in order for the director to reach an hours length for this waste of film which only runs 65 minutes long.Instead Husson did not find Severine outside the theatre and after wandering the streets aimlessly he just happened to spot her leaving a bar into a cab where she just happened to leave the barman with the address of where she was staying. lucky as Husson describes it... I would describe it as stagey and poorly conceived though even here if the director were to spare us from more luck the film may have been bearable. Afterwards Husson goes to the hotel where Severine is staying and just as he enters the elevator she exits the adjacent one after which he comes down again much too quickly only to see her leave. The hotel clerk then tells him she is leaving the city. Finally later as he is walking along the street he just happens to bump into her again where he is talking to her and she walks back and forth clearly imitating some of the behaviour of Severine Played By Catherine Deneuve in the original film though to a nauseatingly exaggerated degree. So in the end these 2 reunite.. after FOUR chance encounters. A Single might have been poignant. 2 pushy but 4 utterly ridiculous. This scene which is all shot outside in sky view ends with Husson entering the boutique and emerging 30 seconds later. We later find out that he therein purchased the box with the perverted sex toy held by the oriental client in the first film.... right where he bumps into her for the 4th time Convenient to a writer and director unable to create a realistic and coherent plot bust most importantly his character in the first film did not know anything about her encounter with the Asian client.That essentially is the entire plot not aided at all by the ridiculous fact that in all 3 times the male lead enters the bar where he was able to obtain Severines address each time there are 2 sex workers there who observe him and interest in his story as if they are fixtures there with no real lives and nowhere else to be. Almost a third of the movie takes place here and the worst aspect is that it in no way gives the viewer anticipation for when Husson and Severine finally will speak to each other. Instead it is a reflective and unengaging speculation upon the first movie which anyone who has seen the first movie could reflect upon as good or better on their own.Finally when the 2 leads meet at a dining room where they had arranged after some simple words of exchange they eat and say nothing to each other for almost 5 minutes. Anyone who finds a single shred of meaning out of this and doesn't see it as the mindless filler that it is is the kind of person who would find meaning in a single line drawn on a blank piece of paper. They have a short discussion about the past as the candles on the table 1 by 1 extinguish a very obvious and somewhat contrived bit of symbolism until finally they part and the movie is ended by this very empty climax.This entire film is I believe the biggest disgrace upon another movie I have seen. If the plot was at the very least put together in an intelligent and plausible manner it would at least be acceptable though still even that disregarded this film seems like it was put together by a 10 year old with nothing original or new to offer and literally no plot based purely on a script contemplating the events in the original movie which could have been written in a couple of hours and much better done at that. I do not know why Catherine Deneuve did not reprise her role from the first film but thankfully for her she does not have to associate her name with this absolute disgrace. Michel Picolli should be ashamed of himself for taking part in this pile of film stock. This movie is not even a film of its own. At best it is a meandering reflection upon a true film and has no purpose to it whatsoever.".

Later the film doesn't have a real point and for me was a little boring more in the part when they are eating is a very strange scene. I put 6.6 out of 10 to this film just for the part in the bar that i really like is like a film of Jim Jarmsuch slow and with excellent dialogs between the characters in strange situations.So i found this as a very strange film that maybe work better without the need to be a tribute to Luis Buuel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Luis Bunuel's Belle de Jour is a classic of 1960s dark comedy with the touches of surrealism that made the director such a household name for artfilm households anyway and had a seductive sometimes cold but never less than interesting performance from Catherine Deneuve as Severine who spends her days as a hooker in a brothel while her husband doesn't know. You may or may not recall Michel Piccoli was in the film as well and had a pivotal moment  following being the one who originally gave Severine directions to the brothel  who may or may not have told her husband. Bunuel was smart and clever and right enough to not show us this conversation only Severine seeing a single tear running down his cheek. We can read into it whatever we wish which was the sly gift from the mater.The now late director Manoel de Oliveira decided in 2006 at the age of 100 to make a sort of homage to Bunuel and his collaborator JeanClaude Carriere by making what is in all actuality a sequel to that film where Piccoli's character Husson sees Severine at a classical music concert tries to followtrack her down and then when he does has dinner with her to talk about things. Will he finally tell her what she said? In truth does it matter either way one might ask? Certainly de Oliveira doesn't care.Despite an opening sequence at this concert hall that is simple and magnetic and wonderful to sit through  maybe in large part due to the music itself from Dvorak being so powerful  and a final dinner scene that has a couple of nice visual touches this is just not that interesting. It doesn't work that Deneuve isn't back as Severine I'm sure the director would argue this is a further homage to Bunuel two actresses were used in That Obscure Object of Desire but it just feels off seeing another actress there who doesn't have the same looks Deneuve at her age today is still astonishing looking by the way. The film is a scant 70 minutes long  65 not counting credits  and it still feels padded out with scenes of watching characters eat their dinner the waiters cleaning up and lots of walking around.Belle toujours wasn't a bad idea persay. Revisiting such memorable characters years later and giving a new perspective could be captivating or enlightening and as a standalone short film it could have worked imagine for example if Husson and Severine meet right after the concert hall and grab a bite and talk you cut out ALL of the midsection and don't really miss much at all other characters here are inconsequential really. At the same time it was hard for me to also grasp what the homage was ultimately. There are two Bunuelian moments of surrealism one involving a golden horse statue outside in Paris that may have real eyes this works because there's buildup as Piccoli is staring at it and another with a chicken that is just weird but weird for weird's sake if that makes sense.The performances aren't terrible and some of the camerawork is fine but the film has not much reason to justify its existence. And the mystery and fun of Belle de Jour was that it was kept in its own satirical 1960's Parisian world. Maybe there's something to be said about the nature of remembering things and how time changes people but that feels weak here too. Again as a short this might be worthwhile. At 70 minutes somehow it feels too long. Not to mention perhaps a nitpick but something I caught on to as this WAS a 100 year old director all of the sound is turned up really high on things that don't matter.If you've been waiting to hear Michel Piccoli gulp his whiskey and chew his food this is the movie for you I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Read the full review at httpnickplusmovies.blogspot.comI started off my experience at this year's Toronto International Film Festival with Aki Kaurismki's Le Havre a rather obscure small production that was competing for the Palme d'Or at Cannes it was Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life that was the big winner. The question is Did I start off on the right foot? Read on to find out...Le Havre centers on an elderly workingclass shoe shiner named Marcel Marx played by Andr Wilms living with his loving wife Arletty Kati Outinen in the French port city of... Le Havre. Although his profession only leaves him with enough money to get by he never gives up hope and always finds great joy and warmth in all the people in his life be it his friendly selfless nextdoor neighbor or the kind owner of the local bar. Marcel's life takes a bit of a turn when he must send his ill wife to the hospital hoping she will get better soon. But that's not it soon after when he finds himself alone eating a sandwich at the harbor he discovers a young African boy named Idrissa Blondin Miguel hiding in the water. Marcel befriends him and learns that he had been hiding with many other illegal immigrants in a shipping container with hopes of arriving in London to meet up with his aunt. The old man voluntarily goes out of his way to keep him away from authorities and completely out of sight but soon this situation quickly transforms into a catandmouse game lead by the persistent intimidating wolf like police inspector Monet JeanPierre Darroussin.With its simplistic plot clearly defined characters and inviting setting this film has all the qualities and characteristics of a great short film if you don't count its featurelength runtime. Is this a bad thing? Hardly! I find that this makes the film all the more absorbing and enjoyable though slow in progression at times and thus able to make your average modernday moviegoer lose interest. But I still believe that sometimes it's nice to just sit down and follow a naturally flowing straightforward story when most of the movies you see today are flashy and overly stimulating to the point where they bore you. Le Havre is something refreshingly different for a change.Rarely do films combine comedy with drama in such a natural uncontrived way. With this film Aki Kaurismki proves to be one of the few working directors able to pull off a mixture of dark ironic and deadpan humor while maintaining the same upbeat cheerful and optimistic tone throughout the entire film. A great example of this guy's exemplary sense of humor is the opening scene of the film where we see Marcel going around with his shoe shining materials looking for a paying customer. He finally lucks out when he approaches a suspicious looking type holding a suitcase in his hand. As he shines this man's shoes we see two other mysterious figures watching from a distance. It's clear that something's up. When Marcel finishes his job the man pays him and quickly tries to escape. But it's too late we hear gunshots a tire squeal and a scream as the camera lingers on Marcel whose facial expression remains pleasant. He simply says Luckily he had time to pay.. Of course since it's more of a visual gag it's much funnier when you see it for yourself. Having said that there's no denying that this film has very smart comedic elements.What I love just as much if not more about this little film is how authentic and downtoearth the characters are in their interactions. Every scene is made into such an accurate portrait of life thanks to all of the real human performances from the entire cast of lesserknown actors. The only thing that threw me off was how the couple of Finnish actors in the film let their accents slip through as they were speaking French. But this would be barely noticeable for those of you who don't speak either one of these languages.Although this film is Finnish it's obvious that it's shot on location in France. I was breathless as I got to admire the beauty of the ocean and the quaint coziness of the old city buildings. Sadly this is the closest I've ever gotten to visiting France! No wonder these sights took me away.In sum Aki Kaurismki's Le Havre is a simple human tale that remains light and pleasant while brushing on topics of illegal immigration and the illness of a lovedone. It's a soulful film that mixes smart humor with true emotion without ever feeling artificial. I recommend looking for this hidden gem. You might just like it.".

Kaurismaki has aged and his outcast and misfit characters aged with him the quirks mellowed the ferocious smoking toned down the lines in the sometimes quietly astonished stone faces deeper wearier but imbued with almost ascetic serenity. Some viewers have complained why trivialize an actual problem in the manner of a fairy tale? A fair complaint for a problem perhaps more pressing than ever especially in France and especially these days with Sarkozi's desperate attempt to shore up votes for what looks like nearcertain defeat in the upcoming elections by reverting to reactionary rhetorics from the farright. No I believe the fairytale is the point. The idyllic neighborhood. The mannered caricatures of French people with even the poorest having the time and fine sense of taste to leisurely enjoy their freshly baked baguette or glass of wine. The miraculous turn of events explicitly acknowledged in the finale where kindness of this world is so overwhelming it even cures sickness. How could anyone miss this?But a certain emptiness has always been of the essence for Kaurismaki deliberate designed emptiness. The world is always flat to that effect twodimensional. The characters lack any conventional depth to speak of and do not really grow or learn lessons. By contrast the plots of the films often exhibit a life of spontaneous motion the objectives intentionally abstract journeys across town to America in search of coffee and cigarettes. Motion for the sheer musical capacity of life to fill the quiet the room in the heart to do so.So it is always a variation of transient worlds centered in the stillness of the present moment that Kaurismaki has studied and consistently delivered. What is so remarkable is that he achieves this without any layering whatsoever as a single flow. This is his most Japanese film to date even more concentrated flow than usual. Which is to say artificial nature that does not attempt to pass for the real thing but instead is empty space cultivated for beauty a roadmap for inner heart.I saw this together with the recent viral video KONY2012 and the contrast was amazing that one shameless artifice passing as nature as truth the real thing contriving to motivate awareness several years after the fact and by selling merchandise but was in truth both misinformed and morally dubious and even perhaps unwittingly manipulated agitprop in the service of shady foreign policy while this one is simple crisp gracefully moral work that does create awareness without any agendas.So it is very much the point that no one in the film is shown to wallow in misery and most of the characters we meet would have plenty of reason to do so. Instead they enjoy this drink or meal together whatever is at hand. And act with no complaint in the present moment to do what needs to be done. There is no meddlesome thought or proud ego to cloud the mind from the day's work be it polishing shoes or helping out an immigrant kid.This is the beauty of the thing an idyll embedded with the purity of soul that gives rise to it and clear images only possible because of this cloudless eye. The parting image is of a blossomed cherry tree gently rocking in the breeze among the most traditionally Japanese images. It encapsulates motion in stillness. The song of Zen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The natural flowing of this simple movie where no excesses are to be noticed may make one judge it as a weird movie where something actually happens but does seem to affect the lives of the characters. This is not properly true. Indeed this is a simple movie with no plot twists no complications but here does it lie its magic. It's a movie where normal common people simply accept their lives for what they are which does not mean in a passive way on the contrary they prove morally resilient people who relate one another in an authentic way behave as honest and fair people so difficult to find people like these nowadays that they look so strange! they face bad things with dignity and good things with no easy enthusiasm. Its best quality lies in the perfect and never clashing blend between hard facts the hardships of immigrants the theme of illness and poetry with a human faith in miracles which never sounds ridiculous or mystical miracles happen simply because sometimes they may happen and there's not even much to wonder at. There's such a placid attitude shown by the characters very well interpreted by a good cast that if the aim was to convey a calm and resilient acceptance of life with its weird mixture of hardness and poetry well the aim has been successfully accomplished.".

	onyx:emotionText "The natural flowing of this simple movie where no excesses are to be noticed may make one judge it as a weird movie where something actually happens but does seem to affect the lives of the characters. This is not properly true. Indeed this is a simple movie with no plot twists no complications but here does it lie its magic. It's a movie where normal common people simply accept their lives for what they are which does not mean in a passive way on the contrary they prove morally resilient people who relate one another in an authentic way behave as honest and fair people so difficult to find people like these nowadays that they look so strange! they face bad things with dignity and good things with no easy enthusiasm. Its best quality lies in the perfect and never clashing blend between hard facts the hardships of immigrants the theme of illness and poetry with a human faith in miracles which never sounds ridiculous or mystical miracles happen simply because sometimes they may happen and there's not even much to wonder at. There's such a placid attitude shown by the characters very well interpreted by a good cast that if the aim was to convey a calm and resilient acceptance of life with its weird mixture of hardness and poetry well the aim has been successfully accomplished.";

This is Kaurismki at his best working with a great cast and a script stripped of any unnecessary dialogue. The colors and the settings are stunning. There's always a risk that movies like this would come across as to polished or constructed but from my point of view Kaurismki strikes a great balance and makes sure that every image adds layers and details to the story.".

	schema:headline " Charming and delightful pure optimistic cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "These days it seems that French films predominantly fit into one of two categories Smug over long and preachy such as Rust and Bone or Little White Lies. Or they produce deeply involving but simplistic stories containing the most genuine heartfelt emotion such as Amour in French therefore French or The Kid with a Bike. I am happy to say that Le Havre falls in the latter group. In fact the story here is one of pure simplicity and the tone of the film contains nothing but genuine optimism towards the theme of human compassion. That is it this film has no ulterior motive or no gimmicks and it is a very simply and extremely involving story based around that one simple theme. However this film is not just a tribute to human compassion but contained within it are tributes to the history of cinema that are quite simply a joy to experience. When I say that the use of music as well the way certain scenes are lit pay a respectful tribute to films of the 40s and 50s throughout the narrative. This is not to say that this film is not without its realism Marx and his neighbours all live a humble life bordering on poverty. The plight of Idrissa is unenviable and there is an honest depiction of a refugee camp just outside Calais. However the theme of Le Havre is not that life is simply good that would be naive. It is how these characters deal with life and the situations that it presents. Of course it would be so easy to fall into to the trap of patronising and borderline preachy clich here but this never happens due to the genuine feeling of honesty depicted throughout the narrative. Every character is presented very honestly with all their flaws quite clear to see but it is their ability for natural compassion that drives the narrative forward. By the time Le Havre reaches its very satisfying conclusion where there are no loose ends it is difficult not to feel that not only have you been entertained but also enlightened.".

To describe it well I couldn't say this film has a very deep meaning I couldn't say it offers some philosophic ideas to contemplate I couldn't even say it's logic in every way. As a matter of fact the film could be accused of being just an empty trendy imitation of the past. A past which has actually never existed and which is just an unreal image of our imagination created by idealizing times which have already gone. But to my great surprise I still enjoy watching it. It's because I enjoy seeing such nice imitation such nice image of life which consists of a lot of idealism which is idyllic and even Utopian. I bet many people miss idealism in their lives and this film just gives them what they want. As it is known the concept of every movie is to imitate the reality even create a new reality which consists of things which we lack in our real life. It's just like cinema genius Alfred Hitchcock said long time ago the cinema is not a slice of life but a piece of cake. So this stands for the fact the film is good.Being more certain I like Le havre because it's nice to watch it. Every set is selected precisely. Voices of actors sound pleasantly. Everything is full of harmony in this film characters communicate often they help each other when troubles come in the movie. Marcel's wife does a lot for her husband she doesn't even tell him she's dying in order to protect him from suffering. Marcel does a lot for love too. He helps immigrant boy to find his origin. Every resident of Le havre town stand together for the boy they stand for love for ideal and they manage to defeat the troubles the threats which come from outside world. Of course they do this they show their idealism not too much the film is not too sugary'. The mechanism is quite opposite it's something like less is more less feelings showed exactly in the right time are less banal more real more influential.Some people may laugh find humor in some episodes of the film some especially those who are insensitive may find Le havre vast. Those who tend to conceal their feelings may even hate the film. But it's just as they say  you love it you hate it  it's the same you simply can't manage without it. So that's why the film is suitable for a very wide range of people  I guarantee everyone would be affected by it one way or another.".

	schema:headline " Le Havre";
	schema:reviewBody "Le Havre is a film from Finland in French with English subtitles. The film focuses on a middle aged man named Marcel who makes a living going around town and working as a shoe shiner. Business is not always great and at home Marcel lives a very simple life with his much adored wife Arletty. One day a group of refugees are found in town and one of them a young boy named Idrissa escapes and is wanted by the local chief inspector and the police. Marcel one day stumbles across the boy and shows kindness to him and the next thing he knows Idrissa shows up at his home. The rest of the story is about how out of his way Marcel will go to hide and protect the boy from the police and to find a way to get him back with his family. Le Havre is a great film on several different levels. The acting here from the whole cast is all very good here and just their facial expressions and deadpan looks say a lot even when there is nothing in particular to be said. They convey the feelings and thoughts and emotions of their characters perfectly. The direction and writing of this film by Aki Kaurismaki is also a real delight here. He provides us with some very interesting characters and a good story to use and put them to work in. I also found that the film had just the right blend of humour and drama. Ultimately this is a feel good film and I think almost anybody who watches it will leave feeling very happy and joyful. The story and events in the film are simple enough and nothing is done to extravagance but I think what really got me about the whole thing was the kindness not only Marcel but his friends and neighbours show to Idrissa knowing that if they are caught they too could be in a lot of trouble. It was really refreshing to see these characters live their simple yet happy lives and find happiness in things we take for granted and how when one needs help they will be the first ones there to lend a hand and offer support. They work together well as a community and more than that they are great friends and neighbours who look out for each other. That was what I really thought got me about Le Havre the basic message of the kindness of strangers and being the good Samaritan and helping out your fellow man. The film I might add is also quite a good looking film and I really admired it's cinematography. At one time it shows buildings and homes in bright primary colours and then goes to show us bleak and older homes that are a bit run down and much more simple. The colour scheme and the effect of this further added to my appreciation of the film and how these characters live. The cinematography actually reminded me of the works of French cinematographer Raoul Coutard whose work I came to know and love in JeanLuc Godard's films such as Contempt which looks absolutely exquisite on it's Blu Ray release but now back to Le Havre. This is a film where much joy and laughter can be had but also gives us hope for each other and the human race. The film may be a little unrealistic in that regard of showing the goodness in people but any film that has that as it's central message and gives us something to not only think about but to feel good about after is a winner in my books. It may even get you to reevaluate your own attitudes and perspectives on things so keep an open mind while watching. This is one of the most entertaining and inspiring films of 2011 and also one of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's all so familiar The shabby old worn interiors the far from picturesque scenery those slightly patinacovers images with their dirty soft colors the slowness those long shots which are hardly more than stills even the hairdos. Not only do Aki Kaurismki's films have a very distinctive look and feel they all have this quality of watching something that is not quite there. Nostalgia is the wrong word but his films and more so his characters have fallen out of time. They are creatures of the past but the present they end up in is not quite the present we know either. There is a timeless quality or rather a different sense of time in the slow movements the museumlike atmosphere the silence. More often than not Kaurismki's characters are not exactly talkers. So it is no surprise that Le Havre looks a lot like Helsinki but there sure is a lot more talking going on.At the end of the day Le Havre both is and is not a typical Kaurismki. It is his most upbeat and optimistic film to date. Gone is most of his trademark melancholia the despair many of his protagonists have to fight and sometimes succumb to. On the other hand his films have never been as cynical hopeless or pessimistic as the occasional viewer may think. On the contrary underlying his work has always been a basic belief in the goodness of humankind  at least the underprivileged part of it those on the outskirts of society. And there always has been a fairytale quality in many of his films. Le Havre can be regarded as the culmination of both a truly optimistic fairytale a story about goodness which well may be too good to be true. But maybe it is not.Andr Wilms reprises his role from Kaurismki's 1992 film La Vie de Bohme however Marcel the unsuccessful writer has turned into a shoe cleaner  a profession that belongs to a different time too. One day he finds an African boy who escaped when the police found the container in which he and dozens of others tried to get to London. He takes him in and eventually gets him to London. Meanwhile Marcel's wife the wonderfully dignified sad angel Kati Outinen is diagnosed with a fatal sickness which she refuses to tell Marcel about. Don't be surprised though if a miracle is in the making here too.This may be a rundown shabby world but it is inhabited by the best kind of people one could imagine. And they're not flat characters but fullblooded sinners with exceptionally good hearts. This is after all a fairy tale with a fairy tale ending but it is also more  a celebration of the human spirit of goodness in the face of adversity a beautiful vision of what the world could be if we all tried a little harder to do the right thing.At the same time Kaurismki never loses sight of the evil humans do to each other. TV excerpts and a relentless police hunt highlight the plights of immigrants in today's France and elsewhere. if there is a message here it is that each of us must start in their own lives to do good only then do we have a chance to make this place we call earth a little better. It is a simple message but told like this it is hard to escape its grip. And who ever said that answers cannot be simple sometimes?Kaurismki creates beautiful as well as memorable images mostly stills such as the one in the harbour with the boy in the front and Marcel in the background. An image of longing and also of togetherness. The most intense scene occurs when the container is opened and the camera goes from face to face. All turns quiet a choking silence that is hardly bearable. And eyes who tell stories that could fill books.Not all is dead serious though there is a playful element to this film. Kaurismki starts it with a wonderfully clich noir scene and ends it in n equally cheesy melodrama. Don't take me too seriously we might hear him say I'm just throwing some ideas at you.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1992 Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki directed LA VIE DE BOHEME where he transplanted to Paris for a story of impoverished failed artists on the cusp of society. A funny sad film about art love and loss. Nearly twenty years later Kaurismaki returns to France in LE HAVRE while some of the humor remains its story of the impoverished and dispossessed is even more affecting.LA VIE... showed a painterly visual sense all the more amazing that it was filmed in black and white. LE HAVRE boasts an equally striking visual sense with scenes that seem to glow. That said other elements of the production are less convincing  and at times. almost embarrassing. For example a group of black refugees are locked in a container crate for almost a week when it's opened no one's hungry or even concerned and several are freshly shaved. LE HAVRE sets up the camera in a stationary spot  much like an old silent  giving the film a real resonance. But this affection for older filmmaking will be familiar for Kaurismaki fans his silent black and white JUHA uses the same minimalistic approach with good results. If you're willing to forgive certain production details and the dependence on melodrama LE HAVRE is a feelgood story of how those of modest means can help those in desperate straits. LE HAVRE itself was directed under low budget. The film's humanism is its saving grace. While the filmmaking is occasionally awkward there's still a lot to be admired here.".

Nearly twenty years later Kaurismaki returns to France in LE HAVRE while some of the humor remains its story of the impoverished and dispossessed is even more affecting.LA VIE... showed a painterly visual sense all the more amazing that it was filmed in black and white. LE HAVRE boasts an equally striking visual sense with scenes that seem to glow. That said other elements of the production are less convincing  and at times. almost embarrassing. For example a group of black refugees are locked in a container crate for almost a week when it's opened no one's hungry or even concerned and several are freshly shaved. LE HAVRE sets up the camera in a stationary spot  much like an old silent  giving the film a real resonance. But this affection for older filmmaking will be familiar for Kaurismaki fans his silent black and white JUHA uses the same minimalistic approach with good results. If you're willing to forgive certain production details and the dependence on melodrama LE HAVRE is a feelgood story of how those of modest means can help those in desperate straits. LE HAVRE itself was directed under low budget. The film's humanism is its saving grace. While the filmmaking is occasionally awkward there's still a lot to be admired here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Aki Kaurismki is the extreme leftleaning Finnish director hell bent on satisfying every raving Francophile's dream. With 'Le Havre' he's outdone even the most radical of today's French libertarians by fashioning a tale of a neversaydie radical liberal curmudgeon out to save victimized third worlders from the clutches of a 'fascistic' police state for Kaurismki that of course includes the Catholic church.Our curmudgeon hero in question is Marcel whose surname Kaurismki unsubtly dubs 'Marx'. A selfdescribed Bohemian Marcel used to be a bourgeoisie writer but now shines shoes for a living obviously sharing an affinity with his working class associates Marcel's shoe shine partner is an undocumented alien from Vietnam who carries a fake ID. Marcel is also a freeloader often taking food from neighborhood shopkeepers on credit with no intention of satisfying his debts. The neighbors tolerate him as Marcel's wife Arletty named after the legendary French actress of 'Children of Paradise' fame appears to be a pleasant unassuming type and soon become much more sympathetic as she falls ill with cancer and has to be hospitalized.The inciting incident occurs when the police find a shipping container loaded with African immigrants at a dock in Le Havre. A young boy Idrissa runs away and a police officer is about to shoot him with an automatic weapon only to be stopped by kindly police inspector Monet who instructs the officer not to fire since he's only a child.Wouldn't you guess but Marcel and Idrissa's paths cross and soon enough Marcel is committed to helping the boy. He travels a long way to a detention center where he finds the boy's grandfather who informs him that Idrissa's mother is now living in London believe it or not 'Le Havre' is billed as a comedy and Kaurismki finds it amusing that the warden at the detention believes Marcel when he claims he's Idrissa's Albino uncle!.The curmudgeon now turned unstoppable hero must find a way to hide Idrissa since the big bad police are after him. He asks one of the neighborhood shopkeepers to hide the boy and she graciously complies by safeguarding him in her apartment above her shop. Another shopkeeper initially cross with Marcel now gives him loads of food for the beleaguered Idrissa. In contrast to what happened in World War II average Frenchmen here are depicted as natural humanitarians who will even break the law in the name of justice. Only government officials backed by the aforementioned bad guy police force and a reactionary clergy stand in the way of Idrissa's liberation.Marcel needs a ton of cash to have Idrissa transported by boat to his mother in London so he dreams up the idea of a benefit rock concert. All he has to do is convince a local pop star to perform but first must bring the pop star and his wife back together after they've had a lover's spat again we're supposed to laugh when Marcel reconciles the two wounded lovebirds.After Marcel raises the cash and brings Idrissa to the boat Inspector Monet shows up as he's done throughout the film and makes it clear that he's thoroughly on Marcel's side. When the police come on board he pulls rank and pretends that Idrissa isn't below in the hold of the boat. One is reminded of the scene in 'Casablanca' where Inspector Renault covers for Rick who has just shot Major Strasser. Just as Monet misdirects his police officers Renault misdirects the Germans by ordering them to round up the usual suspects.Earlier we see Monet reassuring the Prefect inside the church that he's determined to catch the boy but it's obvious that he has no intention of keeping his word to the religious authorities seen here as in league with the 'devil' police state. Funny how Monet so easily is determined to risk his entire career for this one boy and join forces with the disgruntled Marcel. You'll also notice that Kaurismki dare not suggest that any of the Africans that he introduces us to are anything but upstanding saintly citizens.To top it off Kaurismki cannot allow his audience to experience any of the hard knocks we might encounter during our travails in life. In the shockingly sentimental ending Marcel's wife who has a terminal diagnosis miraculously is cured and returns home with Marcel presumably to put up with his neverending curmudgeonly ways.As a registered Democrat I am generally sympathetic to liberal causes. However when some of my more radical left leaning brethren decide to twist reality by proffering up fairy tales of victimization and undeserved heroes sticking up for straw men victims I can hardly remain silent. Le Havre is watchable to see just how far its misguided director will go in peddling such a selfrighteous sentimental left wing fairy tale.".

It's a decision indicative of the thoughtful and unique approach to the film it aids both the storyline and the viewer's experience immensely. I was grateful and relieved to be taken away into a simpler and more honest world both in the film's outward image and within the story's universe. Its worth emphasising this film doesn't try to masquerade as real life and as such allows for a much purer enjoyment.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not recommended.Le Havre has been on quite a few best film lists this year. It seems many critics have been beguiled with its Gaelic charm optimistic story and its winning cast led by Andre Wilms as an impoverished shoe shine man Marcel. I wasn't. It all seems so superficial and silly to me.Writer  director Aki Kaurismaki wants you to suspend your disbelief with his romantic notion of the good in everyman.

It seems many critics have been beguiled with its Gaelic charm optimistic story and its winning cast led by Andre Wilms as an impoverished shoe shine man Marcel. I wasn't. It all seems so superficial and silly to me.Writer  director Aki Kaurismaki wants you to suspend your disbelief with his romantic notion of the good in everyman.

On the other hand the story still has this special mixture of simplicity absurdity and realism But it's mostly the child personage that bothers me because it draws too much empathy from the public which I think is a cheaptrick for such a great director. What I like about his loser characters is that I can laugh at their sufferings  here this is not so much the case. It appears tolerant politically correct clichs that are appealing for wider public.

	schema:reviewBody "The director Aki Kaurismki's films are so dry that I may only describe the characters and their situations if I try to talk about his movies in my writing  and I might get away with my delinquency. His deadpan approach is so simple that you probably do not understand why it is funny until you see it for yourself. For instance one character in his new film Le Havre buys a certain fruit in the middle of the story and then he walks into the bar to have some conversation with a bar owner. The camera does nothing except simply observes the man sitting on one of the tables and the fruit placed on the table right next to him but it somehow made me smile.Kaurismki's films are usually set in the urban area of Finland and his unhappy characters are stuck in hard time while yearning for the escape from the ennui and dreariness of their daily life as shown in Shadows in Paradise1986 and Ariel1988. But this time it is a little different. Set in Le Havre a French port city in Normandy he presents us a middleaged couple content with their poor lifestyle and happy to be together  and he makes a movie warmer and more accessible than before.MarcelAndr Wilms is a shoeshine living in Le HavreI am curious  how many cities in the world are called The Harbor?. He moves around the different places in the city for earning money but it is not so easy for him to work on these daysthe opening scene made me to be conscious about what I was wearing on my feet. While watching him working I thought he would envy the shoeshines I saw in Seoul who usually occupy the booths on the streets as their workplace for doing other things besides polishing the shoes. I remember that I once needed my shoes to be polished as soon as possible when I was about to attend the lab colleague's wedding I went into one of those booths and the guy did a marvelous job with my old shoes I seldom wore.Anyway let's get back to the film itself. Marcel does not earn money much but there is always the place waiting for him whenever the day is over. There are his good workingclass neighbours including the bakery owner who demands Marcel to pay off his accumulating bill while well aware of that he will probably never do that. He tells her he will pay it all when a good chance comeshe mentions about the inheritance of his wife but it is a lie and both know that. The grocery shop owner across the alley chooses a more direct way  he shuts down the store instantly when Marcel walks to the store though as we learn later he is a nice man after all.Marcel was once a freeliving bohemian who wanted to be a writer when he was young but now he is settled with his wife ArlettyKati Outinen  do you remember her far younger self in Shadows in Paradise and The Match Factory Girl1990? and their dog Laika in their shabby house. We do not know much about how they met in the pastI guess they started as the best roommates but the lowkey performances of Wilms and Outinen succinctly conveys us a dry but loving relationship between them.Meanwhile a group of illegal immigrants from Gabon who tried to go to London are found by the police at one of those huge containers at the port after locked in there for days due to their bad luck. One of them a boy named IdrissaBlondin Miguel manages to escape. When he goes to the riverside to have a lunch Marcel comes across him hiding from the police. He gives Idrissa the food later and Marcel soon finds himself taking care of him at his house while the newspapers make a big fuss about this shy quiet and nice boy.Marcel does more than that to help Idrissa. He goes to Calais to find and meet Idrissa's grandfather who was with him in that container. He even concocts a secret plan to send Idrissa to London where Idrissa's mother lives. While Marcel is absent Idrissa can take care of himself well and Laika who deserves to appear with others in the movie poster is always near him.Marcel's neighbours also help him too. Except one petty guyJean Pierre Laud  remember Antoine Doinel in 400 Blows1959? his neighbours do not tell anything to the police. Captain MonetJeanPierre Darroussin very serious with a black suit a black coat black shoes black gloves and a black hat seems to be determined to do his job but Darroussin gives us a subtle hint that Monet does not like what he has to do. Monet can be flexible and the loose suspense of the film depends on how much flexible he can be.While Marcel is busy with helping Idrissa Arletty is in the hospital. She knows she has been ill and she hides that from her husband but she can't hide it from him any more now except that her days can be counted. She is sent to the hospital early in the film so she does not know much about what is going around her husband but when Idrissa comes to her at the hospital to deliver the message from her husband she accepts the message from the boy she barely knows. Outinen expresses little in the face but this scene is one of the warmest spots in the film along with its charming soundtrack. Later in the story there is an illegal concert promoted by Marcel and his Vietnamese colleagueQuoc Dung Nguyen to gather the money for helping Idrissa and a singer named Little BobRoberto Piazza gets a little showstopper moment with his live performance.".

Later in the story there is an illegal concert promoted by Marcel and his Vietnamese colleagueQuoc Dung Nguyen to gather the money for helping Idrissa and a singer named Little BobRoberto Piazza gets a little showstopper moment with his live performance.";

	schema:reviewBody "Another joyous work from the Finnish master Kaurismaki whose films always brim with delight and wry humour an unmistakably Finnish sense of humour. In typical whimsical fashion Kaurismaki has created a charming story set in a nondescript time in a place that couldn't be more current evidenced by the major conflict in the film the issue of illegal immigration. Le Havre is a city that suits Kaurismaki like any other place in Finland with it's traditional working class port and harbour the unique blend of French cultures and English climate. As a francophile with his very dry nordic wit and humour Kaurismaki is perfect for this somewhat dire subject.In trademark Kaurismaki style it is also a very colourful film with the help of his brilliant veteran cinematographer Timo Salminen Kaurismaki imbues the city of Havre with life humour in what is characteristically perhaps only in my perception a grim and literally cold place. Kaurismaki has always had a great eye of visuals some of his compositions with Salminen are gorgeous notice the impressionistic ray of sunlight illuminating a grey stone wall at the Gare de Calais the boisterous colours of the fruit and veg shop with it's provincial style store front even the shipping containers by night in the rain are haunting and melancholic. It's as if the film was shot in Technicolor so vibrant is the palette of colours consistent in most of Kaurismaki's works it looks like it belongs in an era decades ago. This is coupled with the fact the style is almost anachronistic from the style of fashions to the modest decor of Marcel's house and the local bar to the rotary dial phones and very little other modern technology. It is all an utterly charming strange universe.Kaurismaki's films always play out like a fable of sorts the every day man or woman in Drifting Clouds lives simply in a modest lifestyle almost on the edge of poverty making ends meet with a dream or catalyst to set them off some expected new life. In this case a writer of sorts Marcel Marx lives each day just to get by and care for or be taken care of his equally devoted wife Arletty. When she gets sick and has to go to hospital she prefers not to worry him and understates her sickness so he can go along and continue with his life. At the same time he discovers a young boy Idrissa who is on the run from authorities after illegally immigrating from Africa with what looks like entire family of about 2030 members. His kind and mellow heart leads leads him to foster the boy under his roof with he help of the kindly townsfolk and the absolutely heart meltingly irresistible Golden Retriever Laika!. However local inspector Monet is on the hunt to restore things to natural read legal order.This combination of hard edged social realism with the young boy and his family' dire outcome and the joyous optimism of Kaurismaki's benevolent play off watch other beautifully. There is some much dry humour in detective Monet's interaction with the townsfolk the hopeful and determined innocence of Marcel's quest to reunite the boy with his family which belies his simple and bucolic lifestyle and the efforts of Arletty to ask her doctors to lie to her husband so not to worry him.Although not as ingenious as his masterwork The Man Without a Past 2002 perhaps lacking the incisiveness and tension in that film admittedly I've only seen that and Lights in the Dusk 2006 however Kaurismaki remains in the top eschelon of the very great filmmakers working today due to his incomparable individuality and visual style generosity and sincerity of his characters some of which are hopeless nobodies but they grow on you. He is foremost a humanist storyteller challenging his characters to do their best not always perfectly but with the right heart. I was utterly charmed by this world of Le Havre in a serious subject about current problems today that's not always easy to smile about.".

	schema:reviewBody "I understand that this is the film that brought Isabelle Huppert already the accomplished veteran of over 20 films and yet just 22yearsold to the forefront of the French cinema. It is not hard to see why. She is apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. She is shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary French girl who hopes one day to be a beautician. Along comes Franois Yves Beneyton a tall handsome young intellectual from a petite bourgeois family who sweeps her off her feet.They set up housekeeping and eventually he gets around to introducing her to his family. Alas Mom finds the girl decent and ...well it's rather predictable. You should watch. I've seen the story a number of times and I find it rather painful especially because in this case Huppert is so incredibly sweet and adorable. It is a naturalistic love story like something from a nineteenth century novel sad compelling bittersweet and ultimately tragic in an all too familiar way.Claude Goretta's direction is lean and finely cut and he does a great job with Huppert. There are moments of pure genius especially the stunning final shot in which Pomme suddenly turns to the camera on her face a vaguely hopeful enigmatic expression. It lingers just long enough so that we realize this really is the end and the lights are about to come up. The shot is especially effective because we can see the posters from Greece on the walls that reveal that what she just told Franois was a kind of proud makebelieve story. Also very well done without undue emphasis is the scene where Pomme goes to him at the window in their apartment presenting herself to him so to speak her naked little self so vulnerable and he is not interested. Nothing more need to be said. It is like the turn in a sonnet everything changes.Without the beguiling childlike but deeply experienced and finely expressed performance by Mademoiselle Huppert this film would still be good but nothing special. She carries the film her timing her intense concentration her sense of who she is and how she feels at every moment is just perfect. She is exquisite.For those of you familiar with the work of Isabelle Huppert this is a film not to be missed.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "To revisit this exquisite performance from Isabelle Huppert is to forgive her the sleaziness of some of her recent choices. Like the other posters I have just read here this film  or rather this performance  has remained vivid in my memory since I saw it first on television some years ago. I bought the DVD in Paris last March and have just got around to playing it. Unfortunately it is offered without subtitles but dubbed into several languages so that any nonFrench speakers who have yet to see it will almost certainly lose out. There's one semi major hurdle to get over but when and if that is accomplished this is a semimasterpiece. The film was made in 1977 and there is nothing to say that it is not also set at that time yet we have a pretty 18 year old girl who admits to being a virgin and a courtship which would do credit to a repressed English couple of the 1930s40s50s rather than a FRENCH couple in the 1970s. There is an equal lack of Passion between Huppert and Yves Benyeton in fact Kevin McCarthy lookalike Benyeton is SO wooden we can't help wondering if he is REALLY a pod who somehow strayed from the set of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers on to THIS set. Throughout the acting of Huppert is Magnificent and leaves everyone else for dead. Huppert is not only one of the most beautiful but also one of the most Intelligent actresses working today and the way in which she suppresses her natural intelligence to play a colorless unambitious low selfesteemed teenager is little short of incredible. Goretta has chosen to end with a shot of Huppert looking straight into camera with a completely expressionless gaze reminiscent of Garbo in the last shot of Queen Christina. Whether by accident or design it's a comparison that Huppert can more than justify. One of the alltime great film performances.".

I do not agree that Pomme was proud and hopeful.When Francois visited Pomme at the mental hospital she told him that she had had other lovers and had been in Greece with one of them. This was obviously not true. Then why did she say so? Dennis Littrell thinks that she was proud. I take him to mean that Pomme would give Francois the impression that she was quite capable of going on living without him.I cannot imagine that she could have such motives. Although SHE is the one who became sick when he abandoned her and even so ill that she had to attend a hospital HE is the one who needs support from two friend when he goes to see her and HE is the one who cries when nobody sees it. My conception is that Pomme even here revealed her good heart. She tried to make things easy for Francois  he should not need to have any feelings of remorse because of what he did to her.Moreover I disagree that Pomme's face in the last shot shows a vague hope. I think that it reveals the greatest hopelessness.One Swedish reviewer wrote that things go bad when Francois lets Pomme remain at her own level and they go bad when he tries to draw her up to his level.  But this is double nonsense. Things are excellent when he accepts her as she is. Moreover Pomme is realistic. FIRST Francois must finish his study and afterward they may see what they can do about her. At the present time they cannot even afford to go to the cinema without saving the money elsewhere.Much more important is the other side of the coin. Pomme would really love to be like Francois. In a bookshop she looks at the volumes with paintings by famous artists. But she cannot learn to understand such things without help. And the idea never strikes Francois that he might help her. He just scolds her for being as she is.There are several key scenes. In one of them Pomme is afraid of crossing a street full of motorcars. Francois had soon run over and now he is standing there and shaking from impatience and irritation. The idea never occurred to him to take her hand and lead her over the street. And when she asks him what is the meaning of the word dialectic he gives her no reasonable answer.By and large the idea of sexual Samaritans is unrealistic. Extremely few people are prepared to sleep with another individual toward whom they feel little attraction and expect no other gain. There are nevertheless a few unusual situations in which I would seriously recommend such things. Francois just throws Pomme away giving no thoughts to the consequences. He does no even participate in the last meal when he is at home in front of her and will drive her to her mother's home as soon as the meal is over.I claim that Francois did have enough personal strength to continue the relation a little longer and to try to make the break more gradual and as little harmful to Pomme as possible. He could have seen her sometimes after she had moved to her mother and he could sleep with now and then for a while.I do think that he had an amount of responsibility for her and should have done something to help her overcome the breaking of their relation.".

Everywhere she turns there is love and passion evident even through the hotel's thin walls. She only wishes to please and outwardly doesn't project herself as a selfregulated person. Her lower class background is clear before she goes on vacation where she meets the student. Although they stay in the same hotel this is about the only thing they have in common beside the bed they share but being removed from their normal lives just delays the obvious. Love is idyllic at first for everyone. She is hopelessly adrift among his friends in Paris and cannot communicate with them. This class based depiction is consistent with how many French view that one's birth divides a person from the other classes. The classbased system exists here in the South but I have a feeling that passion and love and familiarity more readily breaks down barriers than those 30 years ago in France.This is a movie well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The expression method was coined by the acting teacher Lee Strasberg to describe his unique interpretation of the acting techniques of the Russian director Constantin Stanislavsky. In the 1950s Strasberg was the guru of the famed Actors Studio of New York where many great film actors honed their craft with the master. Strasberg's authoritarian style was legendary as he watched the actors perform scenes and monologues and then proceeded to psychoanalyze the actors and their choices. Mr. Strasberg would be truly appalled by the trite and clichridden Method. The film seeks to weave two stories in a playwithinaplay style. Unfortunately neither one of the stories is interesting and the main problem is the script. Much of the dialogue was laughable. Also the production values of this film seemed amateurish with special effects and scenes of violence that were not credible. Sadly the good premise of a story about an actress who loses touch with reality and becomes the character was not realized despite the good efforts of the cast. The classic film A Double Life 1947 was successful in developing this premise as the actor playing Othello is so enmeshed within his character that he commits a reallife murder. The screenwriters for A Double Life were the brilliant team of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon from whom the writers of Method could have learned a lesson worthy of the great teacher Lee Strasberg.".

In order to totally immerse herself in the role and get the best performance she feels she can give Fairbanks resides on set trying to live the life of Belle Gunnes. However all becomes tragic when people begin to turn up dead and Jake is arrested as a suspect.Method or Dead Even as is titled on the UK DVD is a very good thriller and is at times quite unnerving. The film Method features scenes from the film 'Belle' that Fairbanks and Fields are starring in. As such you get 'real action' mixed with the action for the pretend film. Iy has been said in at least one comment that it is hard to tell what is the 'real action' and what is the fake film action. I would have to disagree with this as I thought it was perfectly clear but maybe I'm just more preceptive than some other people. The acting in this film is very very good with the standout performance coming from Jeremy Sisto brilliant actor. Elizabeth Hurley looks very good in this film as does Jake Field's wife Bethany Hannah Yelland. I feel sorry for Fields having to choose between these two it's a tough call. Olivia du Sautoy is very good as Mona the mother of actress Fairbanks who controls her life and seems very overprotective of her daughter. I watched this last night for the first time and am left feeling the longing to watch it again tonight which is a sign of how much I liked this film. It really is a great thriller. 810Cat Squire".

The film Method features scenes from the film 'Belle' that Fairbanks and Fields are starring in. As such you get 'real action' mixed with the action for the pretend film. Iy has been said in at least one comment that it is hard to tell what is the 'real action' and what is the fake film action. I would have to disagree with this as I thought it was perfectly clear but maybe I'm just more preceptive than some other people. The acting in this film is very very good with the standout performance coming from Jeremy Sisto brilliant actor. Elizabeth Hurley looks very good in this film as does Jake Field's wife Bethany Hannah Yelland. I feel sorry for Fields having to choose between these two it's a tough call. Olivia du Sautoy is very good as Mona the mother of actress Fairbanks who controls her life and seems very overprotective of her daughter. I watched this last night for the first time and am left feeling the longing to watch it again tonight which is a sign of how much I liked this film. It really is a great thriller. 810Cat Squire";

	schema:headline " Interesting and fun but a bit confusing at times";
	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILAGE!!!METHOD is a fun film within a film story about a beautiful glamorous actress who is trying to make a big comeback with her first leading role in 3 years. The cast is headed by Elizabeth Hurley who after giving birth to a son took some time away from her own films. In a way this story of a modern day actress seems to mirror Hurley's own career. Although this film isn't too shabby it is just the latest of Hurley's films to go straight to video. I'm not sure if this even got theatre play overseas. The reputation of the fictitious actress Rebecka Fairbanks is similar to Hurley in so many ways that I wonder if all the gossip surrounding the filming of METHOD was part of an attempt to get the public to be intensely interested in the film. Among the gossip was an alleged brawl between Hurley and director Duncan Roy in which some harsh things were said and then apologized for. The other big issue was Hurley's husband reportedly being jealous of Hurley's love scenes. I thought I only saw one very hot love scene not many.Before I continue I guess I need to try to dispel my own confusion and any potential confusion I may cause readers of my commentary. I can only keep my sanity by referring to METHOD in its two entities the film BELLE which is the movie Fairbanks is shooting and the MAKING OF BELLE which is the documentarystyle element in which we get more than just a glimpse of Fairbanks' personal life. See what I mean when I say confusion can set in easily unless things are sorted out??? Hurley as Fairbanks Fairbanks as notorious 19th century serial killer Belle Gunness. It is the role of a lifetime for Fairbanks and she wants badly to do her very best to turn in a stellar performance. At least that's what we assume when we first meet her. On the set her mother Mona Carmen du Satoy seems just a little hovery just a little bossy and just a little domineering. She treats her daughter Rebecka like she's a 5 year old superstar rather than a 34 year old mildly successful actress. Mother's ambition and daughter's resentment become quite clear and not only because Mona's a pushy stage mom. There is also the matter of Rebecka's costar for the film Jake Fields Jeremy Sisto. He used to be Rebecka's boyfriend and it's obvious he still has feelings for her much to his wife Bethany's dismay. More reasons are revealed for why Rebecka resents her mother and they are good understandable reasons. Instead of the life she would have been overjoyed to have Rebecka is living the life her mother chose for her. Jake is not as happy as he would have liked to be either and before too long the feelings he harbors for Rebecka ultimately drive his wife away.Yet instead of happiness when they get back together Rebecka and Jake face strange onset violence and off set murders begin happening. Although no suspects are named certain people seem to have a motive for killing. Both Mona and Jake have been pestered by a sleazy little media mouth named Timothy and Timothy is found with his throat cut. Jake was not in love with his wife and Rebecka might have been jealous and Bethany Fields is found with her throat cut. The film within the film BELLE was fun to watch. I almost want to say that I wish they would have just made a movie about Belle Gunness and been done with it. It was done well. Hurley playing Fairbanks playing Gunness. Sisto playing Fields playing a farm hand named Ray Lamphere who falls under the spell of the beautiful widow and ends up helping her kill and dispose of over 40 men. On the set Mona notices that Rebecka is not taking medicines that have been prescribed to her for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia is my guess since Rebecka protests to her mother They make me tired. I'm forgetting my lines. I can't FEEL anything. So the actress has stopped her medicine in spite of Mona's worries because she wants to capture the spirit of the role she is playing. A method actor she is. A few days without her balancing meds and Rebecka seems to be hallucinating the spirit of Belle Gunness hearing the serial killer's voice telling her that Mona doesn't want her to be happy that all men are evil. Thus the lines between pretend and reality are blurred. I'm sure that METHOD will be a film that I will chew on for a while trying to learn more about it trying to figure out things that confused me like What happened to the little Romanian hottie that Rebecka picked up in the bar??? She took him home but we don't know if she bedded him or killed him or both!!! That was most confusing. And whose was the burnt corpse in the morgue??? Did the Romania guy end up as one of the victims under the house??? As for the acting well Jeremy Sisto was first rate as always. Hurley was better than usual. Du Satoy was great and so was Oliver Tobias.Not perfect but definitely unusual and fun!!!".

Pretty as she is Hurley is a terribly inexpressive actress the film gets points for having someone actually say on screen that she can't act and is so bad in the period film sequences you'd like to believe it's intentional but I think not. Jeremy Sisto's acting style consists exclusively of lowering his chin and looking up at everybody hoping one would assume that this conveys some kind of brooding intensity. Unfortunately it only makes him look like Tony Perkins in Psycho. Sisto should also take it easy on the eyebrow tweezing...they look exactly like Hurley's. The plot a troubled actress becomes too immersed in playing the role of a serial killer is too convoluted by half  leisurely when it should be tense abrupt when we could be helped out by some exposition. Really didn't like the film at all but can't say I minded looking at Elizabeth Hurley and that everadorable hunk John Barrowman".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason this came up as a horror I assure you it isn't.It tells the story of an actress returning to the spotlight for a new movie.

	schema:headline " Competent Italian War Actioner";
	schema:reviewBody "The king of average mediocre Italian action movies Alfonso Brescia does his best work in this actionpacked antiwar commando story released in 1967. Hell in Normandy may not be the best of a slew of Italian commando movies but it's somewhere near the top of the pile simply because Brescia manages to pack so much into a 90minute running time.American commandos led by Captain Murphy Guy Madison parachute into occupied Normandy where Lt. Strobel Peter Lee Lawrence a German spy helps them penetrate a flamethrower installations which threatens the landings on Omaha Beach. Murphy is skeptical of his mission's practicality but Strobel is fanatically dedicated to destroying the base and the two butt heads several times before the film's bulletridden climax.This was an ItalianFrench coproduction and was quite possibly shot in France  this is noticeable in the first few shots. For once an Italian war films opens with the landscape actually looking like the country it represents. I can't count the times I've seen semiarid climates and rock quarries passed off for southern France so Brescia's choice of shooting locations earns him major points in my book. The movie looks just as real throughout  uniforms weapons vehicles and sets all look very authentic. Many Italian directors such as Leon Klimovsky and Umberto Lenzi disregarded accuracy in favor of action and that damaged their credibility. Here one can respect the time and money Brescia puts into making his film look credible.This was Guy Madison's first Italian war movie and he hasn't grown comfortable yet in a part which he would eventually own in the genre  he's starred in several similarlythemed films each helmed by a different director. Man does this guy get around! That said he seems a bit unsure of himself as Captain Murphy quite possibly because the role has its limitations. Murphy is cynical and critical of the way his mission was planned by superiors and how he's been ordered to execute it but that's about all he gets to say  and he says it so many times that his dialog gets old and worn out very fast.In direct contrast Peter Lee Lawrence seems to be enjoying himself as Lt. Strobel and has plenty of good dialog as well as some physically active scenes to be involved in. From the moment we meet him Strobel is obsessed with the success of his mission even if it means killing anyone who gets in his way. But he also has a tender side demonstrated in his love for the French partisan girl Denise Erika Blanc a relationship which never gets the full development it deserves.Brescia then loads his supporting cast with familiar names and faces most notably Max Tarilli Hornet's Nest an always underused and underappreciated actor. Here Tarilli is a vicious German Corporal who is hot on the trail of Murphy's commandos and never ceases in his search. It's refreshing to see what talent Tarilli has and he never appears less than fully convincing as the viciousNazitype. Massimo Carocci Pierre Richard Giuseppe Castellano Luciano Catenacci Gianni Pulone and Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia all have small parts too which give a necessary boost.When stacked up against similar films such as Where Eagles Dare Attack and Retreat or Tobruk this little action story doesn't hold up as well. But Brescia takes his craft seriously and earnestly tries to make everything look and sound as good as possible given the circumstances. Hell in Normandy is a wellmeaning war film with a good premise and enough good acting suspense and violent action to keep it entertaining even if it is all clichd.SGT. SLAUGHTER'S RATING 3 Bullets".

His mission is only partly successful but he is able to join up with a squadron of paratroopers sent to finish the job and guides them to the installation.

Erica Blanc is excellent as a brave and intelligent member of the local resistance.Brescia's Hell in Normandy is a cleverly plotted and welldirected military actionadventure centered on events preceding the allied victory at Normandy during World War Two. The film is fictional and makes no pretense at engaging the realities of the battle. But it does remain mostly within the constraints of plausibility. The cinematography is very good  hardly unexpected from an Italian film. But the script is horrendous. The writer included several token American idiomatic clichs  probably at the insistence of the cast  but did way too much exposition through dialog. The version I saw was dubbed. Perhaps the dialog is better in Italian? Recommended for war film fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "SpaghettiWar film about a misfit outfit led by Guy Madison who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines  in Omaha Beach . The movie is set during World War II in the days just prior to the DDay invasion. A special parachute unit is sent to destroy a German flame thrower installation on Omaha Beach . A group of twofisted soldiers formed by various experts are drafted to go on a nearsuicide mission and attempt to destroy an installation from a Nazi fortress . Hell in Normandy  is an entertaining film with Guy Madison as a stiff officer along with Peter Lee Lawrence posing as a Nazi lieutenant . Guy Madison leading a group of motley and eclectic soldiers for a dangerous assault on a beach . In the hands of hardboiled director Alfonso Brescia  alias Al Bradley  and a toughasleather cast  that's all the plot that's needed to make one riproaring wartime flick . Madison's mission is twofold and in violent and cynical style  first turn his G.I.s into a valiant fighting unit being parachuted  then turn them loose on a French location in Normandy where they run into partisans Erica Blanc and there Lt. Strobel Peter Lee Lawrence a German spy helps them penetrate a flamethrower installations which threatens the landings on Omaha Beach . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader . The final part is all action  as the brave commando wreak havoc and then run for their lives . The dangerous mission includes a selected group formed by a motley and varied squadron played by usual of Italian Bseries . This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning about an experienced officer  he's assigned by Military staff to train a group of valiant G.I.s who get a chance to redeem themselves and later on  they pull off a extremely risked assignment called Operation Gambit . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines  to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected position .Guy Madison as Capt. Jack Murphy assumes the character of commando leader along with Peter Lee Lawrence as Lt. Strobel in this ordinary wartime movie regularly directed by Al Bradley . This moving film packs frantic thrills  perilous adventures  relentless feats  and buckloads of explosive action and violence . The noisy action is uniformly wellmade  especially deserving of mention the riproaring final scenes on the beach fortress  including some spectacular shootouts  firing and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit  cudgeled by Madison into his varied group  the film is full of feats  shots and thrills though contains excessive dialog and a lot of night scenes . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Peter Lee Lawrence is good in his usual tough role  here playing the unshakable lieutenant Strobel . Blond German youth Peter Lee Lawrence who made his uncredited debut in Sergio Leone For A Few Dollars More 1965 was the hero in many Spaghetti Westerns. His short cinematographic history can be enclosed in nine years of ItaloSpain coproductions such as More Dollars for the MacGregors  Winchester justicePistol for a Hundred Coffins The man who killed Billy the Kid  Fury of Johnny Kid and several others . Rough Guy Madison is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Philippe Hersent  Pierre Richard  John Bartha and Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia as Navy officer  all of them habitual secondary players in multiple Italian films and mostly playing brief interventions . Atmospheric and functional musical score and mediocre cinematography in Eastmancolor filmed by Fausto Rossi  being necessary an urgent remastering because the film copy is washed out . This is a wartime typical vehicle and into the warlike commando genre  in USA style which also belong the American classics as  Dirty Dozen Robert Aldrich  Where eagles dareBrian G. Hutton and Kelly's heroesHutton  Tobruk Arthur Hiller Devil's Brigade Andrew V McLagen and many others .The film is middling directed by Alfonso Brescia . He began directing musclemen epics as The Conqueror of Atlantis   The magnificent gladiator La Rivolta dei Pretoriani. After that  he continued with Spaghetti Western as Winchester Bill  Ley Del Colt  I Giorni Della Violenza  Adventure as Zanna Bianca Amazons against Supermen and warlike movie as Objetivo Rommel  Misiones Ardientes and this Hell in Normandy.

As the title suggests the narrative centers around the DDay landings the Nazis have prepared a booby trap for the Allies about to 'invade' Europe from the sea so a select band of paratroopers is flown over beforehand to nip their plan in the bud! While I wasn't familiar with any members of the cast other than Guy Madison and Erika Blanc the film emerges as a fairly engaging actioner which also features a couple of stage actors assigned to impersonate the distinguished professor who invented the Nazi's latest gadget and the young German officer accompanying him. An unusual subplot involves an old French peasant who informs on the whereabouts of the commando outfit they're being sheltered by his partisan daughter Blanc because he's afraid of what the Nazis might do to him if they get wind of the situation.Though the film ends with the DDay operation itself shown through blackandwhite stock footage the downbeat climax sees the majority of the Allied squad perish trying to destroy the Nazi's Normandy beach outpost. Nevertheless there's a healthy dose of comedy throughout  with Madison as perhaps one of the most cynical soldiers ever depicted on the screen my favorite bit however was in a scene where a German officer rebukes the guard dogs for failing to detect any trace of the Americans' presence in a barn  whereupon one of his underlings off the screen quips sarcastically You should be glad they didn't die from all the stench! The film has probably been out of circulation since its release as the print I watched was in extremely poor shape scratched grainy and excessively dark yet faded enough at times to expose the dayfornight shooting!.".

There is so much that's puzzling about the movie one wonders if we'll ever know how it came to be made. The original treatment that it's based on is by Ennio Flaiano Fellini's most frequent writing collaborator but it's written by an Englishman Stanley Mann.  The director never made anything before or after that indicated he had the imagination or sensitivity to create something like it yes this is the same John Guillerman that made Shaft in Africa and The Towering Inferno. It's shot on location and yet has the look of an Alist film shot on a sound stage. The cast includes two Americans a Frenchwoman and a Swede so it was probably dubbed into many languages for international distribution. Produced by 20th Century Fox  it couldn't be less American. Most puzzling of all why has it never received the recognition it deserves?If anyone reading this has background information about its production please contact me.".

There is such an delicate realism to Gozzi's performance as an emotionally troubled and deluded adolescent that makes the film actually seem far ahead of its time. Trust methis kid could have been right at home next to Brando in On the Waterfront and never been upstaged by him for one second.Most reviewers seem to believe that it's these three sensitive performances that carry the weight of the plot but how they stumble into learning about themselves and each other is never contrived. There isn't a single scene as there is in most Hollywood films with an overwrought catharsis that changes their world overnight.

She lives with her distant father Melvyn Douglas and housekeeper Karen Gunnel Lindblom who do little to understand her. Agnes spends her time playing in the surf whistling with the sea gulls and taking care of her dolls. She desperately wants something of her own so she makes a scarecrow and cares for it like a child. Soon an escaped criminal named Joseph Dean Stockwell comes and dons the scarecrow's clothes causing Agnes to imagine that her creation has come to life. She convinces the family to take Joseph into their home and quickly becomes enamored with him.The move stars slowly but gets progressively better. Each character is complex and interesting namely Agnes and Joseph. Their relationship is intriguing if not a bit disturbing. Physically they are both very beautiful people. Gozzi is gorgeous despite wearing no makeup and acting like a child she is reminiscent of Ingrid Bergman. Stockwell also looks like a composite of two classic stars James Dean and Montgomery Clift.".

	schema:reviewBody "Plot Set against the rugged beauty of the Brittany seacoast it tells the story of a young girl whose lonely isolation under the watchful eye of her stern and bitter father is abruptly shattered by the arrival of a seductive fugitive from the law.'Rapture' is a comingofage tale a dark Gothic fantasy a romance a bit of a melodrama and maybe a few other things. Its ability to stay clear from clichs despite the familiar dramatic framework alone is astonishing which makes the film ultimately pretty uncategorizable not to say anything about how sensible and dare I say perfect everything else is about this relatively layered production that feels grounded in realism while often being quite magical thanks partly due to the script and partly due to its beautiful dreamy score and arresting as well as intelligent compositions of its CinemaScope black and white cinematography.Its nationality isn't easily identifiable either. The spoken language is English the writer of the source novel is British as is the director but he was born to French parents the film unlike the novel is set in France and most of the crew is French as is the main actress. Its overall feel is predominantly French but it definitely also has British and American touches and there's something Bergmanesque about it as well as it often plays like a chamber psychodrama and with Bergman regular Gunnel Lindblom in the cast providing a direct link to the Swedish auteur. Speaking of actors although without big stars the main players are all recognizable faces who fit their roles excellently and all of which give very good performances with the memorable standout being French actress Patricia Gozzi as the young girl she bowed out of acting only a few years later but if you happen to have seen 'Sundays and Cybele' you certainly will remember her from that movie.There are many films I could compare it to but no comparison would be exhaustive. The enigmatic stranger who enters a family with each person projecting their own desires onto him and them essentially creating their own image of the man is an important element in the film that recalls Pasolini's 'Teorema'. Then there's an impressive section later in the film in which the girl finds herself in Paris for the first time and she is completely overwhelmed by her surroundings and the situation in general which has something of the same year's 'Repulsion'. In fact I think I saw Catherine Deneuve rubbing her nose in the background in one of the shots...OK I didn't. Anyway those comparisons are just scratching the surface.I'm not really sure to whom I would recommend 'Rapture' but if my genre description made it sound like your kind of thing you may want to look into it. Especially if you loved Chanwook Park's 'Stoker' I think there are a few similarities between them with a general oddness that is not only captivating with its complex web of character relationships but also feels perfectly natural to the material in particular thanks to its mentally troubled young protagonist on the brink of sexual awakening who is like a warmer but also more visibly unhinged version of India Stoker with the actress very much having the same strange appeal as Mia Wasikowska as well as the acting chops to go with it.Although understandably not the kind of film with a huge mainstream appeal 'Rapture' apparently never even saw all that much of a release back in the 60's. The handful of reviews that I found all written within the past few years amazingly enough are unanimously very positive which strengthens me in my belief that this is a gem still waiting to be discovered by a much wider audience. It's only now that the film sees its first wide home video release by the UK label Eureka so maybe now its time has finally come.".

Speaking of actors although without big stars the main players are all recognizable faces who fit their roles excellently and all of which give very good performances with the memorable standout being French actress Patricia Gozzi as the young girl she bowed out of acting only a few years later but if you happen to have seen 'Sundays and Cybele' you certainly will remember her from that movie.There are many films I could compare it to but no comparison would be exhaustive. The enigmatic stranger who enters a family with each person projecting their own desires onto him and them essentially creating their own image of the man is an important element in the film that recalls Pasolini's 'Teorema'. Then there's an impressive section later in the film in which the girl finds herself in Paris for the first time and she is completely overwhelmed by her surroundings and the situation in general which has something of the same year's 'Repulsion'. In fact I think I saw Catherine Deneuve rubbing her nose in the background in one of the shots...OK I didn't. Anyway those comparisons are just scratching the surface.I'm not really sure to whom I would recommend 'Rapture' but if my genre description made it sound like your kind of thing you may want to look into it. Especially if you loved Chanwook Park's 'Stoker' I think there are a few similarities between them with a general oddness that is not only captivating with its complex web of character relationships but also feels perfectly natural to the material in particular thanks to its mentally troubled young protagonist on the brink of sexual awakening who is like a warmer but also more visibly unhinged version of India Stoker with the actress very much having the same strange appeal as Mia Wasikowska as well as the acting chops to go with it.Although understandably not the kind of film with a huge mainstream appeal 'Rapture' apparently never even saw all that much of a release back in the 60's. The handful of reviews that I found all written within the past few years amazingly enough are unanimously very positive which strengthens me in my belief that this is a gem still waiting to be discovered by a much wider audience. It's only now that the film sees its first wide home video release by the UK label Eureka so maybe now its time has finally come.";

	schema:headline " How one errant shove can destroy everything. A sensitive fable of romantic awakening.";
	schema:reviewBody "The world lost one of its actresses with the strongest potential when young Gozzi retired for the screen within a few years of filming this movie. She plays an emotionallystunted childlike young lady who lives in a big bleak house with her stoic father Douglas and a pretty housekeeper Lindblom. Unable to deal with the fast pace and the sophisticated ideas of city life she wiles away her time playing with dolls or lollygagging around on the beach to the great consternation of Douglas who seems to resent her for reminding him of his dead wife. The two have occasional showdowns in which she displays tantrumlike behavior while Lindblom tries to keep things in order. One day circumstances lead a delinquent young man Stockwell to their somewhat remote house and Gozzi is enthralled with him. In her regressed state she comes to believe that he is the human incarnation of a scarecrow she took great pride in creating. Eventually she blossoms under his attention and begins to evolve and grow out of her previous condition. However it may not be enough to salvage her happiness since he also has his eye on Lindblom not to mention her father's stash of money. The deck is even further stacked against them because of an incident that took place just before his arrival to their home. What results is the pleasure of seeing Gozzi mature mixed with the tragedy of seeing her fail to fully succeed in that effort or to find complete happiness. This is a moody atmospheric film with excellent photography and a haunting score by that genius Delarue. Fans of Steel Magnolias will recognize the ebullient lullabylike qualities he brought to that film and others. It unfolds like a fable or parable with all the romance fear humor and unfairness that so many great stories consist of. Douglas a 30's leading man who later evolved into an indispensable character actor is very strong providing the necessary stern qualities but also the underlying vulnerable ones. When he enters a room unexpectedly that feeling of being caught by an unhappy parent bursts from the screen. Lindblom adroitly straddles her character's caring qualities as well as the saucy ones. She like virtually all the cast members gives a solid performance and is attractive to look at. Stockwell is excellent as well displaying many dimensions and benefitting from a camera that at times worships him especially in the sunlit outdoor scenes. Gozzi is exceptional. She's playing a role here that could so easily defeat an actress and yet she not only succeeds in the role but soars in it. She is heartwrenchingly tender yet believably strong when it's called for. Wearing little or no makeup she is nonetheless lovely in the same way Juliette Binoche would be years later. It's a shame that the viewing public was denied more from this girl when she abandoned her cinema career to marry and raise a family. She clearly had a great deal to share with movie lovers everywhere. The film is sadly littleknown and undeservedly so. It has to rate as one of the director Guillerman's best efforts and has established a small but devoted following.".

The movie was changed quite a bit from the book but both convey the story of a bereft lovestarved young girl who blossoms into a rapturouslyfulfilled woman through an unexpected source. A handsome young man comes into her life while trying to escape other circumstances. Although I like both the movie and the book the book has a much more hopeful ending and I don't know why the story was changed so much for the big screen. Nevertheless I would very much like to see this movie become available to the public on DVD. Dean Stockwell as the young man is such a wonderful actor very handsome and much of his work of this period seems to be missing from publication. Melvyn Douglas is perfect as the domineering abusive father and Patricia Gozzi is lovely vulnerable and innocent just as is the central character in the book. This is a movie worth enjoying.".

	schema:headline " John Hughes best adult comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "John Candy was a comic genius. He really was. Never was his talent on display better than it was in this film. John Hughes and John Candy went on to develop what I can only surmise was quite the friendship because Candy appeared in many Hughes films either as the star  this one Uncle Buck Great Outdoors  or with a cameo  Home Alone Vacation and a few others that I can't think of right now but check the IMDb and you'll see that he did . But of all the films that Candy did including Stripes I don't think he has ever been as good and as funny as he was in here. If there was any justice in the Academy  and we all know that is an oxymoron Academy and justice  then Candy would have at least been nominated for best actor in 1987. I think Douglas won that year for Wall Street and he deserved to but Candy was brilliant in this film. It was a shame to see his career cut short because even in his bad films he was good. This is his best and most complete role. He will be missed but at least we have great roles like this to remember him by.Planes.... is a film about one man trying to get home for the American Thanksgiving. He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a workaholic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally it is the kind of family that although is together now it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this  You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say because I can take anything I've been with Dell Griffith and they'd say  I know what you mean. Whooooo shower curtain guy!  And as funny as that scene is Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told first and foremost this is a funny funny film. And if anyone has scene it they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk who subsequently is Grace from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying Can I help you? Martin replies You can start by wiping that fing dumbass smile off your rosy fing cheeks.  From there he goes into an FWord filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of fing nowhere with fing keys to a fing car that isn't fing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10".

He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a workaholic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally it is the kind of family that although is together now it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this  You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say because I can take anything I've been with Dell Griffith and they'd say  I know what you mean. Whooooo shower curtain guy!  And as funny as that scene is Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told first and foremost this is a funny funny film. And if anyone has scene it they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk who subsequently is Grace from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying Can I help you? Martin replies You can start by wiping that fing dumbass smile off your rosy fing cheeks.  From there he goes into an FWord filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of fing nowhere with fing keys to a fing car that isn't fing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "The greatness and pure genius of Planes Trains and Automobiles is that while it is uproariously hilarious it also reveals great hurt and truth  unlike any comedy I have ever seen before or since. Scenes such as those in the Bravewood Inn are classics. The argument between Neal and Del is the turning point in the film and it is the first time that the audience realizes that they are in for more than they thought they were. There are certain elements of tenderness heart agony conflict and heartfelt emotion in Planes Trains and Automobiles that make it transcend the genre. Steve Martin and John Candy don't just act they embody themselves so deeply in their characters that it almost sets a standard for how comedic pairings should be. Line them up next to Chris Farley and David Spade and the differences are astronomical. Watching Steve Martin is like acting a comedian at the top of his game. Just watch his reactions. The facial reaction from Steve in response to Del's comeback in the Bravewood Inn is perfect we understand what Neal is going through and Steve Martin lets us know this by placing himself in a recognizable area. We also understand Del and that is really the key to this movie Being able to identify with both characters almost equally. How often can you say that about buddy pictures? I don't ever feel much sympathy for Chris Farley if that means anything.John Candy remains one of the most underrated and underwritten film comedians of all time. Offered constant mediocre scripts during the eighties and early nineties all the way up until his death in 1994 he could make the material something more something watchable. I recently viewed Funny Farm a painfully unfunny film to sit through. I imagined what John Candy could have done with Chevy Chase's role and I found myself laughing. Why? Because John Candy can make anything watchable. Just how many times would you watch Summer Rental or The Great Outdoors if the lead actor was Jim Carrey?There's some important content in this film but it is never overpowered by laughs nor vice versa. They go handinhand. I come back to the Bravewood Inn argument scene. After the hilarious ongoing insults Neal throws at Del Del responds and says You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right I talk too much. But I also listen too much. I could be a coldhearted cynical like you but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. So you go right on and think what you like about me. But I'm not changing. I  I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real deal. Whatcha see is whatcha get. It's creepy how much dramatic emotional and truthful subtext sneaks into this film and yet it only makes it all the better for it. Planes Trains and Automobiles is my favorite Comedy yes I know that I have said it before. But it is a serious comedy that has both heart and is hilarious at the same time. Entertainment at it's best. And isn't that what movies are all about? 55 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie having heard it mentioned in a fascinating book called Metal Cowboy which is essentially a sort of journal that this guy named Joe Kurmaskie wrote about his adventures as a touring cyclist. I've gotten very interested in the subject lately as my increasingly long bicycle adventures have led to an interest in seeing the country from the saddle of a bicycle and Kurmaskie references Planes Trains and Automobiles to emphasize a point he makes about the freaky things that can happen to you while traveling particularly by bus.Steve Martin and John Candy play well off of each other and it's interesting to note how many weak gimmicks are in the movie and yet how well it pulls it off. You have the traditional odd couple they run into each other constantly among millions of people for the sake of the plot of course and are such polar opposites that it's impossible not to see the inspiration that the movie took from the classic Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau film The Odd Couple. But just when you begin to think that the movie is following an easily predicted formula you get something thrown in that really catches you off guard like the scene where Neal Steve Martin finally jumps out of bed fed up with Del's John Candy inability to lie still and sleep and yells at him extensively about every single little thing that he hates about him.It's strange that this can be such a hilarious scene for Martin similar to Chevy Chase's temper tantrum over his Christmas bonus in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and yet we get cutaways to Del's face that are truly moving. He listens silently to Neal's endless stream of harsh criticisms and he just watches his face registering his inability to argue with any of it and leaving the audience to wonder why we're laughing so hard at this guy who is obviously being hurt. And it's not even that the movie makes you look back at yourself with scenes like this but that the characters are made so effectively threedimensional. spoilers Del is an overly outgoing character who is sociable to a fault. He just wants to make conversation and make friends but ends up annoying instead. Kind of like that line in The Cable Guy 'I just wanted to be your friend Steven but I screwed it up.' Carrey had won the audience's heart with that one line but sadly the remainder of the movie allowed the character to rescind any sympathy. This guy doesn't need a friend he needs a criminal psychiatrist. Del on the other hand badly needs a friend as we find out later in the movie.As a whole the movie is about the strenuous things that happen during the holidays. Rather than focus on the difficulties in dealing with the extended family as was the case in Christmas Vacation this one focuses on traveling hazards. Three years later writer and Director John Hughes wrote Home Alone in which John Candy reappears in a similar situation and plays almost exactly the same character. Here Neal's inability to get on a single plane flight leads to a twoday nightmare involving planes trains automobiles and Del Griffith.As is to be expected this odd couple grows on each other as they always do but the movie manages to escape being just another odd couple movie for a variety of reasons. First there is not resentment and dislike coming from both sides only an irrational one coming from Neal's side. He has already judged this guy long before he knew him and it is only Del that is willing to make conversation and simply get along despite their differences and the difficulty of their situation. I especially loved that the movie did not cop out at the end which it could very easily have done. It takes two people who could hardly have been more different puts them together for a matter of days in an extremely stressful situation and then brings them together at the end without compromising the validity of their characters. It is certainly a bittersweet ending but one that leaves you with a smile.".

	schema:reviewBody "Neal Page is trying to get home in time for thanksgiving with his family. When his plane is diverted to Wichita due to heavy snow elsewhere he finds himself partnering up with shower curtain salesman Del Griffith.  However Del is not Neal's immediate first choice for travelling partner and the two soon find that one misfortune after another wears their patience very thin.While comedies have moved on to become more grosser and outrageous in order to tickle our dulled funny bone PTA manages it with what now seems like restraint but is really a good example of wacky' comedy mixed with a good vein of sentiment and character.  The plot is pretty good although some of it pushes the boat out to the unreal in order to get laughs  but this isn't a problem because it DOES get laughs if it hadn't then it might have been an issue.  Most of it is hilarious although some drags early on.The deeper beauty of the film is how well controlled Hughes is in painting his emotions.  Usually his stuff can be sickly sweet but here he mixes it well with the comedy.  The relationship between Neal and Del is good and they both have things to learn more so Neal the hurt they inflict on one another is well done and not to the point that the comedy is stopped. Thankfully the two actors are good enough to carry it off.  Martin is close to his manic best and Candy plays a loveable goof.  The best scene to see them working is when Martin is laying into Del in the hotel room  the expressions on their faces Candy esp during this makes it hard not to feel anything.  The support cast do good work whether it be nowfamous cameos or just support cast but each character has their own little thing!Overall I worry that modern audiences may have become so used to everything being so OTT and gross that this film may seem subtle even though it isn't.  However aside from that this is a very funny film that does have a good heart.  Not a perfect film in any way but it does exactly what it says on the tin  it made me laugh hard but also had a believable emotional core.".

However Del is not Neal's immediate first choice for travelling partner and the two soon find that one misfortune after another wears their patience very thin.While comedies have moved on to become more grosser and outrageous in order to tickle our dulled funny bone PTA manages it with what now seems like restraint but is really a good example of wacky' comedy mixed with a good vein of sentiment and character.  The plot is pretty good although some of it pushes the boat out to the unreal in order to get laughs  but this isn't a problem because it DOES get laughs if it hadn't then it might have been an issue.  Most of it is hilarious although some drags early on.The deeper beauty of the film is how well controlled Hughes is in painting his emotions.  Usually his stuff can be sickly sweet but here he mixes it well with the comedy.  The relationship between Neal and Del is good and they both have things to learn more so Neal the hurt they inflict on one another is well done and not to the point that the comedy is stopped. Thankfully the two actors are good enough to carry it off.  Martin is close to his manic best and Candy plays a loveable goof.  The best scene to see them working is when Martin is laying into Del in the hotel room  the expressions on their faces Candy esp during this makes it hard not to feel anything.  The support cast do good work whether it be nowfamous cameos or just support cast but each character has their own little thing!Overall I worry that modern audiences may have become so used to everything being so OTT and gross that this film may seem subtle even though it isn't.  However aside from that this is a very funny film that does have a good heart.  Not a perfect film in any way but it does exactly what it says on the tin  it made me laugh hard but also had a believable emotional core.";

For some reason Thanksgiving is a neglected holiday in terms of moviemaking. That being said there is one Thanksgiving movie that not only is far and above the best of its kind it also stands as one of the greatest holiday pictures of alltime. Planes Trains and Automobiles was John Candy at his best Steve Martin at his best and also writerdirector John Hughes at his absolute prime. Mixing classic slapstick with outstanding dialogue masterpiece moments and a heavy dosage of heart that slowly builds then delivers towards the end this 1987 film never preaches and never slows down a second. Every five minute a conflict arises usually leading to a hilarious conclusion but lessons learned from the two main characters. This is a must see every fourth Thursday in November.In Planes Trains and Automobiles a bumbling cynical marketing success story Steve Martin meets a talkative yet helpful and loving traveling salesman John Candy as they both embark on a road trip across the snowinfested United States to reach Chicago in time for Thanksgiving. All sorts of transportation are used but they are all failing and letting down the two main characters for different reasons. Flights are being delayed trains are breaking down traffic is heavy car rental places aren't being reliable and vehicles are fighting against Mother Nature. John Hughes is the sole writer in this tale and manages to deliver plenty of laughs oneliners and complications in a short 93 minutes. Throughout all the troubles Neal and Del learn a lot about each other and a bit more about themselves.Steve Martin and John Candy were decent before but absolutely delivered in this movie. Both fit their roles perfectly well as we see Steve Martin at his funniest and angriest and John Candy in his most downtoearth role. Neither of the two ever stole the spotlight they each shared incredible moments whether it's the close encounter with two trucks waking up together very close or driving a car obviously not fit for the road. Individually they each had one classic moment with Martin's tirade at a rental place and Candy singing Ray Charles by himself while driving. There was such an amazing balance in this movie it would be years before we see such chemistry amongst the main two stars in a film See Dumb and Dumber in 1994.John Hughes known for his teen comedies that mesh hilarity with angst and heart reached his quality peak here. He successfully combines comedy and drama for adults and packs layers of emotion within 93 minutes. One can dissect this movie and realize it's much deeper than it looks from the outside. One has to see the movie a second time because some of the elements make more sense after seeing the ending. And what can I say about the ending? It was a quiet and gradual build up then unleashes in the final moments in such a surprising manner. Martin and Candy prove that they can do drama just as well as comedy in the final five minutes. Decades later it still stands as one of the most underrated and most unexpected endings you'll ever see. After laughing until you are tearyeyed within the first 80something minutes your throat will suddenly swell up upon seeing certain revelations and ugly truths.Bottom Line No more discussion I think I've said enough about this film if you have seen this movie I am basically preaching to the choir as to how good this film is. Otherwise you better drop everything and watch this movie now. It presents an amazing story about family about people about life's sudden curveballs. There isn't a better Thanksgiving movie within a country mile and this is leagues above the average holiday movie and this does include It's a Wonderful Life any Christmas Carol movie you can come up with and Hughes' most successful work which was Home Alone. The acting writing directing pacing and amount of sentimentality is incredible as we see the best work of two veteran actors and an acclaimed writer. Bring the family and friends and some tissue paper and prepare for a delightful experience. Recommend to the highest degree as movies that can age well and tug the heartstrings decades after its release deserve more praise and more viewings.".

Sure on the surface it is brilliant slapstick with scenes so hysterically funny they make you roll off your chair. If ever there was a laughaloud movie this is it and it ranks right up there with classics like Blazing Saddles Return of the Pink Panther and Monty Python's Holy Grail. Even if it didn't go any deeper than this Steve Martin and John Candy perform a comic feat that wouldn't put Laurel and Hardy to shame.But the strength of the movie is that just below this surface it plays out a very human drama. The two main characters Neal Page Steve Martin and Dale Griffith John Candy are polar opposites. Neal is introvert anal retentive arrogant and ambitious a typical stressedout corporate middlemanager who works in New York away from his family in Chicago. Dale is a simple salesman obese extravert uninhibited a social animal with friends in every town. They find themselves bound together by fate on a journey from New York to Chicago two days before Thanksgiving where everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong.As you would expect the involuntary close relation of such disparate characters initially causes massive friction. Neal can't stand Dale's physical presence nor his endless pointless chatter Dale is not impressed by Neal's arrogant stiffness and his notsosubtle attempts to get rid of him. Yet they need each other to reach their objective and they know it. Some brilliant scenes play out this confrontation but in the end they come to grudingly accept each other and through their trials and tribulations on the road acceptance even grows into something resembling a budding respect. Steve Martin and John Candy are fantastic their chemistry fuels the movie and raises it to a level well above standard comedy. Spoilers ahead  But the film goes deeper yet. At the next level there is underlying tragedy that both characters try to hide in their day to day existence. It turns out that Dale has lost his wife eight years before and has in fact been wandering and travelling throughout the country without ever going back home. He is effectively homeless and lives in cheap hotels and motels out of a trunk which by the way also acts as a very effective comic prop but he never discloses this to Neal. His life contains a great emotional emptiness but he can't really face up to it and he pretends to be a happily married man. Neal on the other hand is so selfobsessed with his career that he sacrifices the love for his family to the point where his wife becomes mistrusting of what is going on. Here is a man who risks losing what really matters for the sake of shallow success. He vaguely understands that something is going wrong but can't get himself to admit it or even pause and think about it.It is only when the two of them get paired up that they come to realise what is wrong with themselves. Dale is confronted with Neal's family life a life that he himself so sorely misses and Neal realises in the end that life is about more than himself and that other people do matter. At the conclusion of the film they come together and fulfill each other's needs becoming whole in the process.This is buddy movie road flick supreme. The tragedy underlying the superficial slapstick makes this film Humour with a Capital H much more so than the great comedies I mentioned before. You will have to go back to the likes of Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton to find anything comparable.However and this is where the true greatness lies in the final analysis this film is not about the drama of two different characters at all but about the opposing forces struggling within each of us ourselves. We all have a Neal and a Dale side apparent opposites that cannot exist together but only by accepting this and giving both sides equal weight can we become whole human beings. The film shows that this may at first appear an impossible task frought with risk and danger but if we persevere it can be done and the prize of healing ourselves is worth it.Hilarious comedy superb drama and ground truth  few movies would even dare to try and combine these themes. Planes trains and automobiles does and it succeeds brilliantly. Martin and Candy deliver stellar performances that work at all of these levels. Definitely one of the best movies ever and vastly underrated.".

	schema:headline " A great film on so many levels.";
	schema:reviewBody "John Hughes normally concentrated on teen films in the 1980's. Most of these were very good but Planes Trains  Automobiles was a nice change of pace. The pairing up of Steve Martin and John Candy was an inspired choice and these two great actors turn the film into a comedy masterpiece.Normally I can't stand Steve Martin because in almost everything I've seen him in he goes completely over the top. But his performance in PTA changed my outlook of him. He plays Neal Page a snobbish cynical advertising executive in New York who is going home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. The film is called Planes Trains  Automobiles because these are the means of transportation Neal has to go through to get home.Desperately late for his plane home there is an hilarious scene at the beginning where he makes a mad dash for a taxi with Kevin Bacon making a cameo. Unfortunately Neal loses out and then loses a second taxi stolen by John Candy. He plays Del Griffith a shower curtain ring salesman who is also on his way to the airport.The two of them properly meet at the airport after Neal's flight is delayed. I like this scene because they both recognise each other from somewhere but can't quite place where. Neal then has the bad luck of being seated next to Del on the plane. At some point in our lives we've all met someone like Del Griffith. Someone who is over friendly chatty and a real pest. But they're so full of the best of intentions you don't have the heart to tell them to leave you alone.Just when it looks like things can't get any worse for Neal the flight is then cancelled. So begins the hysterical chain of events of Neal's odyssey to get home.Now stuck with Del who wants to help Neal our hapless duo go from one disaster after another to get to Chicago. Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double act because although they seem like the archetypal Odd Couple there are more complexities to their relationship then at first thought.One of the best scenes is when they are forced to spend a night in a motel. Del's slobbish behaviour finally drives Neal to explode. He begins ranting about how boring Del is and what a real failure he is. In short Del is nothing but a plague on humanity.What is so good about this scene is at first you are chuckling at Neal pointing out Del's shortcomings. But Del looks so genuinely hurt your sympathies start to switch to Del instead of Neal. Then something very unexpected happens when Del tells Neal and the audience something I thought was very movingYou wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. You can say what you like about me I'm not changing. Me... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.This scene alone speaks volumes about the personalities of these two men. You begin to really feel sorry for Del because he seems like a lonely man. And Neal is not such a nice person after all. He doesn't mind insulting people if it makes him feel better. But still the laughs come thick and fast afterwards. One of the most hysterical scenes is when Neal mouths off at a car rental saleswoman after being dumped in the middle of nowhere. I've never heard so many F words in one sentence. This had to have been what gave the film its 15 certificate. Its possible Hughes inserted this scene to make it clearer to the audience PTA is more adultoriented than his previous films.Del and Neal end up sharing a rental car and they manage to completely wreck it. They are nearly killed by two trucks and the funniest part is when Del appears as the Devil to Neal. Everything just seems to be conspiring against them. Gradually the two men start to become friends. What's satisfying is it doesn't feel artificial. It feels like its been building up to it. This is due to John Hughes' slick direction. Neal and Del are two men who are both social misfits for different reasons. Neal is too organised and structured to relate to others and Del tries so hard to make friends he often ends up alienating them.Despite all the disasters that befall them they do make it to Chicago. This is where the film takes on a more serious tone but doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Del has a secret he hasn't told Neal concerning his wife but I won't reveal it for those who haven't seen the film.The ending is very touching and a little sad too. But you have grown to like both Neal and Del by the end of the film. Both of them realise things about themselves. Neal learns to be more tolerant and kind and Del learns not to be so overbearing with his friendliness. The film ends with where their friendship will lead to and its probably best left that way.Its a pity Steve Martin and John Candy couldn't have made more films because they worked so well together. This is my favourite Steve Martin film and it never seems mawkish or cloying in any way. A great little study into the personality changes you can go through on the road. I always notice something different to this film every time I watch it. This was the best film John Candy ever made. There is so much of him in Del. R.I.P. John Candy.".

Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double act because although they seem like the archetypal Odd Couple there are more complexities to their relationship then at first thought.One of the best scenes is when they are forced to spend a night in a motel. Del's slobbish behaviour finally drives Neal to explode. He begins ranting about how boring Del is and what a real failure he is. In short Del is nothing but a plague on humanity.What is so good about this scene is at first you are chuckling at Neal pointing out Del's shortcomings. But Del looks so genuinely hurt your sympathies start to switch to Del instead of Neal. Then something very unexpected happens when Del tells Neal and the audience something I thought was very movingYou wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. You can say what you like about me I'm not changing. Me... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.This scene alone speaks volumes about the personalities of these two men. You begin to really feel sorry for Del because he seems like a lonely man. And Neal is not such a nice person after all. He doesn't mind insulting people if it makes him feel better. But still the laughs come thick and fast afterwards. One of the most hysterical scenes is when Neal mouths off at a car rental saleswoman after being dumped in the middle of nowhere. I've never heard so many F words in one sentence. This had to have been what gave the film its 15 certificate. Its possible Hughes inserted this scene to make it clearer to the audience PTA is more adultoriented than his previous films.Del and Neal end up sharing a rental car and they manage to completely wreck it. They are nearly killed by two trucks and the funniest part is when Del appears as the Devil to Neal. Everything just seems to be conspiring against them. Gradually the two men start to become friends. What's satisfying is it doesn't feel artificial. It feels like its been building up to it. This is due to John Hughes' slick direction. Neal and Del are two men who are both social misfits for different reasons. Neal is too organised and structured to relate to others and Del tries so hard to make friends he often ends up alienating them.Despite all the disasters that befall them they do make it to Chicago. This is where the film takes on a more serious tone but doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Del has a secret he hasn't told Neal concerning his wife but I won't reveal it for those who haven't seen the film.The ending is very touching and a little sad too. But you have grown to like both Neal and Del by the end of the film. Both of them realise things about themselves. Neal learns to be more tolerant and kind and Del learns not to be so overbearing with his friendliness. The film ends with where their friendship will lead to and its probably best left that way.Its a pity Steve Martin and John Candy couldn't have made more films because they worked so well together. This is my favourite Steve Martin film and it never seems mawkish or cloying in any way. A great little study into the personality changes you can go through on the road. I always notice something different to this film every time I watch it. This was the best film John Candy ever made. There is so much of him in Del. R.I.P. John Candy.";

	schema:reviewBody "What is a more funny movie then one with both Steve Martin and John Candy Planes Trains and Automobiles' kept me laughing the whole time.  There's no better way to explain Martin and Candy but truly funny.  They are the ultimate odd couple.  The up tight Neal Page Martin is a workaholic just trying to see his family for Thanksgiving.  When he runs into Del Grifith John Candy Neil learns  to laugh and unwind.  They couldn't be more wrong for each other. Through all the busyness of New York it's ironic how two opposite people could possibly meet each other and become friends.  Especially when they are so different and couldn't like one another any less.  Del is a carefree easy going curtain ring sales men that seems to have no problems in life. Though he hides one tearful secret he keeps you laughing until the end.  When Neal is in such a hurry to get home for Thanksgiving with his family he just has to have everything go wrong.  It doesn't help that Neal is an overly obsessive business man with no other purpose in life but to work and go home.  After several attempts to never see each other again Del and Neal learn to spend their trip together.  After hopping from planes trains and automobiles a simple trip soon turns into quite an adventure for the two odd friends. The fine acting and natural raw comedy between Martin and Candy adds an addicting appeal to the movie.  The movie is rated R for the language that the characters use through the entire movie.  Although that is what makes the movie so funny.  It's a great ing movie!  The film would probably appeal more towards an older audience because of the intense' language used  though the film still holds a wholesome quality about it.  It's a warm hearted film with lots to laugh about.  The laughter of the film keeps you drawn in until the end when the more serious nature of the film is displayed.  Planes Trains and Automobiles' deserves a 7 out of 10.".

Neil Page Steve Martin is looking at his boarding pass for his flight home to Chicago.  He is Tapping on his watch Rolex lip sinking to his co worker across the table I got to go!' The two men are in the meeting room trying to get a client William Windham to buy  an advertisement for their marketing agency.   Next scene Neil Page is leaving the office building hoping that he will make his flight which is   an hour away.  He is having trouble finding a cab during rush hour  so he negotiates with a stranger and pays 75 for a cab.  While all that is happening the cab takes off and Neil gets up to the cab opens up the door and tells the passenger John Candy to get out  of the cab just then the cab takes off leaving Neil behind.  This is Neil Page's first encounter with Dell Griffith the shower curtain ring salesman. Eventually  Neil Makes it to the air port just in time to find his flight delayed.  Sitting in the crowded airport he notices a large man seated opposite him. The two look at each other for a few seconds until they figure out that they some how know each other. Neil tells him you stole you stole my cab at the same time Dell says You're the guy who tried to take my cab'.  When it  occurs to Dell that it was pretty easy to get a cab that day during rush hour in New York City he tries to make it up to Neil. Neil just wants to forget about it.   After every one boards the plane Neil finds he has been bumped from first class. To ad insult to injury not only does he have to fly coach but he has to sit in the middle seat next to Dell Griffith. Things could not get much worse right? The flight to Chicago was routed to Wichita due to a snow storm in Chicago. While Neil was trying to book a room and couldn't get one Dell said I booked a room at the Braidwood inn.'  and invited Neil to share a cab ride with him to the hotel. After an interesting cab ride the two arrive at a hotel for the night. and the funny adventure starts there.  Neil specializes in marketing and Dell specializes in selling the best shower curtain rings.  They have one thing in common. Both  are trying to get back to Chicago for thanksgiving.  Although the men are very different from one another in personality their misfortunes seal a  bond between them.  As they try to make the way home they find various means of transportation including a train a bus a pickup truck a burned out car and a refrigerated truck. They also find themselves on another journey. Neil Page makes the journey from career minded advertising executive to a more soft hearted person and Dell Griffith realizes that he has been a screw up who annoys people. Eventually the two make it back to Chicago but they not only have completed the journey home they have also completed the journey to a lasting friendship.  Steve martin does an excellent job playing Neil Page a business man in his late thirties early forties who can be a bit of a control freak. Dell Griffith  is played by john Candy.  Who in turn is about the same age. Dell a salesman is more relaxed then Neil. He can be really funny and a disgusting slob at the same time.  Although  I do not recollect the two being in a motion picture before with each other I am glad that they were chosen to act with each other because their interaction with each other is what made the story so interesting.  The reviewer would rate this movie a five out of five star rating.  Though Steve Martin repeatedly dropped the FBomb in one scene it is understandable when you see this well mannered man who has met every inconceivable obstacle n his quest to spend Thanksgiving with his family finally  meet the limit of his patience. It is a classic to show around Thanksgiving time.  The way in which the movie was shot and the acting was done it brought out the highlights in the real funny scenes.  Go see for your self to realize what a great movie it is. Just a reminder the next time your flight is delayed or you have trouble getting a cab things could be worse. You could be traveling with a shower curtain ring salesman named Dell Griffith.".

In the scramble to get home for Thanksgiving and because of a massive snowstorm that closes O'Hare Airport in Chicago and diverts them to Wichita Neal and Del become unlikely travel companions as they hit the road for Chicago in a variety of modes of transportation.As we follow their misadventures this becomes a very funny movie.

Del talks too much and has far too many irritating habits but he is who he is and  as he says  he likes himself and he likes people but there's also a sadness to him that makes you want to know more about him. Martin and Candy played off each other perfectly and there are many absolutely hilarious moments throughout. I think my favourite scene is as they travel the wrong way down the highway. Ultimately the mystery about Del's life and Del's wife is revealed which leads to a very touching scene at the movie's close as Neal is moved to invite Del to his home and family for Thanksgiving.In a movie I enjoyed very much the only thing I didn't like was the scene in which Neal loses his cool with the car rental agent and spews forth an ongoing chain of the fword at her. I realize this scene has to be looked at in context. I realize it presented an interesting view of the character finally losing it but to me  although I'm no prude  it was far too out of character for Neal and too out of place when compared to the rest of the movie. That scene aside though this movie is one of the best comedies that you'll ever see  a mustsee holiday film. 910".

This could also be seen as an 80's version of A Christmas Carol with Neal starting off selfish but by the end he is a completely different man.There is also Del's heartbreaking secret which casts him in a different light too.Highlights include the hysterical scene concerning Neals tirade of swear words directed at a rental car womanNeal finishing a shower only to find Dels used all the towels and the ending.What makes this work is the fact that we have all experiencedalthough granted not to this extent I hopedays where nothing goes right and we have all had big travel delaysso we can relate to Neal's plight.Steve is excellent with a lot of the comedy coming from his priceless reactions to the many mishaps which take place.He and John have a great chemistry and after seeing this you'll think twice about your travel arrangements next time your making a journey.".

This could also be seen as an 80's version of A Christmas Carol with Neal starting off selfish but by the end he is a completely different man.There is also Del's heartbreaking secret which casts him in a different light too.Highlights include the hysterical scene concerning Neals tirade of swear words directed at a rental car womanNeal finishing a shower only to find Dels used all the towels and the ending.What makes this work is the fact that we have all experiencedalthough granted not to this extent I hopedays where nothing goes right and we have all had big travel delaysso we can relate to Neal's plight.Steve is excellent with a lot of the comedy coming from his priceless reactions to the many mishaps which take place.He and John have a great chemistry and after seeing this you'll think twice about your travel arrangements next time your making a journey.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Hughes leaves adolescent angst behind for his first comedy about adults. It is his best comedy bar none. This is not to discard classic works like Sixteen Candles the Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink but Hughes hits pure gold with Planes Trains  Automobiles.It begins in New York as Neal Page Steve Martin is getting done with business but must hurry to catch a plane to Chicago and be with his family for Thanksgiving Dinner. He misses his flight thanks to a shower curtain rod ring salesman Del Griffith John Candy.Then it begins. Dealing with the Thanksgiving rush home they become stranded and decide to trek together across the U.S. using planes then trains then automobiles but the title leaves out use of the bus.Very much like National Lampoon's Vacation the audience can laugh because we can identify with layovers losing wallets messed up car rentals being robbed and all the other travel frustrations. The best thing is we can laugh at it because it is not us.The story comes off as believable even though Murphy's Law seems to apply for every situation. The two players though make the trip worthwhile funny and credible.Steve Martin does depart from his usual comedic lead role to be the straight man. It is refreshing to see him as an uptight and straightlaced jerk instead of the wild and crazy guy he is known for. However he may do something that may make the audience uncomfortable dislike him. He is not one to loathe but more to pity as he comes off as selfrighteous angry selfish and impatient. The real breakthrough performance though is John Candy. Usually plagued with mediocre scripts and being shoved into a supporting role Candy finally shines through as a good sincerehearted person who is socially immature. Candy gives the buffoon earnestness and depth. An audience will love him like loving an immature child hoping him to grow  and being grateful he is not part of our lives.The crowning jewel though is the chemistry between the Candy and Martin. Their talent meshes well together thanks to the direction of Hughes. This all culminates to a dramatic bittersweet ending that will hopefully leave the audience hopeful and tearyeyed.Yes Hughes was the master of teen angst. It is refreshing to see him grow up in more ways than one.".

	schema:reviewBody "You need a special talent like John Hughes to find creativity amidst a torrent of clichs. The premise is simple ancient and grossly overused but Planes Trains And Automobiles is so uproariously funny that I'd chuck all the bygones right out of the window and delve into a bucket of popcorn and invest into this hoot of a comedy. Hughes has always been one of my favorite filmmakers a productive artist of his time and a virtuoso of movies on teenage angst. No matter how hard my day was I'd just watch a John Hughes movie to cheer myself up because he knows how to do it better than anyone else.We open in New York City two days before Thanksgiving. Neal Page Steve Martin a compulsive snob and a marketing executive yawns through a meeting with his bosses. He's desperate to make a flight he's late for so that he could spend Thanksgiving with his family. He been told that he'd 'never make it' a challenge he takes on only to have a cab that he has paid for being stolen from right under his nose. Neal's a frustrated exec he wears neatlycut suits that compliment his grave demeanor. Martin's perfect cast as Neal. He can play a dignified workingman in one frame and an angry elitist in the other. That's what happens when he has his cab nicked. The culprit is Del Griffith John Candy a traveling salesman who sells showerrings who apologizes profusely to an incensed Neal later on when they meet on the flight. He wants to make up for it Neal would rather be left alone. But Del doesn't give up easily. He's talkative friendly and he wants to declare a truce. Neal doesn't want to be friends. But as fate would have it a blizzard prevents them from reaching Chicago where they're headed and they land up in Wichita instead. Del offers to book a room for Neal for the night. Neal doesn't have a choice he agrees. And from there on a series of misadventures and mishaps occur when they try to get home as soon as they can and by any means possible.Planes Trains And Automobiles would never have worked if it wasn't for its characters. Hughes often makes the characters count in his movies an example of which can be found in Ferris Bueller's Day Off and it's no different here. Del could be a character that could prove to be irksome if spent too much time with but here he's nothing short of charming. He's immensely affable like his genial laugh that's disarming and Candy plays him accordingly. In the scene where Neal ticks him off for being boring annoying and distracting Candy's magnificent. He radiates a feeling of hurt but emphatically states that he likes himself for being the person he is. Marvel at how expressive he is in that one scene when his face falls I couldn't help but applaud the skill he showed. Martin's elucidation of Neal Page is a triumph he earns our solicitude though he's rash with Del and never once loses the character. Both Candy and Martin sneak into the skin of their characters like water in soil and they make a hell of a team.The writing is subtle supremely funny and often insightful. The jokes keep pelting the oneliners are winning and the craft is exceptional. My favorite sequence in the movie is when Neal and Del steal a busride and catch a young couple in the heat. The sequence is naturally evocative prompting loud guffaws at the goofiness of the whole comical situation. The movie's loaded with sequences like this and every single one of them is rational. Somehow that makes it funnier still.There is nothing really wrong with Planes Trains And Automobiles except for the fact that it's very predictable and repetitive. You can guess at the very beginning how it's going to end though when Hughes actually gets there you don't want it to. And may I add that Hughes pulls off one of the most moving endings I've witnessed in the recent spew of films.Candy and Martin are terrific in their respective roles. They end up adding the zing that the movie direly required to make a somewhat implausible plot work by playing the characters who mingle with us and stay with us long after the movie ends.Planes Trains And Automobiles is unapologetically a wholesome crowd pleaser that never stops being delightfully goofy and captivating. Consistently hilarious and frequently touching it's the best film of its kind I've had the pleasure to watch. It's also one of the better comedies I've seen in a long time one that does justice to the genre. I can't remember the last time I had laughed out so loud.".
