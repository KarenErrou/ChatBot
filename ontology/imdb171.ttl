I am ranking it 10 out of 10 to redress the unfair balance.You will see by the reviews for this movie already that you are either going to love it or hate it it will be very difficult to feel indifferent about it. And why? Because some people are not going to find this funny. If you haven't laughed once after the first 10 minutes then you might as well turn it off. It's not for you was never intended for you so keep your opinions to yourself and move on to something designed for your more mainstream sense of humor. DO NOT tell everybody else in the World not to watch it because you are denying a potential audience a comedy classic.To say that this is the worst movie ever made as some reviewers have done is preposterous and is just a reflection on the reviewers' taste not a true representation of the movie.I'm a bit fairweather with these recent comedies. I loved Superbad and Pineapple Express was fairly indifferent about 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up and thought Zack  Mire was lame and puerile. As such I was a bit skeptical about this film but I was wrong. This is better than all of the aforementioned because it appeals to my sick sense of humor and does not pull a single punch.This film smashes so many taboos including police brutality date rape mental illness alcoholism and racism. But it doesn't care. None of the above would be seen as any great topics for comedy but this film embraces all as if it is purposely trying to offend. It has clearly succeeded judging by the feedback here. But I loved it. Taboos are there to be exposed and smashed and if you like your comedy to be near the knuckle and ground breaking then you will definitely love this film.Seth is fantastic in the lead role. Very plausible and a definite deviation from his past roles. The supporting cast are also equally brilliant especially his mother and Seth's coworkers. There is also no rationality behind this film so please ignore all the reviewers who claim certain aspects are implausible. Who cares? It is a comedy and the suspension of disbelief is paramount to the viewer's enjoyment.In a nutshell if you are not easily offended like your humor to be in your face and boundary pushing and most importantly fairly sick then you will love this film and laugh out loud throughout.One other thing the soundtrack is absolutely awesome with a great cover version of The Pixies' 'Where is my mind?' during one of the funniest scenes in the film as well as a rocking song by Pyramid a band I'd never heard of during the end credits.One of the best comedies I've seen in recent years up with Bruno and Black Dynamite. And although it may not deserve the 10 out of 10 rating it is so close to comedy perfection.".

Yes this movie has its share of politically incorrect humor and gratuitous violence played up for laughs. But to call it not funny. I simply cannot fathom why anyone did. This movie is a laughoutloud spectacle. Its almost as good in the way that Bad Santa was good. Seth Rogen even plays his character akin to Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver minus the Oscar worthiness and anything that made Travis Bickle a classic character of course I'm not equating Rogen to DeNiro. The rest of the cast exemplified terrific comedic timing especially Ray Liotta. If your looking for laughs this movie is up your ally. Its in the same league as KickAss and Bad Santa for sure. As for the critics well prior to the film's release the stock market crashed. I blame the economy for this one. Times are a little bit better and so is this movie. Give it a watch.".

And as such it is the worst I have seen in several years Fool's Gold comes immediately to mind. It's the dark side of Paul Blart mixed with elements of Taxi Driver Fight Club and American Beauty with none of the intrinsic interest or excellence of any of those films.In fact this makes Running With Scissors feel like a Marx Brothers movie and Zack and Miri Make a Porno look like Citizen Kane. Sorry it has to be said. It is one of the very few comedies in which I felt worse leaving the theater than I did entering.It is a bloated dismal depressing dysfunctional movie about a bloated dismal depressing dysfunctional man Ronnie Barnhardt Seth Rogan a bipolar borderline psychotic security guard at a generic Los Angeles shopping mall. With his equally idiotic coworkers Michael Pena Jesse Plemons John and Matt Yuen he dreams of carrying lethal weapons joining the police force and capturing a serial flasher.When cosmetics salesperson Brandy Anna Faris who brings the same great sense of comedic timing here as she did in House Bunny is flashed Ronnie takes it upon his delusional self to become her protector and solve the crime even though he has no skills for such an endeavor.Plus he's a major ahole to boot. He threatens vendors is a blatant racist terrorizes customers violates security procedures and basically sexually harasses Brandy even forcing her to go out with him and then daterapes her. Yet after all of this he is not once reprimanded by his sappy superior.Not to read too much into this but what mall would keep a security guard around that a has a restraining order out on him by one of the store owners and b tasers some guy for no reason. Wouldn't there be major legal ramifications here? Or am I just a dope for asking? Of course Ronnie lives in a hovel and has to deal with an alcoholic mother Celia Weston so maybe he's not totally at fault.Acting as the anyman for this movie Ray Liotta GoodFellas is LAPD Det. Harrison who plays cruel jokes on the idiot such as leaving him in the middle of South Central and gleefully informing him that he was not accepted into the academy.There's a good reason too as Ronnie blurts out to the police psychologist that he dreams of taking a shotgun and killing everyone. Yeah I want a guy on the force to carry those plans around with him.Then just when we thought the humor could not get any lower the film takes a weird and violent turn as Ronnie's best friend reveals a terrible secret and then he takes on the LAPD for some bizarre reason. All the while a pretty girl at the doughnut counter Nell Collette Wolfe is becoming more attracted to the crazed loser another example of reel life vs. real life.Most of the laughs here were nervous giggles as opposed to the outandout belly ones most movies of this ilk illicit. I found myself smiling during just two short scenes not the greatest endorsement for such a genre. Once again proving that Fbombs  even repeated over and over  or laughing at retarded people do not necessarily make a great comedy. Marketed as a light vulgar laughfest in the vein of Role Models and I Love You Man this dark effort is a truly awful film in every sense of the word even though director Josh Hill The Foot Fist Way attempts to populate it with eccentric Jarmusian characters. Most of these come off like his leading man inept moronic violent and a complete waste of time.Just like the 86 minutes I spent watching this drivel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can easily understand why many people were turned off by this film Its easily one of the darkest comedies i've ever seen. There is some brutal violence use of heroin and even essentially a date rape. But perhaps the darkest element of the story is Ronnie Seth Rogen. The character is so twisted but fear not people this movie IS funny and sometimes extremely. If you have seen Jody Hill's other works The Foot Fist Way and Eastbound and Down and think they're funny then I can almost assure this humor will be right up your alley. But for those who are not fans of dark comedy you may hate it it all depends on your taste. While it may lack originality in its plot it also has a side of Seth Rogen we haven't seen before a more deep layered character that shows he may have the ability to do more dramatic work. I gave the film a 7 out of 10 because of Seth Rogen's performance with a few noteworthy comedic shines from Anna Faris but most of all for the intelligent and hilarious dark humor the film contains. On the con side however the plot was very similar to Paul Blart.".

Even when they don't work under Apatow there is real work wit and earned laughs in what they do and here is a film that is a perfect example of how elemental film techniques can make a movie funny. Music and slow motion work in favor of the main character's mindset but the reactions of his surrounding characters are deadly opposite. He is delusional to the point that he is dangerous. At one point later there is mention of his being a bipolar case but not just to lend clarification to his behavior but more to ground him in a realworld everyman situation which makes his heroic narcissistic delusions all the more unexpectedly genuine.Seth Rogen's Ronnie Barnhardt exemplifies both the oldschool hardass and the modernday dumbass and while he merely defends the domain of Forest Ridge Mall he does so with an aggrandized selfimage and the most brutal of temperaments. If it weren't for those bothersome psychological evaluations he might even be a cop by now. Rather he's an archetype of misled masculine vigor on a mission to stop the flasher who has been threatening his territory.One would imagine it'd be a light storyline one convenient for the cheaper tendencies of SNL or MAD TV yet Rogen and writerdirector Jody Hill extract a subversively funny character study about a depraved man and his perverse perception of what it means to be a hero. In Ronnie's mind to save the day means busting out the Taser with his sidekick a speechdefective Michael Pea by his side to love a woman Anna Faris as funny and foul as ever means essentially committing date rape. He is sexist and racist.There's a good deal of immediate laughs to be had here found in Ronnie's behavior with another character and how they're oblivious to each other in some way or another or how Hard rock music and strutting slomo complement him while onlookers are dumbfounded or confused or shocked. For example Hill gives Ray Liotta his best role in awhile sharply utilizing his intense temperament to make his character funny. But Hill appears more focused on getting under the skin and verging extremities in order to get a better grasp of who Ronnie is and why he behaves the way he does. Perhaps it's Ronnie's bipolar tendencies that propel the plot leading our impassioned protagonist to a downfall and a warped idea of redemption. Ronnie isn't an antihero. He's a hero in his own mind and his own territory and Rogen is more acutely committed to this performance than any before leaping in with profundity and brooding. Therein lies the distinction between the bottomfeeding shenanigans of one Paul Blart and those of Ronnie Barnhardt.The grandest indication that Rogen and Hill have scored something above average is when the authentic jolt and utter hilarity of a peak moment of violence reveals the stunner that everything had led up to that moment within reason if only in Ronnie's line of reasoning. There is always something more rewarding about a comedy that achieves a careful tonal balancing act.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched this film almost half a dozen times so I guess I am part of the Observe and Report cult. All you people giving it one two star reviews...really? Are you that masochistic that you have to write a dissertation on something you hate? This is a great movie that knocks you on your ass with its dark humor and is indeed offensive. In fact I would say if you're not offended in certain scenes then there may be actually something wrong with you. Go see your shrink and talk about it. Despite that there are also scenes that are moving and true to life which make this more than just some exercise in shoddy exploitation. At any rate I love this movie and own a copy if that says anything Why you ask? Well for one thing this is a great movie about a delusional man with bipolar disorder. The film has dream elements where he comes close to realizing his over the top ambitions only to be smacked in the face by societal regulations. On a serious note there are a lot of young men who cannot fit into society and find a deeper purpose for living. The mall seems like the perfect metaphor for what has happened to American society. It is a boring stultifying environment where banality is seen as the highest good and crass consumerism is the almighty God. Certain professions like security guard seem to attract nutballs guys who dream of a police badge and a gun yet have to settle for chasing off skateboarders from the mall parking lot while carrying mace and at most a tazer. Now is the film an indictment of a crazed society and its shiftless youth or is it a nihilistic celebration of recklessness and mental illness? Even after watching it as many times as I have I'm not sure I can come to any stunning conclusion. Its opened ended and while I know that can infuriate people looking for closure and worse a message its the truth about this shocking and original film. Let me say that you owe it to yourself to check it out. When truly stupid comedies are abundant usually ones about young men smoking pot and trying to get laid its refreshing to see a film that dares to be wildly different in true punk rock fashion.".

	schema:reviewBody "An anonymous flasher exposes himself to shoppers in the Forest Ridge Mall parking lot. The head of mall security Ronnie Barnhardt Seth Rogen makes it his mission to catch the flasher. He is helped by Charles Jesse Plemons Dennis Michael Pena and the Yuen twins John Yuan and Matthew Yuan. Ronnie's dream girl Brandi Anna Faris is flashed the next day and she becomes hysterical. Detective Harrison Ray Liotta comes and takes over the situation this makes Ronnie very angry. Ronnie decides to take the case into his own hands.A incredibly disgusting film where Seth Rogen is at his funniest but a great performance by Rogen cannot save this crude film. Observe and Report is a very dark and unpleasant experience. A clich thing to say but I found myself looking at the clock waiting for this film to end. Besides for Rogen Observe and Report has very few laughs. The perfect example of why you can't base and entire films laughs on dirty humor. Some of the most unfortunate and unwanted nudity I have even had to sit through. Jody Hill tries to shock and awe viewers will dark humor and a unique storyline but instead creates and unfortunate film. The most surprising thing about this film is that even while the film is very tough to sit through Rogen's performance still almost carries the film.Jody Hill is the cocreator and executive producer of the HBO series Eastbound and Down. Eastbount and Down has dark humor and a very outrageous plot as like Observe and Report but Observe and Report is not able to link together as well. Hill's first film The Foot Fist Way was seen by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell who bought the distribution rights. And also developed a cult following. Hill was allowed on the set of Knocked Up and he fell in love with Seth Rogen's acting style. He became even more of a Rogen fan after the release of Superbad. Hill both directed and wrote the script for Observe and Report. Unfortunately it just didn't have as great of an effect as his previous work. Observe and Report's script is very poorly made. Hill's direction is well done but the film is an absolute mess.Seth Rogen's performance is one of the best and hilarious performances from a comedy since probably Steve Carell's in 40 Year Old Virgin. Besides for Rogen there are no other performances worth mentioning. Anna Faris as Brandi is a very untalented performance. Ray Liotta as Detective Harrison is nothing special no lines or scenes worth mentioning. One performance does not keep a film in motion. Each time Rogen is off the screen this film just crashes and burns.Observe and Report only grossed about 25 million in the box office one of the lowest grossing films that Rogen has stared in. This film had plenty of hype. Rogen as the lead the cocreator of Eastbound and Down as the director and also starring Ray Liotta. But like so many comedy films it disappointed. It seems like each year there are more and more gross out comedies that are released. Hopefully this film will help people realize that these films very rarely work but probably not. The amount of awful nudity in this film will make you have to check and make sure you are not at a Jackass film. Observe and Report is a film you need to brace yourself to sit through. A film Rogen fans will want to pass on and if you are a Jody Hill fan you too will be disappointed.".

This cringeworthy narrative offers little less.So here's the deal Seth Rogan manchild comedian of bromance comedies of varying quality the fun Pineapple Express the overrated but decent Knocked Up is Ronnie head of mall security cussing and butting his way into conversations and living with his drunken mother. A streaker plagues his mall it gets broken into at night and the local cops come to investigate which offends Ronnie's sense of grandeur no really this is a plot point. Trying to reclaim his sordid turf and get what can possibly pass as the most unattractive woman in screen history I think even guys who staple Carmen Electra pictures to every inch of their walls would find this woman horrid and vacuous Ronnie goes on the offensive... by offending people needlessly? Because it's supposed to be offensive??? Because that's funny?????? Apparently? I don't even know. All I know is that every decision the character makes is terrible he never grows and develops as a person and he's not even an antihero but a truly poorly presented everyman who is not anything like any man because anybody would have at least ten times the social grace this guy does. Again laughing at his social ineptitude could potentially be funny to a point but this movie makes the fact that he truly is incapable of controlling himself into The Joke which means that we are in fact being asked to laugh at the mentally underdeveloped who lives with his alcoholic mother. Yeah.And well the rest of the screen is filled up with jerks and idiots too. The only nearly realistic character of the bunch is Ray Liotta's Detective Harrison who is constantly being given crap by everybody because he's doing his job and Ronnie's getting in his way.Have you ever seen a kid break out into a howling frenzy in a store while his mother shouts profanity at him? Did you think that was funny? Well then this movie might be funny to you. But if it was sad and uncomfortable to behold then be prepared for 1hr30min of it.

I was so disappointed with this movie. It finished and I thought to myself That was it? I didn't see the point to this movie. A bloke works at the mall wants to be a police officer goes about being a police officer doesn't become a police officer tries to get the girl of his dreams to fall in love with him doesn't get the girl of his dreams to fall in love with him. This movie has taken different story lines from different movies and it's just meant kaput! Movies like this they only put the funny bits in the trailers and everything else is rubbish. I'm a big fan of Seth Rogen but this movie is just an insult to him and all he stands for. Don't make another movie like this Jody Hill. Just don't.".

I was so disappointed with this movie. It finished and I thought to myself That was it? I didn't see the point to this movie. A bloke works at the mall wants to be a police officer goes about being a police officer doesn't become a police officer tries to get the girl of his dreams to fall in love with him doesn't get the girl of his dreams to fall in love with him.

	schema:reviewBody "That would be a better title for this movie. I'm sure you've probably heard that comparison before and you will probably continue to hear it because it is extremely accurate. I went into this movie expecting a dark angry comedy. I got the dark and angry. The comedy fell woefully short. I don't believe I laughed once during the movie. Every scene that is supposed to be comedic falls flat and drags on and on and on. The characters that are supposed to be comedic are just annoying the drunk mother the slutty cosmetic girl the lisping sidekick. I actually found myself checking my watch during the movie to see how much more I had to endure. All of this could have been redeemed if the filmmakers had just stuck the landing. The ending is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen and completely ignores any form of reality even the one set up in the film. Our delusional Mall Cop returns to the mall after being fired for beating up real police officers and is flashed by the mall pervert. After an overlong slow motion chase Travis Bickle wannabe takes a short cut and shoots the flasher at near point blank range. He then refuses to call paramedics for the gravely wounded perv opting instead to take him to the police station in his security guard golf cart. At the police station Bickle marches the bleeding and still naked perv past about a dozen uniformed officers and detectives to claim his moment of glory for catching the perv when the cops couldn't and then walks away and gets rehired as head of mall security. Ridiculous. Avoid this watch Taxi Driver instead. It avoids lame attempts a comedy opting instead to be a real character study of a very sick and damaged individual.".

	schema:headline " Complete Garbage. A disappointment in every way...made to shock but instead bores you to death and makes you want to run from the theater";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm definitely not going to be the first person to jump on the Seth Rogen fan club bus. I don't dislike the guy he's had his moments but I think he is over rated as a whole. However Observe and Report seemed to be the only thing playing at the time so I went to see it. Usually in a mainstream film you can find SOMETHING redeemable but with Observe and Report it is such tried and true garbage that I would literally never choose to sit through it ever again. I can't hardly believe that anyone could actually like this film or anything about it although I know everyone has different tastes. At the very least even with a bad comedy you can find yourself chuckling at the stupidity but I can guarantee that I sat through this without ever cracking a smile. If I wasn't so vehemently dead set against walking out of movies in an actual theater I would have spared myself the hour and a half of torture. The whole concept of the film is incredibly stupid but that doesn't make for a bad comedy. In this case the concept the cast the story the plot the jokes just every piece of this film just simply blows.Seth Rogen has talent it would be hard to argue with that. He is a good comedian and I think he has some great roles ahead of him. I also think he's a child at heart and truly just likes to goof off. Unfortunately that doesn't always translate to watchable movies and Observe and Report is one giant goof off and Rogen's credibility drops starring in this trash. Anna Faris is no stranger to this type of slapstick gross out stupidity having done four Scary Movie films. Still she has stepped it up with a really cute comedy like House Bunny but this just sets her back completely. Her character is stupid and disgusting and just completely vapid. The chemistry with her and Rogen is ridiculous and barely existent. Ray Liotta joins the cast and maybe potentially lifts the film from being a big fat zero. Liotta is good as a wise cracking annoyed Police Detective. He has better chemistry making fun of and getting the better of Rogen's stupider than stupid mall cop. I could discuss the supporting cast most of them are Rogen's sidekicks but they don't add to the story and while they aren't really awful they aren't worth mentioning.One of the positive reviews I read on IMDb that still boggles my mind stated that Observe and Report was darker than a typical goof ball comedy. This comedy is not dark it's twisted and stupid but that doesn't equal dark. Jody Hill directs and writes the film...both reasons why he should be banned from Hollywood. He has very little experience behind the camera and his big break to the big screen is a disaster in my opinion. The last thing you want to do is watch this with anyone who is easily offended or doesn't like gross out comedies. When Seth Rogen has sex with a vomiting nearly passed out Anna Faris you won't be laughing. Nor will the last five minutes of the film which features a very unattractive Randy Gambill running completely naked around the screen. Skip this unless you really are an enormous Seth Rogen fan although this might change your mind. Observe and Report is garbage. 110".

I like Seth Rogan and Anna Faris and I like this genre too.Instead of the funny goofy and escapist trip I expected I saw a very sad and even depressing movie. It seemed cruel that the director was asking us to laugh at such human misery. Ronnie Barnhardt Rogen's character was not just some caricature of a wannabe copper we could laugh at. He was genuinely pathetic. I felt horribly sad and sorry for the poor guy. And his mother played expertly by Celia Weston was such a loonytunes and pathetic creature that it was difficult to watch her. I chuckled mildly twice. The packed cinema I was in laughed mildly a few more times but those sitting near me seemed more disturbed and uncomfortable and yes even embarrassed than amused. I heard many soft groans and Ewww more than once.Maybe there is something about mall cop comedies that makes them impossible to pull off successfully? The last one a few months ago was absolutely not funny. It was a dud. But at least it wasn't this heartwrenchingly depressing.Noticing the rave reviews and comments in the first few posts in this forum it made me wonder about the authenticity and genuineness of the authors. I may be completely offbase in which case I can only apologise. After all we all have different tastes and if this film is your cup of tea then by all means enjoy it and share your views. But I must confess a bit of disbelief when I read the first couple of pages filled with glowing reports. Come on!!! Even if I had liked this and found it in my heart to laugh at these demented and sad creatures I still would not have said Movie of the century! and similar hyperbole. But maybe that's just me.

The setup Seth Rogen plays a shopping mall head of security who takes his job a little too seriously. When a flasher makes a spree through the mall's parking lot and a robbery takes place a couple of days later Rogen feels dutybound to find criminals responsible. He becomes territorial when veteran detective Ray Liotta begins investigating the two crimes and unwittingly makes an ass of himself trying to show him up. He also gains the confidence to pursue his dream girl cosmetics associate Anna Farris a hilarious supporting role rather than the colead the marketing suggests. But it seems that the harder Rogen tries the worse things get for him.Visually sophomore director Jody Hill shows a Wes Anderson influence on occasion the takes are shorter cuts more frequent but there are a lot of stationery shots and a bright pleasant color palette. The pacing of the movie is excellent the jokes intrinsic to the forward movement of the narrative moving along at a chuckleaminute pace.The humor will certainly not be to everyone's taste. This is a nihilistic comedy. The supporting players provide some reliable laughs but there is not a setuppunchline format to guide viewers through. And Rogen is dragged through the mud quite a bit largely through his own oblivious behavior. It is a little painful at times but the more Rogen is dragged down the more engaging the character becomes. By the end of the film I knew a Hollywood ending not forthcoming. It seemed the only plausible outcome was something depressing and ugly and any kind of happy conclusion for the protagonist would ring of inauthenticity. I was wrong it turns out. The closing scenes are gutbusting and satisfying and in keeping with the overall feeling of the movie.I stop short of calling it groundbreaking but Observe and Report has a much fresher and more original feel to it than most studio comedies. I recommend it wholeheartedly.".

Unforgivable are the wild erratic shifts in tone throughout the acts beginning as a lowbrow comedy about a dimwitted mall cop who's intent on capturing a streaker and by the third act the tone shifts randomly between witnessing random acts of brutality to having a slowmotion chase through the mall with a fat man with his junk swinging around. If the film had been clear in it's tone it might have been less grating but as it stands it is a complete misfire of poorly directed miscast and illpaced scenes held together by the flimsiest of plots with one of the worst denouements I have ever seen. Do yourself a huge favour and go out and rent Taxi Driver instead  a film classic that deserves to be paid homage to but not in the way that the director of Observe and Report did.".

I liked Hill's Foot Fist Way and this was something like that but even wilder. Seth Rogen plays a hyped up mall security guard who wants nothing more than to be able to carry a gun and carry off Anna Faris' charactera hot counter girl at the mall.While it will receive obvious comparisons with Paul Blart Mall Cop the world of Observe and Report makes Blart's look like Rodeo Drive on a warm spring day. Hill has a gift for mining comedy out of the mundane and he effectively populates his mall with a hilarious food court of human pain.Rogen adds a surprising depth to his usual comic genius as the bipolar Ronnie. Faris is a disgusting delightone of the few actresses who can remain attractive even while she's throwing up. Her performance reminds us why she is one of the best comediennes working today.Ray Liotta brings his distinct brand of overthetop hilarity to the role of Detective Harrison. Patton Oswalt Michael Pena and Azis Ansari are a perfect supporting cast. While most of Observe's key male demographic will be horrified to find the graphic nudity is primarily of the nonfemale persuasion it effectively sets up a world where anything can and does happen. This is perhaps Hill's greatest strengthhe's willing to push the boundaries of comedy to the very edge resulting in a fresh daring voice that will leave audiences sore from laughter.".

	schema:reviewBody "To start off with I actually liked this movie and at first I couldn't understand why some many people hated but upon reflection i can see what some people reacted to so harshly.One thing I liked about the film is the simple story or more accurately the atmosphere. M. Night has always been better at creating a mood than fleshing out a story but the premise of Lady in the Water works for me It about people reacting to a fairy tale happening in real life. This concept probably put a lot of people off the fact of the matter is this concept hasn't been used a lot but it has been done before i.e. Peter Weir's The Last Wave a deeper and more philosophical film and people aren't used to it. Like I said I liked it but most of my friends thought it was stupid.The main thing that people hated was M. Night's own acting in the film and on this I agree. He was without a doubt the worst thing in the film. It was a disgusting example of selfindulgence and selfimportance and more than that he's just a terrible actor and he should stop.The one thing that I really had a hard time stomaching was the extended sequences with the party band Silvertide. They were so awful I wanted to walk out of the movie. Picture a blonde version of The Black Crows with even less talent ripping through and fking up a version of Dylan's Maggie's farm.Those few things aside the rest of the cast was great I thought the story was simple and decent enough the film critic part with Bob Balaban was funny but M. Night was asking for it with that one and the movie as a whole was entertaining.M. Night started out as the new golden boy of Hollywood with The Sixth Sense but many have felt he's lost his touch. The truth is he hasn't lost his touch he just hasn't grown as a director. With The 6th Sense Unbreakable Signs The Village and now The Happening he keep tilling the same field. it's getting old. The 6th Sense was great mostly because it was fresh Unbreakable was entertaining for me at least due to the comic book references but Signs The Happening and especially The Village were just plain terrible. Lady In The Water was a nice diversion from his formula but it's getting tired. Perhaps M. Night would benefit from directing a script written by someone else and not built around some moronic twist at the end and most definitely not acting in it.".

I who usually disagrees with most audiences at least thoroughly enjoyed this film. The storyline itself is rather ridiculous I must say. Some girl shows up in a pool? She's a whata narf? I went into the movie thinking I would hate it but I came out knowing that I had seen a work of art. That's right. It was art.First of all it's a good family film with enough tense moments to keep you watching and enough laughoutloud moments to calm you down. It was refreshing for once to see a film with good clean humour. The dialogue was not necessarily hilarious but the actors especially Paul Giamatti Cleveland delivered the lines extremely well.The acting was tremendously well done also. Paul Giamatti is always fantastic and while Bryce Dallas Howard seemed to act in the same manner as she did in The Village she was still convincing. The ensemble cast worked well together. Some might bash M. Night for casting himself in a notsocameo role but he proved that he can actually act! No his performance will not win him an Oscar nor should it but I think there is definite talent there. I hope to see him in bigger roles in films not his own.The plot had many twists maybe too many but no matter. I kept trying to guess what was going to happen but it I was always wrong. It was quite interesting.What most made this film a work of art was the directing. M. Night has a rare talent that will go completely under the radar for this film because no one will see it. The camera angles were inventivethat's right inventive. I may be one of the few who actually cares about camera angles and how a scene looks but it looked great. The final product was polished.I truly believe this film is M. Night's best work. He made the story up himself wrote a screenplay that made us laugh smile cringe and jump just a little and directed a great ensemble cast including himself. Quite a feat. So before everyone starts ranting about how stupid the storyline is or how sonotscary the film is just appreciate the uniqueness of the film and remember what makes this film good. Forget the crazy story. It's everything else!".

This is one of very few writerdirectors who actually strive to bring something new to the cinema on each different outing.So how was the film? Good. Dare I say great? If you like his films this one will definitely hit you deep. You'll put it at the top of your M. Night List and be glad to have it in your DVD collection later this year.First the acting. We all know Night has a habit of picking actors from the same pool. People he knows trusts and has worked with before. Willis has helmed two of his films while Joaquin another two. This will be Bryce Dallas Howards second as well. We are used to Night writing his lead characters as more of a shadow of a man that once was. A tragic figure this is no different in Lady In The Water.Giamatti plays Heep very very well. But because of Giamatti's inclusion into Nights' world we see things much lighter. Willis Gibson and Phoenix had a habit of turning everything dark and dreary. And while Giamatti is still a tragic figure he is eager to believe and more than willing to take the word of a half naked girl in his home. I personally believe that he is the greatest actor Night has worked with. And the result? A much lighter film. Thank God.This is a fantasy. Not a horror not a film with a twist spoiler there is none which is good because a twist would have put Night into an early grave. As a fantasy a bed time story Night treats us like children. Characters speak their inner dialogues creatures with interesting names plague us at every turn and the residents of this apartment complex are as interesting and comic as they are important.There is still the important Night message Purpose. We all have one. We all are meant to be somebody. Now all we have to do is figure that out.Even the intro reads like a children's' book illustrations dance about in order to create a younger element to this tale.The plot is simple. Nymphs beasts guilds healers etc. Almost like a roleplaying video game in a sense.The music and cinematography? Night kept his allstar team and the project was helmed and sculpted beautifully.The faults? I dare say Night could have done with less characters. They all seemed important but it crowded the screen and left us with a question Is this that persons' only purpose? That's sad.But have fun with this film. It's a treat as rare as Nights' films are.Night brings a world of reality into a world of dreams and the saddest point of the film was when we had to wake up.".

Howard  a very unusual looking and uniquely pretty woman  is shot so beautifully that it is very difficult to take your eyes off of her. M.

I have been up and down with him since the beginning of his career enjoying his early films very much disliking Signs and being impressed with the Village. I believe that with the Village and LITW M.

	schema:reviewBody "M Night Shyamalaan is an excellent filmmaker. OK the twist in The Village was obvious after minutes but it was a film that did not deserve some of the lashings it received. But 'Lady In The Water' is a different story. It is a film that fails in everything it's trying to be.Primarily it's trying to be a family fantasy adventure movie and I cannot imagine what kind of child the primary audience for this genre is not going to be bored out of their mind from the off. The reason it fails is Night and Night alone. Again he has made a slow burning dialogue heavy movie set completely in reality. Where this film should be bright lively fun exciting magical it is instead dull this is the worst work Chris Doyle's done lifeless turgid bland and dare I say boring. The world of the movie is inappropriate for the genre it's living in.The reason that this style doesn't work is that the whole point of the movie is that's it's a fantastical bedtime story yet it's devoid of anything fantastical. This film should be set in a world like ours but not ours. Night  not everything in your imagination can happen in Philadelphia! This movie also feels like it's only ever gone thru two drafts. First draft was a straight up bedtime story which Night has read back and realised man this doesn't work... at all. It's terrible so he's written in a whole layer of character allegedly... horrifically inaccurate caricature's more accurate and dialogue who are there solely to justify how bad some things are. sadly he doesn't seem to have read draft 2 to realise that the layers justifying how rubbish everything is are even worsely executed meaning the script is two layers of h1t on top of each other.And then you have the complete audacity of the man in casting himself as the man who will essentially write the second bible. This would be ego gone insane if he was actually any good but his performance is the one in the movie that really isn't anywhere near what it needs to be. There's a moment when the character finds out what his fate will be a scene which an actor of quality would have been able to wrench your heart with but a moment where Night actually looks like he's realised the film he's made could destroy his career although I hope not! Man I could go on and on from the backstory being explained to you chunk at a time for no reason other than to flesh out the idea beyond what it ever deserved in such a way that it feels like Night's rewriting the rules of his own film as he goes because he's never had any solid idea of what the rules are at the start to the film critic who's only film criticism is it sucked which instantly destroys the attempt to set him up as an arrogant highbrow critic he also gets possibly the worst cinematic death ever to how blatantly obvious the red herrings are.I genuinely cannot see what anyone can see positively about this movie as a whole unless they are so sure Night's a genius they cannot see beyond the name to the film that's actually there.".

For one thing it's boring something none of his other movies were. Here we have a sloppily unstructured mess of a film filled to the brim with incoherent bedtime story mythology that changes from one minute to the next so even if you try and follow the world of the story your efforts will only be met with frustration. The film's flaws are many and as others have and will point them out with much more dexterity than me I'll simply list the films greatest foibles.1 Shyamalan casts HIMSELF as a John the Baptist character who will inspire a great leader who will change everything from a hastily constructed presumable political treatise entitled of all things The Cookbook. Give me a break! As someone who styles himself as a modern day Hitchcock M. Night should take a page from that man's book and continue to play cameo roles not central ones.2 His supporting characters are a mishmash of ethnic and cultural stereotypes. The Asian student who attends university but cannot string together a coherent English sentence. Of course the otherworldly mythology is the remnant of some vaguely Eastern legend based on truth. The old Jewish woman is tackily dressed and her husband is always in the bathroom. Please.3 The filmmovie critic is one of the ONLY interesting and rounded characters and Shyamalan kills him off as he rattles off trite contrivances. This character's appearance seems like a defensive selfconscious way to preempt the critical panning of this film. When a writer forces one of his characters to go on the defensive in dialogue you know something has got to be wrong with a movie.4 Shyamalan continues his now hackneyed convention of having a protagonist who's suffered tremendous loss in the form of familial death. Enough Already. Paul G is a great actor the unnecessary back story about a dead family and a lost medical practice trite and out of place.The list goes on and on but suffice it to say this movie is a waste of celluloid or hard drive space if you'd prefer. Avoid like plague.".

Night Shyamalan has established the ending as the high point of his films I was particularly watching the final moments here. Disappointingly Shyamalan delivers a few very weak very easy to spot twists tied up in a Hollywood Happy Ending.I've nothing against happy endings but with Shyamalan I expect the ending whatever type it may be to have quite a punch. The rest of the movie has the quality we've come to expect from Shyamalan. Tight direction angles and shots that not only look good but also become part of the storytelling and a layered script all add up to a fun and very interesting ride. Unfortunately the ride runs out of gas rather than coming to a final destination.Shyamalan takes a good stab at the fantasy genre here and doesn't waste any time establishing belief amongst the characters. They all quickly accept and then begin to act upon the proposition that Story is a real life fairytale creature come to benefit them and mankind as a whole. Their belief seems too abrupt but it's clear that Shyamalan wanted to dive right into the story. I would have liked just a little more cynicism from the humans though. If he had set the story in the past their immediate acceptance may have been more plausible. But in current day Philadelphia? I just don't see that many folks accepting a fantasy being at face value.The writing is a good bit more humorous than his past scripts. There are a good many chuckles and even a few laugh out loud moments. Giamatti is in a role tailor made for him and he carries it with no problems. Howard shows a suitable sense of wonder and innocence as Story. The rest of the cast a fairly large group of characters are solid as well. Shyamalan writes himself into his largest role to date and does quite well.Overall I can't say it's a bad movie. The Shyamalan quality alone puts this above most of the competition. However he has set himself a pretty high standard with his earlier films and this one falls short.".

Instead look at this movie for the message of hope it leaves you with or the humor that abounds the great acting involved or even the amazing visual style and suspense. but don't just sit in the theater waiting to be surprised your just wasting your time and missing the point of a really good movie.".

It's got some great scares but overall it will be enjoyed more if you know ahead of time your not going to be sitting on the edge of your seat.The theme of finding your purpose definitely is poignant in this day and age I love all the self reflexive humor as far as story structure goes too.SFX were decent not awe inspiring but good for what was required. The film is really about the characters though and their arcs. I'd say the film is much more for the introspective crowd than the hardcore comic kids who want plenty of screams.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard being M. Night Shyamalan. Year after year his works of uncompromised genius are poorly received by theatergoers and film critics alike. Even Disney didn't want to make his latest film Lady in the Water fearing that it was poorly written featured too large a role for the writerdirector and contained an embarrassingly selfindulgent attack at his detractors the crrritics. And as much as I hate to agree with Disney they were absolutely right.The story as convoluted as you've come to expect from the man is not the main problem here. Sure it's chockfull of narfs tarturic and poorly drawn stereotypes but the larger issue for me was the cringeinducing selfindulgence that runs rampant throughout the film. For instance Shyamalan plays the role of an author misunderstood in his time who will one day influence a boy destined to become the president of the United States. Selffulfilling prophecies anyone? His acting is embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious in turns and his reactions to pivotal plot points had me longing for the brief campy cameos of years past.While I can understand M. Night's desire to respond to the unenlightened critics that failed to see the staggering brilliance of his previous works one has to question the response itself. Shyamalan is multitasking here attempting to transport his audience through the magical realism of his selfproclaimed bedtime story while simultaneously denouncing his critics for trashing the gospel of M. Night. In the end we're left with a fairy tale too aware of itself to fully envelop us and a pseudomanifesto too delusional and selfimportant to inspire us in any way. In the end Shyamalan made a film that can really only be enjoyed by himself. It's just a shame that the likes of Paul Giamatti Bob Balaban and Freddy Rodriguez have to go down with the Good Ship Shyamalan.".

It hasn't deserved the shafting it's getting.Lady in the Water has a magical feel to it. It's a bedtime story put on film. Like a fairy tale. There's good guys bad guys danger and mystic. What's not to love? It's not like his other films though I think each one has been kinda different anyway. Unbreakable which I didn't like at all the first time I saw it I actually enjoyed the second time through. There was something about the way in which he put the Willis character against the Jackson character. It was like.. watching a comic book. And while it wasn't the glorified sorta.. SupermanBatman sorta.. bright colours.. big powers.. that you get from lots of comics.. it was subtle and watching it again I actually thought really fascinating.Anyway.. Sixth Sense was another one that you almost enjoy more the second time through. You watch it this time knowing the twist and notice that Bruce Willis after he gets shot only ever talks to the Osmund character. You don't notice that the first time.And I just loved the Village. Flat out.I think what makes his films so enjoyable to me are the subtle things. Things you might not catch til the second time through. But I loved Lady in the Water the first time through. Just as I did the Village. It was an awesome story. Sweet engaging well acted and just a little surreal. But hey if you have totally forgotten what it was like to be a kid and enjoy a story then yea you might not like it. ".

The atmosphere and vibe that he created along with a clever plot and a twist ending made moviegoers everywhere realize the importance of Shyamalan. He to some extent created a cult following.Now four movies later many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense. With the OKatbest movie Unbreakable people were wondering if he was just a onehitwonder director. Then with Signs there was some hope that he would make a comeback.But then he released The Village. After he lost thousands of fans due to that horrendous movie he attempts at making another good movie. He most certainly fails.The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in an Apartment complex. He as the super notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. You see M. Night created an entire Bed Time Story about how land people used to coexist with the people of the Blue World the ocean. These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure like water as the Super points out. To help out the greedy people huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land and they must confront a Chosen One no really that is how the put it and show them the way. The way the chosen one is directed will end up helping the land people as a whole.The Chosen One is of course M. Night himself. He can write direct produce and now act. He must be the chosen one.Anyways there are wolves that aren't wolves but are Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them. These Scants attack people from the Blue World but not the land. But there are rules. The night that the Snarf lady of the blue world The main Lady returns to the blue world the cannot attack them. If they do these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. But normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is.So now the protagonist Cleveland must find people to help him.You see there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer the Guardian the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can... or else it wont work or something.And the moral is that no one knows who they are. I'm serious.Anyways the main bulk of the movie is Cleveland looking for people who can help and being wrong a lot. And then he keeps stuttering. And it is annoying.This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. Many of the shots are out of focus and hurt your eyes. And then there were the random shots like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying. And there were a lot of unnecessary close ups.The writing is by far the worst in any movie. The Interpreter figures out what to do by looking at cereal boxes. I am not kidding. It hurt me inside when it happened.The acting was decent by many but some of the people should not be actors. M. Night was pretty good but his lines were kept at a minimum.Despite the absurdity of the Bed Time Story every single person Cleveland told it to believed it immediately. And that is about 15 people. Just imagine someone telling you that a human that looks like everyone else... that doesn't even have gills lives in the water. Nope not happening.The only good thing I could find was the music... and only the last song. A few of the other songs were out of place and unnecessary. But the song during the climax was very well composed.M. Night should in my opinion stop directing and maybe pick up a different hobby. Like not directing. Or writing.Overview This movie is in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was but never laughed at the socalled 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you like pain.Final grade 31000".

That's part of the point of the movie.The introduction of this movie is done in cave drawings. It's a fitting opening and a good clue that this movie is about stories. No not modern film which many critics and audiences today think is about pushing boundaries and constantly doing something 'new'. This movie is about the good old fashioned story. The reason why our ancient ancestors sat around fires and told them and their ability to inspire and save souls.There isn't anything truly new about it it has roots in the classic fairy tales and epic poems of antiquity other than the fact that it dares to be a great film made in the mondern era in spite of being littered with elements of the now despised classical story which apparently isn't good enough for modern film makers anymore.The thing about these classic stories and the one that Shaymalan is attempting to tell is that they have a purpose and strive to inspire society and humanity as a whole. They lead people to do great things and make us all feel better in the end where most modern 'stories' feel more like egotistical attempts of artists to make themselves feel great and leave us in awe of their great greatness.Christopher Doyle lends some excellent shots to this film which some how manage to make a scene of an every day loser frigthenedly warding off a werewolf type monster with a pool skimmer seem exceptionally epic. At the same time it helps the story for me at least pull those same strings that great stories like Gilgamesh and the Aeneid pull.I saw this film the day it opened and I was delighted. I came home as is my habit and read all the reviews. A good section of this movie is directed at attacking assanine jaded film critics who think their opinions are authoratitive it depicts them as being the ruiners of the classic story and so all of the assanine jaded and authoratative film critics seem to have panned it.No one seemed really sure what the movie was about but were all quick to pan M. Night as being arrogant for casting himself in the role of a writer destined to change the world. They ironically claim that he was being arrogant completing unable to fathom that their own presumptions about why he cast himself in that role could in fact be a good deal more arrogant...I'll have to admit that I've been the jaded film critic before but one I came out of this one I remembered why I've always loved stories and why they don't' always have to be new and fit into some silly sense of reality.".

They lead people to do great things and make us all feel better in the end where most modern 'stories' feel more like egotistical attempts of artists to make themselves feel great and leave us in awe of their great greatness.Christopher Doyle lends some excellent shots to this film which some how manage to make a scene of an every day loser frigthenedly warding off a werewolf type monster with a pool skimmer seem exceptionally epic. At the same time it helps the story for me at least pull those same strings that great stories like Gilgamesh and the Aeneid pull.I saw this film the day it opened and I was delighted. I came home as is my habit and read all the reviews. A good section of this movie is directed at attacking assanine jaded film critics who think their opinions are authoratitive it depicts them as being the ruiners of the classic story and so all of the assanine jaded and authoratative film critics seem to have panned it.No one seemed really sure what the movie was about but were all quick to pan M. Night as being arrogant for casting himself in the role of a writer destined to change the world. They ironically claim that he was being arrogant completing unable to fathom that their own presumptions about why he cast himself in that role could in fact be a good deal more arrogant...I'll have to admit that I've been the jaded film critic before but one I came out of this one I remembered why I've always loved stories and why they don't' always have to be new and fit into some silly sense of reality.";

	schema:reviewBody "Has M. Knight Shyamalan lost his mind? Is he a mad genius or just loopy? Has he created a masterpiece or a mess? These are the questions I'm still grappling with after watching THE LADY IN THE WATER. This is most interestingly beautiful confusing and downright strange films I've have ever seen. Wow trying to come up with words to explain what's going on in my mind after watching this film is impossible. I'm not sure if I've seen the future of the cinema or the end of a popular director's career. But I do know that THE LADY IN THE WATER cannot be ignored.I think walking into this film I had many preconceived notions. I know what an M. Knight Shyamalan film is or at least what it's supposed to be. But THE LADY IN THE WATER challenges every one of those notions. There's no surprise ending there are very few scares and the film feels sloppy halfhearted overly confusing and I understand why most will dismiss it. This is a movie that can't quite be nailed down and since the film bucks any and all convention. It's easy to find the conventional flaws everywhere.The acting is disjointed the plot is a mess the dialogue is overly simple the story is far too complicated and it all combines into something that seems pieced together on the fly. It feels almost as if Shyamalan has drawn a line in the sand. This line is all logic. This line is how far he expects us to go and then out of nowhere the line suddenly falls apart. Shyamalan pushes us so past the line it's easy to just give up. I think the line comes at a different point for each of us. The line disappeared to me when the little boy begins to read cereal boxes. It is so weird so out of left field. This was at that point in which I had to decide if I should give up any semblance of logic and just give in to the sheer absurdity of it or whether I should give up and pan it. Where that lines falls with you may decide if you have a positive reaction to the film or not. The plot is simple or maybe not. A Narf named Story Bryce Dallas Howard shows up in a pool at The Cove and apartment community in Philadelphia. What's a Narf? Well it's kind of like a mermaid with human feet or maybe more like an angel or a muse that lives underwater both would be appropriate. Anyway Story is rescued by The Cove's resident superintendent Cleveland Heep Paul Giamatti. Story is looking for a writer who's written work will cause a positive change in the world forever. On that trail Cleveland must protect Story from an evil creature bent on destroying her. But what is this movie exactly? It is a bedtime story come to life. It's a fanciful yarn a child's story and a wild imagination run amok. Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale it's not a terribly cohesive and demands that the audience put the pieces together. I liken it to the weird tales I created with my action figures as a kid or a nonsense story that a first grader may try to write. It's not designed to be pulled apart just experienced at that moment. None of the pieces quite fit a lot of times if feels as if the film is grasping for straws. Sensing that it's lost most of the audience it gives into its oddness and it revels in it. But is that by design?The other side of the coin is that this is a badly made movie. It's the wild ranting of an over zealous personality. The first credit you see as the film comes to a close is Written Produced and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan and since he's been so successful maybe this film is an example of what happens when you allow a director too much room and no editorial comment from the studio. Maybe this is a selfindulgent vanity piece a sloppy mess of a movie that would have been easily dismissed had it not been created by Shyamalan himself. Honestly I don't know where I fall. I think I want to see the movie again. But I like the notion that this could be a step in the right direction for film as a whole. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time. I'd hate to realize that there is nothing there because it would rob that odd sense of madcap joy I experienced with the film.THE LADY IN THE WATER is the perfect remedy for what's wrong in Hollywood. Even if you hate every single moment of it it encourages strong reactions. Whether that reaction is confusion anger or awe this film cannot be easily ignored. So at this moment I think I will argue that THE LADY IN THE WATER is a brilliant film. That Shyamalan will get ribbed for it now but will later be rewarded with a strong cult following. It's easily the best film I've seen all year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of M. Night ever since the first film I saw of his SIGNS. After that I was a HUGE fan...I had to see the others. While SIGNS had always been my favorite I love how he blended moving stories with thriller aspects. After the critics bashed the VILLAGE which I found to be a very well made movie I wondered if he could recover or not. And here is is answer.This movie much like the other ones is a theme movie that goes deeper than nymphs ghosts or creatures in the woods outside. This movie explores Purpose a theme we don't hear from much from movies. Paul Giamatti is fantastic and real in this movie and that's why he is one of my fav actors. He could actually nab a Oscar nomination for this movie. He is INCREDIBLE.Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning...and while I think she was robbed last year at the Oscars for Village I think this year she will miss out on the award. She didn't stand out because there was not as much depth to her character as their was for Paul.Shyamalan actually performed a huge part in the movie and a very moving part. The story was well crafted...and I actually think this may have been Night's most original and daunting task of a story he has written yet. I also think this is one of his best. It's not scary. It's moving. And actually has some comedy in it which he missed in some of his other movies. In how many thrillers do you see a guy who performs an experiment and only works out one side of his body so it becomes 4 more muscular than the other. I love how he brought some many diverse people together a critic who sees no originality in the world a crossword puzzle genius a stumped writer and his comedic sister an old woman who has a thing with animals and a man locked away in his solitude. The way they come together is incredible.One of the best parts of the movie is the music. BY FAR the BEST music in any of Shyamalan's movies. James Newton Howard has created a masterpiece soundtrack that's sweeping chorus of angelic voices and swelling violins and cellos will leave you awestruck. And don't believe Shyamalan's lies about there being no twist. there's about 10 twists...the entire movie will keep you guessing until the very end which is to say the least perfect.People will tell you that the movie isn't worth 6 bucks I'm sure because it's not scary. They'll say that your getting gypped. I say you're not getting gypped. I'll say that Night is the one getting gypped. This movie is worth a lot more than 6 bucks.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic Original brilliant and captivating!!";
	schema:reviewBody "It is so very sad that in a day and age when Hollywood churns out films that critics claim as garbage and it's the same old recycled seen before trash that something like this isn't hailed by critics and top of the box office for fans. M. Night Shyamalan's brilliant tale is one of his best but the man has done some brilliant work up till now. It's not secret that Shyamalan seems to be an acquired taste. He has almost a cult following it seems of people that absolutely adore his brilliance. I say he has completely outdone himself with Lady In The Water. Not only has he created this brilliant story with an ensemble cast of mysterious and interesting characters but he created an entire fairy tale that this story bases itself around. This is completely unique and original inside and out and that is something to be proud of. On top of that it is so watchable captivating and interesting. I sincerely hope that none of the bad reviews brings Shyamalan down because he has outdone himself this time and gave me an incredible experience at the theater.Paul Giamatti takes the lead role as classically haunted and brilliantly melancholy Cleveland Heep. This is a typical Shyamalan character and one of his absolute best going straight up there with Bruce Willis' Dr. Malcolm Crowe Samuel L. Jackson's Mr. Glass and Mel Gibson's Graham Hess all absolutely classic characters in cinema and Giamatti's Heep belongs there 100. Giamatti outdoes himself and gives another Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Heep makes a great hero because he is not. He's the average guy stuck in a rut sad and we know something has caused his melancholy but it unfolds slowly. He is given reason to come alive again with the discovery of a stranger who saves his life. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the mysterious Story. A water Fairy who must accomplish an important deed to the future of mankind and the small apartment complex is the link to this deed. I admit I wasn't crazy about Howard's performance in The Village but she fits this role perfectly. She is mysterious disturbed pale and perfectly suited for this. She still wasn't my favorite character in the film but she does well in the role. One of the most fantastic elements of Lady In The Water is this incredible ensemble cast including none other than Shyamalan himself in an intriguing and important role. Jeffrey Wright Bob Balaban Sarita Choudhury Cindy Cheung Freddy Rodrguez Bill Irwin Mary Beth Hurt and Noah GrayCabey all deserve mention as they play variations of important parts in the story. I must single out Cindy Cheung who is terrific as the punk rocker student who seems to be quite close to Heep. I think her boisterous Goodbye Mr. Heep will become a classic in my books. Also Bob Balaban as the rather sour movie critic Mr. Farber and if this was Shyamalan's dig at his rather harsh critics it was hilariously done!! Balaban's character is subtle but meets his end is a rather sarcastic and clever demise poking fun at the movie plot and critics in general. Shyamalan himself plays a very very good role as the important Vick who has a bigger purpose in life that is dropped on him.The film unravels at break neck speed and everything is discovered and unraveled and carefully dealt with all coming back to this fascinating and original fairy tale that Shyamalan has created. The creature stalking the Water fairy from the grass is terrifying and definitely makes the suspense first rate. One of the most amazing things about this film is that this mind binding imaginative story all takes place in one tiny area. Never once does this film leave the apartment complex. For the most part the bulk of the film takes place at the pool side and yet you barely notice because Shyamalan makes the story so incredibly interesting. As far as I'm concerned if this wasn't already the case this film puts the nail in Shyamalan being one of the most talented writers and directors in Hollywood. He has such an incredibly unique style and I have loved his films since day one. Bravo for this one because it was amazing!! Everyone that loves something unique and suspenseful and interesting will love this film!! 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "It is so very sad that in a day and age when Hollywood churns out films that critics claim as garbage and it's the same old recycled seen before trash that something like this isn't hailed by critics and top of the box office for fans. M. Night Shyamalan's brilliant tale is one of his best but the man has done some brilliant work up till now. It's not secret that Shyamalan seems to be an acquired taste. He has almost a cult following it seems of people that absolutely adore his brilliance. I say he has completely outdone himself with Lady In The Water. Not only has he created this brilliant story with an ensemble cast of mysterious and interesting characters but he created an entire fairy tale that this story bases itself around. This is completely unique and original inside and out and that is something to be proud of. On top of that it is so watchable captivating and interesting. I sincerely hope that none of the bad reviews brings Shyamalan down because he has outdone himself this time and gave me an incredible experience at the theater.Paul Giamatti takes the lead role as classically haunted and brilliantly melancholy Cleveland Heep. This is a typical Shyamalan character and one of his absolute best going straight up there with Bruce Willis' Dr. Malcolm Crowe Samuel L. Jackson's Mr. Glass and Mel Gibson's Graham Hess all absolutely classic characters in cinema and Giamatti's Heep belongs there 100. Giamatti outdoes himself and gives another Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Heep makes a great hero because he is not. He's the average guy stuck in a rut sad and we know something has caused his melancholy but it unfolds slowly. He is given reason to come alive again with the discovery of a stranger who saves his life. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the mysterious Story. A water Fairy who must accomplish an important deed to the future of mankind and the small apartment complex is the link to this deed. I admit I wasn't crazy about Howard's performance in The Village but she fits this role perfectly. She is mysterious disturbed pale and perfectly suited for this. She still wasn't my favorite character in the film but she does well in the role. One of the most fantastic elements of Lady In The Water is this incredible ensemble cast including none other than Shyamalan himself in an intriguing and important role. Jeffrey Wright Bob Balaban Sarita Choudhury Cindy Cheung Freddy Rodrguez Bill Irwin Mary Beth Hurt and Noah GrayCabey all deserve mention as they play variations of important parts in the story. I must single out Cindy Cheung who is terrific as the punk rocker student who seems to be quite close to Heep. I think her boisterous Goodbye Mr. Heep will become a classic in my books. Also Bob Balaban as the rather sour movie critic Mr. Farber and if this was Shyamalan's dig at his rather harsh critics it was hilariously done!! Balaban's character is subtle but meets his end is a rather sarcastic and clever demise poking fun at the movie plot and critics in general. Shyamalan himself plays a very very good role as the important Vick who has a bigger purpose in life that is dropped on him.The film unravels at break neck speed and everything is discovered and unraveled and carefully dealt with all coming back to this fascinating and original fairy tale that Shyamalan has created. The creature stalking the Water fairy from the grass is terrifying and definitely makes the suspense first rate. One of the most amazing things about this film is that this mind binding imaginative story all takes place in one tiny area. Never once does this film leave the apartment complex. For the most part the bulk of the film takes place at the pool side and yet you barely notice because Shyamalan makes the story so incredibly interesting. As far as I'm concerned if this wasn't already the case this film puts the nail in Shyamalan being one of the most talented writers and directors in Hollywood. He has such an incredibly unique style and I have loved his films since day one. Bravo for this one because it was amazing!!

	schema:headline " Shyamalan's Folly";
	schema:reviewBody "I would first like to say that I am a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan. I didn't see Sixth Sense until it was on DVD and once I did I was hooked. I've enjoyed each film he has directed since then including the much maligned The Village. I've been eagerly awaiting Lady in the Water ever since I heard about it. The teaser last winter made me even more curious and I couldn't wait for this movie with a sense of wonder. After finally viewing the movie I have to say that M.Night has a major mess on his hands.The movie is about an apartment maintenance man named Cleveland Heep whom seems to have a very dull life. He is good at what he does but you can't help but feel that he wants more. One night when looking for people swimming after hours he discovers a girl in the pool. Startled and clumsy he falls into the pool and nearly drowns until he discovers himself back in bed with the girl in his house. She is a Narf from the Blue World who wants to return to her world and avoid the Scrunts wolf like monster as she tries to get back via the great eagle. She is to assist Cleveland in assembling a Guild to help her return. Little does Cleveland know that she is also there to help him overcome his grief of losing his family and quitting his job as a doctor. I have a good imagination and I was ready to see how all of this plays out. The child inside me was waiting for a payoff. I am sad to say I never get it.The movie is a complete convoluted mess and a huge failure of execution. Let me begin with the characters. The supporting characters in the movie were annoying stereotypes of all kinds of ethnic backgrounds. The young Asian woman who conveniently told the story of the Narf's by interpreting for her mother was incredibly annoying. It would seem like if the story needed more explanation she conveniently shows up to tell us more even being available while at a dance club. Then we have the guy who is only working out one side of his body. He serves no real purpose until the end and when he does it is completely laughable and not worth the moment of awe as the movie makes it. Then we have the movie critic who seems to be there to serve as M.Nights poke at critics at his past movies. M.Night is also playing a supporting role but because he is the director who makes clever appearances I kept waiting for something magical to happen with his character and we don't get it. He needs to stick with Hitchcock like appearances.The story itself unfolds slowly but when it should be getting more involving and interesting it simply gets messier. You meet all of the characters in the film and you notice they have certain traits to their personality. Those traits are to be put to use in the Guild that Cleveland is trying to assemble. When it comes time to put it all together you are waiting for something meaningful to happen and it just doesn't come together. Take the pool party scene. Has there been any scene in the past several years in movies as confusing and perplexing as this? They were there to protect the Lady yet stupid things happen. A girl drops her mirror who is to be watching for the Scrunt. The movie critic shows up and is given horrible dialogue. A band is to be playing inside but doesn't start on time. As a result of the confusion the Lady is taken by the Scrunt and nearly killed. Then they realize the Guild is not correct and between a kid reading things in cereal boxes and his Dad finding clues in crosswords to shifting people and roles in Guild I was simply confused because of the poor execution. We finally get one good scene when Cleveland has his catharsis and it was able to induce tears in audience members. But it simply comes back to the standard M.Night protagonist whom is trying to deal with personal tragedies. We saw this in Signs The Village and again in this film. While that is a good thing to build a movie around third time around is one too many. Finally when things do play out as they should we are scratching our heads and thinking Are we too stupid to understand this film or is the film too stupid to understand. I've noticed many fan reviews of this film and many liked it but I do tend to think they are way to kind to allow M.Night to have a folly. Lady in the Water is his first folly and I hope he will recover and wow us with his next film.".

To me the rest of my party and apparently the entire audience there was no point to this movie. I thought the general idea was good but there was absolutely no plot to it. The movie is a fantasy but at least the human elements of the movie could have been realistic. First off every character in this movie seems to believe everything they are told. IF some guy came up to me and started rambling on and on about a narf I would laugh in his face. Yet he doesn't even have to work to get people to help him out with whatever he is trying to do with this woman. Then watching a group of 3550 year olds party like they were at a fraternity keg party was priceless. Weird beasts are running around outside that are covered in grass another thing that had me laughing and yet nobody seems to notice. Eventually the narf is saved and the grass covered wolf thing is beaten up by grass covered monkeys and an eagle comes to get the woman. Then it just ends. You don't see where the woman goes you don't see what happens to anyone else for that matter. I wish I could let myself believe a bed time story from somebody in order to try to save some strange woman whom we never find out why she needs to be saved. At least I stuck it out and watched it until it ended which I can not say for half of the audience. This is the first movie I have ever been to where half of the people just got up and left because it was that bad. It made no sense to me. I have read other reviews from people who liked it and it still doesn't make sense to me. I hope it never will!".

	schema:reviewBody "At the showing of Lady in the Water that I went to on Saturday the theater was less then half full. Compare that to the packed houses that greeted both Unbreakable and Signs when I saw those films. What to make of this low attendance? Were that many people really turned off to M. Night Shyamalan because of the twist at the end of The Village a movie I liked by the way. Maybe people were just apprehensive after seeing the mediocre to negative reviews that Lady in the Water has been getting in the media. Perhaps they are put off by Shyamalan's perceived arrogance and egomania. Whatever the case folks are really missing out on nice bit of storytelling.First of all a lot of the negative reviews for this film state that it doesn't live up to the standards of horror films. However Lady in the Water is NOT a horror movie it's a fantasy. More to the point it's actually a bedtime story brought to life. The basic story is that a mysterious woman Bryce Dallas Howard is discovered in the pool of a suburban Philadelphia apartment building by the building's superintendent Cleveland Heep Paul Giamatti. Heep discovers that she is not of this world and sets out to return her to her own realm. The scary parts of the story are provided by the wolflike creature that tries to kill her whenever she is out of the water. Apparently some reviewers are mistaking this standard fairy tale convention as an attempt at horror but Lady in the Water is no more an attempt at horror than anything Shyamalan has done since The Sixth Sense. In fact all of Shyamalan's films including The Sixth Sense are better described as suspense or mystery than as traditional horror films. The meat of all of his films is the storytelling and the emotional connection to the characters in the movie. The scary bits are just the gravy. In Lady in the Water the scary parts are more scarce than in any of his other films but there seems to be more humor both subtle and otherwise than in any of the movies that preceded it.Shyamalan has also been criticized for casting himself in such a large role in this film. While he had cameos in each of his other four movies his biggest part previously had been as the local man who killed the wife of Mel Gibson's priest in a car accident in Signs. His role in the current film casts him as not only a major character but without hopefully giving away too much let's just say he's almost Christlike. Obviously Shyamalan's critics are having a field day with this one saying that his egomania has finally taken him over. Would the critics however really have liked the film more if Shyamalan had switched roles with Bob Balaban as a pompous movie critic or Jeffrey Wright as the resident who is gifted at solving crossword puzzles or even Bill Irwin as the eccentric resident Mr. Leeds? I think not. If he plays a similar part in his next film I'll join those who criticize his ego. Until that happens he's merely playing the role that best suits his vision of the story.In the end it's all about the story or rather the Story. That's the name of Howard's character in the film. She plays the part with a wideeyed detachment that suits this sort of outsider character. The film is teeming with interesting slightly off kilter people and much of the film's surprising humor is derived from the supporting cast. It's the interplay between Giamatti and Howard that gives the film its emotional center though. Despite his looks it appears Giamatti may make a leading man out of himself yet. The man can flat out act. He played mostly bit parts until his breakout role as Pig Vomit in 1997's Private Parts. I loved him as Bob Zmuda Andy Kaufman's best friend in Man on the Moon and of course in his lead part of wine connoisseur Miles in Sideways. As with the rest of Shyamalan's movies it's the slow buildup of the quirky story that pulls you in but it's Giamatti's superb acting that keeps you there. His scene of emotional release near the end don't want to give anything away is truly heartbreaking. You really feel the pain of this man whose life had lost its purpose.The bottom line is that Shyamalan is now five for five in good movies. While The Sixth Sense is probably still his best made film and Signs remains my personal favorite this one is right up there with them. His critics say that all of his films stick to the same basic formula. I agree but I don't feel that's a bad thing. As long as the plot lines and characters remain interesting I enjoy going into a M. Night Shyamalan movie knowing that it will be done in his signature style. Night has turned out another winner.".

But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by Prosper Mrime in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda 'Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love''Amantes' 'If they tell you I fell' etc.. Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers  Jos  provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. Carmen the amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega works in a cigar factory in Seville a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper Jos Leonardo Sbaraglia is stationed. Carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy Carmen murders the coworker and is arrested. Jos is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape  his payback is the promise for a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps her pact providing Jos with his first sexual encounter and Jos is doomed. His lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while but at his release Jos encounters Carmen again kills a fellow officer and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are Carmen's people. Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison destructive behaviors take over behavior's that include Carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and Jos comes to a tragic end. One factor that makes the story as adapted for the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jord move so well is the role that Prosper Mrime Jay Benedict plays his questioning of Jos completes the story that Bizet's opera only outlines. The acting is superb the cinematography by Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score by Jos Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

At least i did it This is an adaptation of a novel by a french writer immortalized in an opera by a french composer. The writer Mrime was as well an historianarchaeologisttranslator meaning this someone who cared for exotism in a time in which Spanish or Portuguese rural worlds were still considered exotic to the English and the french. That novel established the clichs and preconceptions regarding Spanish culture still considered these days and efficiently exploited by the tourism industry. Bizet also helped establish other clichs musical to that matter. But this film is Spanish in production creative minds and people involved. So this was a brilliant opportunity for a view into a distinct edge of Spanish culture described by a french and commented on by the Spanish. That was the motivation for me.They started off quite well and at least i think they gave a thought at what i mentioned. That's why they place Mrime himself as a character observing Andaluzia as a foreigner and taking note of what he sees even sharing space and scenes with Carmen and Jos. That was good and i appreciated the audacity of crossing the line of the facts if there ever was a real Carmen Mrime never got to know her.But the problem is they never step out of the very clichs Mrime established. The film is visually as lush as the opera is musically. The sets are brilliantly baroque the excellent production emphasizes passioned environments operatic as well an orangeyellow deviating sexual mood. But they also emphasize the temperament of the characters a little too much deviating the thing from what could have been better explored something that could matter and that is in fact notedThe drama is built around Carmen and the inability for Jos to play the game according to her rules. Those rules are defined by cultural background and that is where the frictions lie. Carmen comes from a branch of the Spanish culture that transcends Spain. Gypsies a group of nomads a people that wouldn't or couldn't adapt to the established norms the roman derived catholic based culture that self and forced rejection still lasts today in most of the places. Jos is Basque but that is little seen he could be from Madrid that in this case it would be the same he is a clich as well. So it is those cultural differences that matter. This is i mentioned noted but not made the center of the thing. They prefer remarking on the sensuality as the engine for the plot and sex as the motivation for the characters that's why we have Paz Vega here who had been in the brilliant sexcentered 'Luca y el sexo' just 2 years before. Well she does deliver what they intended and she is sensual for my contemporary and contextualized eyes. So it's not a matter of what they did here but what they could have done.Side note one could also take Carmen as an early symbol for a female emancipation that would only really happen decades later. Is this something Mrime observed or something he included as part of his french more cosmopolitan way of thinking?My opinion 35httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera the book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is.And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichs in the movie. Well historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the black Spain of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly but it's also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly anyone who doesn't want to see any clich about Spain shouldn't buy a ticket to see Carmen but in this case those clichs are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. If all the rest of the audience did the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner Leonardo Sbaraglia gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a bandolero and her accent is very well learned.No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is horrible suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us especially for the ones that hadn't detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily had to care for. I'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because that's what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen and an excellent one in Vicente Aranda's movie.".

	schema:headline " Where's the vavavoom?";
	schema:reviewBody "Screenwise the story of 'Carmen' has lent itself to more than two dozen outings the plot with its core elements of jealous lovers femme fatales and outlaws being powerful indeed simplistic enough to embrace several contemporary stylings such as 1954's allblack Carmen Jones 2001's 'Carmen A Hip Hopera' and JeanLuc Godard's 1983 film First Name Carmen.Similarly while it's a popular misconception that 'Carmen' first flowed from composer Bizet's pen the crowdpleasing opera is just one of numerous interpretations including dance and theatre productions of Prosper Mrime's 1847 source text.Though a crowdpleaser now and a terrific enlivener of many a 'Classical Lite' compilation CD operagoers attending the 1875 premiere performance actually thought it less than the Bizet's knees owing to its interminable chunks of dialogue later expunged or set to music. It's those glorious songs we most associate Carmen with these days and tellingly this version  a straight selfimportant retelling of the novella  feels infinitely poorer for their exclusion.As if anticipating the loss director Aranda attempts to hold the interest during almost two hours of screen time through fullfrontal nudity judicious smatterings of gore and authentically course dialogue.It's in this attention to earthy period detail that the filmmakers have really succeeded the costumes lighting and production design are uniformly excellent. For such a purist take however occasional liberties have been taken  some good some indifferent.

	onyx:emotionText "Screenwise the story of 'Carmen' has lent itself to more than two dozen outings the plot with its core elements of jealous lovers femme fatales and outlaws being powerful indeed simplistic enough to embrace several contemporary stylings such as 1954's allblack Carmen Jones 2001's 'Carmen A Hip Hopera' and JeanLuc Godard's 1983 film First Name Carmen.Similarly while it's a popular misconception that 'Carmen' first flowed from composer Bizet's pen the crowdpleasing opera is just one of numerous interpretations including dance and theatre productions of Prosper Mrime's 1847 source text.Though a crowdpleaser now and a terrific enlivener of many a 'Classical Lite' compilation CD operagoers attending the 1875 premiere performance actually thought it less than the Bizet's knees owing to its interminable chunks of dialogue later expunged or set to music. It's those glorious songs we most associate Carmen with these days and tellingly this version  a straight selfimportant retelling of the novella  feels infinitely poorer for their exclusion.As if anticipating the loss director Aranda attempts to hold the interest during almost two hours of screen time through fullfrontal nudity judicious smatterings of gore and authentically course dialogue.It's in this attention to earthy period detail that the filmmakers have really succeeded the costumes lighting and production design are uniformly excellent. For such a purist take however occasional liberties have been taken  some good some indifferent.

So this is not a mistake of the film which in many ways deserves certainly criticism the film lack rhythm and the actors are very bad indeed. I think the opening scene when all the women appear in the cigar factory is great a scene of great tension and furious wild force. Unfortunately the great expectations this opening create on the spectator are certainly not accomplished.

	schema:reviewBody "Before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not I should inform you I've never seen another adaptation of Carmen so if you're looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to you.The only time I've come across Carmen was on the car stereo when driving through Spain on a family holiday when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention to it because I didn't like opera at the time and I didn't know any better. The story has been around for 150 years or so. Do I feel I've missed out after seeing this movie? Yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega I would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my DVD collection.Directed by Vicente Aranda who also corewrote the story with Joaquim Jord the story is told through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mrime a French writer making his way through 19th century Spain. He comes across Jos Leonardo Sbaraglia a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen Paz Vega a sultry sexy bedazzling gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a 'toro' and who recklessly leads men to their doom. The moment she meets Jos she is attracted by his standoffish behaviour. But she hooks him reels him in and lets him go manyatime. Until one day Jos is wanted for murder. Carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers. They seem to be settling she's fallen in love with him but she meets the charming Escamillo the bullfighter. Can Jos hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him? It's a beautifulseductive story something that resembles almost a Shakespearian or Ovid plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character. It's poetic fiery and above all slutty. I was left hanging on I didn't know which way it was going to turn. I always hoped that Jos might change Carmen's dirty little ways. I won't tell you if he succeeded or not.The above synopsis is what I took away from the film but I was not impressed by the film itself. It was only after I watched it that I dug a little deeper into the story and I realised how much of a missed opportunity Aranda had made of retelling Mrime's classic. It was a shallow slutty perioddrama blunder that saw Paz Vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that I'm complaining about this in particular!.First of all the acting was poor. I was not impressed by Sbaraglia as Jos. I'm still unsure whether he was a weak actor or Jos was supposed to be a weak character I've not read the book. He's supposed to be a man who with burning desire for Carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim. Paz Vega was slightly better as Carmen. I was convinced by her hardened wicked character although I have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that I've come across many Andalusian gypsy women so in a way the role didn't really fit her. The other actors in the film weren't great either. They seemed to do everything halfheartedly. The story is passionate emotive  they looked halfarsed as if they couldn't wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearing.However the costumes I was impressed with  one of the redeeming factors of the film. I like Spanish culture I liked the soldiers' uniforms the tophats and the women's Flamenco dresses. They fitted the time well. That's all I can really say about that. Sorry back to the criticism.The script as stated above was corewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jord and done so badly so much that it would leave Mrime turning in his grave. It was boring. It didn't make best use of Jos's intense passion for Carmen or maybe that was just the acting. There were cheesy lines piled upon one and other Satan and devil connotations everywhere amongst the millions of swear words. I know the Spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was littered with puta 'whore' in literally every line Maybe it was realistic in 19th century povertystricken Seville but the story itself didn't need it.The editing and camera work was dull and ordinary. There was only one bit I actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly closeup in midair which lands on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? Boring.To conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing. If you're a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story. However only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise stick to the opera version even though I hate musicals. I give this film 4 just for the fact I love the storyline! And Paz Vega!".

Great sets lots of colour  you get to see Cordoba Seville Spanish mountains and countryside.

Carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Jose the soldier in charge of taking her to prison to let her escape. Jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks Basque he is Navarrese and speaks the same language. Jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. He later meets Carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit to him and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. In a jealous rage Jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with Carmen. They then have to leave town. Life on the run turns Jose into a bandit. Carmen meanwhile remains the same a wildly promiscuous woman. In the end Jose loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen.The story is told by Jose in prison awaiting to be executed. The person he tells the story to is Prospero Merrime a French writer and anthropologist whose fancy watch it plays Beethoven's Fur Elise was stolen by either Carmen or Jose.Worth watching for the sets and for the delectable Paz Vega.".

	schema:headline " Just like Stanley Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut''";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet PeaAbbie Cornish. She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. BabydollEmily Browning is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that the lobotomy comes the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage. By choosing to watch the movie we are complicit in everything that's happening. Of course this doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile girls kicking ass. What this movie is really about is the difference between empowerment and exploitation. This is represented through three layers of fantasy first was the mental institution second is the brothel third is the fantasyaction scenes each exploring a different set of social values each aligning with different phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim incarnation of the '60s the mental institution set during the second wave of the feminist movement when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the second world the brothel which takes us back even further to a time when women were literally treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world the world of today action scenes which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect video games TV movies etc... Sweet Pea is aware of how sick this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering. It's only through seeing its effect on men does she start to see how much power they really have as the girls start taking back the control they've lost by using men's objectification of them to their advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it they learn that their inherent femininity can be better used as a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly it's the men who become helpless instead of them. Point being men may be in a position to physically overpower women but women have the power to psychologically overpower men thus inverting history's longstanding power dynamic between men and women. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios  a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show women taking back geek culture which men have been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to a better world Blue has plans of his own. But its no use she's already escaped even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body Babydoll and retreats into the comfort of her own mind a paradise over which nobody has control of but her. Blue may have control over her body but without her mind he has nothing. The importance of this is also apparent during Babydoll's encounter with the High Roller who recognizes that the choice to truly be with someone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal choice. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over their bodies as they have over their minds. You can interpret this movie so many ways it's beyond belief. It gives you so many options to think. It's really funny that the one who made this kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by someone like Stanley Kubrick probably everyone would have tried to decipher the depth of it and wouldn't have even minded the bad reviews. But when the journalists ruled it out as one of worst film of the decade because it had directed someone who isn't as influential as Stanley Kubrick everyone thought the movie was trash and just stupid soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. So they didn't even bother to understand.It's really sad that people turn off their brains and see everything literal and never uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they see a Snyder film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet PeaAbbie Cornish. She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. BabydollEmily Browning is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that the lobotomy comes the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage.

But if you can keep an open mind right till the end at the very least it will give you a lot to think aboutOn the other hand don't go thinking that is all it has to offer. It is visually stunning in a way that makes director's like Michael Bay and dare I say it James Cameron look like blind toddlers with a handycam strapped to their heads. As for the music it's not often I'm afraid of giving spoilers for a movies soundtrack I'll say that much and every track fits the movie perfectly.I'm going to shoot myself in the foot here but when it comes to this movie don't listen to the reviews and just go see it.

Yeah the action is over the top but if you look at the emotional landscape that is being explored in a more literal fashion via the action then yeah this is a pretty cool idea. Sometimes films come along that are a sucker punch in terms of originality. The general public usually reacts negatively to it which leads to poor box office results. But later on the audience has had a chance to digest what was given and revisits the film and breaths new life into it. My prediction is that such a situation will happen with Sucker Punch. It'll probably not recoup its initial budget at the box office. People will flood the IMDb forum with reasons why it did not work. We will probably see about a few dozen threads at least where people will vent their reasons why they hate the film and why you too should not see it.But given some time it will recoup via video sales and other distribution deals. Why? Because it's still a solid story. The style of the movie is an Otaku's wet dream but overall result is still the same it does surprise and give ample food for thought. Think of it as stylized parable about repression personal will and sacrifice.

	schema:headline " An actionextravaganza that is haunting beautiful polarizing and brilliant.";
	schema:reviewBody "After absorbing myself in the world of Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch for a while including one viewing at IMAX one in my local theater and multiple listens to the soundtrack I felt the unusual calling to dump my thoughts out regarding this haunting beautiful polarizing and brilliant film.From the first trailer I saw I'd been anticipating the release. Usually this is bad as it means my expectations are built up and it will take an outstanding performance to meet those expectations. Turns out Sucker Punch is everything I'd hoped it would be and more. Some would say that in art we see what we want to see though maybe it's true also that we see what we are prepared to see. Here's what I saw and felt about the film why it resonated with me and why many people didn't like it Within the first five minutes I knew I was in for a treat. The film opens with an excellent cover of Sweet Dreams by the film's lead actress. The initial scenes are otherwise silent and the storytelling is all visual. Yes you're about to experience a film that is basically a 120minute music video. But that's not all. It's also an action extravaganza AND it's cerebral to boot.Right out the gate from as early as the opening sequence where we enter through a state and later rain on a car window forms the movie's title this film announces that you should shut off your disbelief. It's fantasy at all levels and doesn't have to make sense to entertain or ask provocative questions both out loud and suggested.Thank goodness for the fantasy elements as had this been a movie about an escape attempt from an abusesteeped asylum it would have been immeasurably depressing. Snyder's vision protects the audience from what Baby Doll Sweet Pea and the rest were experiencing in the reality of the film probably more effectively than Baby Doll's fantasies protected her from those horrible experiences. As it is the film is sad enough in its portrayal and suggestion of certain negative themes like incarceration lobotomies aggression rape corruption and betrayal. On the other hand it's also a film that is both empowering and moving.In contrast to the dark themes we also have several positive themes like the individual's search for freedom teamwork giving love forgiveness risk and courage. This film likely upsets many viewers because it doesn't exactly have a happy ending. An approach which tends to spell failure at the American box office. I enjoy the apparent contradictions it presents to the audience. One popular debate is whether the film is empowering to women. I think this debate in particular misses the point of the film and takes too much at face value but it does show how polarizing the movie is.The conversation both internal with yourself and external with others about what is portrayed in the film can be difficult for one to consider which is likely why it's a turnoff for so many. The critics may be upset by the questions it provokes about themselves. Cognitive dissonance encourages them to just forget all the issues label the film a piece of garbage and move on. Other viewers were likely upset by the film's darkness  it certainly made me uncomfortable but that doesn't mean the movie was bad. For those of us looking deeper there are all manner of important questions provoked.People are being abused. What are you doing about it? Is reality a prison? If reality is a prison as the trailer for the film states what does that make you? Why are you here? Are you here to be corrected or to escape? Do you want to be free or should you just shut up and let the guards continue to take advantage of you and the other prisoners? What will it take to escape? Are you willing to risk your life in the quest for freedom? Is Sucker Punch really just a actionextravaganza with no plot as many critics would suggest or is it a subtly and cleverly presented art film about your evolution and selfempowerment? The film even asks a series of provocative questions out loud in the final narration. I'm a panentheist and I don't claim to know what Zack and Deborah Snyder believe but my interpretation of the final narration is that it is reminding people of the divine dichotomy. We are individuals but we're all connected to allthatis. The world's horrors and beauty were created by us collectively. What we see around us is a reflection of our collective beliefs.

	onyx:emotionText "After absorbing myself in the world of Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch for a while including one viewing at IMAX one in my local theater and multiple listens to the soundtrack I felt the unusual calling to dump my thoughts out regarding this haunting beautiful polarizing and brilliant film.From the first trailer I saw I'd been anticipating the release. Usually this is bad as it means my expectations are built up and it will take an outstanding performance to meet those expectations. Turns out Sucker Punch is everything I'd hoped it would be and more. Some would say that in art we see what we want to see though maybe it's true also that we see what we are prepared to see. Here's what I saw and felt about the film why it resonated with me and why many people didn't like it Within the first five minutes I knew I was in for a treat. The film opens with an excellent cover of Sweet Dreams by the film's lead actress. The initial scenes are otherwise silent and the storytelling is all visual. Yes you're about to experience a film that is basically a 120minute music video. But that's not all. It's also an action extravaganza AND it's cerebral to boot.Right out the gate from as early as the opening sequence where we enter through a state and later rain on a car window forms the movie's title this film announces that you should shut off your disbelief. It's fantasy at all levels and doesn't have to make sense to entertain or ask provocative questions both out loud and suggested.Thank goodness for the fantasy elements as had this been a movie about an escape attempt from an abusesteeped asylum it would have been immeasurably depressing. Snyder's vision protects the audience from what Baby Doll Sweet Pea and the rest were experiencing in the reality of the film probably more effectively than Baby Doll's fantasies protected her from those horrible experiences. As it is the film is sad enough in its portrayal and suggestion of certain negative themes like incarceration lobotomies aggression rape corruption and betrayal. On the other hand it's also a film that is both empowering and moving.In contrast to the dark themes we also have several positive themes like the individual's search for freedom teamwork giving love forgiveness risk and courage. This film likely upsets many viewers because it doesn't exactly have a happy ending. An approach which tends to spell failure at the American box office. I enjoy the apparent contradictions it presents to the audience. One popular debate is whether the film is empowering to women. I think this debate in particular misses the point of the film and takes too much at face value but it does show how polarizing the movie is.The conversation both internal with yourself and external with others about what is portrayed in the film can be difficult for one to consider which is likely why it's a turnoff for so many. The critics may be upset by the questions it provokes about themselves. Cognitive dissonance encourages them to just forget all the issues label the film a piece of garbage and move on. Other viewers were likely upset by the film's darkness  it certainly made me uncomfortable but that doesn't mean the movie was bad. For those of us looking deeper there are all manner of important questions provoked.People are being abused. What are you doing about it? Is reality a prison? If reality is a prison as the trailer for the film states what does that make you? Why are you here? Are you here to be corrected or to escape? Do you want to be free or should you just shut up and let the guards continue to take advantage of you and the other prisoners? What will it take to escape? Are you willing to risk your life in the quest for freedom? Is Sucker Punch really just a actionextravaganza with no plot as many critics would suggest or is it a subtly and cleverly presented art film about your evolution and selfempowerment? The film even asks a series of provocative questions out loud in the final narration. I'm a panentheist and I don't claim to know what Zack and Deborah Snyder believe but my interpretation of the final narration is that it is reminding people of the divine dichotomy. We are individuals but we're all connected to allthatis. The world's horrors and beauty were created by us collectively. What we see around us is a reflection of our collective beliefs. The contrast exists so you can continue to choose what you want. Will you consciously choose to evolve expand and therefore grow allthatis? The film explains this by announcing that you have all the weapons you need and encourages you to fight. Leave the realm of living life by default and begin working towards freedom. Gather your tools map fire knife key and don't forget the fifth element  love.

	schema:reviewBody "Sucker Punch the latest barrage on the senses from writerdirector Zack Snyder 300 Watchmen is his first film that's based on his own source material. And it proves to be quite stunning definition of pop filmmaking. In a triumphant marriage of style and tone Snyder has created his own Kill Bill by going deep down into the rabbit hole. A glorious pastiche of colour CGI and kinesis Sucker Punch even through its obvious flaws has set a new bar for graphic storytelling that attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen.Essentially cohering around a simple premise  hot chicks kicking ass and taking names the film's bravura opening charts Baby Doll's Emily Browning institutionalisation by a wicked stepfather after her mother's death and her introduction to the asylum where damaged young women are sent to be kept away from society. She meets the peopleincharge Blue Oscar Isaac and Dr. Gorski Carla Gugino as well as the other girls in the institute Rocket Jena Malone and her sister Sweet Pea Abbie Cornish Amber Jamie Chung and Blondie Vanessa Hudgens.The story that follows Baby Doll reveals a larger canvas of a clever narrative conceit that coincides three realities together Inception comparisons tread lightly the first being the asylum the second is a burlesque brothel run by Blue and trained by Gorski and the final and most resplendent one is Baby Doll's hyper reverie focused on destroying the forces of evil  be it shogun titans zombie Nazis or killer androids. The darker the reality preceding it the deeper and more risky the wormhole of fantasies go. There is a real sense despite its tremendous parade of visual setpieces that Snyder wanted a narrative strong enough to endure the weight of spectacle and in many respects he has. He uses the ageold device of character quests to propel the plot peppering it with familiar consequences until he doesn't. The flow culminates in an intriguing final act that sets it a mark higher than anyone would have expected or even needed from a film that already proudly wears its stripes as pure escapist entertainment.Snyder goes the way of Tarantino in appropriating and amalgamating artistic and stylistic influences from the most conspicuous of genres and mediums. Within the real world or whatever the relative equivalent of what exists in this film's dark and twisty tone the film uses templates in the vein of sexploitation female prison grindhouse features from the 60s and 70s like Love Camp 7 99 Women Caged Heat and the grandmother of them all 1950's Caged. As the film progresses into its actionoriented enterprises it quickly recalls the dizzying array of cutscenes from videogames and punk animestyle design in how it encompasses the digital environment. Snyder's thematic goal is to situate the idea of imagination as a coping mechanism for terror a concept seen recently in Pan's Labyrinth and Tideland. The landscape of the mind is uniquely realised here by Snyder who etches a remarkable amount of detail into each CGI frame an hyperbolised celebration of artifice and invention that is at once magnificent and exhilarating as it is compelling and spellbinding.Werner Herzog once posited that the dearth of new and unique imagery that do not reflect the times we live in will be the death of civilisation. If anything Sucker Punch truly defines the generation of filmmaking we exist in  a sophisticated and passionate emblem that delivers an overload of sugar high through the ideals of creating and maintaining a creative medley of popculture influences bridged together with keen commercial sensibilities. Suddenly Snyder holding on to the helms of the next Superman film makes more sense than it ever did.".

	schema:reviewBody "With 300 Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes indeed they do but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.Emily Browning plays Babydoll a blond bombshell who is placed in a mental institution by her cold stepfather and is then seen trying to persuade the orderlies into lobotomizing her to keep her from giving details surrounding a tragedy in her life. However Babydoll begins to create a dreamworld in which not only to pass the time but to figure a way out of the asylum.As if that makes any sense whatsoever here are the main problems with Sucker Punch that's been plaguing modern cinema no plot and character development. Barely any of the characters that the protagonist meets are developed. They're just static talking heads spouting out lines that are trying to hammer into the audience that they are more than just clich's and cardboard cutouts. The acting feels stiff and artificial with no sense of tension or suspense. You never feel that the characters are in real danger of any kind. It just goes thru the motions and despite having a nice premise to go on the film feels like a halfassed attempt to be something new and fresh.Sucker Punch has some merits. The special effects and action scenes are impressive. I did get a kick out of some of the battle scenes which are nicely choreographed and executed with lots of explosions. Watching it is sort of like looking at a silent film on steroids but minus the heart and soul of that bygone era.The incredible aesthetic beauty and action choreography are a lot impressive than Snyder's 300. But the problem with Sucker Punch is that even in a fantasy film or any action film for that matter you have to put effort into making the audience care for your characters no matter how good looking the action and special effects are. You simply won't care who lives or dies in this film. At some point you have to try to make the audience care. This film simply never does.I think that I got my point across perfectly clear regarding this film. If it entertained you fine then it did it's job. The problem is is that there's nothing remotely remarkable about this film aside from the visual aspect of this film. If more time was spent fleshing out the story characters with a more coherent script then this could've been a really good film. But since so much potential was utterly wasted I have no choice but to give my grade and it's a D.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD!I'm from Argentina and here this movie was premiered today one day before the rest of world.Sucker punch has great action production and music but there's one big problem which is the same problem many many directors and producers and filmmakers in general keep doing The script is BAD.Today I learned that not even Zack Snyder can save a bad script.The main character gets confined to a mental asylum for reasons that stop being important once she is inside for the rest of the movie. There she flashes a weird burlesque world slightly related to the real world. and there she flashes another world which is pure fantasy. This flashy third world has the cool action that we want to see. sadly it doesn't work at all since nothing there makes sense. She finds suddenly turned into a super powered chick who fights robots Nazis dragons and samurais. Who are them? nobody. Why does she fight them? No reason. What if she loses the fight? We don't know. Who gives a damn then about them? Well not me. Of course after we start to see that her actions there mean something in the real world actually it's not the real world either but it's already too late. We see the first fight without caring about it since it doesn't have a background at all. And that transfers to all the rest.Some of the actors were good but many of them have the problem of having to act a scene that makes no sense at all and that hurts their performances really bad. The perfect example of this is the doctor that lobotomizes her having to repeat the there was a creepy look in her eyes speech like 5 times to make the audience believe it.It's sad that all those good action scenes fell flat for the lack of story. When I saw the first action scene versus the samurais the best one by far I thought Man!! if I had this one action scene alone at the end after a great movie with good characters I'd been totally happy. No need for more action than this in a well constructed movie. of course I was able to think that so early cause the fatal flaw of the movie was all exposed already.Aniway. Nice action and nothing else.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is likely to be the most underrated movie experience of the year Zack Snyder's barrage of girls gun and giant samurai is a misunderstood effort from the man behind 2009's excellent adaptation of Watchmen. Yes it's not without flaws yes it can be predictable especially the 5th item but it doesn't mean that it isn't everything that most films seem to miss these days fun. Fun isn't usually associated with child abuse and an asylum but that is where the curtain opens the audience at. An opening silence gives great anticipation a tragedy occurs and protagonist Baby Doll is shunted into an asylum by her stepfather where she awaits lobotomy in five days' time. It should be said at this point that this review is coming from someone who openly loathes the style over substance limbo of an era in which we live what with CGI and 3D being used as an excuse for anything considered a showcase for this technology.Sucker Punch boasted a similar exercise course of stylish nonsense yet the finished result left this reviewer in a state of pleasant surprise the concept was highly original  though sprinkled with an influx of other influences which ultimately could have been the films downfall had the context they been used in feel more of a parody than a series of dream sequences. Orcs dragons and robots have never been more refreshing out of their native genres.As the visuals go there was never going to be an issue there. It's easily Snyder's best looking film to date and for a written debut the plot is on par with the heavily action orientated 300 in that it takes a back seat once the films' issue has been established. It's only noticeable dent in its armour is the characterisation or rather lack of characterisation. For a film nearing the two hour mark the audience are relatively unrewarded when trying to relate to any of the five heroines' of the story. It may be great to see that Baby Doll Blondie Sweet Pea Amber and Rocket haven't been assigned to overused archetypes  that would be taking the easy route yet there's not even been a road taken here. The characters as such remain relatively hollow being left as shellless albeit undeniably attractive characters. There's not even what you could coin as a 'Fenster' wherein a character with next to nothing about them can morph into something noticeable even memorable. They are what could be the fullyfledged realisation Pulp Fiction's Fox Force Five each an assassin with their own weapon speciality perhaps this is how the audience is supposed interpret their personalities each instrument being reflective of the character using it. That is my only complaint everything else did as Big Daddy put it Knocked me for a loop with three particular but unspoiled scenes breaking a monotony that had infected the infinite amount brainless action films that have preceded Sucker Punch  and sadly continue to follow after it. While the scenes aren't anything groundbreaking they play to Zack's strengths  detaching from the action so it does not cease to stand impressive next time round and focusing on the realism that confronts them back in the reality. Critics have mauled it calling it dull senseless and even plot less yet the fact many fans have interpreted it as having meanings on a deeper level particularly the importance of Sweet Pea's character suggests there may have been a certain naivety from critics  a definite contribution to its growing cult status there is an excellent interpretation on the IMDb Message Board that is worth a look. You could also throw weapon argument mentioned above into the mix for further evidence of such ignorance  I also stand guilty of missing this possibility.The film has also been accused of being overtly sexist but drawing another parallel to 300 300 men are seen topless and not a single complaint is raised. But five scantilyclad women and one imaginary brothel are seen and all hell has broken loose. 300 got a reasonable 60 on Rotten Tomatoes and Sucker Punch just 22 both are relatively balanced in terms of their stories character's and direction yet the reception of each is hugely unbalanced. It effectively asks who the sexist ones really are.Sucker Punch is misunderstood not question about it. It's not the genre changing cult films that Blade Runner or Donnie Darko are but it certainly deserves the fans that it has generated and I for one eagerly anticipate the Extended Cut to see what else it has to offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion the movie was a good movie. It bugs me to read reviews and have people complaining because it looks too much like a video game or there was no real suspense well thats not even the point. The girls cant be hurt when there inside baby dolls dream worlds because its all in her head and baby doll chooses to be strong. In reality they are 5 girls locked in an asylum with no control over what they can do but the reason for it changing to a club and baby doll making up these grand stories is because she doesn't want to feel weak or dependent inside her mind shes strong courageous and able to stand up for herself along with her companions.Maybe im reading too much into it but its a movie about escaping reality and going to a better place a place that you can control and that you can be or do whatever you want so maybe thats the point. The end was a bit disappointing because it left us wondering what happens to blue but again in my opinion thats part of it its left to the audience to decide what happens. Is baby doll finally at peace in her own mind? does blue pay for what he did? how does sweet pea's life play out now? its all left to the viewer who gets to just like in the movie be creative and decide what happens. The movie was action packed filled with good looking girls and leaves a good message behind. You have all the weapons you need now fight".

Add to that the convoluted storyline and notsospecial effects and you easily have one of the worst movies of the year.What small plot this picture has features Babydoll Browning as a much abused stepdaughter placed in a Shutter Islandtype 1950s mental institution. There she meets a group of equally terrible actresses and begins her flights of fantasy. Browning seems to have one expression a sadsack dopeyeyed headcocked look that makes Anna Faris' thespian abilities look like Katharine Hepburn's. With this group she delves into an Inceptionlike world of multilayered dimensions fighting giant killer robots massive zeppelins German zombies from World War I. These scenes are all one big CGI mess that  to some I suppose  are going to appear impressive but when all is said and done give the intelligent viewer one large headache.Meanwhile an orientallike wise man Scott Glenn The Right Stuff Hunt For Red October waxes philosophical about finding a map a key fire a knife and other mundane items which are supposed to make this film somewhat deep. Glenn by the way only was considered for this role because David Carradine had passed away.To waste any more words on this slick piece of garbage would only serve to justify Snyder's pathetic vision of titillating teenage males by enticing them them with nearly barebreasted violent adolescent girls with guns and martial arts skills.Take my advice here unless you're a confused young women with anger and appearance issues or a horny 14year old boy avoid this movie like the bubonic plague. No matter what kind of money you save by doing so eventually you will thank me for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how this movie got such rave reviews by some people oh wait yes I can the ONLY people who can possibly like this film are fantasyanimecomic book junkies!Where do I begin... First and foremost the biggest upset of this movie is the plot which flip flopped back and forth with no real point or purpose for the most part  and not in a creativeunique way. The plot starts off in some wannabe 'Inception' idea with a fantasy inside a fantasy. Baby Girl goes from about to get a lobotomy odd enough as it is to going to a story inside a story which ends with the lobotomy ending basically the story in between the lobotomy was never explained outside the fantasy and couldn't have happened since the lobotomy happened from the beginning of her entering the insane asylum.Now for the second level of the story So Baby Girl and her pose are trying to escape their slavery from the burlesquewhore house and they must obtain 4 items and a mystery in order to escape which is all fine and good. However in the process of obtaining these items Baby Girl andor her pose enter the third fantasystory aspect of the film which is COMPLETELY NON RELATED TO ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE FILM and is replaced with pretty much every popular fantasyfiction battle scene from the last 30 years of movie history. From a generic samurai swordbattle battle to a Nazi war scene with some mech machines to a scene literally right out of Lord of the Rings with Orcs a castle and dragons to a Unstoppablerunaway train sceneMatrixTerminatorDefuse a bomb scene the plot is a mess! I was waiting for some fairies elfs werewolves vampires or unicorns to come up next but I'm sure they are saving those for sucker punch 2!Aside from the plot there were some other major issues. The soundtrack consisted of about 3 songs or at least the same artist since they all sounded the same It was so predictable that there would be nothing but hard chick rock. I think the movie tried way too hard to emphasize the hardcore tough chick act yet they still always have to have women look like little sex dolls when they battle with perfect makeup tits hanging out and short skirts. The volume of the audio was WAY off in some dialog scenes the words were barely audible yet in the battle scenes the sound was so loud that you couldn't even think and after the movie my ears were ringing as if I were standing right next to the speaker at a Metallica concert. I even plugged my ears at some points to attempt to save my hearing and I could still hear the sound perfectly. I'm sorry but blasting music does NOT make a movie better.I typically enjoy fantasysuper hero movies but this one failed on all levels for me. I feel there was almost no effort in the writing of this movie almost as if it were an after thought. The actors all seemed second rate the crying was clearly fake and lacked emotion. Oscar Isaac seemed like he was trying too hard to be like Joker from Batman yet he showed no genuine emotion in the scene where he executes the two girls that execution scene had no place in this film it made no sense look around the theater after this scene and you will see most people scratching their head.If I could rate the CG alone it's easily an 8 or 9 out of 10 but the terrible plot mediocre acting and overblowneverything ruined it for me. If you honestly enjoy this movie you have to be lying to yourself or foolishly attempting to defend it based solely on the fact that it has fantasycomic book aspects.".

Oscar Isaac seemed like he was trying too hard to be like Joker from Batman yet he showed no genuine emotion in the scene where he executes the two girls that execution scene had no place in this film it made no sense look around the theater after this scene and you will see most people scratching their head.If I could rate the CG alone it's easily an 8 or 9 out of 10 but the terrible plot mediocre acting and overblowneverything ruined it for me. If you honestly enjoy this movie you have to be lying to yourself or foolishly attempting to defend it based solely on the fact that it has fantasycomic book aspects.";

	schema:headline " A disaster";
	schema:reviewBody "A crime against the cinema. It's too bad. I honestly have enjoyed Zack Snyder's films in the past besides that crappy owl movie he made last year. I'd classify them more as guilty pleasures than actual good movies but I found them entertaining and neat to look at. Sucker Punch though combines all his worst traits and adds a script that he himself wrote along with cowriter Steve Shibuya. His previous films were all adaptations three of picture books and one a remake of a George A. Romero classic. He didn't have to think much himself to make those neat images. Sucker Punch demonstrates that he just doesn't have the ability to think of things himself. It's a movie that combines mental hospitals burlesque shows giant samurai warriors halfmechanical zombieNazis mech suits orcs dragons killer robots and atomic bombs pretty much every cool thing one can think of.And then one might guess that the problem is overkill. It isn't well that may be a smaller problem. The major problem is that there's not a single thing we haven't seen before here. Also the plot is created in the worst possible way. The skeleton of it is pretty much identical to Inception. While this film had to have been conceived beforehand so you can't blame it for ripping Nolan's film off that's just one more strike against it. Emily Browning plays a girl who accidentally kills her sister while trying to defend her from her rampaging stepfather. She's sent to a mental hospital where she hides behind two levels of reality. In the first level down she's the new girl at a burlesque housewhorehouse. Snyder inserts a very video gameesque premise she and her hooker friends Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung are basically sex slaves and they must find five objects to help them escape. Now up to this point the film is tolerable. It's not good but it's watchable. The girls are very attractive and the visuals are kind of oldfashioned and nice to look at.But here comes the third level whenever the girls are about to steal the next thing they need to escape they all descend into a fantasy world which is about the most video gamelike thing to ever appear in a movie. Well kind of. There was Scott Pilgrim vs. the World last year. That one actually used video games in a clever metaphorical way and it did it with its tongue in its cheek. Snyder really thinks we want to watch people play video games on the big screen. The worst thing was after I experienced the abject horrors of how boring this could possibly be the first time I realized I was going to have to sit through this same thing four more times. Oh these sequences are beyond awful with these girls fighting through dozens of notverygreatlooking CGI Nazis robots orcs whatever. This is the worst parts of every event movie of the past decade mashed into neverending sequences. There's nothing logical about the existence of these sequences. The funny thing is in that second level of reality while these fantasy sequences are going on Browning is dancing sexily in front of whomever the girls want to distract. I think Snyder had to have known that the premise that this girl is such a sexy dancer that anyone watching her would be so utterly distracted that the other girls could steal from them was laughably ridiculous. But watching the movie I'm not so sure he was smart enough to realize this. He's also not smart enough to realize that the audience this film was intended for would probably rather be watching the girl dance sexily than watch these hot girls play video games in front of us.While these video game sequences are some of the worst cinema I've ever experienced and about the worst bit of narrative as well Snyder isn't done completely screwing up. He completely miscalculates which characters the audience gives a damn about. He also doesn't make any sense of the connection between the first and second levels of reality we'll thankfully forget about the third and characters whom we met in the second level but not in the first aren't able to connect to the audience when we meet them there. The film ends with a character whom we don't know and don't give a crap about. And then I stand up and flee the theater and it's all I can do not to start a riot in the lobby.".

It was no forest gump but looking at the Director's history no one should be expecting that anyway. Having previously directed Dawn of the Dead 300 and Watchmen this one fits in pretty well in the mix. The style is more Watchmenesque than 300 but man may there be violence and much appreciated! Oh and the costumes are just what the demographic ordered. Though from the previews I may have been predisposed to expect a more straightforward storyline kicking and fighting it's way to a climactic finish possibly a little twist thrown in there I was happily dazed enough to enjoy myself. As I write this I am still trying to piece together the understory and back goings of the film. When I initially left the theater though stunned in a sense of sheer awe I was quite sure that I got the whole idea Pretty straightforward classic Indieesque Hollywood action film. Wrong. But as I lay in bed earlier this morning trying to gather my thoughts after waking up from a Sucker Punch of a dream I realized that I had missed something The morality of the film. It was deep and the more I think about it the more I realize it. This film had more guts than I realize. It wasn't only great slomo posterwallpaperworthy brilliance Though that it was. It had real soul. In fact I'm toying with the idea of a second watch sort of how you rematch the Matrix Reloaded just for that epic car chase scene but hopefully here to also flesh out some of the ideals behind the whole thing.

If you liked Mr. Synder's the Director past films you like action or you like girls or you're just a man this is a good one.

	schema:reviewBody "Listening to Emily Browning's adaptation of Eurythmics's Sweet Dreams i must say i found some decisions in the moviemaking process very bizarre decisions made mainly by Zack Snyder coming right out of the blue.For example he wrote the script directly as a PG13 movie something very untypical for him.In an interview he stated that the movie was already to cruel and the story itself was too hard on viewers for him to make it an Rrated movie.So he did it directly for PG13.When does that ever stopped him to do it.In Watchmen there were some pretty intense and gross so to say scenes that it was hard to bear.And in Sucker Punch the opening scene was intense full of emotions so was the ending as well but that's not a reason for Zack no to do what he's best at.So that was a sucker punch for the audience and as well a reason for the movie not to fit in to the frame of most Zack Snyder movies.Even his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead was performing better at the domestic box office in it's start not to mention Watchmen and 300.Besides that there are some plot holes to be seen here or there acting to be improved and some other details that need to be touched to be perfect.So saying all that i shall explain why i'll rather give the movie the full note than apply those weaknesses to the note.Zack Snyder has those skills i personally think no other director has.He has the ability to speak to the audience with his style with what we see on screen combined with the powerful soundtracks and songs he and Tyler Bates the composer use.He lets his visually rich and upgraded style speak for himself and that's very unique for him and for the movies he make.There literary is no dialogue in the first few minutes of the movie he allows the viewer to see and be a part of the experience of those frames.The feeling in the viewer is stronger when it's all shown rather than spoken of.Actions are stronger than words.And Zack Snyder knows that.With him words are not necessary for the strenght of a movie.And that he makes perfect good use of.That's what's impressive with his work and that's why i'll give the full note to the movie as i did to 300 and Watchmen despite some flaws and holes.Otherwise the CGI was great the movie as a whole is a visual masterpiece and people will see that a lot of effort and commitment is sacrificed for the quality the movie has.The crystal clear shots made a little 60s like are great and the fight sequences and than the train and castle sequences in the imaginary world that Babydoll's in are great.So there can't be any complaints about that.The acting was something that could've been up a little bit.Emily Browning is very lovable and convincing in her role as Babydoll a young girl who experienced the death of her mother and sister and her stepfather involved in it.He institutionalizes her and she reprises this part of her role almost perfect.She has the needed experience from her last movie The Uninvited where the role is very similar to this one at least most of it.Shid did a perfect job with the other part of her role as well being a somewhat silent but very skillful and good looking deadly warrior killing everything in her way to survive in the imaginary world she creates in the brothel and in the mental institution she's at.Abbie Cornish was also solid in her role as one of the girls in the facility.Vera Gorski and Blue Jones played by Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were good as well although his role is very unpleasant so to say.So the acting was good and it's obvious that the cast had a great time together.That's mainly because of another great choice Zack Snyder and Tyler Bates've made.They let Emily Browning who aside from her acting skills is obviously a talented singer as well perform some of the songs for example Sweet Dreams and Asleep both of witch were reprised and remade perfectly for the film.The voices of the other actresses can be heard in the background of the songs.So that made a great bond between the actors and what helped to improve the movie.So with some great decisions from the team and some great performances from the cast mainly Emily Browning pulling the movie forward the movie ended up as a very entertaining moviegoing experience sad and intense at moments breathtaking and cool in others.All in all it could've been better but i liked it like that as well and in order to get some things straight i'm ready to see it once more.I liked it one of the first movies a really liked this year and although this wasn't Zack Snyder's best effort financially the movie definitely has it's fans and so it marks the true beginning of the movie season.Not Zack Snyder's best but i'll give it the full note anyway.Bring on SupermanMan of Steel!1010 P.S.There are tributes to some classics in the movie classics such as LOTR i'm sure you'll notice them ".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me be blunt in the very beginning This movie is not for everyone. It will be excellent to some and utterly annoying to the others. You expect to have an absurd actionflick with some minimal plot to keep it together then halfway into the story the movie comes out and kicks you in the face. It's a rough story depressing uncomfortable and unpleasant. It's about abuse affliction and evil living amongst us it's about fighting for survival and struggling for escape. A rather bitter cup to swallow. It could have been your typical institutional drama. But it chose to be something else it chose to present itself in an absurd way approaching the theme in dreamlike visions. If one can accept its heavy use of metaphors one will really enjoy it. The multilayer narration also adds to the atmosphere therefore to the final result. Snyder chose to experiment with storytelling methods and it was an excellent move. There is a certain trainsequence which is filled with slowmotion effects. First it is annoying but only after the scene realize that slomo is there for a reason. The dreams are vivid wild beyond regular imagination. Jena Malone Abbie Cornish and Oscar Isaac are brilliant in their roles. The only thing I missed is character progression but it is remedied in the extended version.If you can take steampowered German zombies and other abstract visions and also like harsh stories presented by these metaphors I strongly recommend to give it a try. It's a great movie with an important theme in the background which can move one's heart. Also it has Jena Malone in it. Come on only the blind and bleareyed aren't in love with her.".

Still I am not always consistent with this and sometimes movies like this one painfully bring me back to the right path.La conjura de El Escorial could have been excellent. Excellent as most of its actors a very experienced international cast or its historical recreation location spots costumes. And yet A good movie needs a good script. When the script is bad and this one is awful or to say the least very uneven all hope is lost. The narrative is hesitant there are several unneeded distracting and even positively disgusting scenes the entire lovestory subplot of course there is one! is hard to believe simplistic and boring The movie's changing pace is made worse by the editing for instance a fadeout between two scenes with some 20 seconds between them and involving the same characters. I also suspect the poor editing is to blame for not understanding how and why a number of scenes take place the character's reasons for a change of mind and son on. Quite true some takes are brilliantly shot but others are simply laughable NOT funny. Take the fights for instance. I was wondering why they forgot to play the theme tune of Benny hill's show. Bud Spencer or Terrence Hill could have signed it but we're talking of a 16th century sword fight Poor action scenes bad editing mostly static dialogs technically speaking this is more of a play than a movie.All things considered I believe Antonio del Real director and scriptwriter here is much to blame for this waste of my time and money. The movie is worth watching perhaps if you like costumes or have a historical interest in 16th century life in Spain. Also it is probably one of the best renditions of Phillip 2nd of Spain a very interesting king much unlike most productions. But if you like movies please forget this one.".

	schema:headline " Watch it for the intrigue not the swordplay";
	schema:reviewBody "The 'conjuration' in the title refers to a real event the political assassination in Madrid of a highranking official in the Spanish court in 1578. A plaque marks the spot today in the exact corner of the street where it happened.The script begins with the scene of the murder and then takes us back to recount the events leading up to it. There are many characters involved and although at the beginning it is not clear why we are being introduced to so many eventually they all find a reason for being there from a priest who ends up a the centre of the investigation to a young 'morisca' a halfMoorish girl who is plucked from the streets to serve in a rich house.The film is not very imaginatively shot and some of the expository dialogue is quite clumsy some actors seem to be there just to summarise in words what the atmosphere at the time was which is always a pitfall in historical films. Many actors means many lines of dialogue and this film not short about two hours and a quarter long is full of conversations often stilted and stagy. There's a lot of standing upright with broody brows with the purpose of looking imposing and serious in bunches around the king or other important characters. It is not a slow film however but it's not a swashbuckler either. In fact the one time when we are given a good old swordfight it goes so lamely clichd with stalls of fruit and ceramic bowls being turned upside down in a street market and a couple of unrealistic fight moves that it feels utterly wrong.In its favour the costumes are great and many scenes are shot at El Escorial itself the palacecummonastery where king Phillip II pored over the business of governing the world's leading superpower. Some of the actors are quite good in their roles and this despite a cast mixing Spanish and foreign stars. I would single out for praise Julia Ormond who looks not a day younger than her 43 years old. With her ageing beauty she brings alive one of the most fascinating characters of her time the eyepatchwearing princess of Eboli. Joaquim de Almeida is also very good as the vigorous secretary Juan de Escobedo acting his scenes with muchneeded energy. It is a pity though that the role of Jason Isaacs Antonio Prez fizzles out somewhat towards the end when he should be one of the most memorable characters according to the real story. Juanjo Puigcorb plays a more ironic and even affable Phillip than the sombre and adust quasimonk we have seen in other portrayals. And I personally took a liking to Jrgen Prochnow's character a local 'alguacil' sheriff who becomes involved in the matter both through his job and his private life.The question at the heart of the film is did King Phillip II order the dismissal of one of his own officials? This has been much debated by historians and the evidence is not conclusive. It may have been in his favour because of political rivalries but the public backlash would have been uncomfortable as it in fact was even for a monarch as selfassured and with so great a grip on power as he happened to be. This matter is one of the central charges against him laid out by the socalled 'Leyenda negra' Black legend with which other European rulers and political enemies sought to discredit him in public in particular in the Netherlands and Britain. Whether the film takes a stance on it or not you will have to see it.".

It is a pity though that the role of Jason Isaacs Antonio Prez fizzles out somewhat towards the end when he should be one of the most memorable characters according to the real story. Juanjo Puigcorb plays a more ironic and even affable Phillip than the sombre and adust quasimonk we have seen in other portrayals. And I personally took a liking to Jrgen Prochnow's character a local 'alguacil' sheriff who becomes involved in the matter both through his job and his private life.The question at the heart of the film is did King Phillip II order the dismissal of one of his own officials? This has been much debated by historians and the evidence is not conclusive. It may have been in his favour because of political rivalries but the public backlash would have been uncomfortable as it in fact was even for a monarch as selfassured and with so great a grip on power as he happened to be. This matter is one of the central charges against him laid out by the socalled 'Leyenda negra' Black legend with which other European rulers and political enemies sought to discredit him in public in particular in the Netherlands and Britain. Whether the film takes a stance on it or not you will have to see it.";

	schema:headline " Accurate history of Philip ll Spain in case anybody cares";
	schema:reviewBody "Almost every historical movie is mostly movie and very little history. The fault of La conjura de El Escorial is that for once it might be too much history. The action takes place in the court of Spain's King Philip ll. The year is 1578 and the crisis is about the war against the rebels Protestant supporters of William of Orange in the Netherlands. There are two views at the court. The aging Duke of Alba a blunt military man would go to all out war and the young and progressive Prime Minister Antonio Perez Jason Isaacsobjects to the expense of the war and argues for a negotiated settlement. The Spanish regent in the Netherlands was Don Juan of Austria the hero of Lepanto and bastard of Charles V and Philips' half brother. Philip is worried that Don Juan might be too ambitious so Perez sends Juan de Escobedo Joaquim de Almeida to be Don Juan's secretary. Sort of a plant but Escobedo turned and became Don Juan's man. This is all about Escobedo. He returns to Madrid and becomes aware that Perez has been treacherous maybe even treasonous manipulating the situation to his own advantage sowing doubt in the king's mind against Don Juan. Perez's lovercoconspirator is the Princess of Eboli Julia Ormond complete with eyepatch. Escobedo comes into possession of papers proving their disloyalty and they plot his murder. After poisoning fails they have him set upon in the streets and murdered on Easter Monday 1578. The rest of the film is rather like CostaGavris' Z as the plot is uncovered as a 16th century police procedural.Though it's a Spanish film I saw the film dubbed into English with Spanish subtitles and the voices were so similar and the men period properly bearded that it took a couple of minutes to distinguish the protagonists. The film is just straight ahead history. There is sub plot of a doomed love between a constable Jurgen Porchnow and a poor morisco girl Blanca Jara. Escobedo was poisoned three times but in the film there is only one attempt. Just necessary concision. There is a rather desultory sword fight routine stuff. Other than that one could write a tolerable term paper from having seen the film.It could be interesting if you're interested in history. However there are no good looking ex models in their 20s with great cheekbones David Bowie on the soundtrack 'splosions  Perseus not marring Andromeda and other anachronisms so it will not as they say find its audience. TORA TORA TORA the story of Pearl Harbor told from both points of view and tirelessly researched and recreated was sorry a bomb at the box office. The sequel MIDWAY which made use of a lot of left over material and was full of soap opera conventions watered down and sentimentalized history made money at the box office. Several years ago I saw a Czech film from the socialist period about the Munich crisis of 1938. It was an education but again not something the general public could be interested in. However I am now fully conversant with the minutia of the period. This role the historical film the accurate historical film has been supplanted by the widespread contemporary technique in documentaries of recreation. Documentaries now have cast lists props and costumes.Once upon a time in fact from the very beginning of the feature film the historical costume picture was a staple of the film industry. These were basically fiction films like say The Three Musqueteers. It is a rarity today the challenge being to contemporize everything for a young audience but in truth an historical film which was both excitingly cinematic and accurate is a promise which the cinema has left unachieved except in rare instances like THE PIANIST. British war movies of the 50s and 60s tended to be non sensational and accurate. But that's what they call the living past. The remote past is anybody's game. GLORIOUS BASTERDS played as fast and loose with recent history as a gladiator or crusades picture do without drawing attention to themselves. We know how WW2 turned out but how many know how the 3rd Crusade ended? The pity is that film is the perfect medium to recreate history and history is itself more exciting than the dull assemblies of clichs and standardized stories which attempt to pander to a narrow minded audience.King Philip is the king because we are told he is. His behavior does not categorize him as cruel generous greedy brave or any other comfortable stereotype. People tend to want to easily pigeonhole characters to facilitate involvement in the story. A rooting element its called usually based on prejudice and preconceived ideas. A drama containing Richard The Lion Heart and Philip Augustus of France will play to the audiences notion of Richard as a hale fellow honest fair magnanimous open and brave while Philip is sly untrustworthy cowardly etc. Find a jolly open faced actor for Richard and a mean narrow faced one for Philip. Let the audience figure it out from there. In this picture Philip ll is merely a man a clever and experienced one at that but merely a man. He is capable of errors but he doesn't go around in a perpetual temper tantrum as movie kings so often do.The version I saw was 128 min. but there is a 150 minute version too. I think they cut out some courtroom action as well a fuller explanation of Perez' and Eboli's motivation for their plot.Unfortunately while the story of La conjura de El Escorial is faultlessly presented it is nothing that would interest a contemporary audience in the first place. Even tarted up it would be like colorizing an old movie no one is really interested in anyway. For the history student only lightly familiar with the period and events its an education.".

The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened or at least as the book says it happened and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league compared to other Hindi movies though the editing is choppy in places. The music by Indian Ocean is brilliant and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip and that's really commendable.I haven't seen Satya and I am sorry for that so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work though he also did the dialogues I believe for Yuva which I have seen but considering the smoke he generates with every movie I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything  even the correct language  which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.The actors with Kay Kay he should be getting awards for this one and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention do a very good job too and I think many of them are of a theatre background which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently wellmade series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years and brilliant performances aren't new to him.The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly and thankfully the movie and so I suppose the book too is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.To finish off this is one of those very rare movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and songanddance routines.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Friday caught up with so many controversies that many in Mumbai never thought that it would ever see the light of the day.Now almost 2 years after the date on which it was slated to releasedoes it live up to its expectations? well it surely does and how!!!It is not a movie to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon nor is it an entertaining popcorn extravaganza. Black Friday is amongst the best films Indian cinema has ever produced but it is not a movie for everyone. I had my fair share of disappointments and I think many audiences will walk away unsatisfied by its documentarylike style and unusual structure. The movie based on the book of Hussain Zaidi tracks the investigation that takes place followed by the dreadful Bombay serial bomb blast in '93. the foray of the Indian cinema into investigative journalism is splendid to say the least. what makes the film a lot more riveting is the fact that it is not afraid to take names of all those involved in the conspiracy. Hence it has mixed up with a myriad of controversies. For this alone the directors and producers should be applauded for sticking their neck out.The music by Indian ocean gives the movie a life of its own and especially in the final blast scene the eerie noise that is made is something that can just be experienced in the theaters. The screenplay with its tautness effectively delivers the movie and third person view which it assumes adds another shade to the movie as a whole. Finally the editing does seem to be a tad bit less crisp towards the end but still especially in the first half it is just perfect.The usage of cranial cameras to capture the top views of Mumbai or the monochromatic shots during the investigation is a pleasure to watch. In fact using the metaphor of a dog to capture the melancholy withing Badshaah Khan's head is simply marvelous to watch. The acting throughout the movie is par excellence and the uncanny resemblance to Dawood Ibrahim is amongst the other reasons why this movie is a must watch for any one.Finally this movie with the focus on Bombay Bomb blast has covered lots of issues including the stress on the Police during investigation along with the perspectives from all sides. Yet towards the end the message remains global that to stop shedding innocent blood in the name of religion for those who are caught in this web are none but jobless chas as so correctly pointed out by Inspector.Rakesh Maria. Its canvas is not just Mumbai but places including Iraq Afghanistan911. It shall be if nothing else a textbook to not just learn the technicalities of cinema but also to understand history from a wider perspective.".

Anurag Kashyap's foray into Bollywood was marred by the judiciary for more than 2 years but finally the wait ended a few days back. And we were given the privilege to see the true potential of Indian film making. The topic was sensitive. Highly sensitive one of the most tragic events in the last 3 decades in Indian history an event which made Don Dawood Ibrahim as the 1 wanted man in India.Right from the beginning the interrogation sequence where the prisoner confessesSir bombs are about to explode in the city sir Right from that word till the last scene where Tiger Memon saysMumbai mein dhamaka macha dega hum. you are glued to your seat wondering what will the director make you see next ? The casting for the movie was in my opinion perfect. One may criticize that Kay Kay Memon was underused but in my opinion he was just perfect. He wasn't given much screen appearance but whatever time he had he brought everyone to their feet. His dialogs brought the entire theater applauding. Aditya Srivastava and Pawan Malhotra were equally good if not better. Pawan Malhotra's portrayal of the underworld don Tiger Memon was just superb. Same goes for Aditya Srivastava's portrayal of Badshah Khan the terrorist who turned as a police witness. His struggle to escape the country from the clutches of Mumbai police was just marvelously portrayed. A person helplessly running around the country lack of money being chased around by an unknown force. And when mentioning the casting one cannot but ignore Vijay Maurya as the feared Dawood Ibrahim. He was given about a couple of minutes at maximum of screen presence but even in that minute period he brought a shiver up your spines.Black Friday is also a very good technical movie. The special effects used are pretty advanced and are at par with Hollywood. The script although adapted is superb. Every expression dialog will make you feel for the characters in the movie.Just remember this isn't a movie about Hindus or Muslims. At first you feel for all the people getting killed by the blasts but later when the riots are shown then you feel for the Muslims as well. But this ain't a movie for any of the religious sentiments. Its about the society as a whole in those few years in Mumbai. This is the type of movie that India should send to Oscars and other film festivalsawards. The world should be made known that we can make movies that will claim fame and bring India to the global picture.1010 !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Anurag KashyapTake a bow! Black Friday is sincerely the greatest piece of cinematic magic to be released ever. You and your team have produced cinema of the highest quality raised the notch by a few miles and used this medium like never before hats off to you sir!I must admit that I am slightly biased toward your film because I have been born and brought up in Bombay and on March 12 1993 the day of the serial blasts was just 8 years old. As Salman Rushdie famously calls children born during the era of Indian Independence as Midnight Children i would like to say we are but Blast Children. Children whose innocence has been shattered mercilessly by the underworld and extremists from every religion and you have portrayed just that in your film. The film does not hype terrorism or romanticize the darkness of Bombay or the coldness of its police like many other so called underworld films do but portrays exactly what happens in reality the human side. Sir your film has merged the very shady line between cinematic magic fiction and reality to an intoxicating mix of actuality.Pawan Malhotra Tiger Memon Kay Kay Rakesh Maria and Aditya Srivastava Badhshah Khan do not act they live and breathe the very sentiments of these real life people. As a viewing audience I never once felt like I was watching a film but felt like a 'fly on the wall' as the plot unfolds before your very eyes the very same helplessness as Mumbaikars felt on that very day of the bomb blasts. The music by Indian Ocean is outstanding it flows as easily as your reel does and blends so very brilliantly with the script. The cold chill that trickles down your spine as Dawood Ibrahim is shown in his mansion in Dubai is breathtaking. The authenticity of Bombay and its various locations from fast food restaurants in Bandra to the passport office in Worli is worth many many accolades. Mr. Kashyap this film has struck the very chord of life in cinema once more. I'm sure everybody who watches it will share similar sentiments as I do. I am glad that the 2 year dustbin wait for your film did not deter you from eventually getting it released. You are not alone sir the world supports your work with open arms. The silver screen is worth visiting again. Thank you sir and take a bow again..Yours sincerely Aditya".

	schema:headline " Black Friday  a tremendous film that goes places most Hindi films don't";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the opportunity to see the film at a screening in Berkeley as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival. Hopefully it will one day be released in India.1. The student has surpassed the master. Ram Gopal Varma may think he is pushing the envelope but Anurag Kashyap has REALLY done that. Make no mistake about it Kashyap was a big part of the genius behind Satya and it shows in the writing pacing and even in some of the shots of Black Friday 2. The film is as politically incorrect as Mani Ratnam's Bombay was correct 3. When Satya released Ali Peter John of Screen magazine had a review titled 'Listen Mr. President Listen every Indian.' He went on to say about Satya in his review 'That's why it must be seen by every Indian who still loves the truth by every Indian who still swears he is an Indian.' These comments are equally valid with regards to Black Friday. There is no doubt that Kashyap is obsessed with the truth 4. So enough about other films on to Black Friday. The film has a nonlinear format not because it makes the story more interesting but because its the most impactful and nearly only way the story can be told. The film starts on March 9th three days before the bomb blasts in Bombay and travels all the way forward to 1994 and all the way back to the riots in Bombay in December of 1992. The movie uses the chapters of the book its based on by Hussain Zaidi as benchmarks.5. If I had to classify the film I would say its a docudrama. Its constructed as if it were part of the case for the prosecution not my words its in the prologue of the film. Kashyap uses real raw footage here and there.6. One of the great triumphs of this film is that it is strikingly objective. And I do not say this from my point of view. I cannot fathom how anyone cannot find this film objective from ANY point of view mainly because the film HAS no point of view it wants the truth. Even if one disagrees with me on this it is at the very least the least subjective film I've seen on such a big politicalhistorical event in India.7. Kay Kay as Inspector Rakesh Maria is absolutely fantastic in this film though his screen time was limited there are over 200 characters named in this film go figure. The surprise packet here is Aditya Srivastava who absolutely nailed his character. Of course he has had minor roles in most of these films he was Khandilkar in Satya but I think he is an actor whose films I will definitely look out for.8. The film does a remarkable job of delving into the psyche of a terrorist AFTER an attack takes place and he is on the run and I might add here that its the first film I've seen to do this Of course this is probably well delineated in the book but Kashyap brings it to the silver screen with great emotion and extracts a as I stated above marvelous performance from Srivastava it wouldn't have worked without him in the process. The film goes into the psyche of the terrorist after the attacks to help the audience understand why he would SPOILER a very MINOR one though squeal.9. The film has no songs but is still as long as your everyday Hindi film. The pacing is fantastic though.10. The cinematography is outstanding. There are a couple of extraordinary sequences one of which is a rather comedic footchase scene 11. The background score is also outstanding and used wisely. Kashyap uses different stylestype of music throughout various chapters of the film. I don't know who did the score but in general the rule of thumb for fantastic background scores in recent last 15 years or so in Hindi cinema has been 1. its done by A.R. Rahman or 2. its in a Ram Gopal Varma film. This breaks that trend.12. The show I went to sold out as expected and at the end of it you could have heard the slightest bit of movement there was pindrop silence.13. The film's best scene arguably is an interrogation between Rakesh Maria Kay Kay and Badshah Khan Aditya Srivastava. The dialogue here deals with communalreligious violence without being clichd. The dialogue by Kay Kay is so great that one would think that it was spoken by some great historical figure when it was actually merely written by Kashyap! I thought of the scene in Lagaan when Bhuvan gives a discourse on casteism when I saw this scene in Black Friday. Of course the scenes are different but their nature is the same in the sense that the dialogue is so far reaching and that it deals with complicated sociopolitical issues. The scene in Black Friday is infinitely more effective than its counterpart in Lagaan. They should just give Kay Kay awards for that scene alone Srivastava was great as well.14. The film begins and ends with the quote by Gandhi 'An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind'".

	onyx:emotionText "I had the opportunity to see the film at a screening in Berkeley as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival. Hopefully it will one day be released in India.1. The student has surpassed the master. Ram Gopal Varma may think he is pushing the envelope but Anurag Kashyap has REALLY done that. Make no mistake about it Kashyap was a big part of the genius behind Satya and it shows in the writing pacing and even in some of the shots of Black Friday 2. The film is as politically incorrect as Mani Ratnam's Bombay was correct 3. When Satya released Ali Peter John of Screen magazine had a review titled 'Listen Mr. President Listen every Indian.' He went on to say about Satya in his review 'That's why it must be seen by every Indian who still loves the truth by every Indian who still swears he is an Indian.' These comments are equally valid with regards to Black Friday. There is no doubt that Kashyap is obsessed with the truth 4. So enough about other films on to Black Friday. The film has a nonlinear format not because it makes the story more interesting but because its the most impactful and nearly only way the story can be told. The film starts on March 9th three days before the bomb blasts in Bombay and travels all the way forward to 1994 and all the way back to the riots in Bombay in December of 1992. The movie uses the chapters of the book its based on by Hussain Zaidi as benchmarks.5. If I had to classify the film I would say its a docudrama. Its constructed as if it were part of the case for the prosecution not my words its in the prologue of the film. Kashyap uses real raw footage here and there.6. One of the great triumphs of this film is that it is strikingly objective. And I do not say this from my point of view. I cannot fathom how anyone cannot find this film objective from ANY point of view mainly because the film HAS no point of view it wants the truth. Even if one disagrees with me on this it is at the very least the least subjective film I've seen on such a big politicalhistorical event in India.7. Kay Kay as Inspector Rakesh Maria is absolutely fantastic in this film though his screen time was limited there are over 200 characters named in this film go figure.

I remember landing up at tuitions on 6th December 1992 and waiting for my friends to turn up friends who lived very near the area most affected by the riots... I remember hearing that riots have broken out because the Babri Masjid has been demolished... I remember passing that week hidden behind blackened windows and Bombay looking like a dead city my hysterical mother not even letting us children go down to the street to play. I remember the undercurrent of tension amongst communal solidarity between the hindus and muslims even where the riots did not reach.I remember 6th January 1993 even more clearly A day when worried parents gathered out in the school football ground to pick up their children Riots had broken out again. I remember my driver maneuvering the car expertly through bylanes and little side roads protecting us kids from angry approaching mobs mobs who would not differentiate between hindu and Muslim child or adult... all they wanted was blood.Even at fifteen I knew that the January riots were political not communal. The politicians of the day had seized the opportunity to make their power plays giving it a communal twist and the uneducated scared or frustrated sometimes allthree common man fell for it and became part of it.I remember joining a charitable organization and handing out food to what seemed to be millions of people who had lost their homes and families. sitting at VT station.And I remember the 12th of March 1993 clearer than anything. I was in school and the sound of what was probably the century Bazaar blast tore through the air in the afternoon in the middle of the exam hall. It was the last day of the 10th Standard Board exams And we didn't know what the sound was Someone made a joke for me to stop farting...It was only when we got out of school that we heard about the blasts. All sorts of news started filtering in but we didn't know exactly what the magnitude of the attack was until we got home that is. When I got home all the windows of our living room were broken just from the shock waves of the Air India Building blast.The following few months were spent in dread looking over our shoulders. Even then I knew that this was in retaliation to the riots And even then we were looking for answers. We waited making heroes out of policemen and martyrs of the common people who died that day waiting for some kind of answer some justification to the madness.Now fourteen years hence The film comes along and reminds me of how big in magnitude the attack actually was and how it had impacted my mind forever.When I had heard of the film being banned I was sad I had heard so much about Anurag Kashyap but the censor board seemed to hate him not allowing any film of his to be released. From the day I heard that he was making this film I had wanted to see it. And I am glad I did.The film gave me personally a sense of some kind of answers some sense of what happened and why it happened. It was directed with panache precise and to the point without resorting to jingoism and anticommunal will. All it did was present what is now believed to be fact in a format that comes together superbly. Brisk editing masterful direction and real earthy performances. It is exactly how a film should be made. A special mention should go to the real hero of the film Mumbai City always a picture of resilience and strength and the film shows that. Despite the blasts the riots and all the Chaos Mumbai moves on and thats what the city does to its people as well. Gives them a strength that can only be understood if you spend some time living in the city.If only the powers that be wake up take notice and put their money behind Anurag Kashyap so that he can go on to make more Cinema that can put India on the map.".

	schema:headline " A bold fantastic and pathbreaking film";
	schema:reviewBody "Anurag Kashyap's film 'Black Friday' is quite possibly the most important film of 2007 and as relevant today as it was two years ago when it was banned.Based on the book by S Hussain Zaidi the film shows the events that led up to and followed the serial blasts that shook Mumbai on 12th March 1993 from three very interestingly chosen points of view  The mastermind Tiger Memon the unsuspecting misguided foot soldier Badshah Khan and the hapless and underequipped police Rakesh Maria.The film follows an episodic format and keeps jumping in time and location quite regularly. However kudos to Anurag Kashyap for his taut screenplay and brilliant direction and to Aarti Bajaj for her dexterous editing that make sure you don't lose track of the goings on. The performances are top notch be it Pavan Malhotra as the scheming vengeful and manipulative Tiger Memon Aaditya Srivastava as the misled disillusioned jehadi Badshah Khan or K.K Menon as Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria who manages to convey more about the rigors and moral dilemmas of a police officer through his eyes than most talented actors can with the best of dialogues. The dialogue is so fantastic in its realism that you almost feel like you're watching a documentary. Action set design and sound are among the best yet remember they were done more than 2 years ago and give the film a very troublingly real look.An all round masterpiece this film deserves to be seen by one and all not just because of its cinematic brilliance but also for its relevance in today's troubled times.But I do have one grouse. How can the censor board allow words like Madar and Bhen in a film like Omkara and bleep the same words in Black Friday? It's unnecessary and unfair not just to the filmmakers but also to the viewer.".

I felt how a genuine appreciable and real effort can go wasted on box office. Such movies should run well even on box office as well as in award functions.Kay Kay Menon is one of my favorite actor as well as Pavan Malhotra in his intense role playing. Hats off again to this movie from 1st scene to last one. The sequence of Badshah Khan moving Rampur to Jaipur to Kolkata and back to Rampur is truly worthwatching. I know this movie didn't mean to earn profits or a MASALA FLICK that's why it became a serious cinema and worth watching.Anurag Kashyap has really done a brilliant and hardhitting job. I wanted to see this movie from the moment I came to knowledge about it. I really enjoyed every moment though I found there were many censor cuts during the movie and BEEP tones during bad words speaking. Anurag made it hardcore real.I am not here to reveal or tell the story as it will spoil concentration and excitement of the watchers who didn't watch this movie yet. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BY BEING A REAL MOVIEWATCHER TO SEE THIS MOVIE ANY WAY YOU CAN GET IT.I learned that because of politicians' dirty plays games and just because of their selfishness such incidences happens frequently in our country and which interrupts India to move further progressively. Such degressing tact cheats and bad intentions of our politicians ruins peace between 2 religions and whatever they do they do just for their own benefit. How many innocent people were killed during such riots and blasts that's nightmarish thought and DID THIS POLITICIANS EVER THINK ABOUT THEIR INNOCENT FAMILIES WHILE PLANNING SUCH THINGS? My anger is purely towards THE POLITICIANS not to any Hindu or Muslim. Now our young generation must come up with their new ideas intelligence and unity to fail such bad and dishonest intentions of Indian POLITICIANS.BLACK Friday is most worth watching that's all.".

No matter how much you prepare yourself for it you will still be getting shocked by it.I was waiting so desperately for the movie ever since I came to know about Anurag Kashyap. I was mesmerized by one of his interviews in which he blasted all the conventional thinking present in Hindi cinema. Finally it got released after 2 years of ban.So the movie claims to be the truth behind the Bombay Blasts. It not just covers the Bombay Bomb Blasts but also other events that led to them like Babri Masjid demolition and riots after that. But still it is a version of Anurag Kashyap or rather S Hussain Zaidi on whose book the movie is based. It follows the same pattern of chapters given in the book.The depiction of what all happened is the closest one can ever get to the reality on big screen. And the inclusion of various real video footages which apart from making the movie sometimes seem like a documentary only enhances its credibility. The shooting is done at all the real places and that makes it much more real. For some scenes even hidden cameras were used to capture genuine reactions of people. And even after being a two year old movie it is technically brilliant.Calling this movie great would be a gross understatement. Everything in the movie is just perfect. It has entered my list of alltime favorite movies. The actors seem like they were born to play these roles only. Pawan Malhotra as Tiger Memon and Kay Kay are steal the show while others like one playing Badshah Khan are also no less wonderful in their portrayal. Other aspect is that how daring the movie is. It openly takes names of various real political personalities who are alive today Advani Thakrey Jethmalani and shows how the training camps are organized in Pakistan by ISI to give training to jehadis.As far the message of the movie goes I think every Indian should see the movie and understand that violence is not the mean to achieve anything. Watching what kind of things people do to each other in the name of religion sometimes makes me feel ashamed of my religion. Don't miss this movie for anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would give this film a 10 out of 10 but I don't think any film can be perfect. Anurag you are a genius! This film is great. Not only is it a true story but it has been shot in a very unique fashion...The flashbacks etc make this film so unique. Also the red shots and the blue shots also give a feel of reality. The acting cinematography editing and action was all top notch and made the film very realistic. This is not your everyday masala popcorn flick but a very well made thought provoking film. It's really sad that the Indian government can't handle reality. This film shouldn't have been banned. The public should know what happened in 1993. This was a very good movie but only for those who enjoy realistic films. This along with a few other bollywood films Omkara dor rang de basanthi goes against the stereotype that all bollywood films have a set formula of a boy meeting a girl and dancing and singing. It's sad and pathetic how films like these don't get popular internationally. Many foreigners think of Bollywood as escapist cinema with cheesy dance numbers. More films like black Friday need to release And become popular in order to destroy this generalization among foreigners.".

Kay Kay Menon and Aditya Srivastava have delivered yet another stunning performance. The movie is about the '93 Bombay blasts and the investigation that followed.

Badshah Khan mentions that Allah or Khuda is on their side. At this KK says that if Allah was at your side you would not have left that Maruti Van near Siemens. And then the dialog that follows is captivating. Great job Anurag Kashyap  I am going to recommend this movie to everyone I know and tell them that if they want a taste of reality and are sick of Karan Johar and SalaamEIshq kind of movies this is the real deal.

It could be attributed to the movie being a book adaptation but I can't comment on it as I have not read the book. The way the narrative moves back and forth in time is remarkably impressive Anurag has pulled it off brilliantly and that gives a sense of timeless unrestrained cinema. A few sequences from the movie are memorable they stay long enough with you the second interrogation scene the chase sequence which definitely has to be one of the best ones I have seen so far the disillusion phase of Badshah where the movie scores beyond the paradigm of a mere gangster flick it addresses the finer aspects of the human psyche as it reacts to a choice of a lifelong passiongood or bad the interrogation scene featuring the assistant copnow watch out for the awesome camera work and lights in this one! the hotel scene between Badshah and friends that erupts like a dormant volcano suddenly came to life. A special mention for the meticulous work on the music it simply carries the narrative to starry heights. But there are a few glitches too a funny Dawood some undesired sequences in Dubai towards the end that do not carry much meat. But overall a commendable effort. I have already seen this one twice and rediscovered some altogether new aspects the second time. I think this movie has layers that lay unexplored if you lack an eye for cinematic detail. I will just give you one example the sequence where Badshah haplessly looks at a man playing with his dog says much more than any amount of dialog or sound could have done or the never ending quagmire of the conflict between objectivity and subjectivity of the facts as they happened.

BLACK FRIDAY is a shocking heartbreaking and haunting crime saga which is as thrilling as it is emotional.BLACK FRIDAY is a very dark film to the core though there are a few naturally funny moments too. It's not a film for the faint of heart. The film is replete with violence expletives and horrifying sequences and it does complete justice to its subject. There are a lot of characters and they are so realistically portrayed that you'll both love and hate them from time to time.The film doesn't glorify crime in any way and instead condemns it in the best possible way. Some dialogues are really hardhitting and memorable enough to be remembered forever. The usage of music throughout the film is excellent it never hinders the film's pace. The action sequences are filmed very well and add a haunting depth to the film. The cinematography adds a very realistic touch to the film as well.The climax left me speechless and breathless plus the rolling title credits accompanied by a dark and haunting song broke my heart into many pieces.BLACK FRIDAY is a brilliantly made film and there are no two opinions on this. It takes a lot courage to make films like this and I really salute Anurag for choosing to make and stand by the film when the world seemed to stand against him.".

It also puts light on the criminals involved and how justice was obtained.I would like to talk about other factors that came to my mind while watching the movie.Consider love of people belonging to Islam. It is great. During the month of Ramzan 1811326114 it can be seen in their fasting. Only because of few of them going along the wrong path entire community should not be questioned. When I turned to Atheism I felt most appropriate religion to be that of Islam. I mean somebody coming into dreams and all that. Today I am again not an atheist I feel what we are presented is stretched a lot in religious texts. A movie came 'Exodus Gods and kings' where events are drawn the way how they could have been in reality not stretched.It is really commendable Anurag Kashyap brings this sort of cinema to see for general public.Consider the heinous crime of rape I don't understand how it is possible to have sex with someone when they are not psychologically involved. Thus I conclude it is more of an animal behavior rather than human. People like me cannot do it. I don't understand how those criminals who do it are built psychologically.In the movie I liked how a True Muslim decides to become a witness and helps in police proceedings.The other thing I liked is that the movie is based on writings of a writer who is Muslim.".

A movie came 'Exodus Gods and kings' where events are drawn the way how they could have been in reality not stretched.It is really commendable Anurag Kashyap brings this sort of cinema to see for general public.Consider the heinous crime of rape I don't understand how it is possible to have sex with someone when they are not psychologically involved. Thus I conclude it is more of an animal behavior rather than human. People like me cannot do it. I don't understand how those criminals who do it are built psychologically.In the movie I liked how a True Muslim decides to become a witness and helps in police proceedings.The other thing I liked is that the movie is based on writings of a writer who is Muslim.";

This film is about this event as well as the subsequent police investigation of it. It's all based on true events but is rather critical of the police and as a result the film was banned in India for two years before the government eventually allowed its release. The film begins with a man under arrest pleading for the police to believe him that a group was planning on burning the Mumbai Stock Exchange. Foolishly the police just dismiss this and soon you see bombs detonating all over the city. All this occurs in the first few minutes of the film and what follows is a step by step documentary style investigation. How the police captured and interrogated suspects and tortured them in some how the mastermind of the bombings abandoned his minions and how the events are all in context as this springs from previous attacks in which hundreds of Muslims were murderedand this makes the quote from Gandhi at the beginning of the film quite appropriate. Overall this is a very hard film to watch in places such as the scene where the police use a hammer on one suspect's hand but is also very well made and unflinching. And unlike a typical Bollywood film it lacks the song and dance numbers and just concentrates on telling the story.By the way I did some checking and as of today one ringleader was arrested and sentenced to death he was executed two years ago. Two main ringleaders are still being sought by the Indian government.".

A smooth celebration of scientific theory and of the romantic partnership of two scientists.The first third of the film is in many ways the best a very funny and sensitive depiction of the courtship of two gauche scientists. Often filmed in longshot on beautifully detailed cavernous sets we see Garson and Pigeon sometimes isolated in space sometimes haltingly moving through crowds tentatively finding their way to each other. Though Mervyn Leroy could be a stolid director here he shows great delicacy and judgment and he perfectly sets a mood of gentle comic romance.The middle third deals with the engrossing scientific mystery that led to the discovery of radium. The lightness of touch and the humor of the first third are not entirely abandoned here but there is a greater seriousness and a kind of reverence for knowledge and scientific endeavor that is virtually absent from films today the exception would be A BEAUTIFUL MIND which I kind of hated. There are some striking visuals including a tracking shot across hundreds of bowls of evaporating chemicals and a haunting image of a glowing dish of radium in a large dark shed.The last third is the dullest and most conventional portion of the film fame and celebration for the Curies and a renewal of their love just before Pierre died prematurely in a traffic accident. The high point here is what surely won Pigeon his Oscar nomination for Best Actor the speech to a jeweler in which he describes the beauty of his wife just before his untimely death. There is also the evocative image of a wet umbrella broken under a wagon wheel.Of course what you think of this idealistic creamy and surefooted vehicle which must have packed 'em in at Radio City Music Hall depends entirely on what you think of Greer Garson as well as your opinion of the popular GarsonPigeon screen team. Their looks and personalities were perfect matches templates of feminine and masculine 'virtues'. There was nothing sexy about them but they suggested a platonic ideal of what every child would wish their parents to be. They were the last stars to make middle age look glamorous and desirable.As for me I like her. Her mannerisms are kept to a minimum in this restrained performance. The famous tinkling laugh the arched eyebrow the flaring nostrils  so overused in some other films  are not much in evidence here. But her best qualities are the sense of intelligence of quiet watchfulness selfpossession dignity and tact are all here. The source of her screen personality has always seemed sane and tranquil relaxing to watch and finally to me admirable. I can understand why some people like critic Pauline Kael felt that Hollywood's ladylike stars presented an outdated oppressive ideal for women. But from this distance Garson's confidence and ease her capability her selfcontainment all strike me as civilized and even sophisticated traits. She played grownups and we have never had enough of those on screen . . .".

In the late nineteenth century a beautiful young Polish woman enrols at the Sorbonne.  Mademoiselle Sklodowska is a brilliant physicist and before long she has been attached to Doctor Curie the shy boffin with the large laboratory.  One day the lives of both scientists are profoundly affected when a colleague shows them the strange radiant properties of certain rocks. Marie and Pierre decide to devote their careers to understanding how minerals can cause changes in a photographic plate.    Mervyn LeRoy I Am A Fugitive Gold Diggers etc directed this conservative little biopic with quiet professionalism.  If the film never truly hits the heights it has to be said that it is a near flawless piece of workmanship.  The writers Osborne and Rameau produced a literate and wellpaced screenplay and the incipient romance between the two shy scientists is depicted with delicacy and gentle humour.    Doctor Curie gradually falls for his gifted student.  The graduation ceremony is cleverly depicted as a crowded sellout which the absentminded doctor almost misses.  We hear but do not see Marie receive the first prize.    The critical point in the relationship comes when Pierre invites Marie to spend a weekend at his parents' country villa.  Marie retires to bed and the agitated Pierre spends the night pacing up and down in his room not entirely sure what is bothering him.  When he finally resolves to propose marriage we see him ascend the stairs walking away from the camera this emphasises his nervousness because he is moving 'out there'.  After Marie accepts Pierre is shot from the reverse angle going back down the stairs  now he 'belongs' to Marie and we see him from her point of view.  The scenes which follow are deeply attractive.  The studio sets of the villa garden and Grenoble are sumptuous and the location shots of the honeymoon absolutely idyllic.  The hard labour back in Paris will seem all the grimmer after this interlude.     The film is almost an hour old before Marie embarks on her discovery of radium.  The experiment to separate uranium and thorium is lit from below resembling the dramatic paintings of Joseph Wright of Derby.  Infinite patience was required during the four years of toil which culminated in the preparation of radium and the film conveys a vivid sense of the Curies' dedication.  The new century begins with the gentle glow of the isolated radium sample a beacon heralding the wonders of the dawning age.    Interesting side issues include the appearance of a very young Robert Walker as David the lab assistant and an equally callow Van Johnson as the cub reporter.  Some lines in the script were perfectly innocent in their day but raise a titter now.  Telling Marie how much she will like his father Pierre goes on to add And my mother's quite gay  you'll enjoy them both!  When Pierre leaves the house in pouring rain on some purpose of his own Marie calls after him Don't forget your rubbers!    Marie's reaction to the news of the accident is well done but her final speech to the Faculty of Science fails to inspire. It is her work that is uplifting not her oratory and the film puts this across.Verdict  Solid wellmade biopic which doesn't quite ignite.".

The film concentrates on the relationship that forms between Pierre  Marie  the science. The script actually allows for a nice balance there.Greer Garson is great as Madame Marie Currie. I can't see many other actresses doing as was as she does in this role. Walter Pidgeon is excellent as Pierre  it is these 2 leads that make the film a good one. There is some quick supporting work from Van Johnson but nothing about his cameo really does a lot for this particular film.This film does show the MGM studio quality as it existed in the 1940's as it goes over very well  is well produced. MGM came into World War 2 as the premiere studio  this film was a strong entry in the biographical film category. It is very obvious that even though the film is set in France near Paris that Paris was not available for location filming due to the war. This is a very good film for it's era being factually based  really painting a positive portrait of who Marie  Pierre Curie were  why they were important in the history of science. It does give short shrift to the couples kids but at over 2 hours the film has too much to cover to do otherwise.".

In the movies at best they have been charming but outoftouch boffins at worst coldhearted and humourless beings. Madame Curie however is a rarity in that it shows scientific folk as being the dreamy romantic types that they so often are in real life.Adapted by scifi novelist Aldous Huxley and others from the biography by Marie Curie's daughter Eve the screenplay makes concession to the fact that Hollywood movies are designed for mass consumption. As such the scientific jargon is dumbed down almost painfully. On the one hand technical talk is skipped over as babble as in a notsodiscrete dissolve during Marie and Pierre's walk home together when she begins quizzing him over formulae and conversely the protagonists seem implausibly clueless at times the idea of the Curies dismissing the stain at the bottom of the bowl and taking days to realise it might be radium is laughable. But nevertheless it's impressive and rewarding the way the writers find ways of making real scientific concepts easily digestible such as the discovery of radium focused in waiting for the right number to appear on a spectroscope.For the two lead roles MGM decided to reteam its starcouple of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon previously seen as Mrs and Mr Miniver in the previous year's Best Picture winner. Sadly they don't compare to their earlier incarnations the interaction between them veering from wooden to melodramatic. However as their on screen relationship develops the affection appears very real and touching. These aren't exceptional performances in their own right but the rapport between the two of them is clear and effective.Thank goodness director Mervyn Leroy has the sense to direct this movie with steady delicacy with long takes and measured performances giving the story the dignity and also the humanity it requires. There's a particularly nice moment where the Curies are by their daughter's bedside Walter Pidgeon telling a story to little Margaret O'Brien Garson sat silent and motionless between them the camera dollying in then out upon her face as the emotion of the moment plays across it.Madame Curie is a far from perfect work and Hollywood will probably never get science quite right. And yet this picture achieves a quite wonderful thing  a marriage between the magical romanticism of that great moviemaking factory and the equal yet misunderstood allure of scientific endeavour. The common ground exists and Madame Curie treads it.".

Pidgeon here is even better here then as Clem Miniver. In this film he shows a frigidness never depicted by him before in films. He appears afraid and incapable of any human relationship. How the two find their way to love is an inspiration to us all.The early part dealing with the separation of radium from barium was tedious at best. Not one to be a science scholar this is some ways reminded me of a horrible chemistry teacher that I had in high school. She too was frigid and very incapable of forming lasting relationships.Fine support is offered from Albert Basserman and Henry Travers the latter being memorable in Mrs. Miniver as well. Dame May Witty briefly appears as Pidgeon's devoted mother. The resurfacing of Garson Pidgeon Travers and Witty was like a reunion of the Miniver characters.Garson really pours on the acting as the film develops. She is devoted to her experiments in physics but shows memorable emotion with the tragic death of Pierre Curie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star in Madame Curie the story of the famous scientist.Actually what is included in the film is quite accurate but much is left out which is normal. The film begins with the Polish Marie meeting Pierre when she is a student in Paris and shares his laboratory. Both of them are too involved in their science careers to get married but they fall in love and do marry.When Marie becomes interested in uranium rays Pierre gives up his research and the two work together. It's grueling disappointing work but they don't give up. The movie shows just how detailed and difficult it was in their makeshift lab.This is a beautiful film about a great woman. I happen to think Greer Garson is wonderful as is Walter Pidgeon. They worked so well together just as Marie and Pierre did  true partners. Of course Marie is in her sixties she died at 66 at the end of the film and looks 90. Typical Hollywood aging  either no aging or decrepit.Marie Curie of course didn't understand the dangers of radium and used to put isotopes in her pocket and in her drawer and would comment on the light emitted from the drawer. She had several medical problems due to radiation poisoning and eventually died of it as did her younger daughter and soninlaw. Strangely her daughter Eva died in 2007 at the age of 103! Go figure. Eva chose Greer Garson to star in the film.If you want to look at Marie Curie's papers and books today  they are still radioactive and one has to wear protective clothing. Like Marie Curie they still emit light.".

Together  through thick and thin so to speak  they pursue the elusive dangerous element of radium finally with success. They are a happy couple Pierre and Marie. They lead irenic lives. They never have arguments like the rest of us. They're joined at the hip by their shared obsession with radioactivity. They have two lovely children too one of them being Margaret O'Brien. Just as their life seemed most fulfilling their joy serene their rapture divine  little did they know that tragedy lay just around the corner. Walter Pidgeon gets run over by a horsedrawn cart full of wine barrels. Suffering in silence despite the comfort offered her by her older mentors and her loving family Greer Garson finally pulls herself together and goes on to win the Nobel Prize and the film ends with the stalwart grayhaired woman giving a speech in Stockholm.Boy is she noble. The movie is divided about fiftyfifty into the story of the search for radium and her family life. Both of these life spaces are studded with failures of one sort or another but Garson sets her considerable jaw and looks fearlessly ahead.I frankly don't know what all that family stuff is doing in there. It could have been sketched in with more brevity. Walter Pidgeon is hardly more than an ancillary character in the movie only to provide the heroine with a love interest and a climactic tragedy. Here's how they work together in their research. Something like this. Garson Suppose the radium did NOT disappear. What if the living element itself were in the stain at the bottom of the bowl? Suppose the energy could be used to destroy unhealthy tissue as well as healthy? Pidgeon excited Yes  go on! There was a BBC production of The Double Helix back in the 80s that managed to make scientific research exhilarating without debasing it with factitious triumphs tragedies and emotional epiphanies. I don't know how much of this movie is made up. I suppose it sticks roughly to the historical facts in its broad outline. We can certainly believe for instance that Marie and Pierre Curie were married and that they had children and that they discovered radium and that she won a Nobel Prize. She won two I believe in physics and in chemistry but I'm too lazy to look it up. The conversations  both the intimate ones between the married couple and the more public ones involving their families  are concocted but probably not more than most runofthemill studio productions of the period. This particular example comes from MGM. Some of the best came from Warner Brothers.One of the film's virtues is the way that the research process is spelled out. It's explained in a way that the alphabet is explained to kindergrtners and that's fine with me. I was really fascinated when they measure the radioactivity of thorium and uranium and realize that there must be a powerful third element in the batch. I wish they had gone into it in more detail and skipped the cute stuff involving the irascible father of Walter Pidgeon. We never do find out what radioactivity is. No one at the time knew anything about the dangers of radiation poisoning. Marie Curie may have died of its effects. Wilhelm Roentgen who discovered Xrays probably killed his own wife by unwitting overexposure during the same period.Another admirable feature of the film is the attention it brings to the discrimination against women that was so common at the time. And it accomplishes this without being strident. It's mentioned a few times notably by Pidgeon but it doesn't sound as if his objections are written for an audience of feminists probably because such an audience to the extent that it existed in 1942 was to the general audience what radium was to pitchblend an almost infinitesimal fraction of a fraction.Anyway the movie does what it set out to do. It introduces us to a couple of courageous scientific geniuses their professional achievements and their family lives. The stuff on the family which I've derided was a specialty of the MGM house.".

We can certainly believe for instance that Marie and Pierre Curie were married and that they had children and that they discovered radium and that she won a Nobel Prize. She won two I believe in physics and in chemistry but I'm too lazy to look it up. The conversations  both the intimate ones between the married couple and the more public ones involving their families  are concocted but probably not more than most runofthemill studio productions of the period. This particular example comes from MGM. Some of the best came from Warner Brothers.One of the film's virtues is the way that the research process is spelled out. It's explained in a way that the alphabet is explained to kindergrtners and that's fine with me. I was really fascinated when they measure the radioactivity of thorium and uranium and realize that there must be a powerful third element in the batch. I wish they had gone into it in more detail and skipped the cute stuff involving the irascible father of Walter Pidgeon. We never do find out what radioactivity is. No one at the time knew anything about the dangers of radiation poisoning. Marie Curie may have died of its effects. Wilhelm Roentgen who discovered Xrays probably killed his own wife by unwitting overexposure during the same period.Another admirable feature of the film is the attention it brings to the discrimination against women that was so common at the time. And it accomplishes this without being strident. It's mentioned a few times notably by Pidgeon but it doesn't sound as if his objections are written for an audience of feminists probably because such an audience to the extent that it existed in 1942 was to the general audience what radium was to pitchblend an almost infinitesimal fraction of a fraction.Anyway the movie does what it set out to do. It introduces us to a couple of courageous scientific geniuses their professional achievements and their family lives. The stuff on the family which I've derided was a specialty of the MGM house.";

It's the earliest film I've seen that shows nonmainstream people interested in other people only by way of the ideas that excite them and a disciplinespecific surrogate family providing strong social support. All that while placing a woman on convincing equal footing with contemporary male intellects. Greer's character makes only small concessions to warmth and conventionHere the heroic boilerplate speeches that are given by the Curies are of their time. The Curies speak in some stilted nobleese as does the narrator. The camera usually occupies film space like a silent polite bourgeoisie Victorian. All of that is dubious. And while dramatically false the movie is still more interesting than I would have ever imagined. I appreciate that it has the courage to be almost dull to mass audiences for lengthy periods. It also assumes audiences are mature enough to observe the tedious isolated methodical nature of scientific experimentation without grousing. I found much of the movie fascinating and thought it a courageous choice in 1943 to let me observe. The movie also adopts a gently comic tone towards the Curies with their strange geeky drives and obsessive interests. Occasionally perhaps at the exact rate an audience needs the movie offers a visual superior to the rest of the film a zoom in to a hand... a time lapse process... a pullback to slowly reveal the impressive scale of an experiment. The always stiff Walter Pidgeon gets some doozies to recite Marie this new concept... if we can prove the existence of this new element it may enable us to look into the secret of life itself deeper than ever before in the history of the world Wow that's the kind of dreck that Pidgeon spouts with total sincerity throughout his whole career. Mind you he says it within a minute of saying something dramatically indistinguishable from it.The purpose of this movie is didactic. The makers of the film clearly believe the goal is to produce better citizens tons of that product would follow in the '50s. Although I only own movies that aim higher than this I have recently concluded that the percentage of unusually good films is sadly just as low among those that have pretensions of art as among those that do not. There might be 1 good mainstream movie a year compared to 1.5 thoughtful films. Most filmmakers have nothing to say. If you like the movie be sure to view the featurette the Romance of Radium which though reductivist and pseudoscientific is still rather interesting.".

The story is quite riveting and human. Full of laughs tragedy and ... a little bit of a love story.Although the movie starts a little slowly it really picks up about one third the way in. The main characters the two mountain climbers and the one female love interest are all solid actors well directed and well casted. The director did a great job at capturing the climb. Everything was so convincingly shot it makes you wonder if they actually filmed some of it on a real mountain. I suppose they must have used CGI but it was used so sparingly and realistically that it must be commended. The contrast between the plight of the mountain climbers and that of the rich bystanders makes the movie so much more emotionally riveting. Some people in the audience cried.This is a tragedy that must be seen. It captures humanity at its best and worst... and shows us that sometimes nature rules our lives and that it is not forgiving.Overall I felt this movie was a small masterpiece. One that will probably not be seen by many.

	schema:reviewBody "All in all I was quite disappointed with this movie. I knew that historical facts had to be a little bit twisted for show's sake but this went too far. The original story is a perfect tragedy in itself it was hard to screw it up but the director somewhat succeeded in it.The movie starts quite well in my opinion the introductory scenes put you in the mood of the Thirties and the side love story seems to be kept in low tones. The first wrong notes come down when the Austrian competition is introduced I was expecting two sound rough mountaineers rivals but not enemies on the screen I see two arrogant silly sneaky men they look like a comic villain from some particularly bad issue of Batman. The same goes on with the two parties on the wall here we have the two heroic Germans and the two silly arrogant and cowardly Austrians. Even more cartoonish... Angerer's broken legs puts another minus sign on the total score  real events were already grim and tragic enough without this gimmick.But it's after the accident that everything goes really haywire becoming Hollywood at its worst. First the self sacrifice by Angerer which apart from historical inaccuracy comes completely out of the blue and out of character. Then the real Eiger disaster pun intended the movie completely switches and becomes a sappy love story and Luise up to now a side character becomes the real protagonist. From now on all realism is forgotten and the mood is completely killed a bombastic soundtrack informs us that she loves him Antifreezegirl spends one night in the storm on the Eiger north face with just a light pullover and an overcoat Spidergirl climbs better than the alpine guides from Switzerland... And so on and so on. I went through the last ten minutes of the movie waiting for the end harder than Kurz hanging from his rope.And then the cherry on the pie in order to show us that Luise distanced herself from Nazism the director shows her taking photos of a black jazz musician in old New York. If you need a definition of anvilicious here you have it. And finally the movie closes on a completely forgettable monologue by Luise quite unasked for and plainly out of contest.The director had a perfect story in its hands and managed to completely waste it with unneeded nationalism and by pasting three quarters of decent mountain movie to a quarter of sappy Hollywood melodramatic trash. The movie deserves to be seen for the wonderful mountain shots but that's the only thing that allows it to get a sufficient grade.".

So last time i was in Grindelwald the village below the Eiger this October i saw in one advertising window of the local cinema the movie Nordwand! Unlucky the movie was booked out on that day so i could not see the film until now! And what can i say the story has everything its thrilling and dramatic and also is a true story. There are a few untrue moments but you can overlook them. So my advice is if you can see in the movies don't wait run and watch it!".

	schema:headline " Not only a spectacular cliffhanging literally thriller but also a touching human story";
	schema:reviewBody "The name of the deadly formidable north face of the Alps Eiger stands for ogre the killer monster. The true story behind this movie happened in 1936 Nazi Germany when at the height of frenzy nationalism two young men were lured by the Government into a deathdefying attempt of the North Face as a symbol of national heroism. The political backdrop however has been wisely downplayed to leave centre stage to a moving human story. Or not quite centre stage which is obviously reserved the ordeal of the mountain climbing heroes.Three young people grew up together in a humble village in the mountains Andreas Hinterstoisser Andi Toni Kurz and Luisse Fellner. At the start of the movie the young men have already become expert mountain climbers but with lowly positions in the army which they now quit to take up the challenge. Luisse works in a major Berlin newspaper mostly making coffee until her childhood acquaintance with the two guys comes to light. This together with her talent in photography wins her a ticket to Switzerland to cover this major event  only if it ends up in either triumph or tragedy. A retreat without conquering the peak would only be good for a few lines of coverage in the third page is her boss's advice.The first half of the movie setting up the scene is well done and holds the audiences' interest winning them over to root for the heroes. The second half unfolds to be an unforgettable cinematic experience. If you don't know anything about this true story don't try to find out more. After all most people who have missed the live coverage of a football game wouldn't want to hear about the scores before they watch the recorded game. The only spoiler I'll let slip here is that this is not so much about a fierce competitive thirst to win but about the noble selfsacrificing human spirit in face of the devastating hostility of nature.Not knowing any of the German actors I can objectively say that casting is excellent. Benno Furmann portrays the taciturn Toni a levelheaded leader who climbs not for fame and glory but just because this is what he loves. Florian Lukas is the childlike excitable passionate Andi who understandably responds to the lure of fame and glory. Johanna Wakalek playing Luisse is not a beauty in a conventional way but has such charm in her character that she will have the audience falling in love with her in no time at all. The love story in the movie is barely discernible which makes it so much more affecting in the end.This is movie is not to be missed by not only fans of mountain climbing but also the general audience.".

What a letdown when the story started straying further and further from what actually happened only to turn into a sappy Hollywoodstyle BSfest. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for completely misrepresenting a gripping and tragic story which didn't have any need whatsoever for fiction to make it compelling. This is my first review on IMDb after many years using the site. The reason is that this film is simply disrespectful to the people involved in the actual events.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cinematography here is brilliant. The film does a wonderful job in portraying the closeup atmosphere that's possible and lethal in some of these violent outdoor places. I think it's easily one of the best climbingthemed films out for this reason. Go and see the movie for breathtaking scenes.I think it was let down not much by the way the climbing theme was tied to the subplots. A third of the film has no mountains in it at all which is fine but as long as it was going to branch into another kind of film I think I would have enjoyed more character development. The Nazi theme is brushed over as background politics with little attempt to show disturbing things were brewing. We barely learn anything about the attitudes of the people involved in the film. I guess this may have been fear of distracting from the film's main theme but which I think could have made the entire story and characters stronger if it were done well and believably.Some details of these subplots also directly interfered with the main climbing theme and maybe believability. eg. The love story presumably tacked on for interest included Luise shouting into a storm and amazingly being heard. I found this very difficult to believe  I've been in what I thought were similar storms at high altitude not dangling from a cliff and had trouble screaming and being heard by people a couple of metres in front of me. Since leaving I've also read conflicting stories about the ending sequence and although there would clearly have to be much creative licence for much of this under the circumstances I now also wonder how much even confirmed facts have been changed to romanticise the story more.All of this is small nitpicking though. If you want to see some awesome cinematography it's a brilliant mountain film which makes it one of my favourite films. It's also not such a bad story if you're less pedantic than myself.".

The Hero Triumphs 2 The Hero dies but hisher task is complete. 3 The hero is united with hisher love. etc.In this movie the director shows how it really was. The characters look genuinely sweaty and tired at the appropriate times. The female lead could not be described as beautiful but thats OK most girls are not beautiful to Hollywood standards. Her acting was entirely natural and believable as was the whole movie.Although the movie climaxes differently from the history in some significant ways I think it is because the director considered his audience. The historical facts are far more terrible than the movie portrays and probably too horrifying for any audience.However the movie portrays the story in a very believable fashion. I had no reason to believe that the shooting was not actually shot on the Eiger.The ending is not a Hollywood ending and I think this is the main strength of the movie. A Hollywood producer would insist on some sort of positive message such as Human Endeavour triumphs over Adversity or something of that nature.However the message of this movie comes through loud and clear How futile and pointless is the human quest for Glory?".

The depiction in this movie is annoying though. There is no critical note to this gloomy period in German history. The German climbers are the good guys the climbers from other countries are depicted as caricatures giving up before even starting or as in the case of the Austrians portrayed as stupid people taking too many risks eventually being the cause of the failure of the German heroes. This bothers me. It feels like I am again looking at one of those propaganda films. The second part of the movie the actual climbing is much better. It feels like the movie was actually shot on that mountain. Computer generated images and studio shots are not obvious so viewer's attention is not drawn away from the struggle these climbers are in. At times it really gave me the rush of being high up on a steep slope only inches away from a certain death. Not being a climber I thought this part of the movie made up for the failing start. All in all it get's a 7 out of 10 from me.".

The terrorizing scenes on the mountain contrast with the spectators below who warm themselves by a cozy fire and drink wine and eat fine food dimly aware of what the mountaineers are going through yet caught up in the romance of a first ascent of the North Face as seen through a telescope on the deck of the restaurant. The movie is a meditation on the role of the press and the chasm between the news account of an event and the reality of the event itself. News reports are as detached from the reality of what is occurring on the mountain as the spectators with their telescopes down below.The climbing seems authentic  there is no Sylvester Stallone swinging by one hand with a grimace on his face no Tom Cruise doing a fancy backtothewall climbing move never before seen on a rock wall. These are either very competent mountaineers or very good facsimiles.The female love interest evolves through the movie. At first she is a mousy secretary easily bullied by her supervisors. Eventually she finds her own strength and in doing so she begins acting on the basis of what she thinks is important and becomes an appealing person in her own right. The photography is stunning.".

This is an award winning German film with English subtitles set in Germany in 1936. The government has encouraged German mountain climbers to show the world how brave and strong they are by climbing this most difficult mountain. The chilling and we do mean ice cold and freezing attempt to do this feat is the main plot of this film. It is based on a true story. Most of it including all the life and death parts of the movie are based on known facts of an actual occurrence. One of the guests at our film screening was a young alpine mountain climber who not only had heard of the actual events shown but verified that all the situations on the mountain  pitfalls and climbing techniques with pitons and ropes etc were quite authentic. This was a period piece nicely depicting the lavish hotel setting at the base of the mountain. However most of the two hours and one minute of this film take place in the outside bitter cold. We also learned that this movie is in the tradition of some great German mountain climbing movies which we haven't seen. While we were caught up with the suspense and adventure we did feel there was too much time up there in the mountain with snow continually falling or alternating between flakes to avalanches. The movie was very skillfully done. The story line was interesting and painful but wasn't complex and stimulating enough for all we had to bear in watching it.".

Im an adventure fan and watched all kinds of adventure movies but neither of them touched my heart so deeply.This was epic  realistic and philosophic. At the end i had an understanding of what nature can do to us and how it is powerful. Human cant rule the nature  we must find out how to live in harmony with the nature. And love. It brings all the happiness and the sorrow. Its just like the nature. I was very inspired after watching the film so i started mounteneering.

Im an adventure fan and watched all kinds of adventure movies but neither of them touched my heart so deeply.This was epic  realistic and philosophic. At the end i had an understanding of what nature can do to us and how it is powerful. Human cant rule the nature  we must find out how to live in harmony with the nature. And love. It brings all the happiness and the sorrow. Its just like the nature. I was very inspired after watching the film so i started mounteneering.

For a few months they were able to live happily as man and wife in a small village near the border of Brazil where they worked as school teachers. Respected by all who knew them and unaware of their real identity Camila and Ladislao were eventually recognized by a priest and captured. Imprisoned and executed without a trial by Rosas' orders their bodies were placed together in a double coffin. At the time of her death Camila was eight months pregnant but perhaps due to censorship the film alters that fact and her execution along with Ladislao's prompted the downfall of Rosas' reign.This is a story that goes beyond doomed love but also focuses upon personal and political freedom.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1982 the Argentine military government seized the Falkland Islands also known as Las Islas Malvinas from the British. The British deployed combat forces to the South Atlantic and recaptured the territory in a war that lasted ten and a half weeks. This led to the downfall of the Argentine military junta and a reversion to democracy establishing conditions which in 1984 brought to the screen a true story that had been suppressed by political religious andor cultural forces for nearly fourteen decades. It is one of the most popular movies in the history of Argentina from among those produced by that nation.Camila refers to Camila O'Gorman and opens very briefly in her childhood with the arrival at her family's ranch of a stagecoach bearing her grandmother who is to be placed under house arrest. Camila's father fully consents to the arrangement siding with the authorities rather than with his mother who is on the wrong side of contemporary political affairs. The opening then shifts forward to Buenos Aires 1847. Camila now a young woman of about 19 is closeted with and huddled over some newborn kittens she knows will earn her father's disapproval if he discovers them. In the late 1840s Argentina is under the control of a dictator General Rosas and the federals. The unitarians some in exile and others trying to stay under the radar as it were are the latent opposition.The plot can be summarized simply A socialite daughter from a wealthy family falls in love with a celibate Jesuit priest. It is not only taboo in a Catholic society but is taboo in a Catholic society at the wrong place and the wrong time and neither the federals nor the unitarians contribute positively to the outcome. As the kittens meet their fate and the opening credits conclude we view a statement dedicating the movie In memory of Camila O'Gorman. History and director Maria Luisa Bemberg are serious about the advisory so be forewarned and be aware also that the movie has an R rating. The film coloring is memorable and Susu Pecoraro in the lead actress role gives a strong performance.".

Yes. 'Camila' certainly pulls the heart strings of any viewer. The final scene is one of the most dramatic in history.The production quality and acting is exceptional. 'Camila' should also be credited as with what it doesn't contain which mostall Hollywood romances do. Overly graphic sex and political agendas.'Camila' is considered controversial for the obvious forbidden romance and Hollywood worried about it being too offensive to Catholics to be a success. As a Catholic myself I dreaded some kind of political speech. I was surprised to see none. In fact there are no types of anti Catholic diatribes or speeches at all. The story is powerful enough to stand alone. We don't need to hear a speech about a father petitioning the governor to override the law and execute his pregnant daughter. The characters know it's just as horrific as the audience.'Camila' is also smart enough to avoid graphic or even passionate sex scenes. In fact there's no nudity simulated sex or even passionate kissing. Only moderate passionate kissing. Again the story is strong enough to stand on its own.I'll never forget the horrific graphic sex scene between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. OK! The audience gets it! They're making love! We do not need to see part A going into part B! Less is more.The only negative point which prevents me from giving 'Camila' a full 10 stars is that more of the drama pulling of heart strings is focused around the lovers' execution rather than their love. I just wasn't feeling to romance. Honestly if the film ended with the lovers riding happily into the sunset I wouldn't recommend it at all. Most of the reviewers here seem to agree. The drama really revolves around the lovers' deaths rather than their lives.".

Directed by Maria Luisa Bemberg Camila tells the story of a passionate woman who will fight for what she desires and is willing to sacrifice everything for it.  The film is true to the times in which it is based and true to the characters it is based on.  Rosas the dictator at the time is portrayed in a way that is also true to history.  The director Bemberg is also a passionate woman and filmmaker who struggled with censorship in the making of this film but prevailed.  Although it is based on real people some of the characters are shaped in order to benefit the ideals of the director but a good film nonetheless.  I also recommend  I the Worst of All by the same director.".

The movie shows the audience the importance of the church and social classes and enables us to view the attitudes and emotions of people living during the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas.  However it is evident that Bemberg has a slight bias in that the movie is seen through the eyes of Camila O'Gorman.  This film is a wonderful example of how the movies intend to manipulate the viewer allowing Camila to have all the rights and giving none to Rosas is rather biased.  The film strongly emphasizes the dictatorship of Rosas and the viewer is given the opportunity to see the profundity and power of this dictator.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vanessa Paradis is most famous today as American superstar Johnny Depp's longtime girlfriend but she is also a FRENCH actress which means she of course she has an early role where she plays a nubile teen in love with a middleaged man. The French penchant for drooling over beautiful teenage girls may be annoying to some but is it really worse than the AmericanHollywood penchant for pretending they're NOT drooling over the beautiful teenage girls that seem to find their way into every other movie somewhere? But really there is no eew factor herethere are no oncamera sex scenes between the man and the girl and 17 or not a few shots of a naked Vanessa Paradis are not going to make ANYONE go eew.The bigger problem with these French lolita movies is the plausibility. Middleage men don't generally date teenage girls not because they find them icky and physically unappealing but because they're very rarely as worldly and sophisticated as the fictional nymphets in these French movies. Moreover even in France very few girls that age are probably too interested in ennuifilled men old enough to be their spry young grandfathers. It's actually understandable that the married middleaged philosophy teacher in this movie would fall in love with his brilliant but troubled student since she is absolutely beautiful clothed and unclothed and wise beyond her years. But Paradis' character is supposed to be this streetwise urchin who has dabbled in prostitution in the past and it is a little hard to believe she'd fall madly obsessively in love with a fifty year man just because he shows her some kindness. Also while 17 may not get you twenty in a French bastile I'm pretty sure it would get you kicked out of the teaching profession.Paradis is indeed pretty good in this although she would be better playing another troubled teenager a few years later in Elisa. And this movie is definitely wellmade with some memorable scenes of sad beauty. It still remains somewhat of a middleage male sex fantasy however which doesn't make it at all distasteful but does make it somewhat implausible.".

It's actually understandable that the married middleaged philosophy teacher in this movie would fall in love with his brilliant but troubled student since she is absolutely beautiful clothed and unclothed and wise beyond her years. But Paradis' character is supposed to be this streetwise urchin who has dabbled in prostitution in the past and it is a little hard to believe she'd fall madly obsessively in love with a fifty year man just because he shows her some kindness. Also while 17 may not get you twenty in a French bastile I'm pretty sure it would get you kicked out of the teaching profession.Paradis is indeed pretty good in this although she would be better playing another troubled teenager a few years later in Elisa. And this movie is definitely wellmade with some memorable scenes of sad beauty. It still remains somewhat of a middleage male sex fantasy however which doesn't make it at all distasteful but does make it somewhat implausible.";

She shows up late for class if at all she's flunking math and other subjects. He gives a lecture on Freud and the unconscious and asks her to stay after class and explain why she's so slack. After all maybe he can help her.The subject of his lecture the unconscious was apt because Bruno's ego has no idea of what his id is leading him into. One wonders if he is familiar with the Electra complex. Paradis invites him to her flat where she casually undresses and changes clothes in front of him to his embarrassment. I mean  even in Loire there are limits.Before you know it  or before Cremer knows it at any rate  they're lovers. Hints of the affair become received wisdom although both desperately try to hide their love for one another. Certainly Cremer's wife knows about it. As usual both females can waltz intuitive rings around the somewhat oafish male.Cremer's wife is fed up with the constant phone calls and the poison pen letter and finally leaves him for a while telling him to think it over before she returns. He thinks it over between roles in the hay with Paradis and decides it wouldn't work between the professor and the student. Sensibly he ends it telling Paradis that in ten years he'll be an old man. Her passion though seems adamantine. She'll love him whether he's young or old thin or fat sick or healthy. They can run away together and she can pretend to be his DAUGHTER. And she seems to mean it but Cremer is mature or dull enough to see that not all things are possible. So back comes the jealous wife.It doesn't work out. Paradis continues to haunt him and taunt him. She nuzzles up to one new boyfriend after another in front of him. Her accomplices break the windows and paint filthy sayings on the bookstore his wife runs.At his wit's end Cremer yanks her out of his classroom flings her into an empty room and slaps her around but she keeps coming back to him like a lost puppy until finally he gives in peels off her clothes and  well a few minutes later the whole school seems to be peering through the windows at them with one student yelling Hey a teacher is screwing a naked girl! What happens next to the undone Cremer is instructive. In America if a teacher gets caught in flagrante delectable with an underage student he or she winds up in court and then in jail. In France Cremer is given a reprimand by his school and sent to exile in Dunkirk where he continues lecturing as before. After all screwing a naked seventeenyearold girl on a classroom desk may not be evidence of savoir vivre but well why stir things up? Insert here a philosophical shrug the kind found in such abundance in France. The performances are adequate probably no more than that. Paradis is quite a lynxeyed morseau with two shiny front teeth behind those tiny pouting lips. Seventeen? She's about as tall as Cremer's lower sternum. She's so petite and gracile she looks as if she'd barely made fifteen at least until she sheds her clothes something that to my perverted taste anyway she doesn't do quite often enough. Her figure is exquisite.Bruno Cremer LOOKS like a philosophy professor big soft flabby and comfortable with gentle blue eyes. His nose though  it looks as if when God was handing out noses he asked Cremer what he would like and Cremer replied Two lumps please. That proboscis has its identical twin on the face of George C. Scott.The script isn't bad actually. It deals intelligently with what is basically a conundrum without a solution. Paradis is right. They should take what they can get while it's available. But so is Cremer. Loving CAN be folly. Ten years heck. In twenty he'll be 70 and she'll be a vibrant and eager 37. What's she going to do  wheel him around in his lap robe to exciting night clubs? JeanClaude Brisseau's direction is functional without being in any way imaginative. Cremer's switch from avuncular prof to jealous swain takes place too quickly. The outburst is unexpected.

	schema:headline " 'Noce Blanche'. I have to divorce you from my life. You're really not worth rewatching.";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong Ephebophilia films like this has always been a hard to watch. However once in a while some of them really do shine such in the case like 1999's 'AmericanBeauty' or 1962's 'Lolita' as entertainment due to their approach to blackcomedy while exploring the themes of romantic paternal love sexuality beauty materialism selfliberation and redemption. Unfortunately this French movie is not one of those films as it's mostly one dimensional in its humorless dry and full of gloom tone with two very dreadful main characters 47 year old character Franois Hainaut Bruno Cremer  17 year old Mathilde Tessier Vanessa Paradis. Still even when it tries to be blissful  romantic with scenes of the lovers rowing boats and making love on grassy hills in public. The film come off as highly cheesy tiresome and clichs than a powerful message of the freedoms of ideal dreamlike 'White Wedding' love life outside the reach of moral paternalism. Also if the movie's goal was to show the dangers of forbidden love like 2006's film 'Notes on a Scandal'. Then it truly fails at that with its semi laissezfaire approach of punishment in an ending in which the philosophy teacher still being able to teach after being caught in the school ground having sex even if the supposedly 'victim' was over the age of consent. Now if the movie purpose was to be an erotic psychology thriller like 1987's 'Fatal Attraction'. Then it likewise fails to work as for the most part socalled protagonist seem alright with Tessier torment his caring wife Catherine Ludmila Mikal whom doesn't deserve any of this mistreatment. It's clear that the writing by JeanClaude Brisseau just fails to be entertaining. The story was just mostly miserable. Also it doesn't help that the film come across as a selfinserting sexism fantasy fanfic of a story much like his later films 2002's 'Secret Things' and 2006's 'The Exterminating Angels'. While the film is not as graphic with its themes and nudity as the other films. It's still egotistic  exploitation at its worse. Don't get me wrong I get somewhat the film was trying to do with pessimistic cynical approach between the MayDecember Relationship lovers Nevertheless Brisseau wrote the story a little too vague without digging deep enough to understanding the basics of female sexuality eroticism. Look I get that some women like Mathilde might indeed find Hainaut's power  sophistical knowledge attraction and maybe they will manipulates him like a Femme fatale in order to keep themselves please something similar to somebody diagnostic with disingenuous histrionic personality disorder. However much of these ideas of stereotypical loose girl with daddy issues has already been so overplayed. The idea that these hysteria are caused by a lack of libidinal evolution are also outdated and shameful. If anything the movie feeds on the negative stereotype that the French people are full of stupid Erotomanics. Another thing while I do understand the French culture being more quite open when it comes to talking about sexuality  its taboos compare to Americans. I doubt they are that blas with disturbing sexual acts. After all in 2002 Brisseau was arrested on charges of sexual harassment after three women came forward accusing him of cajoling them into performing sexual acts on camera by promising them a film role. He was eventually found guilty fined and given a suspended oneyear prison sentence. So it wouldn't surprise me that he once pull the same supposedly sleazy artistic stunt with then15 year old actress Vanessa Paradis who was looking for her first film debut after her singing career launched with the song Joe le taxi a few years before. Regardless on how shady his practices of hiring actresses were. His camera work with cinematographer Romain Winding was still impressive. There were some beautiful shots throughout the film such in the case with the beaches of Dunkirk. Along with those shots came satisfactory music from composer Jean Musy. I just wish the score was just a little more memorable. Despite that another thing that this foreign film has going for it is the amazing acting from the main two performers. Both of them do a good job even if both of their characters are horrible people. Because of that it's a lot better to watch this movie with English subtitles than the awful English dubbing version. Overall While this movie is somewhat engaging. It really fails to live up to anything else than being mediocre unpleasant and highly exploitation. For those reasons alone Au revoir 'Noce Blanche' I hope never to meet you again. I really can't recommended watching this movie. In short there are better more entertaining French films than this muck of a movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Don't get me wrong Ephebophilia films like this has always been a hard to watch. However once in a while some of them really do shine such in the case like 1999's 'AmericanBeauty' or 1962's 'Lolita' as entertainment due to their approach to blackcomedy while exploring the themes of romantic paternal love sexuality beauty materialism selfliberation and redemption. Unfortunately this French movie is not one of those films as it's mostly one dimensional in its humorless dry and full of gloom tone with two very dreadful main characters 47 year old character Franois Hainaut Bruno Cremer  17 year old Mathilde Tessier Vanessa Paradis. Still even when it tries to be blissful  romantic with scenes of the lovers rowing boats and making love on grassy hills in public. The film come off as highly cheesy tiresome and clichs than a powerful message of the freedoms of ideal dreamlike 'White Wedding' love life outside the reach of moral paternalism. Also if the movie's goal was to show the dangers of forbidden love like 2006's film 'Notes on a Scandal'. Then it truly fails at that with its semi laissezfaire approach of punishment in an ending in which the philosophy teacher still being able to teach after being caught in the school ground having sex even if the supposedly 'victim' was over the age of consent. Now if the movie purpose was to be an erotic psychology thriller like 1987's 'Fatal Attraction'. Then it likewise fails to work as for the most part socalled protagonist seem alright with Tessier torment his caring wife Catherine Ludmila Mikal whom doesn't deserve any of this mistreatment. It's clear that the writing by JeanClaude Brisseau just fails to be entertaining. The story was just mostly miserable. Also it doesn't help that the film come across as a selfinserting sexism fantasy fanfic of a story much like his later films 2002's 'Secret Things' and 2006's 'The Exterminating Angels'. While the film is not as graphic with its themes and nudity as the other films. It's still egotistic  exploitation at its worse. Don't get me wrong I get somewhat the film was trying to do with pessimistic cynical approach between the MayDecember Relationship lovers Nevertheless Brisseau wrote the story a little too vague without digging deep enough to understanding the basics of female sexuality eroticism. Look I get that some women like Mathilde might indeed find Hainaut's power  sophistical knowledge attraction and maybe they will manipulates him like a Femme fatale in order to keep themselves please something similar to somebody diagnostic with disingenuous histrionic personality disorder. However much of these ideas of stereotypical loose girl with daddy issues has already been so overplayed. The idea that these hysteria are caused by a lack of libidinal evolution are also outdated and shameful. If anything the movie feeds on the negative stereotype that the French people are full of stupid Erotomanics. Another thing while I do understand the French culture being more quite open when it comes to talking about sexuality  its taboos compare to Americans. I doubt they are that blas with disturbing sexual acts. After all in 2002 Brisseau was arrested on charges of sexual harassment after three women came forward accusing him of cajoling them into performing sexual acts on camera by promising them a film role. He was eventually found guilty fined and given a suspended oneyear prison sentence. So it wouldn't surprise me that he once pull the same supposedly sleazy artistic stunt with then15 year old actress Vanessa Paradis who was looking for her first film debut after her singing career launched with the song Joe le taxi a few years before. Regardless on how shady his practices of hiring actresses were. His camera work with cinematographer Romain Winding was still impressive. There were some beautiful shots throughout the film such in the case with the beaches of Dunkirk. Along with those shots came satisfactory music from composer Jean Musy. I just wish the score was just a little more memorable. Despite that another thing that this foreign film has going for it is the amazing acting from the main two performers. Both of them do a good job even if both of their characters are horrible people. Because of that it's a lot better to watch this movie with English subtitles than the awful English dubbing version. Overall While this movie is somewhat engaging. It really fails to live up to anything else than being mediocre unpleasant and highly exploitation. For those reasons alone Au revoir 'Noce Blanche' I hope never to meet you again. I really can't recommended watching this movie. In short there are better more entertaining French films than this muck of a movie.";

They are trumped by the muscularity cynicism experience and judgement of adults. But they see through us Mathilde sees straight away that Franois despite a wife career and friends is completely alone in the world she sees it because it is obvious and she has not been desensitised.There are two particularly interesting philosophical ideas that come up in Franois' classes that we are the unknowing accomplices of our other self the subconscious prisoners of its fate and also that people who choose to study metaphysics choose death as a preference over life.The aesthetics of the movie are very subtle it could easily be mistaken for one of those French dramas where the camera is simply pointed at the actors but there is a palette of blue and greys here and I ended up freezing the view a few times to admire the stills. It is far from being ostentatious or mannered however.The story ends up feeling quite Grecian in the end but who am I to say unrealistic reality is almost always stranger than fiction. Works for purposes of titillation for sure but also has great depths. Two successful watches in a row from Brisseau for me following on from The Girl From Nowhere more adventures to come!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Heart of the Earth evidently was a big deal in Spain where a reportedly 13 million euros went into the production of this misguided film that leaves the viewer cold when all is said and done. Based on a novel by Juan Cobos Wilkins it takes the viewer back to a time when the Riotinto copper mine was in operation in Spain's province of Huelva. It chronicles the tragic events of the last century in which the mine was being exploited by the English who had an enclave near where it was located.We are told a story that is seen by two young girls Blanca and Katherine. Blanca was a local girl while Katherine came from class and privilege. The two girls loved getting in all kinds of mischief involving one that will stay with them forever for they were the witness of a carnage from the Civil Guard of many miners that dared oppose the company that employed them under precarious conditions. The miners wanted to make a stand about the conditions in the workplace and the noxious fumes from the many smokestacks that made sick the locals as well as the men that extracted the ore.As directed by Antonio Cuadri the film does not impress as perhaps it was intended. Perhaps the problem is in the casting and in the stereotypes shown in the story. One does not believe for a moment on what is going on. To add injury the producers of this film insisted in bringing different actors from Spanish speaking countries as well as mixing some American and British players. The result is a cacophony of accents that is harsh on the viewer's ears. Worst off is Jorge Perigurria the Cuban actor from Strawberry and Chocolate sporting a ridiculous mustache who we are made to believe is the mayor of the town a stretch of the imagination indeed.".

Based on a novel by Juan Cobos Wilkins it takes the viewer back to a time when the Riotinto copper mine was in operation in Spain's province of Huelva. It chronicles the tragic events of the last century in which the mine was being exploited by the English who had an enclave near where it was located.We are told a story that is seen by two young girls Blanca and Katherine. Blanca was a local girl while Katherine came from class and privilege. The two girls loved getting in all kinds of mischief involving one that will stay with them forever for they were the witness of a carnage from the Civil Guard of many miners that dared oppose the company that employed them under precarious conditions. The miners wanted to make a stand about the conditions in the workplace and the noxious fumes from the many smokestacks that made sick the locals as well as the men that extracted the ore.As directed by Antonio Cuadri the film does not impress as perhaps it was intended. Perhaps the problem is in the casting and in the stereotypes shown in the story. One does not believe for a moment on what is going on. To add injury the producers of this film insisted in bringing different actors from Spanish speaking countries as well as mixing some American and British players. The result is a cacophony of accents that is harsh on the viewer's ears. Worst off is Jorge Perigurria the Cuban actor from Strawberry and Chocolate sporting a ridiculous mustache who we are made to believe is the mayor of the town a stretch of the imagination indeed.";

Four Flies on Grey Velvet is the last film in Dario Argento's animal trilogy which also includes the brilliant Bird With The Crystal Plumage 1970 and the very stylish Cat o' Nine Tails 1971. This is certainly Argento's oddest film and also by far the least widely known of his Gialli. While certainly not one of Argento's masterpieces this strange and highly interesting flick is nonetheless more than worth tracking down for a variety of reasons.When rock drummer Roberto Michael Brandon wants to take a guy to task who has been following him for days the guy threatens him with a knife and in the subsequent scuffle Roberto accidentally stabs the guy to death. The incident is photographed by a masked psychopath who subsequently begins to stalk Roberto and people close to him... Sounds like the beginning of a typical Giallo but apart from the typical formula of a mystery killer murders from the killer's perspective etc. this film differs from Argento's other Gialli in a variety of aspects. This is partly a very comedic Giallo that in some parts even features absurd slapstick humor. Several characters are purely satirical such as a very gay private eye or a sarcastic writer who likes narrating bizarre short stories. Another supporting role is played by none other than the asskicking cult actorcomedian Bud Spencer! The superb score by maestro Ennio Morricone is one more reason to watch this film. Dario Argento is one of my alltime favorite directors and while For Flies On Grey Velvet is certainly not one of his highlights it is definitely a weird and highly recommendable film that my fellow Italian Horror fans should not miss!".

	schema:headline " Experimental early Argento";
	schema:reviewBody "Four Flies on Grey Velvet is Dario Argento's rarest genre film. It completes the Animal Trilogy and is the movie that preceded the magnificent Deep Red. Having never been officially available on video or DVD Four Flies remains a bit of an enigma. It's fair to say that it is not an entirely successful movie  it has serious flaws in story and acting  however it showcases early stylistic experimentation by Argento. And as such is an important entry of giallo cinema.The story involves a rock drummer who accidentally kills a man and is drawn into a web of murder by a masked assassin who appears to have a vendetta against him.The opening credit sequence is a memorable affair incorporating pounding drums and close ups of a beating heart. This title sequence however is a good indicator of the inconsistencies of the film we are about to see as included within this impressive opening is a silly section involving a fly that irritates rock drummer Brandon. The inclusion of this nonsense is an early example of one of the films major weaknesses  the comedy. It is never funny. We have a completely unfunny postman a guru fisherman God who says absolutely nothing of interest at any point and a man with a moustache who tells a succession of abysmally unfunny stories to an audience of giggling women. Argento has never had flair for comedy it's just not his arena and this film shows why. Imagine how bad a giallo directed by Woody Allen would be well that's how bad comedy directed by Argento is.But onwards and upwards. Thankfully he handles the suspense scenes very well indeed. We have the bizarre opening murder in the theatre witnessed by a highly creepy masked figure. A scary scene involving a girl hiding in a cupboard while the killer stalks outside. A sleazy episode in the underground. And best of all an excellent setpiece where a woman suddenly realises that she is alone in a menacing empty park that was previously filled with children and haunting carousel music playing over the tannoy. Four Flies is predominantly an exercise in suspense as all of these well handled sequences testify. The violence is restrained even for giallos of the period. Argento more than makes up for this with stylistic flourishes like the nice camera pan of the phone wires leading to the location of the killer the shots of Michael Brandon driving his car quickly edited together with his subsequent POV approach to the private investigator's office and the deranged asylum flashback scenes. The movie is well shot with a number of inventive jump edits and unusual angles giving a taste of Argento's films to come.However all of these excellent elements are strung together by a somewhat ridiculous plot. There are certainly holes here for example how could the newspapers report finding the body of the dead man if he's not actually dead?! And as for the 'four flies' revelation near the end well I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie but it really is quite ridiculous. And the killer's motivations are to say the least uneven. The acting too is not helpful. Sadly Michael Brandon resembles a plank of wood for the majority of his screentime. His acting range stretches from 'a bit bored' to 'quite annoyed'. He certainly doesn't help draw the viewer in. And where Brandon underacts Mimsy Farmer overacts. It makes for quite unusual viewing when they are on screen together. There is a lack of chemistry here for sure. In general the exposition scenes are a bit clunky throughout the movie. And we even have a bit of unintentional humour in the exchanges between Brandon and the homosexual private investigator. If you turned the movie on at this point you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching Carry On Giallo.The music is variable. This was the first movie where Argento incorporated rock music. From here on he would use it extensively. Similar to the rock music provided by future collaborators Goblin the rock music here is strange except here it is not strange in a good way. The vocalist sounds like a deaf man trying to copy Robert Plant. It's grim. And it's by Ennio Morricone so it's a bit of a shock but fortunately he also provides some good avantgarde jazzy compositions too. Much better.Overall despite its shortfalls Four Flies on Grey Velvet is too interesting a giallo movie to be disregarded. It is a key experimental work in Argento's cannon. It may be flimsy of plot and misguided of humour but as is the way with giallo cinema these elements have to be weighed against the more sensory aspects  the visuals the music the atmosphere. And happily there is more than enough good to outweigh the bad.".

	schema:headline " One of Argento's WEIRDEST. Definitely NOT one of his worst!";
	schema:reviewBody "Four Flies On Grey Velvet is surely an odd truly bizarre film even by Dario Argento standards. In my opinion however it most definitely is not a bad film much less one of Argento's worst. Much of what is said about the film by critics and fans alike seems to me to wrongly condemn it. I definitely can understand why one might be frustrated by this film but I don't believe that's a reason to reject it completely. Some may feel the acting andor story isn't all that good. I would respectfully disagree. I feel the acting is strange and aloof but I believe that it works in favor of the film and the story is confusing but that is typical for an Argento film and as a viewer I appreciate not being handed all of the answers on a platter. Perhaps what repels many viewers is consistently being displaced espacially within the film context that is to say one the viewer andor the characters doesn't necessarily always know where one is within the reality of the film or how one got there. Here in what is perhaps Argento's most abstract film to date the director makes some very bold disarming choices with editing choices I believe serve a greater purpose and add chillingly to the effectiveness of the film. For instance the sequence in which the protagonist Michael Brandon is driving to the office of a private investigator. Shots of him driving in his car to the office are quickly intercut with gliding POV shots approaching the office building going up the stairs nearing the office door. The effect is that of feeling as if he is literally driving up the stairs and down the hallway to the office door creating a tense and strangely humorous sequence of events. This editing technique prevalent throughout the film is surely a forceful presence and I suppose could turn off some viewers. Regardless of the editing the atmosphere and visual punch of the film is pure Argento albeit an Argento who was still developing his technique and discovering his style. There are many beautiful and stunning visuals to be appreciated including the violent shocking ending sequence and  a very creepy chase scene in an otherworldly city park. My favorite visual flourish in this film is the reoccuring nightmare had by the protagonist in which a Middle Eastern execution is taking place in a bleached out desert dreamscape thoroughly chilling. A frantic highly enjoyable score from the master Ennio Morricone adds greatly to the proceedings as well. I really like this film despite whatever flaws it may have and have but one question for anyone who thinks Four Flies On Grey Velvet is one of Argento's worst... Have you seen The Five Days Of Milan or his Phantom of The Opera?Definitely not for everyone's tastes but a certain must for any Argento fan Eurohorror fan or anyone who just really wants to be daring and see something totally different.".

Here in what is perhaps Argento's most abstract film to date the director makes some very bold disarming choices with editing choices I believe serve a greater purpose and add chillingly to the effectiveness of the film. For instance the sequence in which the protagonist Michael Brandon is driving to the office of a private investigator. Shots of him driving in his car to the office are quickly intercut with gliding POV shots approaching the office building going up the stairs nearing the office door. The effect is that of feeling as if he is literally driving up the stairs and down the hallway to the office door creating a tense and strangely humorous sequence of events. This editing technique prevalent throughout the film is surely a forceful presence and I suppose could turn off some viewers. Regardless of the editing the atmosphere and visual punch of the film is pure Argento albeit an Argento who was still developing his technique and discovering his style. There are many beautiful and stunning visuals to be appreciated including the violent shocking ending sequence and  a very creepy chase scene in an otherworldly city park. My favorite visual flourish in this film is the reoccuring nightmare had by the protagonist in which a Middle Eastern execution is taking place in a bleached out desert dreamscape thoroughly chilling. A frantic highly enjoyable score from the master Ennio Morricone adds greatly to the proceedings as well. I really like this film despite whatever flaws it may have and have but one question for anyone who thinks Four Flies On Grey Velvet is one of Argento's worst... Have you seen The Five Days Of Milan or his Phantom of The Opera?Definitely not for everyone's tastes but a certain must for any Argento fan Eurohorror fan or anyone who just really wants to be daring and see something totally different.";

Somewhat like Deep Red Four Flies on Grey Velvet weaves an intricate winding narrative that spreads out in varying directions before closing back in on itself for the final resolution. The narrative here is for the most part coherent and there are enough throughlines to really engage the audience from beginning to end.There are some phenomenal and legitimately frightening scenes involving the threatening killer and the murder scenes are jarring and well handled. Unusual borderline experimental uses of parallel editing and jump cuts give the narrative a dynamic flair and atmospherically every frame bleeds with Argento's unique aesthetic choices. The opening confrontation in the opera house is stunning and several of the murder scenes are particularly memorable and understated the film does seem to have some stilted elements to it including characters and moments that really serve no purpose but the upshot is that they lend Argento more time to wallow in stylistics. Solid performances from Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer really help bolster the proceedings and JeanPierre Marielle is memorable as the flamboyant gay detective.I've read some criticism of the film's conclusion and while I do find it to be fairly easy in terms of expectancy it is a clever twist and the slowmotion finale is mildly remarkable.Overall Four Flies on Grey Velvet is an intriguing giallo with some great understated murder scenes and a puzzle of a plot that engages the audience in ways which Argento would come to refine even more with Deep Red. In charting Argento's career the film is highly important but even outside the context of his directorial trajectory it stands as a solid weirdly memorable effort with some rock'n'roll spirit and an extremely sinister doll mask. For most genre fans I think that's more than enough. 810.".

There must be something with this film since it was chosen for this unique seminar over all his other pre 1992 works. Upon the second viewing of this film I still find it scary and spellbinding and the secret behind the title is quite chilling. Gives me the creeps just thinking about it. The stylish camerawork and storyline is pure Argento black glove period and this is my 3rd favorite film tied with Deep Red of his right behind 1 Susperia and 2 Tennebre.

A mysterious masked stranger took photographs of the entire incident and later begins to taunt him and starts to murder people in his life.Okay Four Flies may lack the elegance and style of the first part of the animal trilogy but it still packs a punch especially the masked stranger with that freaky mask which is truly terrifying and you definitely feel a sense of dread whenever this person is around and the opening of this movie was a very interesting concept and then the growing paranoia of the lead character begins to grow and grow as he wonders what's gonna happen next is truly tense. Along with several stylish murder scenes such as the maid in the park as she's running towards the gate was beautifully shot and terrifying and the girl hiding in the cupboard kept me on the edge of my seat and the nerve racking outcome made me jump out of my skin.

Michael Brandon gave a good performance as the lead character and Mimsy Farmer also gave an interesting performance and gives a great screen presence especially towards the end. Jean Pierre Marielle also gives a standout supporting performance as the private investigator and was truly hilarious and really makes you feel for his character.All in all a good ending to the animal trilogy and okay may not be as strong as the other two but still worth a watch with its good storyline intriguing mystery and fantastic ending that neatly wraps everything up.".

	schema:reviewBody "A musician Michael Brandon is stalked by an unknown killer who's blackmailing him for an accidental killing of another stalker. But is everything what it appears to be?

Michael Brandon plays a rock musician who is photographed by a masked assailant stabbing and killing a man that has been stalking him. Later the masked assailant starts to send Michael Brandon photos of him in the act and that's where the fun starts.Four Flies on Grey Velvet never quite reaches the level of adrenaline that Argento's earlier work Bird with the Crystal Plumage did but a number of Argento's well known trademarks are here including gruesome murders a masked killer and numerous possible culprits. The level of bloodshed in this movie isn't as abundant and the death scenes aren't as creative as in some of Argento's later works such as Profondo Rosso or Tenebrae and the film has only one death sequence that really touches on the elaborate death sequences that Argento has become known for and that's the one where the girl is killed on the stairs. There also a streak of black humour in this movie that isn't usually present in Argento films shown by the detective who will solve this case because of his Amazing record of never having solved a case yet great irony on his conclusion by the way the disgruntled delivery man and the casket party which was both surreal and strangely funny.However the film doesn't suffer much from the lack of bloodshed as there is still much to like about it. One thing I love about Argento and there are many things! is the way he pulls the viewer into the film. Argento gives small details of the plot away just enough to give you something else to think about but not enough so you are able to guess the conclusion. This is a great skill that Argento is very adapt at his movies two detectives on the case. One is in the movie whether professional or improvised and the other is the viewer. This works well because it grabs your interest and keeps it and that's what makes Argento movies great and a cut above the majority of other mystery thrillers.As with all Argento films The movie starts to build more pace towards the end and builds into a clever and satisfying solution as to who the murderer is and the means of finding out who it is which is linked with an animal like in the other two films of the 'Animals Trilogy'. However the very end of the movie is somewhat disappointing. After an exciting finale the way the murder is killed seemed unimaginative and just a quick way to end the film which was a shame. Saying that the end certainly doesn't ruin the film it just isn't as good as it could be.This movie is recommended to anyone that considers themselves a fan of Dario Argento and horror buffs in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most elusive of Argento's films has become more legendary than most simply because of the fact that it's been nearly unobtainable in a decent version. Most have had to do with verybelow average bootlegs that render some of the film nearly unwatchable and therefore pretty hard to judge. Recently an above average bootleg was released in terms of visual quality and a lot of scenes come to life and one is finally in a position to judge the film as a whole.Story wise Four Flies on Grey Velvet doesn't win any awards but it's a good set up for a thriller. Drummer Roberto Tobias Michael Brandon accidentally kills a stalker and is photographed while doing so. The masked fiend who snapped the shots starts threatening Roberto and his wife Mimsy Farmer is very worried for her husband. As it turns out the man who Roberto thinks he killed is very much alive but not for long. Roberto hires a gay private investigator to find out the truth. Say more and I've ruined everything for the viewer.If you look at Argento's work as a whole Four Flies fits in very nicely. You can clearly see a young Argento experimenting with visual tricks that he would later do even better in later films. Story wise the film is similar to some of his later works and even a bit of a rehash of his earlier ones. Some fundamental psychology concerning repressed guilt and anger a very recurring theme in Argento's work and once again the central character is an artist who's thrust into a dangerous world of lunatics and murder. This would be perfected in his next thriller Deep Red.It's just that the film doesn't have enough material to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat. It drags on too long many scenes and not to mention some characters are almost completely pointless. What's Bud Spencer doing here? He serves no narrative purpose but I'll admit it's fun to see the guy.Plot wise this is slim pickens. Argento and fellow writers were lazy this time around. The film has a dynamic start and immediately you're interested. If you've seen The Bird with the Crystal Plumage my guess is you'll have the culprit here figured out before half time. Plus there aren't many red herrings here and a lack of suspects make the guess that much easier.But on to the good things. Certain sequences are very impressive. Brandon's encounter with his stalker in the beginning is beautifully filmed and stylish as hell. A murder that occurs in a park is masterfully realised. Very suspenseful dreamlike and stylish. Not that dissimilar to Stefania Casini's chase sequence in Suspiria. Another murder sequence that sets up the film's title is also quite impressive. Last but not least the knockout ending which can finally be appreciated now that there's a decent version available deserves all the hype it's already gotten. An Argento film is never a complete dud not even Phantom it always has some things going for it.Special nod must also go to Argento for taking things up a nodge and taking some risks. Feeling that the Giallo genre was drying up Argento comes up with unique ways to keep audiences interested. That special camera for instance that captures the last image seen by a deceased person. Well I've never heard of it and it's quite an idea. You gotta give Argento props for trying new things even though they don't always work out.It must be said that Argento should have gone with a different leading man. Michael Brandon is remarkably lifeless in almost every scene he's in. Mimsy Farmer fares better as Brandon's wife and that gay detective provides a few chuckles. That said most of the comedy here is pretty silly and a little distracting.But as said above this is Argento experimenting with visuals editing and writing and his later films were better realised. I doubt this film will appeal to very many people but for fans of Argento there's plenty here to savour and enjoy.".

Argento draws an effective performance from his leading man as the innocent protagonist caught up in events beyond his control as a masked figure emerges from the shadows to eliminate anyone who stumbles on hisher identity. The resolution is ripe with Freudian excess and concludes with a spectacular demise for the psychopathic villain using stateoftheart camerawork in typical Argento fashion.As in his first two films Argento includes a variety of eccentric supporting characters often to distracting comic effect eg. a running gag with Brandon's postman culminating in what amounts to a criminal assault  played for laughs! and while the horror setpieces are often vividly realized  most notably the scene in which Brandon's blackmailing maid Marisa Fabbri finds herself trapped in a lonely park with the killer a sequence which refers backward to a similar scenario in Jacques Tourneur's THE LEOPARD MAN 1943 and forward to John Saxon's final sequence in Argento's TENEBRAE 1982  the pace is labored and dull especially during expository dialogue scenes.Mimsy Farmer makes a fair impression as Brandon's nervous wife while popular Italian character actor Bud Spencer Carlo Pedersoli plays Brandon's closest friend a badtempered fisherman who helps him solve the unfolding mystery. JeanPierre Marielle camps it up as a gay private detective with a poor track record of catching criminals a role which borders on caricature and ends ignobly in a public lavatory no less!. All in all a minor entry in the director's filmography elevated to mythic status by legal problems which have prevented its appearance on home video and while the film exercises a gamut of stylistic concerns Argento followed it with an unlikely detour into historical comedy FIVE DAYS OF MILAN before cutting loose with his giallo masterpiece DEEP RED it amounts to little more than a footnote in horror history.English version".

I do like my gialli cheesy and groovy and this film certainly has that  although it does feel slightly lacking in the 'investigative' side of things. Never mind though as Argento goes for crazy imagery and comes up trumps in that respect. A drummer for a progrock band finds himself being followed by a mysterious figure for an entire day. Losing his rag he turns pursuer and ends up chasing the guy into a disused theatre where he ends up stabbing the guy in a brief struggle. That's bad enough but the person wearing the creepy mask and taking photos during the struggle is going to cause our guy all sorts of problems as pictures start turning up in our hero's home and someone is stalking around his house at night. Who did our man kill? How does the cleaner know who the blackmailer is? And who keeps having flashbacks to an abusive father? A private investigator steps in to help but I'm saying nothing more except to say the bodies start piling up before our drummer can discover who's really behind the killings and nothing is as it seems. Like Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Cat O' Nine Tails this early Argento giallo has a healthy dose of humour thrown to the proceedings what with legend Bud Spencer playing Godfrey a tramp who helps out our drummer guy a postman who keeps being berated and beaten and the ultracamp performance of the PI a recurring theme in Argento's early films. The crazy visuals are brilliant throughout and although I wouldn't say it's an outright classic like Cat O Nine Tails there's a lot of messing around it's still a really good giallo. Also like Cat O Nine Tails there's a fairly dodgy scientific explanation for things that some people may find a bit hard to swallow and instead of the killer being discovered through an earlier clue they're kind of stumbled upon instead and quite easy to guess. However you've got to check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Argento's early films I have been waiting for this to be released on DVD for years. 4 Flies is the the only film from his golden era that I had not seen. Although there have been other ways to see this film I have been stubbornly waiting for a DVD release. It was worth the wait and I was very entertained.Some of the scientificmedical content of the crime investigation is silly. Besides that I have very few complaints. It kept me guessing about the identity of the killer. On a side note I read a review that complained the movies is homophobic. That's not true. I think the gay character is presented as admirably honest and ultimately heroic.

Although there have been other ways to see this film I have been stubbornly waiting for a DVD release. It was worth the wait and I was very entertained.Some of the scientificmedical content of the crime investigation is silly. Besides that I have very few complaints. It kept me guessing about the identity of the killer. On a side note I read a review that complained the movies is homophobic. That's not true. I think the gay character is presented as admirably honest and ultimately heroic.

I enjoyed this early suspense flick from Argento.Unlike his other films this is less gory less bloody but equally suspenseful. The acting is excellent too and I was hooked till the end.Some complain that it moves slowly but most of Argento's flicks Suspiria Inferno all start slow with twists and murders thrown in to keep the viewer entertained.This movie is well directed and shot and musical score is good as well.Michael Brandon is Roberto Tobias a guy whose paranoid that someone's following him and he daydreams about a gory beheading throughout the movie. He meets up up with a guy who he thinks is it and kills him by accident.It's photographed by someone else who is now blackmailing him and making his life a living hell for what reason we do not know till later.The acting is good the cast is very good. Mimsy Farmer as Roberto's wife is very good and compelling FrancinE Racette as Dalie is beautiful and a good actress while Oreste Lionello as the Professor  Bud Spencer as Godfrey provide comic relief to this suspenseful tale. OK so maybe you guess who the killer is halfway but really the story is well executed.The characters are likable and the murder scenes are typical Argento but they are all pretty well done and I even felt sorry for the killer at the end which doesn't happen a lot with me.Highly Recommended.".

If I hadn't been so blown away by THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE one of the most complex mysteries I've ever seen my expectations wouldn't have been so high. But all in all this is a good effort.Roberto is a rock musician. Is he successful? We don't know. We see him perform with his band but they are less than impressive and we never see screaming fans chase after him. He lives in a big handsomely decorated house in Rome but this may be because his wife Nina comes from a wealthy family.Roberto is played by Michael Brandon whose sole musical claim to fame is a vague resemblance to Barry Manilow. Argento had wanted Terrence Stamp one of the Beatles or James Taylor for the role. Brandon isn't really a bad actor he's just uninteresting.Roberto thinks a mysterious man is following him. One day he follows the man into an opera house and kills him but discovers that a masked phantom is also in the auditorium taking pictures.Over a period of time various incidents convince Roberto that the phantom is gaining access to his home not difficulty consider how his his entourage wanders in and out day and night.There are baroque set pieces which eliminate various minor characters. A very effective one set in a sunlit park implies that the phantom killer has supernatural powers. Other people in the park suddenly vanish the carousel music that had been playing all day suddenly stops and as a character is fleeing bright day suddenly turns into night.A set piece on a subway train and chase through the station is excitingly filmed but it's used to eliminate the most interesting character in the story.There are a couple of very weak links in the plot. A policeman uses a laser to reveal the last image seen by the eyeball of a corpse this would have been more believable were the story set in 1871 instead of 1971. It's a clumsy device to introduce the subject of the flies to make this the third in Argento's animal trilogy.At the end the killer speaks pages of exposition while holding a gun on Roberto My father did these terrible things to me. He tried to reshape me in his image and dominated my life. You're just like him.But Roberto is nothing like that. He's vague he's passive. In addition to being severely mentally ill the killer seems to be awesomely stupid.Finally God intervenes long story and the killer flees only to meet an ironic fate speeding through the streets of Rome.What's best about the film is the incredible camera work. Argento has a visual sense like nobody else. Check out the early scenes in the park after the opening titles and the amazing use of color. There are scenes where red is used as a visual cue that draws our eye were Argento wants us to look.The theme of seeing and how it evolves into spying and ultimately voyeurism is prominent here as it is in may of the director's works.The bottom line here is that I'm just happy to have this available on DVD. Paramount held up the video rights for far too long and as best I remembered the theatrical got very limited release. If it did play in Houston I sure didn't get a chance to see it.I'd like to see FOUR FLIES again on a big screen in an actual movie theater. Hey a guy can dream.".

It's nearly impossible to figure out what's going on from one moment to the next characters who have no bearing on the story are introduced and long overstay their welcome and it never really is made clear exactly what the killer wants.

It is sort of delirious having possibly more weird Argento tricks than usual.A drummer has been followed by a man with a mustache sunglasses and hat on more than one occasion. He spots the man again and chases him into a theater. The man claims not to know what the drummer is talking about and pulls out a switchblade. He's accidentally stabbed and a mystery figure in the balcony wearing a cherubic mask takes photos. The drummer is thereafter harassed yet not blackmailed by the mystery maskwearer.There are a number of strange secondary characters. There's a mailman who likes to deliver Swedish pornography to the wrong person. The drummer has a vagabond friend named Godfrey who enlists the help of another vagabond called The Professor to help keep an eye on the drummer's house. He also recommends a private detective a gay man in a white suit who has a record of having failed to solve more than eighty cases.I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Argento or giallos.

They can't all be genuine masterpieces but this relatively early effort his third film and also the closure of his animaltrilogy is still far above average with an original and highly convoluted plot vivid dialogs suspense effectively misleading red herrings and extremely imaginative camerawork. Roberto is a young handsome rock drummer playing in a band alongside his friends. For the last week he has a guy with a fancy suit and dark sunglasses stalking him for no apparent reason. When Roberto accidentally kills the guy during the inevitable confrontation it suddenly becomes clear that someone entirely different intends to frame him as the accidental murder is even captured on film. From then on a guy wearing a crazed Mr. Potato Head resembling mask threatens and blackmails Roberto as well as his girlfriend. Further murders and mayhem soon ensue as well when more people become involved in the continuously thickening plot. Perhaps the strangest aspect about Four Flies on Grey Velvet is the surprisingly high amount of comedy factors. Argento isn't exactly known for his sense of humor but this film features a lot of it like a sub plot about a homosexual private detective a simpleminded mailman who keeps on delivering wrong parcels and the hilarious Queer Frankenstein story narrated by one of the insignificant supportive characters. The humor isn't too inappropriately or misfit just something you don't immediately expect to see in the works of Italy's most prominent horror director. Also Four Flies isn't nearly as grim and sadistic as some as Argento's other stuff or other contemporary Gialli by different directors for that matter. The film does feature however an extremely nasty throatslitting and an exhilarating finale. It's just my opinion of course but instead of some of the odd running gags and stereotypes I wanted to see some extra murders.".

Tibbs was simply waiting for his next train at the station in Sparta Mississippi and the confusion is soon resolved but when local police chief Gillespie learns that Tibbs is the Philadelphia PD's number one homicide expert he reluctantly asks for his assistance. The murdered man Mr. Colbert had come to Sparta from the North to build a new factory and his wife and business associates immediately point the finger at Endicott the most powerful man in the county and the one who had the most to lose if a major new employer comes to the area. Tibbs' life is clearly in danger but he perseveres in a highly charged and racially explosive environment until the killer is found.";

Beautifully atmospheric Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography and Norman Jewison's first rate direction make you feel the humidity of the small Mississippi town in which a black detective teams with the redneck sheriff to solve the murder of an important industrialist.As sheriff Bill Gillespie Rod Steiger is superb in his Oscar winning role and this film provides Sidney Poitier with some of his greatest screen moments including his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off They call me MISTER Tibbs! This is one of the few politically correct films to make its point without resorting to heavyhanded sanctimonious preaching. Stirling Silliphant's Oscar winning screenplay never hits a false note and the change that occurs in the relationship between the leading characters is subtle and therefore believable. The two stars are ably supported by an outstanding cast of both veterans Lee Grant Warren Oates Beah Richards and newcomers Scott Wilson Quentin Dean and the delightfully creepy Anthony James. The score by Quincy Jones featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song captures the proper mood throughout. In a year when the oddsmakers were predicting an Oscar victory for Bonnie and Clyde or The Graduate In the Heat of the Night surprised the prognosticators by taking the Best Picture prize and four other Oscars. Considering its theme of racial tolerance it seemed an appropriate choice at an Oscar ceremony that was postponed following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The film's theme made it timely but its artistry makes it timeless.

	schema:reviewBody "Whether he likes it or not Sidney Poitier will always be remembered first and foremost as the first black actor to continuously star alongside and above his white counterparts. Just look at the opening credits to In the Heat of the Night and you will see that not only does he get an above the title starring credit with method maniac Rod Steiger but his name also appears first. Something that could have easily been switched around and overlooked considering the importance of each character. But for this socially aware thriller born of the turbulent sixties it had to be most definitely a conscious choice.For Poitier this film along with Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? marks the last of his civil rights driven roles in which his character's race is an all important plot element. From Edge of the City to The Defiant Ones Poitier excelled in bringing intelligent and commanding three dimensional characters to life. A feat he had to succeed at if his films were to gain the trust of a predominantly white audience and push for racial equality. Call him the Jackie Robinson of Hollywood.When we first see Poitier as Virgil Tibbs he is stepping off the train in the small Mississippi town of Sparta. Although we can only see him from the waist down we do get a quick glimpse of his hand and from that we are aware of his race. An important fact for the audience to dwell on later when Rod Steiger as sheriff Gillespie standing over a dead body on Main Street and calls for his deputy to round up any strangers for questioning. From that moment on director Norman Jewison establishes the racial tension that will only grow more and more intense as the film goes on.Sometimes the film is far from subtle in exploring the issue of racism. Endicott's plantation complete with tall white pillars and a black jockey lawn ornament to guard them is a perfect example. What starts off as a surprisingly civil conversation between Tibbs and Endicott quickly turns heated and unpredictable. From that moment on the experience will serve to cloud Tibbs' judgment and bring his own flaws to the surface making him almost as complex a character as Gillespie. And it is the complexity of Gillespie that got Steiger the Best Actor Oscar over Poitier in 1968. This man has heart but not made of gold and his motivations are far from pure. He is simply a man who believes in doing his job and doing it as just as possible  even if it means arresting a friend for murder. Take for an example the scene in which Tibbs is surrounded by a gang of blood thirsty locals. When Gillespie arrives to save the day he simply gives them a warning and tells them to go home. It is only when they insult him personally that he becomes angry and takes a swing. His action is just  his motivation almost vain.In the end after the murder is solved and racial injustice is swept back under the rug Tibbs and Gillespie say their farewells and continue on with their very different lives. Each one better off for knowing the other.Rating on a 5 star system  5 stars".

In a bad movie all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and one hundred percent evil here Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth hence the Oscar.  In a great twist Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice as he pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence.  It's refreshing to see a movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism from the crazy extremists and there are plenty of those on hand here to the more subtly prejudiced. Mississippi Burning a weaker effort is not only more tediously didactic but also less progressive that film doesn't feature a protagonist like Virgil Tibbs and instead focuses on the actions of two white federal agents.  In this case the old movie really is the better movie produced at the height of the civil rights struggle In the Heat of the Night feels more immediate and passionate than preachy films on the subject that were made years later after the tension had died down.    Some reviewers complain that the mystery segments of the film are confusing but I follow them without much trouble.  Tibbs does a great Sherlock Holmes routine throughout as he pieces together the solution based on clues that are also available to viewers.  Sure the ending is surprising but it doesn't come entirely out of left field I actually admire the subtle ways that clues are sewn throughout the film.  If you're not used to mysteries the barrage of red herrings and deadend clues might surprise you but it's pretty standard stuff for the genre.I knew about the classic line They call me Mr. Tibbs! long before I actually saw this movie.  I used to wonder why the line was so famous it doesn't sound that exciting does it?  But when I finally heard Poitier say it in context I asked my brother to pause the tape so I could cheer without missing any of the subsequent dialog.  That's how excited I get during this movie.  The performances are so naturalistic and the racial conflict so vividly drawn that I get pulled into the action completely.  Though 1967 was a strong year for films I still think that the right one got Best Picture and not just because it was topical In the Heat of the Night is a welldirected superb character study populated by some of the most vivid characters I've ever encountered in a movie.".

	schema:headline " Through The Mississippi Darkness";
	schema:reviewBody "Gritty realism and a strong performance by Rod Steiger rev up the technical quality of this taut drama about a visiting Northern Black detective named Virgil Tibbs Sidney Poitier who gets nailed as a suspect foolishly in the murder of a local VIP in a small town in Mississippi. Eventually the town's White police chief the gum chewing Gillespie Rod Steiger accepts Tibbs' innocence. And the two of them then work together reluctantly to solve the case.Forty years after the film was made the racial themes seem just a tad heavyhanded. Whites are always backward and racist. And Tibbs is smart urbane and sophisticated. But back in the 1960s the filmmaker probably did need to be blunt. And the point is made that Blacks and Whites working together can accomplish worthy aims even though old Black Joe is still pickin' cotton at the Endicott Cotton Company.As a whodunit the story is fairly good convenient coincidences notwithstanding. The clue to the killer's identity is pleasantly subtle.The film's cinematography and production design are terrific. Many scenes take place at night. And the opaque lighting makes for a moody slightly dangerous look and feel. Loved how they photographed that train moving down the tracks in the Mississippi darkness a metaphor related to the film's theme.

	onyx:emotionText "Gritty realism and a strong performance by Rod Steiger rev up the technical quality of this taut drama about a visiting Northern Black detective named Virgil Tibbs Sidney Poitier who gets nailed as a suspect foolishly in the murder of a local VIP in a small town in Mississippi. Eventually the town's White police chief the gum chewing Gillespie Rod Steiger accepts Tibbs' innocence. And the two of them then work together reluctantly to solve the case.Forty years after the film was made the racial themes seem just a tad heavyhanded. Whites are always backward and racist. And Tibbs is smart urbane and sophisticated. But back in the 1960s the filmmaker probably did need to be blunt. And the point is made that Blacks and Whites working together can accomplish worthy aims even though old Black Joe is still pickin' cotton at the Endicott Cotton Company.As a whodunit the story is fairly good convenient coincidences notwithstanding. The clue to the killer's identity is pleasantly subtle.The film's cinematography and production design are terrific. Many scenes take place at night. And the opaque lighting makes for a moody slightly dangerous look and feel. Loved how they photographed that train moving down the tracks in the Mississippi darkness a metaphor related to the film's theme. And the sound of a train whistle adds to the mournful realism.Interiors look authentic. The masking tape that covers rips in a big leather chair in Gillespie's shabby office is so true to life.

	schema:reviewBody "Pauline Kael remarked at the time of the release of this movie that Hollywood seemed to have divided the United States into three parts. There was New York. There was The South. And then there was everything else. This is a story of The South circa 1968 with AfricanAmericans as a second and much lower caste in the cottonpicking sweltering South. The story is well known. Sidney Poitier is Virgil Tibbs an expert homicide detective from Philadelphia Pennsylvania who is told by his Chief of Police Rizzo no friend of blacks as I know from living in Philadelphia at the time to assist the local cops in the solution of an economically important murder. Tibbs' identity as a homicide cop is only revealed in a funny scene after he has been arrested for the murder by the pragmatic and inept local constabulary. Thereafter he is nudged into helping them by their wheedling encouragement and his own arrogance. Lo! He solves the murder! Well in truth the solution isn't really important. Something to do with abortion and who's responsible but it's a minor matter. And actually the final scene is unbelievable. Poitier about to be slaughtered by a gang of murderous and thoroughly organized rednecks who have all kinds of guns pointed at him stymies them all by simply saying Look in her purse. In a Faulkner short story the movie would have ended right there. There are three things that make this movie worth repeated viewing. One is the ethos of the film. The second is the acting. And the third is the production itself. The ethos of the film by which I mean the values it examines are locked into the 1960s and even earlier. I recall hitchhiking through the South Maryland actually and still seeing signs at the time reading Colored Only over the rest rooms. And an AfricanAmerican friend who took pictures of such arrangements being followed out of town by a short string of local cars and stopped for questioning. The film reflects a dangerous and hatefilled time which Southerners have finally overcome thank God. And yet this same ethos lives on in the minds of some Southern whites and even more AfricanAmericans not reflected in ontheground behavioral reality but in beliefs. I taught for years in a Southern mostly AfricanAmerican university before I came to realize how important this myth is to blacks. To ask them or anyone else to give up that history of persecution is to ask them to sacrifice a solidarity that is otherwise unattainable. There is us and then there is them. And they are the enemy which draws us together and from which we gain support and succor. There is not much segregation in the South or elsewhere although it still exists but there might as well be. From the point of view of any cohesive group there almost NEEDS to be. Don't human organizations need a history of persecution? The Christians have Nero Jews have four thousand years of it including the holocaust Irish have the British occupation Moslems have the hejira Mormons have the assassination of Smith. We  who have once been treated unjustly  have Victim Power. You can't understand us unless you've walked a mile in our moccasins.The acting. Rod Steiger deserved his academy award. He's often dismissible but not here. Standing around the initial dead body worried he's furiously chewing gum and trying to think of somebody to pin it on. Then he suddenly stops chewing darts his eyes around and says Couldda been a hitchhiker. A wellconveyed dramatic moment. Poitier is at least equally good. He was lambasted in some of the press for playing a superblack a kind of white guy in blackface. The fact is that Poitier was one of the best dramatic actors who has ever appeared on screen and this is one of his best performances. Oh  he's put upon true but once he gets his transmission in the proper gear he becomes all too human. Showing off in a subtle way wrong about the town's big time racist being responsible and Gillespie has his number. Boy you're just like the rest of us ain't you. Warren Oates adds some muchneeded comedy. The bad guy has a face that could clear a room without using a gun. The succulent young woman who is spied upon by the Oates' character should be squirted all over with whipped cream spray and eaten alive. Perhaps the funniest scene in the move is when she describes Oates taking her down to the cemetery and rolling around together on the cool marble slabs. Steiger stops chewing again looks up in amazement and asks Sam did THAT? Not so much that he's shocked at his deputy's depravity just surprised at his imagination!To end this quickly okay it was shot in Illinois. But does it capture the smalltown South of the time! Two cars racing towards an empty garage and the camera shows us the squealing tires stirring up dust  and a pile of burning smoking garbage which is what it's all about.".

And this great movie came out about a small Mississippi town embroiled in a steaming hot summer and a sizzling murder case. The movie diverges from the book on many aspects mostly for the better. This is a serious look at a nation and a community in turmoil. The acting is first rate from Sidney Poitier one of the greatest American actors of this generation regardless of race Rod Steiger Lee Grant Warren Oates and the whole passel of townsfolk. The plot has been well outlined in previous posts so I won't belabor it. My favorite scene is when Virgil examines the deceased looking for clues in discoloration type of wound etc. while the sheriff looks on with his jaw practically on the floor in amazement. You can plainly see that he wanted to pin the crime on a hitchhiker or one of the town's less desirable inhabitants. While some may see the film as preachy or presenting Virgil as a superior to the hicks seen in the context of its time it really tells a lot about race relations of the time. The movie is well filmed with lots of atmospheric detail of the time and region even though it was filmed in Illinois some areas of Illinois and Indiana were very Southern in their feel and outlook. Great acting a good mystery fine cinematography and an important theme make this a mustsee movie. 10 stars.".

The supporting cast is perfect with Beah Richards William Prince and Scott Wilson as special standouts.  The dialogue by Siliphant is crisply written the direction by Jewison is nonpareil and the mystery is difficult and resolves things perfectly.  As an overall American mystery I must vote for this even over the Maltese Falcon which of course is also great.  Forget the hitandmiss TV spinoff and treat yourself to the real thing.".

The supporting cast is perfect with Beah Richards William Prince and Scott Wilson as special standouts.  The dialogue by Siliphant is crisply written the direction by Jewison is nonpareil and the mystery is difficult and resolves things perfectly.  As an overall American mystery I must vote for this even over the Maltese Falcon which of course is also great.  Forget the hitandmiss TV spinoff and treat yourself to the real thing.";

Many of the toprated IMDb films on racism in the US are fairly recent and as such are essentially delivering to the viewer a nostalgic or reimagined vicarious peek at the cultural phenomena. But this astounding oneofakind film was made in the 1960s. In the 1960s racism discrimination and violence were neither theoretical nor nostalgic. They were on the TV new every night. Against that backdrop this film parachutes onto the screen two of the greatest actors of their generation Poitier who history will record left the industry much too early given his great talent and Steiger who was so adept at his craft he could play a washing machine if you gave me a place to stand and an electric cord. Keep in mind also that many of the audience members who enjoyed this film at the time of release had never been in the rural deep south nor did they ever want to be. So now that I have set the stage imagine what it must have been like to be sitting in the theatre when Poitier gets off the train on a hot steamy southern night only be manhandled by the local deputy for being the wrong color in the wrong place at the wrong time only to reveal that he is in the law business himself and then offers to help the locals deal with a crime beyond their ability ... the subtle looks glances and grimaces in Steiger's facial expressions as through the movie he comes to see Poitier less as a racial stereotype and more as an associate is simply wondrous to behold and reflected on a broader level the process that American itself was going through collectively. One of the greatest movies ever made hypnotic powerful can be watched over and over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gradualism may have some value in politics. But in art it just represent a stale hackneyed period to be forgotten as soon as we can get on to the real work at hand.  Clifford Mason It's hard to watch Sidney Poitier's classic movies these days. In the 50s and 60s he became Hollywood's token black man. The new upstanding righteous handsome dignified strangely sexless African American symbolic of progressivism Civil Rights movements and backpatting liberal filmmakers. Poitier wasn't just an actor he was a flag bearer smuggling all that was good and just about The Negro into Hollywood. White audiences loved him. Blacks thought he was a joke. Ironically Poitier got into acting because he was ashamed of his AfroCaribbean roots and worked frantically to disguise his West Indian accent. He wanted to be a proper speaking white man. Others used him because they believed that the Negro image is best served or rehabilitated by a black version of a white man in grey flannel suits who takes on white problems and inherits a white man's sense of what's wrong in the world.Most of Poitier's films during this period followed a pattern. Director Stanley Kramer not one to shy away from middlebrow message movies had him tied to a white guy in The Deviant Ones audience and costar Tony Curtis learning that useful black men are our friends too. Meanwhile The Bedford Incident saw Poitier turn his nose up to war mongering white boys whilst snidely calling them sir. Later Duel at Diablo proved that the black man can also be an Indian killing cowboy whilst dressed in slick suave grey suits of course and the inspirational To Sir With Love saw Poitier playing a sexless London school teacher whose students learn that hey black people are great and make good teachers in white schools. And don't forget A Patch of Blue in which Poitier plays a reporter who falls in love with a blind white girl. Typical of Poitierfilm reversals he's well off suited and suave looking while she's a dirty white girl from the slums. Their romance is sterile  white audiences weren't ready for interracial smooching  Poitier rescuing the girl and then politely sending her off to a camp for the blind never to see her again. Then there's Guess Who's Coming To Diner? in which Poitier finally gets to kiss a white girl it's more of a peck after which he proves he's a better white man than her family of arrogant Caucasians.These films are all entertaining in a sleazy salacious sort of way but the fact is that they trade entirely in countercliches and do not as they proudly claim change the stereotypes that black actors are subjected to. They are contrivances artless in which Poitier is reduced to a showcase Negro who exists only in the white man's view of him. Always in clean suits pure of motivation dignified surrounded by stupid mean whites the Poitier Hero antiseptic and onedimensional always finds himself in a totally white world with no wife no sweetheart no woman no black friends and tasked with using his innate goodness to solve white problems for whites. Such Black Saviour tales are resurfacing today. Think Blind Side Precious The Legend of Bagger Vance anything with Morgan Freeman and Obama mania.And so In The Heat of the Night stars Sidney Poitier as a grey suited angelic white man in blackface who finds himself trapped in the Deep South. Surrounded by racist stupid redneck cops Poitier spends the first half of the film schooling white boys and proving that blacks are superior to whites at police work medical examinations manners looks and speech. He's an African American Ubermensch.The film was directed by Norman Jewison though a director who makes comedies when he's not bludgeoning us with message movies. So Night has a sense of humour which your typical Poitier movie doesn't Poitier's superiority played for laughs and redneck inferiority treated as a joke see Watermellon Man. Other good moments include passing shots of workers in fields alluding briefly to the South's reliance on the slave trade and Poitier's standoff with a wealthy local. Indeed though the film is oft touted as being progressive for highlighting white on black racism the only thing it deals believably with is black on white racism Poitier learning to check his aggression stop instinctively blaming wealthy whites and to work with lug headed whites for a better tomorrow. In contrast white on black racism is treated ridiculously. The film pretends to be progressive but amounts to odious titillation playing like a lynch mob lynching whites while blacks are schooled on the dangers of stereotyping rich folk with less melanin. It's the kind of film where audiences snicker because a black man slaps the face of a rich pampered arrogant locally powerful white man...but not before he slapped our hero of course.Aesthetically the film is effective Jewison capturing the heat gentle winds and lazy atmosphere of the Deep South and occasionally treating us to some moody nighttime photography. The film's acting garnered awards but is mostly caricatural a collection of tics. Rod Steiger's a mean curmudgeon and Poitier does his Henry FondaJimmy Stewart in blackface routine. Quincey Jones Hollywood's goto blackcomposer did the score.7.910  Peepshow sensationalism diluted by some moments of humour. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " Race Crime and Ignorance in the Late '60s";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Heat of the Night is as powerful a topical film as Do the Right Thing The Intruder and Boyz n tha Hood but more entertaining. Set in the volatile southern USA during the racially charged late 1960s the story brings a brilliant black homicide investigator Poitier from Philadelphia and a southern white good 'ol boy police chief Steiger together to investigate a mysterious murder. These two men appear to have three things in common 1  They are police officers2  They are investigating a murder3  They are both racistsIn the hands of a less intelligent writing team John Ball novel Stirling Silliphant screenplay and director Norman Jewison the major question might have become can they overcome their differences and work together to solve the crime?. but this question would eschew the entire point and value of the film. In the Heat of the Night took home 5 welldeserved Academy Awards. Unfortunately the great director Jewison missed best director because of the Academy' inexplicable love affair with Mike Nichol's The Graduate. Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are as you might expect amazing. And the support cast and casting are remarkable as well. In the commented version of the film on the DVD Jewison explains that he does not believe that any role is small. The meaning of this statement comes across very nicely in his films especially In the Heat of the Night. Every character in the film is well developed and consistently played. Setting plays a major role in the Heat of the Night as well and the film's perfect cinematography and soundtrack help contextualize the very nicely selected locations. Camerawork is essential to this film. See this film then see it again with Jewison Steiger and Lee Grant's comments turned on. The audio commentary is a retrospective and remarkably  almost startlingly  candid. Highly recommended.".

Set in the volatile southern USA during the racially charged late 1960s the story brings a brilliant black homicide investigator Poitier from Philadelphia and a southern white good 'ol boy police chief Steiger together to investigate a mysterious murder. These two men appear to have three things in common 1  They are police officers2  They are investigating a murder3  They are both racistsIn the hands of a less intelligent writing team John Ball novel Stirling Silliphant screenplay and director Norman Jewison the major question might have become can they overcome their differences and work together to solve the crime?. but this question would eschew the entire point and value of the film. In the Heat of the Night took home 5 welldeserved Academy Awards. Unfortunately the great director Jewison missed best director because of the Academy' inexplicable love affair with Mike Nichol's The Graduate. Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are as you might expect amazing. And the support cast and casting are remarkable as well. In the commented version of the film on the DVD Jewison explains that he does not believe that any role is small. The meaning of this statement comes across very nicely in his films especially In the Heat of the Night. Every character in the film is well developed and consistently played. Setting plays a major role in the Heat of the Night as well and the film's perfect cinematography and soundtrack help contextualize the very nicely selected locations. Camerawork is essential to this film. See this film then see it again with Jewison Steiger and Lee Grant's comments turned on. The audio commentary is a retrospective and remarkably  almost startlingly  candid. Highly recommended.";

There's a very creditable supporting cast featuring Warren Oates but they're completely eclipsed by Poitier  Steiger.There's so many nicely presented details of smalltown USA as well as imaginative use of lighting camera and editing. This movie won 5 Oscars including 'Best Picture' even the later and more flamboyant 'Mississipi Burning' cannot trump Norman Jewison's thriller.I've docked a star because I don't think the sheer brutality of racism is adequately depicted though it probably went about as far as sensibilities would allow at the time.

While most of its other elements I could take or leave the central relationship between Virgil Tibbs Sidney Poitier and Gillespie Rod Steiger is still riveting and manages to not be heavyhanded but subtle in its development and progress. Seeing Tibbs push down his anger whilst everyone in the town treats him with anger and violence is wonderfully portrayed by Poitier. On the other hand seeing Steiger grapple with his morals with Poitier's arrival is a treat as well. Each has their own complexities to deal with and when they are together it adds an additional dynamic to the proceedings. Not only does the film hold important historic relevance but the racial issues still hold meaning today. The two lead performances are electric and are the main reason for seeing the film although all of it is well done.www.cinemaenthusiast.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This film really starts off well.  It is tense you can feel the heat and there is some real suspense.  The beginning however is a good as this film gets.  It is downhill from there.  Jewison does a good enough job directing this film.  The problem with it however lies in the script by Silliphant.  It is a script that tries to be socially conscious and build that around a mystery or investigation.  This doesn't work out very well however for numerous reasons.First of all Poitier as Mr.Tibbs and Steiger as Gillespie are both good but Steiger is excellent in his role.  The problems of this film cannot be blamed on either of its leads.  They were both excellent and carried themselves well.  The only thing that keeps this otherwise bland mystery going is the interaction between the two.  The problem though and this is a scripting and story problem is that the relationship between the two is extremely repetitious throughout the movie.  Steiger constantly tries to best Poitier and then likes him and then tries to best him and so on. There is really nothing new to it no real layers.  The first scenes with the two are excellent and then its the same thing for the rest of the film.Another thing that bothered me even more is the fact that the film is never subtle in its attempts to show the downfalls and ignorance of racism.  There is racism against Mr.Tibbs throughout the whole film and it gets worse. They are never subtle he is a black man in a white mans town.  There are cotton picking negros in the film and he is always looked down upon with lines like why are you wearing white mans clothes and so on.  The focus of the film becomes the racism but its not done in an intelligent manner and detracts greatly from the suspense and story.POSSIBLE SPOILER I was ill impressed with the resolution of the main murder as it is.  I hate and I must repeat this I always hate when a minor character that we have barely been introduced to ends up being a major player when the movie resolves itself.  Of course we can never solve the mystery because we don't have the information required to do so.  It never impresses me when a nobody is the guilty party.  I mean some guy that is only in two scenes in the film who works in a little diner that we know nothing about becomes the killer.  Of course I would be surprised by the resolution because it comes out of nowhere.  Thats not impressive to me at all.  A movie like 'Arlington Road' where we know all along who does it but they still plant seeds of doubt and have a stellar ending now thats impressive.  This murder mystery however was not.So overall its really not that great.  There are more effective movies about race relations and ones that are done in a much more clever and intelligent manner.  The film is never subtle and could have been excellent but ends up falling short and becomes just a mediocre film at best.  Not highly recommended.  6 out of 10.".

Steiger is supposed to be a racist not necessarily stupid so you have to wonder why he is willing to hang the first suspect he finds when he doesn't even know all the facts especially when it's not even established if the suspect has an alibi or where or how he discovered the wallet. These are big plot holes and only one of several throughout the film. Aside from holes in the writing and directing there are egregious goofs like the deciduous forest in late autumn during what we are lead to believe is supposed to be a sultry summer heat wave. Alongside goofs there are unclear story lines like why the boy in the caf hates the cop.The makers of this film were so intent on breaking a barrier they forgot to make a good film.

Tibbs is both aloof and seething while Gillespie is neither a bigot nor saint.Unfortunately the mystery angle is unsatisfying and the solution is arbitrary It's a perfect example of film critic Roger Ebert's Economy of Characters rule which states that no one is introduced into a film without having to serve some purpose.

Too often its message movies are behind the times they condemn trailing behind the trailblazers who have the nerve to speak out when it matters.  In The Heat of the Night is something of an exception.  Beyond that it's simply a great film.Principally a detective story the murder of a wealthy businessman in smalltown Mississippi is for the most part only a framework around which the real story can be told.  This is a battleofwills between Detective Tibbs and Chief Gillespie a struggle for power between black and white a contest for acting honours between Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger.  While there is no doubt as to which character is the victor and which race is the most shamed the actors are absolute equals.  Both give superb layered performances.  Steiger's Gillespie is racist proud but lets us feel a degree of pity Poitier's Tibbs is intelligent thoughtful but shows a degree of arrogance.  These are not simply characters but people.Some have complained that its message is far from subtle that the lines are too clearly defined that the racism is too overt.  Such criticism comes from those with little understanding of history and little appreciation for context.  This was 1967 this was the south this was how it was.  Remember this film came only four years after Martin Luther King told us his dream only three years after amendments to The Civil Rights Bill were passed only two years after the murder of Malcolm X and only one year before the murder of Dr King.  Its message certainly was not subtle it had no need to be. Its delivery however is subtle enough that even today's audience can appreciate it.Beyond the superb performances and the dignified message they contain there are details that give the film a greater depth.  When Poitier is being frisked by Officer Wood he's told to spread his fingers apart so that he can see all ten'.  Poitier doesn't move them they're apart enough already. That nonreaction is a great moment showing that he's been here before that he knows the drill that'll he'll tolerate it because for now he has to but that he won't take orders without reason.There is so much to praise here.  The slow pace of the film should kill its tension but instead it reflects the sticky heat and the leisurely pace of life in the town.  Never is it too slow.  The scene where Steiger would rather condemn one of his own officers than lose another point to Poitier's bigcity detective skills is a high point as is the gentle yet vicious racism from Endicott.  The conversation between the leads in Steiger's house is surprisingly touching its brief moment of bonding never seems patronising or contrived and is expertly ruined by the crudeness of Steiger's racism.  The characters' growth is slight uneven and without any real payoff.  And that's by no means a criticism.In the Heat of the Night is a film that simply has to be seen one that soars despite all that could have brought it down.  It should be preachy but it isn't it should have dated but it hasn't its slow pace should be leaden but it's perfect.  This is a rare kind of a film and one that after a run of terrible movies has helped to remind me why I love cinema in the first place.  I'm grateful for that.".

While Pather Panchali and Aparajito the trilogy's first two are extremely well crafted the lack the heartwrenching beauty of this installment. These three films revolve around tragedy and it has an almost predestined quality to it which reminded me somewhat of Stanley Kubrick's excellent Barry Lyndon. That's where the similarities end of course as this film is warm and radiates humanity and Lyndon as well as all of Kubrick's work is cold and icy. Ray's rich lyrical realism breathes beauty in the mundane acts of his characters. The film opens as Apu now a young man attempts to eek out a living. He searches relentlessly for work most of which is monotonous and doesn't pay well. However his pudgy friend Pulu invites him to a wedding and Apu obliges hoping maybe this display of love will help inspire him and the novel he is writing. In a fascinating turn of events which I won't spoil Apu finds himself coming back to Calcutta married. Aparna his new bride is used to a life of luxury outside of the big city but she is prepared for a life of poverty with her new husband. In one of the most beautiful sequences in film Apu and his bride slowly begin to love and care for one another. The beauty of this is that we never see them embrace or kiss or make love. Instead we see it in gestures in window curtains in little notes Aparna puts in Apu's cigarettes reminding him only to have one after every meal. Their love is like a dream of love we've had one that's so innocent and wonderful we want to dream forever. But like all dreams Apu must wake up. Happiness is just a fleeting emotion for Apu one that enters his life at random points and then dissapears. Apu wanders bitterly through the Indian landscape searching for solace and peace. The end moments cannot be explained in words and simply must be experienced. One of the greatest films of all time. 1010".

Although the ending wasn't as powerful as its prequels I thought it was a more hopeful and fitting ending for the saga. However it did give me the feeling that I didn't want the story to end at all.Soumitra Chatterjee's debut performance as the adult Apu was truly Oscarworthy like Karuna Bannerjee who played his mother in the first two films and a young Sharmila Tagore was also convincing in her debut performance as his wife. Overall I'd say Apur Sansar is my second favourite in the Apu Trilogy after Aparajito.Now that I've finally finished watching the Apu Trilogy I must say this is probably the greatest film trilogy I've ever seen. Although it's a simple story about a country boy's growth to adulthood it felt like I was watching a truly epic saga. Satyajit Ray really is one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century in my opinion.1010".

Satyajit Ray paints how much covered a bitter pain that breaks someone's heart in his life. Someone means the main character Apu which half of life is already reflected in his 1st  2nd epic.It is seen that Apu had lost his elder sister and father before he knows the value of life.

To recap Pather Panchali  1010 absolutely perfect one of the best films ever made. Aparajito  810 had a few problems but still a thoroughly involving and beautiful film. The World of Apu I give the same rating that I did for Aparajito 810. For the most part again it was involving and beautiful. I however have a couple of problems with the film.SPOILERSAs I complained in my review of Aparajito when tragedies arise in this series they tend to repeat themselves. I was most affected by the first two of these major tragedies. The third one at the beginning of Aparajito affected me a lot although its power was diminished. By the fourth one I knew it was coming from miles away and I felt unaffected. Now the major tragedy in this film seems a bit contrived. I think the development between Apu and his wife was incredibly powerful. The situation which led them to be married lends to a lot of interesting options. The option that was chosen to kill his wife off was definitely the wrong one. I am actually hypothesizing that the novel had some more episodes or at least some more fleshedout episodes than does the final film. The events of The World of Apu at least after the tragedy seem crammed into a short period of time. It never feels like five years have passed. Still this is a great movie. Though I stick by these complaints the film as it stands is very worth watching since once you have watched Pather Panchali one of the very best films ever made you cannot help but watch Aparajito and The World of Apu.".

He gets away with a lot because of this. The fact is that he was always able to go his own way with little or no responsibility. One day he is asked by a friend and workmate to come with him for the marriage of his sister. I don't know all the ins and outs of Indian weddings. It turns out that when the arranged groom arrived he had turned mad. If she doesn't marry within a short period of time she becomes damaged goods. Because she can't marry the former man the friend asks Apu to marry her. This seems absurd until he buckles under and agrees much to the great joy of her family. The man she was to marry was rich so her life now becomes much less than she had hoped for. Nevertheless after some tough times Apu falls deeply in love with her and she begins to love him back. When she becomes pregnant she goes back to her family. While there she dies in childbirth. The little boy is saved but she is gone. Apu is torn to pieces never seeing his son and dropping into the depths of depression. While he sends money occasionally he works manual labor he gives up on his dreams and can't get over feeling sorry for himself. This film is wonderful with the most incredible cinematography closeup so to die for and acting that is nonpareil. These three films show why Ray is the consummate director working with concise minimalist technique. What a lovely movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the final installment of The Apu Trilogy. Just when Apu thinks he is finally free to live his own life now that his mother has died wouldn't you know it he gets invited to a wedding by Pulu a friend of his and ends up having to marry the bride himself because the groom turns out to be crazy and if she does not marry by the appointed hour she is ruined for life and no one will ever marry her. Don't you just hate it when that happens?Her parents are rich so you figure that since this is India and everything there should be a sizable dowry. But no not a brass farthing. However Apu and Aparna for that is her name end up being poor but happy. She gets pregnant and so after about the seventh month she goes home to her parents to have the baby. When one of her relatives shows up to tell Apu that she died giving birth Apu punches him right in the mouth. So if you are ever in India and have to tell someone his wife died just send a letter.Apu writes to Pulu that because he is now free to live his own life here we go again he intends to travel. Presumably he has learned his lesson about accepting wedding invitations. Of course we wonder how free he can be inasmuch as Aparna's baby lived. No problem he just dumps the kid on her parents.Apu apparently contemplates suicide standing near the tracks as a train approaches but it runs over a pig instead. In the end he settles for just throwing away the manuscript of the novel he had been working on presumably because he realizes that love as he imagined it turned out to be different from the real thing.After five years of wandering around aimlessly Apu's fatherinlaw is getting a little ticked that Apu is not taking care of his own son Kajal. Pulu who was Aparna's cousin goes looking for him. Apu says he cannot take care of Kajal whose name he did not even know because Kajal would remind him of Aparna. Of course Kajal probably reminds Aparna's parents of their deceased daughter every day but Apu only thinks of his own grief not what others may be feeling. Five years is a long time to grieve but Apu thinks it is a good excuse for not doing his duty as a parent when Pulu reminds him of it. Being so reminded angers Apu and knowing how Apu has a way of punching people out when they tell him something he does not want to hear we are surprised Apu does not hit Pulu as well. I guess we can call it maturity.He finally relents and goes to see his fatherinlaw not to take care of Kajal personally but to make arrangements for Kajal to go to a boarding school so that Apu can continue to wander around wallowing in the great suffering of his soul. And then just like your basic Hollywood melodrama there is a total narrative rupture at the last minute when Apu decides to take his son with him and care for him himself the two of them living happily ever after.".

	schema:reviewBody "Each of the Apu Trilogy films is wonderful but I think this is the weakest link due mainly to the absence of Apu's mother who died in the second in the series. Still Apu is a wonderful persona and here we get to know him a little better. As a mother of sons myself I am probably biased but I found the mother's presence to be the utter heartbeat of this epic film series. In this entry we have yet another iteration of Apu. This time he is portrayed by the more moviestarhandsome Sumitra Chatterjee and for a while at first he watch his fairly aimless wanderings with his good friend Pulu Swapan Mukherjee. We see unsurprisingly that he is a sensitive young man. He questions everything and takes nothing on trust. He sheds his old superstitions and fixed views. Little things move him and bring him joy. He says living itself brings fulfillment and joy. Perhaps rightly Apu's friend Pulu chides him for aspiring to be a writer when he has never been within 10 feet of any woman let alone a love interest. It is quite entertaining to accompany this pair to the country wedding of a cousin of Pulu where through an unlikely chain of events Apu ends up marrying the lovely bride Aparna himself Sharmik Tagore. Over time their love blossoms into something quite charming to observe. The version of this film that I saw was presented by the TV station of the City University of New York and it omitted the segment in which Apu is convinced to track down his son Kapal after having blamed the boy for his beloved's death during childbirth. Glad I checked out this film on Wikipedia or I'd have been clueless about how Apu reconnects with his child. We get a taste of changing times not just in India but everywhere when Apu's fatherinlaw questions why Apu doesn't just force the youngster to go away with him to a life in the city of Kolcutta. Apu doesn't make that move until the boy agrees to go with him freely. Voila a hint of the child with high selfesteem!The final scene of Apu balancing the boy on his shoulders as they leave for the city must be one of the most triumphant hopeful and joyous screen shots in all of world cinema. We wish you well Apu and we'll miss you!".

If you feel for some characters as a cine watcher Apu in Apu'r Sansar has to be one. On the contrary to Panther Panchali it ends on a happier note thus sparing you the pain and tears in your eyes.

	schema:headline " Possibly the best film ever made about childhood";
	schema:reviewBody " WARNING SPOILERS The three films Pather Panchali Aparajito and Apur Sansar form a trilogy and although each holds up well in itself they are best viewed as a unity. Speaking on a purely personal note I know of no greater achievement in cinema and have certainly seen nothing that moves me more profoundly.The twin themes of these films are progress and loss. The former implies the latter and both are in a sense inevitable. This is as all summaries must be an oversimplification. Certainly the loss of childhood of innocence of parents is universal to the human condition. Growing up progressing from childhood to maturity is similarly inevitable. But Apu wills his progress at least he wills its direction. He always grapples with life painful though it is. Only once after the death of his wife in the third film of the trilogy does he turn his back upon life but this crisis is temporary the trilogy ends with Apu once again facing the future willingly uncertain though it is.It is this refusal to turn one's back to stagnate this refusal to renounce that forms the backbone of this trilogy and gives it a unity throughout its often disparate episodes. The central character of these films Apu always aspires towards becoming something greater other than what he is. He wants to educate himself. This in a western context appears somewhat obvious but given Apu's background education is something to strive towards to struggle for and Apu despite great temptation never abandons this struggle. It is not that he sees education as a means towards wealth or power this is not after all anything so crude as a rags to riches story. But he does want to outgrow the village to understand and come to terms with life and the larger world outside. And in this he is as is suggested by the title of the second film aparajito undefeated.Over the three films we see Apu progress from childhood to perhaps his early thirties. In this progression we see his character develop through experience. This experience is often painful and Apu is not always capable of rising above the pain. Perhaps no other film has depicted with such a terrible intensity the emotional pain of loss but the vision ultimately is far from tragic. The last film  Apur Sansar  actually ends with a sense of joy. The joy is by no means unqualified it has been hard won and we the audience recognize its fragility. But it is nonetheless exhilarating.Pather Panchali the first of the trilogy takes place some time early in the 20th century and covers the years of Apu's early childhood. We see him born into a povertystricken family in rural Bengal. Later we see Apu at play with his sister Durga we see him excited by the travelling players we observe the uncomprehending wonder of Apu and Durga as they see a train for the first time. We are shown all those events of childhood that are apparently trivial but which nonetheless shape the adult personality.Apu's mother Sarbojaya the superb Karuna Banerjee is understandably harassed trying to keep her family clothed and fed. The father Harihar is goodnatured otherworldly and quite unpragmatic. With the family lives an aged aunt Indir. She is a pathetic figure helplessly eking out a meagre existence on the charity of those who barely have enough for themselves and relying on Durga  with whom she has a close relationship  to supplement her inadequate diet with stolen fruit. Aware of her status Indir generally speaks and acts in an ingratiating and conciliatory manner but there is a repressed rage within her that bursts out on occasion. It is a magnificent performance from the aged actress Chunibala Devi. Sarbojaya has no patience with this old woman and takes little trouble to hide the fact that she is unwanted. This is not out of deliberate cruelty or indifference it is simply that looking after her own immediate family is burden enough. The old woman desparately trying to retain the last vestiges of her dignity is forever storming out attempting to find a roof to shelter under from some other relative. But she keeps returning even a hostile roof after all is preferrable to none. It is a picture of desperation which moves the heart beyond mere pity. There is one particularly heartrending scene where she sits in the dark singing of death in her old cracked voice.This first part of the trilogy ends in tragedy  Durga's death  and I know of nothing in cinema that delivers so powerful an emotional punch. It took me quite unawares at first viewing and even on repeated viewings it moves me like nothing else I have seen. Particularly unforgettable is Apu's final quiet act of love for his dead sister which really needs to be seen in its proper dramatic context to be appreciated. It is the end of a chapter in the family's life and they move on. The sense of loss is overwhelming.This is perhaps the best film ever made about childhood. I watch the entire trilogy about once every year and wonder afresh at what cinema at its best is capable of achieving.".

The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch but they would probably be hard to enjoy to demonstrate the difference in taste Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there he answered that the movie Baby's Day Out which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where SweetPea wanders through construction sights blindly except extended to 90 minutes had theaters packed in India all throughout its run the film bombed completely in the US. Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful Pather Panchali. This film has got to be the best ever made about well life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film Zhang Yimou's To Live which was good but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. Pather Panchali feels as real as life itself. To be sure it contains great moments of sadness but for the most part it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over has no teeth and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful.I could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see a DVD version of this film and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy and only Criterion could do this effectively which is kind of disappointing since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture so I was able to catch a little but there is so much I don't know.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been asked what my favorite film of all time is. It's a silly question and the answer might have changed over the years. But I am certain now. It is Pather Panchali completed by Satyajit Ray in 1955. Strange that I would settle on an Indian film since I have specialized all my life in Italian movies and think I know a good deal about them. But no Pather Panchali spoken in Bengali and made on a budget that couldn't buy a coffee break on a major production anywhere today is my favorite film.Why? Oh goodness...because of its poetry its humanity its timeless and haunting lyric beauty its imagery its powerful portrayal of a family and a culture. I first saw it when I was a senior in high school. I went to the Avon in Providence where it played for a week in 1959. Overwhelmed I went three or four times that week. I told people about it but nobody seemed interested. And it's futile even now to promote this film among folks who only respond to graphic action moronic oneliner comedies thundering vacuous soundtracks the vapid melodrama of snakes on planes. Pather Panchali means Song of the Road and was the first film by its director made as a total labor of love. He began in 1952 in 16mm then got financing from the Bengal government to complete the work in 35mm. It took four years and was shown to great acclaim at Cannes where it won one of the top awards. It was a radical departure from Indian film convention which has characters breaking out into song every ten minutes regardless of the story.The movie was the first of a trilogy Ray completed in a few years. The Apu Trilogy is about the life of an idealistic hero. Pather Panchali deals with the youth of Apu and his impulsive sister Durga and the travails of his Brahmin priest father and his worrying mother in the midst of crushing poverty. The second and third parts are Aparajito and The World of Apu. All these classics are highly acclaimed masterpieces and very much liked by discriminating audiences.Pather Panchali turns everyday childhood occurrences into wondrous events whether it is brother and sister crossing the fields filled with white feathery rushes to see a train in the distance a pursuit of the candy man a Hindu feast the wonders of the natural world an ancient aunt telling bedtime stories to children. Death interrupts the family twice taking away young Durga too. The scene in which the longabsent father returns to learn of the death of his daughter is a lacerating wail from the beyond. Apu's concealing forever the suddenlylearned truth of a secret theft by his sister is a moment once seen can never be forgotten. In sadness mother father young son move away. The film ends.Musiciancomposer Ravi Shankar did the beautiful score. He was a virtual unknown at the time but I traced down recordings of his music decades before his legendary Woodstock appearance! and still listen to them. Ray was influenced by the Italian neorealists particularly De Sica in The Bicycle Thief which he said bowled him over.In the mid90s the films of Ray were restored and reissued to great acclaim and retrospectives took place everywhere. Pather Panchali and the rest of the Apu Trilogy are available on video or DVD at libraries and retailers and form the nucleus of any collection of world cinema. It is a shining work of art.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is certainly a masterpiece. The film is overwhelmingly real and the key element in the movie is the maintenance of this realism. The characters are so true to the ethnic ruralsixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras. Pather Panchali released in 1955 is the first film of director Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. The film is a serene and beautiful depiction of a little boy's childhood in the Indian countryside in the 1950s.The film was made on a shoestring budget by a hitherto unknown director. Apart from a seventyyearold woman who made her name in the 1930s on the stage none of the cast had ever acted before and many had been plucked from the Indian rurality. In contrast Satyajit Ray completed the trilogy on the behest of the Indian Prime Minister pointing to the film's cultural impact.It's a quiet simple tale centering on the life of a small family living in a rural village in Bengal. The father Harihar Kanu Bannerjee is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed. The mother Sarbojaya Karuna Bannerjee worries that her husband's financial laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children daughter Durga Uma Das Gupta and son Apu Subir Bannerjee. Harihar's family often lives on the edge of poverty coping with the unkind taunts of their neighbors the burden of caring for an aging aunt Chunibala Devi and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.Most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either Sarbojaya or Durga and as a result we identify most closely with these two. Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie and before the penultimate scene Apu is a mere witness to events rather than a participant. Until the closing moments we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual since he's always in someone else's shadow. The simple story of the Bengali family will definitely stay in my heart for a long time to come. If you haven't seen it yet what are you waiting for?........".

As saidthe first half is a bit slow and incoherent but that doesn't take away it's overall drama and power.Most of the actors were unexperienced but that doesn't really show.All star performances are from Chunibala Devi as the old Auntie she died before releaseUma Das Gupta as Durga and Subir Bannerjee as the young Apu.These two youngsters played only in this movieI wonder what ever happened to them. My favorite performance comes from Karuna Bannerjee as she plays Durga's and Apu's mothera very powerful and convincing role it is.The story is about family life in rural Bengal and although there are several great scenes in the movie my favorite one is the scene in which Durga is sick and her mother tries to cure her in the middle of the night while the storm is raging outside.This scene is so realistic that it actually feels that you are therethe chills came over me.The next morning Durga has died and left her mother helpless while the father played by Kanu Bannerjee is returning from his voyage in search of money.Another important part of the movie besides Ray's great directing is the music of Ravi Shankarwho is best known for his friendship in the late sixties with The Beatles listen to Within or Without You on the legendary album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.The music can be annoying to some people because of the always present Sitarbut to me it is a necessary addon to the movie. For me as a film lover this movie was very much an experience since it was the first Indian movie that I say.I've rented the entire trilogy so I can't compare them yetbut I will do so in the comments on the other two. Anywayas I am a film lover and future Film student in September this was a personal must see.After watching it I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy and other Ray movies.910 currently number 61 in my top 100".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't go into detail about this film because the greatest films ask that you really just sit back and enjoy them without questioning. This is in a very very small handful of films that create a kind of 'ecstatic truth' that Werner Herzog is always talking about. There is not a moment of handfed emotion and that's probably what hits you first after the film is finished. This is probably why the film has not hit even the first 250 on the IMDb list while it is more easily accessible than say most 'foreign' pictures it still refuses at every turn to make a clich out of itself or to be unfair to the audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious a ploy that most filmgoers fall for time and time again. A reason for this might be that Ray a young director at the time who had already worked with Jean Renoir on his landmark film about India called 'the River' really didn't have a lot of money or power to wield around and made this tight intimate story on a shoestring with an amateur crew without real concern for anything else but this story that he wanted to tell. A lot of that comes across  the locations the actors  were all real however this is a work of masterful collaboration between director cinematographer actors sound recordist and particularly the editors a collaboration that is unparalleled in most modern big budget films. This is a movie created solely with passion and I am joining in the crusade to make this one of the top 250 on IMDb though it should by default belong on the top 10 of anybody's list.".

They go on not because they are exceptional but because they must because they are human.Ray does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch singing of her approaching death are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today.

	schema:reviewBody "Pather Panchali Satyajit Ray's debut film about life in a Bengali village was the first movie from India to gain wide recognition and acclaim in the west. It is an affecting story of a rural family struggling to deal with poverty and tragedy in their ancestral home. Ray adapted the script from Bibhuti Bihushaw Banerjee's semiautobiographical novel of the same title and retells it with natural beauty and a quiet perspective. The filmmaker who came from a literary and artistic backgroundHe was a product of the Indian Renaissance was interested in the contemporary problems of his countryand he shared with the Neorealist films from Italy a simple and direct approach to making movies. Ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly lifelike. His films contained very few strains of artifice. He believed that the raw material of cinema was life itself. Ray generally concentrated on small subjects and ordinary people. He favored using nonactors and shooting on location to heighten the realism. He made films in his own style dignified and subtle sincere and with a conscience. In Pather Panchali Song of the Little Road Ray makes superb use of his milieu. The viewer immediately feels the cramped conditions of the families' decaying house and the openair confines of the surrounding forest. When Ray sends his camera beyond the village the observer can sense the allure and freedom of the vast fields that spring immodestly from a thin winding trail. Rays' was a cinema of thought and feeling in which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong. This restraint adds to the psychological intensity in his work. Nearly all of his films are marked by this remarkable depth of feeling. Pather Panchali the first installment of the Apu TrilogyAparajito and The World of Apu would follow depicts a young boy Apu exploring his everexpanding universe with a growing sense of wonder. Ray excelled at showing how children and adolescents confront mystery and joy sadness and death. The director shows Apu's burgeoning awareness with a masterful use of the long shot. Highangled distant shots track Apu and his older sister Durga as they run spiritedly through whitekashed fields. This sense of discovery gives the film it's emotional power. The director's main subject was Indiait's customs and culture. It's conflicts between the traditional way of life and the impact and influence of the West. He tried arduously to capture this synthesis between western ideas and traditional Hindu values. His concern for human problems and not issues of national politics gave his films universal appeal. Pather Panchali delineates the small joys and acute sorrows of a poor Indian family. It is an endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love and that even the most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures in their world. The film's indigenous sound track is vital to Ray's story of ancestral limitations. Twanging ektaras wailing tarshehnais and sixstringed sitars resound liberally throughout the movie. It would be difficult to imagine Pather Panchali without it's memorable score. Satyajit Ray was an unpretentious filmmaker. He was genuinely uninterested in commercial considerations. His films were lifeaffirming authentic and honest gentle and poetic truthful observations on human behavior that employed simple but strong themes. Ray's unadorned style of filmmaking was intimate probing and revealing. Possible spoiler The final scene shows the grieving family leaving their home in an oxdriven carriage to begin a new life. A trailing camera in medium closeup captures a compelling mixture of emotions on their faces. Expressions of pain and resolution hope and despair the future and the past. A seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies Satyajit Ray's profound cinema. A cinema of gentle but deep observation understanding and unabashed love of the human race.".

The several times I started to watch the film seemingly something arose during those few times and I never got very far into it. However now in my senescent years I finally got around to seeing it after realizing that I never had taken the time to see it. Having read about the trilogy and about Satyajit Ray I look back and wonder why of all the classics I've seen I'd overlooked these works of Ray. Maybe it was the trauma I experienced 50 years ago at UC Berkeley while taking a year of Sanskrit but I doubt it. I'll only say now I must have been saving it for a treat during my later years. And what a treat! The film has a languid quality and moves slowly listfully. The imagery is diffused due to in part the quality of the film but the eye of the camera misses nothing from shots of nature to a kitten stumbling and licking itself to the old Auntie brushing away flies from her food. The starkness of their poverty does not affect the world of a little boy as it does his frustrated mother and sister. His father a kindhearted dreamer seems resigned to his lot and is willing to take less to keep his sense of life and desire in balance. All of this life trajectory is classic Indian and Ray shows us to us through the camera's eye in a way that is moving joyous and profound. This is their world and Ray lets us see it through their eyes. Akira Kurasawa called Ray a genius and we guess we could say it took one to know one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Growing up in India I had heard of this movie as one of Satyajit Ray's classics and a movie which showed the utter poverty of rural India. Anything classic used to evoke a feeling of a movie usually boring and worse it's most likely would be a black and white film lamenting on the sorry state of human affairs. Of course those were the childhood metrics to gauge what a good film should be and thankfully I have outgrown those notions. Nevertheless I wanted to watch this movie when Satyajit Ray died in 1992 and once again media was talking about his movies. But somehow I didn't have access to this movie anywhere those days of VHS tapes.I watched this movie recently and was in a stunned mode throughout the span of movie. What an emotional roller coaster ride this had been and it has been done without even making you feel that it's a movie it's just seems real life happening in front of your eyes. I don't want to describe much the story hereas other have already commented much but more of what I felt watching rewatchingthis movie. The beautiful and poetic flow of this movie is so smooth that you sort of start living the life as depicted. This movie conveys the reality of hard life but with such gracefulness that you don't feel utterly bad or depressed rather you start contemplating about your existence and the beauty in such mundane things that we tend to ignore. This film gives you the moment the pause that forces you to reflect on the meaning of life. There were many moments in the film which touched the heart in many ways  Durga and Apu's longing for sweets and following the misty kaka candy man in hope.  Old Aunt's happiness on such small things as getting a stolen fruit couple of stolen chillies etc.  Mom's inner strength on managing on in a hopeless situation and shattering of it with Durga's death.  Father's wail on hearing the fate of Durga...  Apu's instinctive hiding of the truth about Durga's theft.I am fascinated and surely will watch the other two movies in the trilogy...".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the film Pather Panchali Song of the Little Road directed by Satyajit Ray you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director but in truth it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay when Ray started this film I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neorealist films had a big influence on him all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel neither child manages to see the train there although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity and the slow fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu  sister Durga share an intimate bond they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' The Unvanquished in 1956  Apur Sansar The World of Apu in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find and if found it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene and gives an allinclusive quality to the film yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness its general diffuseness its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali remarkable as it may be is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism setting out the social hierarchies introducing characters and their social or family role defining them against other people their home and nature. The second half of the film however becomes more abstract even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.".

Really speaking I doubt if anyone in India can ever cross the brilliance of this film hailed as a masterpiece! At least tell me any B'wood films which even comes half close not even the over rated Lagaan!! This movie and of course other Ray's movies are intelligent real and visualistic art. So what are the b'wood ones tissue papers....and the worst part of it is years after years these dumber movies have been sent for Oscar nominations incessantly! Time to grow up b'wood isn't it??

For various reasons it is most definitely that  a masterpiece.Ray started making this film in 1950 and finally completed it in '54. The problem? Lack of a financial backer. The reasons for this were two 1Ray was an unknown in the filmmaking business and 2his ideas for the film were deemed unworkable in terms of catering to a paying audience. However Ray persevered and managed to obtain the financing from the local West Bengal Govt. and in the process changed the face of Indian cinema forever and it needed some changing too.This is a miraculous film if one is to look at what had preceded it in India and most of what has come after. It is sensitive to the ambiance of rural Bengal which is brought out oh so beautifully by the graceful photography and the musical score of Ravi Shankar and it is  unlike most Indian cinema  honest and tender to its rustic characters without a shade of any patronising or exploitative element. The result is a beautiful warm languid film that truly captures the essence of village life in Bengal in a celluloid form that any moviegoer the world over will be able to not only appreciate but more importantly love.The acting is stunning considering a lot of nonactors were used here  a la De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief' an inspiration according to Ray. I must mention the lady who plays Chunibala  you will not find a role better executed in cinema. A prostitute in her younger days Ray tracked her down at the local Red Light District where she was living with her daughter. Ray was always an expert at picking the right man for the role and then prodding them along till they produced nearperfect performances on screen and this film is no different.This is a landmark film for Indian cinema in so many ways  the first time in India that shooting happened almost entirely outdoors the first time someone with any knowledge of the film medium and filmmaking the world over handled a camera the first time that actors acted naturally instead of the melodramainfused performances that were and still are the norm in Indian cinema. Keeping everything surrounding the film in mind and then watching the film for the beautiful journey that it is  makes you realise just how immense this work is. A remarkable tourdeforce.

Unfortunately it's flawed by an excess of sentimentality and melodrama.  Still a fine film by ordinary standards it does fail when measured against its two masterful predecessors.  But that's often the way in multivolume works.

	schema:reviewBody "I am always a bit dismayed by the attention that Pather Panchali and Charulata command in discussions on Ray because while they are fine films they do not account for Ray's cinema as a whole. In fact I would resist from picking one or even three films that 'speak for Ray' but I would be lying if I said I didn't have a favourite. Aparajito is a wonderful work of art an extremely moving melodrama and a remarkably accurate portrayal of adolescence. Of course it would be shameful to give all the credit to Ray. Bibhuti Bhusan Bandhyopadhaya's novels Aparajito is adapted from the last part of Pather Panchali and the first half of Aparajito are meticulously descriptive and Ray's success with the film owes much to the simplicity and honesty of his source. But there is something in Aparajito that belongs exclusively to the cinema  something that has to do with the the mixture of distance and intimacy in the movies of identification and unfamiliarity. You want to feel like Aparajito is a film about you but you secretly admit that it isn't it cannot be  because you experience it outside yourself in Ravi Shankar's beautiful music in the photography that oscillates between banality and the deeply metaphoric in the wonderful performances especially by Karuna Bannerjee and finally in Ray's masterful vision in putting it all together. I couldn't say much else  you must experience it for yourself!".

	schema:reviewBody "Aparajito The Unvanquished second film in Apu's trilogy by Ray is truly a masterpiece in the sense that it can still captivate any sensitive audience even after 56 years of its making and it can easily figure in any selected list of foreverclassic films. The film unfolds a story of Harihar Kanu Bannerjee Sarbojoya Karuna Bannerjee and their child Apu Pinaki Sengupta living in the city of Banaras after leaving Nishchintapur their ancestral village in Bengal mainly due to the tragic death of their daughter Durga as shown in Pather Panchali the first film of the Apu's trilogy. For earning Harihar who is a Brahmin reads the holy Hindu scriptures on the banks of holy Ganges to some Bengali widows who prefer to live in the holy city of Banaras after getting widowed. Sarbojoya is busy in her housework while Apu is spending most of his time by playing with his friends. But these moments of prosperity were cut short by the untimely death of Harihar after a brief illness. Sarbojoya was compelled to take the job of a cook in a wealthy Bengali family settled in Banaras. But to save her child from the inevitable slavery Sarbojoya left Banaras for Bengal to live in her uncle's house at Manasapota village. Apu started his study in the village school fared very well and got a scholarship for the higher study in Calcutta. After much hesitation Sarbojoya gave his son now played by Smaran Ghosal the permission to pursue the higher study in Calcutta. Apu began his struggle in the city of Calcutta to pursue his study as well as earning money for the same and became busy in it. In the mean time Sarbojoya became seriously ill and died just before Apu's final examination. Apu comes back to the village only to retrieve his mother's belongings and then returned to the city again to appear for the examination with a promise to his granduncle to perform his mother's postdeath rites Shradhwa in Calcutta. Aparajito or The Unvanquished is primarily a story of struggle between the tradition and progress first by Sarbojoya in Banaras and then by Apu. The film transcends its linear narrative style with Ray's majestic touches and excellent cinematography by Subrata Mitra. The way the film captured some fascinating glimpses of Banaras mainly through the eyes of Apu who plays and roams around the narrow and shabby lanes of Banaras steep stairs on the banks of the river Ganges old and squalid houses and sometimes in temples with the monkeys is truly beyond description. The depiction Harihar's death here with the groaning of Sarbojoya fit into the scene of suddenly dispersed pigeons on the banks of Ganges can fit among the best scenes of the Indian cinema. Some other unparalleled metaphors of the film include Apu's entry to the city of Calcutta with a geographic globe in his hand meaning entry into the wider world the English class in which the topic synecdoche is being taught and Apu falls asleep or in the last shot where Apu is heading for the city with his mother's last belongings and the sky is heavily overcast with the sounds of thunders indicating the Apu's severing of ties with the traditional occupation and journey to an uncertain and tumultuous world. The music by Ravi Shankar sublimed the whole film. Use of the Multani tune in flute of Pather Panchali to unravel the visualisation of the green landscape of Bengal in the shot when Sarbojoya and Apu are returning to Bengal is simply breathtaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy Pather Panchali was such a great film that naturally the second film in the series was bound to suffer a bit of a let down. Thus Aparajito The Unvanquished based on the novel Aparajita by Bibhutibhushan Banerjee is not the unadulterated great piece of art that Pather Panchali is. Like many middle films of a series it suffers from the infamous middle filmitis when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters the chronology of prior events and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in.Aparajito falls into this trap however in a way different from your average Hollywood blockbuster film. Whereas most middle films feel a need to fall back on what already passed in a first film Aparajito spends too much time ignoring the traits and actions that occurred in Pather Panchali almost as if Ray wanted to sever connections between the two films. He achieves this by having the film's lead character Apu not being played by the child who portrayed him in the first film Subir Banerjee. In this film Apu is first played by Pinaki Sen Gupta when ten and later by Smaran Ghosal when in hi slate teens. Two of the actors from the first film were retained Kanu Banerjee as Harihar Apu's father and his wife Sarbajaya still played by Karuna Banerjee. However there has been a major personality shift in Sarbajaya likely the only evidence of the death of Durga Apu's older sister from the first film. Whereas Sarbajaya was bossy and condescending in the first film while also being loving in this film she's timid and let's life play her whereas in the first film she was restive and dissatisfied with what life brought....The abrupt and disappointing ending is merely the most manifest sign of this tendency to rely on the fact that the viewer will have seen Pather Panchali. If coming to Aparajito on its own most viewers will be a lost or b more likely simply not as prone to care for either Sarbajaya nor Apu.That stated this is an excellent film which asides from the death scenes contains excellent poesy and metaphors such as a scene where Apu enters Calcutta on a train holding a small globe given to him as a gift by the headmaster at the school in his mother's employer's village. The film also makes good use of humor such as scenes where the young Apu plays around with monkeys and bells and later as a student in an English class where he falls asleep due to working a job and his studiousness during a lecture on synecdoche and metonymy. It also has moments of universality such as when the mother and son reacquaint after a long stay at school and the first thing Sarbajaya says is that Apu has grown taller and doesn't appear to be eating well despite the fact that neither is true. But the film's greatest strength is its depiction of fortuity. Despite its flaws Aparajito is a great what if? movie had his sister and father not died early would Apu have ended up in college? Had his mother not been emotionally devastated by both losses would she have domineered her son into submission when he wanted to go abroad? All of his family's losses and deaths his auntie his sister his father his mother all serve Apu's benefit. In short death has been very very good for Apu both in allowing him to grow and removing obstacles to his own selffulfillment which may be the most damning and tangential criticism of religion and its fetishizing by religion that Ray makes in this whole film as well as in the first film.Like the domestic troubles and idiocies that abound in a typical Yasujiro Ozu film which almost always transcends to the universal Satyajit Ray's films seem to likewise contain personal and comic moments that all viewers from any background can relate to. The problem with Aparajito especially in relation to Pather Panchali is that as far as domestic troubles go the first film's were more existential and deeper in nature making those suffered in Aparajito seem trivial by comparison. But that is the trouble with comparing excellent art to great art it always suffers by the comparison. On its own Aparajito is an outstanding film and hopefully provides merely a relatively weak link to a final film that is the equal of Pather Panchali and one that shows Apu finally taking center stage in his titular trilogy's plight.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had high hopes from one of my favorite directors about this movie. Not only because this is one of the most beautifully poetically narrated novel of the history of Bengali literature but also of the reason that this is my personal favorite 'Aporajito' that is from Great novelist Bhibhutibhushan. But my favorite director let me down big time.In this movie he built an 'Apu'which differs significantly from the original novel. In the novel Apu is a keen student of mainly literature wandering about and reading poetry from 'The Golden Treasury' in the schoolyard. On the contrary in the movie he is a keen student of science studying 1u  1v  1f. I didn't like this this thing at all. Because in the later part of his life he became a 'poet come novelist'. How can he become a 'poet come novelist' without a single reference to his liking for poetry in the whole movie? Satyajit focused on the relation between Apu and his 'a bit old fashioned' mother in a strange way. In the movie it seems that Apu has simply stopped to pay any kind of attention to his mother which is also contrary to the original novel. Yes he had a bit of a fight with his mother about studying in the school. His old fashioned mother didn't see the necessity of reading in a school while they are getting enough to live their life from Apu's career as a Hindu priest. But Apu badly wanted to read in a school which will give him knowledge about the outside world. At last Apu won he did go to read in the school but there was no lacking in love and respect for his mother in his life. He always felt his mother in the school according to the novel read out interesting stories to his mother when he was home from school. Overall he intended to share the joy of gathering knowledge with his poor mother who worked so hard to establish Apu. But Satyajit completely ignored these feelings on the basis of a paragraph from the novel that said Apu was relieved when his mother died. This isn't the way of portraying that paragraph. It merely reflected Apu's mind which was free as a flying bird. Now that his mother has passed away he would be able to roam wherever he may like without any bond of family which was a mixed feelings of slight relief and deep sorrow for the huge loss of losing his mom.The character 'Apu' is like a myth in Bengali literature comprises of sweetness of dream rather than bitterness of harsh reality. He gave hope back to me which I lost in the earlier part of my life. He is an icon not only to me but also to a lot of young people of Bengal like me. Satyajit with due respect to the great man failed to portray this mythical 'Apu'. He portrayed his own Apu. He is entitled to his opinion but I didn't like his rendition of Apu. I hope that a better rendition of Apu will be made in near future which will have similarity with Bhibhutibhusan's Apu.".

Now I have and I am a little disappointed. It is a very good film to be sure. It's often moving and it is extraordinarily directed and acted. But I think my problem with it is that it had less fluidity. It seemed more like a collection of events than a complete story with an overriding theme. The beginning of the film works the best. Apu is still a child and he enjoys his life. There are some great scenes of life in a Bengali city and it is always interesting to watch. After tragedy strikes Apu and his family move to work for a rich woman. This part contains one really great scene where Apu enters a school and is given books to read. It is an absolute joy to watch the boy learn and try to teach his mother what he has learned. Then there is a flashforward to Apu as a young man. Now here is where I began to lose interest. First of all the actor who plays the older Apu is downright ugly. Sorry to complain about such a petty thing but this guy is just hard to look at where the young Apu is the cutest child you're ever likely to see. The third part of the picture takes place in Calcutta where Apu has gone to college. Unfortunately although they ring true the events in this part of the film are somewhat formulaic. Apu's mother experiences empty nest syndrome and tries to make Apu feel guilty about it. Apu tries his hardest not to feel guilty about it. You know the kind of stuff that does actually happen between a mother and child when college comes between them. Another tragedy strikes at the end of Aparajito but by this point having watched four death scenes in the first two films of the Apu Trilogy it did not affect me very much. It should have since the character who dies at the end of Aparajito is a well established and very well written character. I cared for this person but was not affected at all when they passed on.Oh well. It still had some great moments. And I will definitely rent The World of Apu sometime soon. Maybe the main problem in Aparajito is that it feels like the center of a trilogy. It doesn't introduce anything new and it doesn't solve anything. I'll see soon how it all turns out. 810".

	schema:headline " In a simple world Apu lives a profound life and Satyajit Ray captures his Apu's transition wonderfully in Pather Panchali's sequel Aparajito";
	schema:reviewBody "The sun wakes up in the land of Benaras. An aged temple priest scatters seeds for the pigeons. Men take their morning dip in the holy river bordering a ghat series of steps. Women wash their clothes in the same waters. A couple of pehelwans wrestlers exercise with gadas heavy Indian club close to the river banks. Priests sit close by sermonizing to their loyal devotees. Ships can be heard at a distance. It is morning. Have we never seen a morning like this? We probably have at least most who live or have lived in India. Yet why do we watch this morning with a quaint fascination? This is because Satyajit Ray doesn't regard his morning sequence as an establishment shot as most directors would  his camera gazes with wonderment at how life begins in the land of Benaras and that gives his morning a wholly distinctive identity. We find young Apu walking beside the ghat one morning passing by the chanting priests and their devotees and stopping where a pehelwan is exercising. He fixedly gazes at the gada which the hefty pehelwan is swinging around his body and then leaves. After his father's untimely demise he reluctantly becomes a priest at the insistence of a male relative. But he seems to have little interest in this as evident in a scene where he watches in his priest's attire a couple of young boys his age tumbling and gamboling happily at a distance and then follows them after ditching his dhoti. He watches as they enter a school and then at night asks his mother whether he can join the same school. Once he gets admission he's found to be a bright student who can recite lokgeet folk music fluently and we realize maybe his short stint as a priest did pay off well. Apu's world is simple yet his life is profound. There isn't explicit symbolism anywhere yet but we know how symbolic each event in his journey is as evident from the paragraph above. Moving to a big city like Benares from a tiny village like Nischindipur living the city life shortly till the death of his father moving to another village called Dewanpur attending a school nearby and earning a scholarship moving to Calcutta for further studies with little enthusiasm to return to the dismal village life are covered in Aparajito.Apu's thinking values and priorities blossom as his life passes these phases take a scene in the film where Apu in his teens watches a couple of street children performing but finds their act uninteresting and leaves. Had this been young Apu he'd be very enthused by their performance and watched it till the end. Aparajito is Apu All Grown Up.His selfsacrificing mother Sarbajaya gives him all her hardearned money so he can move to Calcutta and she surrenders herself to a life of loneliness. Apu's priorities shift towards college studies and printing press work and he only visits her once in every few months. Satyajit Ray uses still shots to capture her emotions and actress Karuna Banerjee's eyes speak volumes her memorable 'Opu!' for calling Apu Bengalis usually pronounce many of their words with an 'O' intonation stayed with me long after the film ended. Apu's college life was probably the only sequence that impressed me less only because I've already seen similar scenes in many other recent movies. But what matters at last is our strong attachment to Apu's world we laugh with weep for and find joy in watching his world. Part of the credit has to go to Ravi Shankar's enchanting score dominated by sitar flute and dholak for creating the right mood for each scene. Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali and Aparajito give the pleasure of experiencing the same world through his eyes. And we are swept over completely.".

	schema:reviewBody "This deeply moving second entry in Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy comes from midFifties India but recalls the much more modern American film Boyhood. Talk about universality!Here we continue to observe the amazingly expressive actress Karuna Banerjee as mother Sarbojaya as she quietly interacts with her son and husband first in the busy city of Varanasi and later in Mansapota a rural village.Apu goes from being a funloving preteen Pinaki Sen Gupta who stops to feed monkeys and runs errands for his mother to a more independent and enigmatic college student Smaran Ghosai. Along the way his loving father earns coins as a priest along the holy Ganges but dies rather suddenly in a shockingly intense scene shortly after bringing a stranger home for boiledmilk and tea. The film skips over any mourning process for Harihar Kanu Banerjee as if to suggest that life goes on despite the worst depredations and hardships. It's almost as if Sarbojaya can continue as long as she maintains an interaction with her sole surviving child. Sarbojaya does as she must  by allowing Apu to attend school  and there's the rub. Ray introduces a theme familiar from another of his great films The Home and the World as we observe the inevitably estranging effects of education. Sarbojaya yearns to be a part of her Apu's life but as time elapses that possibility fades. And she becomes a widow of another sort as she ebbs and her son scarcely notices. Tragically Apu procrastinates in going home to visit when his mother is ill and he even delays performing her holy shraddah ceremony  perhaps the greatest betrayal of all. Is there a mother alive who doesn't identify with Sarbojaya's struggle? In that sense this discomforting film manages to bring some succor. Accompanied by the mesmerizing sitar work of virtuoso Ravi Shankhar.".

	schema:headline " Analysis of the cinematic techniques exclusive to Saiyajit Ray's style";
	schema:reviewBody "In his 1957 film Aparajito director Satyajit Ray continues to follow the story of a curious and ambitious child named Apu as he experiences the dismal reality of life and the trials and tribulations associated with it. Ray uses his simple film style to evoke a sense of realism by portraying realistic events and also to procure certain themes such as growing up modernity and death. By analyzing certain elements of Ray's unique film style which include his use of miseen scne setting plot and more there are certain conclusions to be made regarding the film's ability to accurately convey reality especially from the perspective of a growing adolescent.In contrast to the typical upbeat Bollywood films that India was producing through his films Ray sought to depict the reality of people's lives without sentimentality or glorification 41. In his film Aparajito Ray seeks to portray the raw and unrefined reality of the transitional experience from adolescence into adulthood. Apu's character embodies a youthful spirit and seems to radiate positivity and vitality yet certain tragic events throughout his life forcibly mature him such as the death of his carefree great aunt which was the first indication that his childhood would soon be expiring. After moving to the densely populated city suburbs to escape the tragic memories of the deaths of their loved ones Apu's father also shortly falls ill and dies forcing Apu to enter the role as an adult and shoulder more responsibility. The death of Apu's father also serves partially as a criticism of his chosen trade in which he worked as the village priest a position that is ironically associated with wellness but instead contributes to his demise. Later on in the film when Apu's mother forces him to become educated on becoming a priest like his father Apu longs to play with other children instead and to join them in school. By contributing to his father's death and also to nearly depriving Apu of an education the position as a village priest is further emphasized to have deleterious effects and signifies Apu's need to lead a life different from his parents. By continuing his studies at a university it is implied that his absence contributed to his mother's loneliness illness and eventual death. However at one point Apu's mother attempts to sabotage his education that creates distance between them by not waking him up in time for the train Ahmed 41. This event signifies Apu's increasing estrangement from his roots that seem to impede his ability to lead his own life including his own mother.This film also functions as an indicator of the increasingly modernizing society in which the events of Apu's life take place Ahmed 41. Ray seems to criticize modernity as it makes itself more apparent in Apu's life such as by presenting the city through the film's imagery as being a grungy and claustrophobic. The fact that Apu's father also passes away partly as a result of the city's arduously steep stairs signifies the symbol of modernity as being perilous. Modernity also takes the form of a train that appears several times throughout the Apu trilogy and each appearance signifies the onset of great change in Apu's life Ahmed 41. Apu's first sight of the train occurs just before his sister's death an event that led to his family's move to the city in search of a better life. Upon his second sight of the train Apu realizes his desire to board it and to go to the city to which it was headed and create a life for himself outside of his mother's plan for him.Director Satyajit Ray's film Aparajito explores the concepts of realism growing up modernity and death through the unique use of miseenscne plot setting and more. Ray's decision to shoot on location for most of the film results in a more realistic and faithful view of the grungy surroundings in which Apu grows up. Certain objects and events in this film such as the train and the deaths of Apu's close family members also function as symbols of his increasing sense of individuality and maturation. While also showing some of the joys and pleasantries of childhood and growing up this film generally relays the tragedies associated with the passage of time and life itself. Ray's film could be perceived as dismal and hopeless but it is the very character of Apu that challenges this criticism in that despite all of his losses he continues his education in order to one day make a new life for himself.Work Cited Ahmed Talat.

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't a bad film by any means. It's well made often beautifully shot though not exceptionally so compared to many others before during the 1950s or after. For me it just doesn't have that interesting of a directorial or filmic vision nothing that is exciting as the depth probed by the exploration of inner states and torment of characters in Bergman's films the poetic cinematography and atmosphere of Tarkovsky the excitement and technique of Kurosawa or even the warmth offered by Ozu another director who made rather simple films focusing on family life. It's similar to the first film in the trilogy in many ways and my review of that would probably be about identical. Pacing is arguably better the first and second halves are more varied where the second half has a more traditional plot leading the film instead of characters just wandering around and talking merely showing how the characters live from day to day.My ignorance of Indian culture may play a part in my indifference but I've also seen films from many cultures that were unknown to me and was enthralled so I don't think it's necessarily that. The characters don't have much to act on they never say anything that is interesting or insightful about the world around them even granted the family did not have a high level of literacy and Apu knew very little before the headmaster took an interest in him. The central characters are the mother and Apu and neither say or do much. It's all so simple and linear there's little that adequately stirs the thoughts or emotions in a way that compares to other great films or literature. While the cinematography is good it never reaches the height of the fantastic scene with the train in the first movie. The locations especially early on are beautiful. And the acting is naturalistic at many points especially for the 1950s. However It appears to me that this and Ray's career were outliers in Indian cinema mostly known for Bollywood films. Ray was an auteur who intended to make more realistic and intimate films in a country that primarily churned out very commercial films with little room for independents. To me while this is a well made trilogy the only reason I can find that it's regarded as highly as it is in the history of film is because of its unique place in history more so than the contents of the film.".

In additionRay was also able to put his master visualization of that culture and people. The cinematography was highly appreciable. All the shot maintained with grammatically like dollyclose upcrane and nice panning. However to judge this master art is also kind of humiliation for Ray.The character Apu earns some major point of the early Calcutta. For me this cinema is some kind of knowledge which i needed in past and finally got the answer.".

The acting ranges from the intense too intensely wooden. Eric Bana is engaging in an aloof amalgamation of insanity and infantile. The other male lead Charlie Hunnam barely registers even though he is given the most screen time.There is very little invested in the female Deputy and her Sheriff Dad and the conflicted Parents. Some effort is made in the end to strengthen these complex situations but it is really rushed and rather anticlimactic. It is best when things are on the move and the hunt is on and at worst in the convoluted love story in the middle. Overall it is a good thriller that can be enjoyed for its moving parts despite the stale and stoic presentation of psychological situations that are presented in such shallowness as to be distracting.".

Kris Kristofferson  although supposed to be playing a hardened exdetective still comes off a little too wooden.

It is a fine little film and deserves more attention.The title DEADFALL is translated by the dictionary as 'A trap for large animals in which a heavy weight is arranged to fall on and kill or disable the prey.' How that title applies to his story is one of the subtle strong points in this dissection of three dysfunctional families. Siblings Addison Eric Bana and Liza Olivia Wilde are on the run from a casino heist gone wrong. When a car accident leaves their wheel man and a state trooper dead they split up and make a run for the Canadian border in the worst of circumstances  a near whiteout blizzard. While Addison heads crosscountry killing everyone who crosses his path or who could provide transportation possibilities Liza is picked up by exboxer Jay Charlie Hunnam who has just been released from prison for fixing a boxing match and is enroute for a Thanksgiving homecoming with his parents June Sissy Spacek and retired sheriff Chet Kris Kristofferson. Following Addison's wake of killings the sheriff Treat Williams loses many of his men and ridicules his new deputy daughter Kate Mara. The story all come together at the Thanksgiving dinner at June and Chet's place  where the three families' ties are strained to the breaking point. It's there the siblings are reunited in a terse and thrilling showdown that pushes the bonds of family to the limit.The freezing cold of the blizzard backdrop is juts right for the tension that pervades this story. The original musical score by Marco Beltrami underlines all the facets of this tale. While every one in the cast is excellent it is Eric Bana that pulls of a very well written role in a manner that despite his actions he never loses our empathy. Grady Harp".

Sissy Spacek and Kris Krsitoppher are good.In the end there is nothing much to expect from a movie besides that it's a B class thriller with gorgeous faces. I found movie quite entertaining it may not have the most lovable characters but they sure are pretty. Good Time pass.";

The relationship between the sheriff and his daughter and the how the men treated her and her stoic dealing with it...wow I could not have handled it.The relationship between the siblings was ambiguous but inspiring at the same time. The relationship in the family between the spouses and the son was written with such deft strokes which said so much. The actors were fabulous. Especially at the dinner table at the climax of the story. The mother Sissy Spacek had such easy going wisdom about her but exploded with outraged indignation when pushed beyond the limit.Loved the way the brother got the L word out of the protagonist in the climactic denouement. And it left you in the end wondering how the story would go on with our antiheroes.One of those screenplays where you just fall in love with the bad guy and it just kills you to know he is fated and that he has written his own tragedy as well as having been written by it. Look forward to more of Zach Dean's screenplays.".

The writing was excellent and Bana gave yet another great performance as a violent man who was crazy and funny and charming and human. Writer Zach Dean combined the Western crime thriller sports and family genres to tell a story about three dysfunctional families that are brought together by the trauma of childhood abuse. I knew where the story was going and yet in the end Dean was able to surprise me with how he got there. He did a masterful job pulling together his threads in a way that reminded me of Paul Haggis's work in Crash. Dean's story set in the modern West even included an Indian chief in what was one of my favorite scenes. Afterwards I reflected on Bana's work and wondered if he will ever reach the pinnacle of achievement we saw in the fantastic Australian film Chopper. That role allowed Bana to use all of his gifts in a way that I will never forget and which makes him for me one of the greatest actors working today.".

The cast had me interested right away. The movie started off fast and never really slowed down. It is a movie where you seem to be one step ahead of what is going on though and that kind of hurts the overall enjoyment. When you can predict 90 of what is going to happen before it does you start to lose interest at least I do. I did like the movie and I would recommend it but don't expect a lot of twists.

I don't know if it was a feminist agenda in play or just diabolically poor writing but there was an overarching antimale sentiment running throughout the police element of the story. It was completely unnecessary utterly misplaced and served only to bizarrely detract from the central story. If they wanted to tell the tale of the poor downtrodden policewoman VS evil Neanderthal men they should have gone ahead and made that movie but to try and shoehorn all of this into another movie is a hell of an amateur move and just an allround bad idea.Some examples I that stood outthe police woman not being included in the hunt for the criminals despite the fact the sheriff is her father.the school yard menstruation putdown in front of her colleagues by HER OWN FATHER AND SUPERIOR.

If you're female and wonder what the big deal is then I beg you please just try to take a couple of minutes to imagine a similar scenario with the sexes reversed.

Bearing in mind how far she's got from the crash scene they can't be very far apart and he was no better dressed so this made little sense.the male fugitive just happening upon a child molestation scenario providing him with the perfect provocation to murder the male cabinowner and hide out in the cabin for a while.

They try to justify this but it still doesn't fly one bit in my book.woman who's literally just been taken hostage demanding that the hostagetaker opens a window after he lights a cigarette. Perhaps that'd fly in a comedy but not real life and not this kind of drama.ESP on the part of the female fugitive when she suddenly states that she knows Jay is on the run.Jay's Buddhaesque compassion in instantly and completely overlooking the fact that the hitchhiking girl knowingly misled and used him to rendezvous with her criminal brother at his parents' house thus endangering all of their lives and directly resulting in the shooting of 2 apparent family friends.

The basic idea is a sound one there were some truly wellshot scenes and the whole thing had quite a distinct style to it. Sadly though this was contaminated beyond redemption with all the antimale cartoon nonsense. It really crossed a line.As an aside it breaks my heart to see Treat Williams reduced to this slurry  he was such a powerful actor back in the day. What a crying shame.So I guess if you're a raging manhater maybe this will rock your boat or at least provide some ammunition.

Then he splits the money with Liza and tells her to get a ride to the border while he will cross the woods. Addison leaves a trail of blood in his runaway. Meanwhile the former boxer Jay Charlie Hunnam who was arrested for losing a fight is released from prison on probation and calls his mother June Mills Sissy Spacek that lives in an isolated house with his estranged father Chet Mills Kris Kristofferson that was the former Sheriff. June invites her son for the Thanksgiving dinner but he goes first to the gym to collect money that his couch owes him. They quarrel and Jay hits him and believes that has killed him. He flees and while driving on the road he sees Liza and gives a ride to her. Soon they fall in love with each other. Meanwhile Sheriff Marshall T. Becker Treat Williams is hunting Addison with his men but he does not allow that his daughter Deputy Hanna Kate Mara to participate in the hunting party. The Thanksgiving will end with all the characters gathering at Chet and June's home. Deadfall is a good thriller with impressive landscape in the snow.

The film starts off with an accident early with brothersister team of Addison Eric Bana and Liza Olivia Wilde having to break off in a wintry environment to journey north toward the Canadian border in order to escape with their new found loot robbed from a nearby casino.Director Stefan Ruzowitzky's movie puts Bana in a negative role as a robber who has no qualms in violently dispatching anyone who stands in his way and freedom. With each encounter we see both his compassionate side when having to deal with defenseless women and children and his explosive nature when up against those whom he deem as a threat expertly and clinically finishing off anyone whether those from the law or otherwise as long as one has something of value that can aid in his escape.But Zach Dean's story goes beyond that one man Rambo action with another plot running in parallel with exboxer Jay Charlie Hunnam released from prison and on the run after his visit to an exmanager ended up in a fisticuffs and a comatose. Invited by his mom June Sissy Spacek to return home for Thanksgiving Jay runs into Liza and a romance between strangers develop faster than you can say Clich with Liza seemingly having the upper hand in manipulating June to having do things to her advantage though it's not before long that real emotions get into play as she tries to put some distance between him herself and their inevitable destination that would bring them face to face with Addison.Although there are elements in this storyline involving well used clichs when put together effectively they become a taut thriller filled with a genuine sense of danger especially when the stage is set knowing the violent and unpredictable nature of Addison and the equally hottempered Jay. Zach Dean's story also goes one up from the average conventional story with having a strong fatherchild issues become the spotlight amongst multiple characters here such as the policewoman Hanna Kate Mara and her constant struggle for acceptance from her police chief father Becker Treat Williams and the estranged relationship between Chet Kris Kristofferson and Jay. And as if family matters cannot get more complicated suggestions of incest also gets dangled around between Addison and Liza hinted ever so slightly but no less making an impact about how twisted the two characters can be if not for the transformation in Liza when getting romantically involved with another.Action sequences were brilliantly shot especially those snow white chases using snow mobiles. It's clear from the start that the violence will be graphic without consciously needing to censor itself so plenty of graphic moments got shown without a flinch. One of the most tense sequences involved all the characters converging around a dinner table in what would almost be like Michael Haneke's Funny Games with the one holding the gun calling the shots and having that sense of superiority to impose his will upon those unfortunately caught in his web. That scene along is priceless and makes up more than a reason to watch this on the big screen. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "What would home look like? I don't know. A farmhouse in the valley I guess like the one we grew up in Liza and I.Academy Award winning director for his foreign film The Counterfeiters Stefan Ruzowitzky now brings us an American crime thriller dealing with dysfunctional families. It seems to be an odd choice for a director who had so much success back in Austria considering this is an average Bfilm that doesn't introduce anything new or unique to the genre. Deadfall never manages to deliver the thrills that it promises either and has a rather unsatisfying ending. At times it felt like a film that was trying to be something else but it never quite figured out what it wanted to be and ended up only scratching the surface of the dysfunctional family drama it was so desperately tying to explore. Perhaps it suffered from trying to add several subplots and intertwine them together towards the climactic end but ultimately Deadfall felt like your average crime thriller with a strong ensemble cast but a poor and unimaginative script. Deadfall never quite delivers the thrills and the characters are underdeveloped turning this film into a messy ordeal. As much as I wanted to enjoy this I couldn't find anything redeeming about it and not even the beautiful Olivia Wilde shines here. It's a dull film that tries to be more important than it really is with way too many subplots and overlapping themes that are barely explored.The screenplay was written by Zach Dean centering on two siblings Addison Eric Bana and Liza Olivia Wilde who are heading towards the Canadian border after having pulled of a casino heist. We never see the actual heist take place since the film opens with them already in route to the border when all of a sudden in the midst of a blizzard their vehicle crashes into a deer. Addison is forced to kill the patrolman and decides to split up with Liza and meet up later as the police will be after him. On another note we are introduced to a former boxer named Jay Charlie Hunnam who is being released from prison. The first thing Jay does is call his mother June Sissy Spacek who lives in a farmhouse near the spot where Addison and Liza crashed. She invites Jay over for Thanksgiving dinner despite the fact that he's been estranged with his father Chet Kris Kristofferson. Along the way Jay finds Liza nearly freezing to death near the highway and he decides to give her a lift. Addison on the other hand is being hunted by Sheriff Becker Treat Williams and his men who are closing in on the trail of blood he's left behind. Becker's daughter Hannah Kate Mara whose also an officer is ordered to stay in the station and out of trouble. As the characters are all introduced it becomes inevitable to realize that they are all going to intersect somewhere along the way.Despite the talented ensemble cast the script is so poorly written that there is not much they can do to prevent their characters from becoming cardboard cutouts. Even the always reliable and legendary actors such as Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spacek can't do anything to save this film. Hunnam and Wilde have a very poorly developed romantic subplot that felt extremely rushed. Bana didn't really look too menacing as the villain and at times his character felt cartoonish. The dysfunctional family elements that this film tries to explore never really gets anywhere and they all seem too clich. The male characters are seen as tough while the females are forgiving and patient. The western showdown near the end wasn't engaging either and everything about this film felt ordinary despite the different themes they were trying to blend together. It never digs under the surface of those elements it's trying to introduce and that's why the film feels so dull and empty. Deadfall is not the important and smart thriller it's trying to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Best known for the crime drama THE COUNTERFEITERS which won the foreignlanguage Oscar in 2008 Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky's DEADFALL starts with a bang. Following from the aftermath of a casino heist criminal siblings Addison Eric Bana and Liza Olivia Wilde speeding their car along the slippery road of northern Michigan snowdrift. Suddenly an accident happens out of nowhere which sends their car flipped into the air which is brilliantly shot from inside of the car and crashes down the snowcovered land and ends up killing their driver. While Liza is trying to retrieve all the heist money scattered all over the place a state trooper shows up. Addison wastes no time to approach the state trooper and shoots him to death. So far so good. No doubt Ruzowitzky knows a lot of camera placements and staging a knockout action sequence. But what follows next is a bloated thriller that drags a lot throughout the course of its 95minute duration.Soon after the intense opening scene Addison decides that he and Liza must split up as they make their way through the cold wilderness in which both of their goals are to reconnect again near the Canadian border.Enter former Olympic silvermedalist boxer Jay Charlie Hunnam who is fresh out of prison and finds himself already in deep trouble after critically injured his extrainer. He flees the scene and drives as far as he can to avoid getting arrested by the police. En route to Thanksgiving dinner at the home of his parents June Sissy Spacek and Chet Kris Kristofferson he meets Liza and kind enough to give her a lift. Both of them end up spending the night at a motel which is needless to say they fall for each other.Meanwhile Addison seeks refuge in a small hunting cabin after killing an abusive husband and helps the surviving family.There's more Sheriff Becker Treat Williams is ordering a manhunt against Addison and Liza. Except for his deputy daughter Hanna Kate Mara in which he shuts her out of the manhunt because he doesn't like her at all.With numerous plot threads here and there it's understandable that Ruzowitzky and firsttime screenwriter Zach Dean tries hard to deliver something more meaty than just a regular catandmouse thriller. Somewhere in between there's a modern Western genre with a dash of noir at play think FARGO or even A SIMPLE PLAN. That's not all there's an attempt of complex family drama as well. Such genre mishmash can be a good thing if handle with care. But that's hardly the case in this movie. Zach Dean's screenplay may have been ambitious but his writing is awfully clunky.As for Ruzowitzky his direction is terribly haphazard and he only delivers in certain portions. Most of the scenes are lazily constructed and to make things worst the muchawaited payoff is disappointingly bland and predictable.Apart from the exciting opening scene the cast here are quite impressive. Eric Bana is intense as the coldblooded villain while Olivia Wilde is certainly gorgeous enough to look at. Charlie Hunnam fits the role as the brooding fugitive and Kate Mara is likable as a young deputy. Both veterans Sissy Spacek Kris Kristofferson and Treat Williams play their respective roles adequate enough.Technical credits are overall aboveaverage particularly with Shane Hurlbut's perfectly atmospheric cinematography for the snowbound landscapes Quebec locations convincingly stand in for Michigan's Upper Peninsula.DEADFALL is one huge missed opportunity. It could have been a great crime drama if not for its wobbly execution.".

The baddies say they're headed north on US131 to the border. Heading north on US131 you'll never hit the border of anything you'll just run into more Michigan. They say they're headed north to Canada but they would have to cross the Mackinaw Bridge and then the International Bridge way up in the Upper Peninsula and that's one helluva long haul. And for the sheriff to instruct his men to move east toward I75 is laughable as the distance between the 131 and I75 is absurdly large for such instruction. Then toss in Spacek leaving her front door open while she walks a cop to her car is so out of place as to defy logic  they're in a blizzard and closing roads. Why do I ramble on about these things? Because these sort of miscues suck the life out of any movie. However if you view Michigan as a place of misogynistic cops wife abusing husbands murderers and manipulative women this is the film for you.".

Again the boxer character Don't even want to know his name rather forget him is an absolute idiot cheeseball lines and the type of acting you would expect from a TV movie. The screenplay is particularly poor as well attempts to make up for the lack of plot with lines likeYou know he's an asshole the sheriff... your father!I figured that out in the previous scene when she called him Dad. Moranic lines are present throughout. If you want to see a real movie in a similar vein that is well executed check out Fargo.".

Again the boxer character Don't even want to know his name rather forget him is an absolute idiot cheeseball lines and the type of acting you would expect from a TV movie. The screenplay is particularly poor as well attempts to make up for the lack of plot with lines likeYou know he's an asshole the sheriff... your father!I figured that out in the previous scene when she called him Dad. Moranic lines are present throughout. If you want to see a real movie in a similar vein that is well executed check out Fargo.";

In fact it had to many holes in it. Now I want to explain that I didn't expect script to be such complicated as for example... Shutter Island or Inception films. However I wanted nice thriller for my evening. The story was nice brother and sister running from the police and gets in into small town. I liked that there were other characters' stories which kind of connects in the middle of the film. But some places in the it were just not logical love thing I can't explain more because of the spoilers.. body wound aspects which brought me into movies of 90's where Bruce Willis could beat 50 guys with less than 50 percent of remained blood in the body... And the ending. So disappointing! While I was watching it I thought 'Well I will give to this film 6 stars in IMDb if the end of it will satisfy me'. However it ended so quickly without any showing how the life started  ended for all characters in the it. And believe me the end of the film wasn't something deep or that one which requires to think over again about it. No. It just not finished.".

The film is about a brother and sister who are on the run from a casino job gone wrongthe characters Addison and Liza are played by Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde.after their car crashes they end up separating and going different ways in the snow. this film had good characters and good character development and i like that in a film and i'd like to see much more of that in other films rather than just non stop Action. that's what i liked about this film it wasn't just Action it was also suspenseful and mysterious and there were touches of romance thrown into the story which i thought was nice. i thought this film was written and directed well and i also thought the film had a strange mysterious vibe to it which i found interesting. the sister played by Olivia Wilde is picked up by a character called Jay played by Charlie Hunnam a man who has just been released from prison. Jay and Liza end up in a relationship and get feelings for each other. Eric Bana the girls brother plays a dangerous crazy character and he had a troubled childhood and later in the film we find out his sister did too. the movie has a few psychological moments to it which i thought were okay. There was not much character development of the character Hanna who was played by Kate Mara which is too bad because i liked her characterher father the sheriff also could have been written betterbut the other characters had more to them which made them more intriguing. i also liked the idea of the freezing cold blizzard in the story it made the film more exciting. Eric Bana's Character kills people throughout the film mainly anyone that gets in his way.i thought the acting was good from everyone especially Eric Bana he played a really good bad guy in my opinion and i found his character interesting. i found Erics character dangerous crazy and sometimes i found him rather funny i can't quite explain whyhis character just had a certain funny charm to him and i laughed at quite allot of the weird faces he pulled in this film.he's definitely a weird character in this film especially right at the end. later in the film Eric Bana finds out where his sister is and in The last twenty five minutes of the film Eric Bana's character holds Jay and his family hostage at a thanksgiving dinnerhis sister Liza is there too and he doesn't let any of them leave the house. Eric Banna was very crazy and sinister in the last part of the film and he played his part well when he started taking control of the family. Charlie Hunnam was also very good in the film especially at the end when he stood up to Addison and protected his family from him. to sum things up This film had some good fights some good mystery and some good chase scenes on the snow mobiles which i really enjoyed and the end part of the film inside the house was very exciting and intense!. I found this film very interesting and entertainingit may not have had non stop Action all the way but it was still very entertaining all the way throughand the main Action kicks in during the last part of the movie during the hostage situation at the thanksgiving dinner. I thought this movie was pretty good and i liked it and its definitely worth a watch!. 810.".

Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Shane Hurlbut.Siblings Addison Bana and Liza Wilde are fleeing a casino heist that's gone badly wrong. Deciding to split up they arrange to meet up at a later point and go their separate ways. Liza hooks up with ex convict Jay Hunnam while Addison has a date with an abusive father.

Shane Hurlbut photographs it in steely cold metallic blues piercing whites and bloody reds then laying an ethereal sheen over the night time sequences. This is perfect tonal accompaniment to the characterisations fronting the story Addison and Liza have definite incestuous leanings with the former capable of brutal violence when required. Jay out of prison is a big disappointment to his father Kristofferson but more pressing concerns are a deadly confrontation he is forced into and that he's falling for Liza who appears to be damaged goods and whose motives are unclear.On the supposed good side of the snowy fence is Hannah Mara and Becker Williams daughter and father cops she strives to make her daddy proud he resents her for not being a son even chastising her with cold venom in front of other officers. It's a whirlpool of troubled characters battling it out in the snowy wilds of North America. Ruzowitzky inserts some quality action sequences as the protagonistsantagonists snake towards their date with destiny which arrives in a classy film noir trope way at Jay's parents house. The air is pungent with fatalism and the link of all characters having kin problems gives the narrative some bite. Very well performed by the cast this is comfortably recommended to neonoir lovers. 7.510".

After carefully verifying that nobody will put any tubes up their rectums because apparently that's the only unacceptable condition they sign up for a two weeks stay at a medical facility and agree with the terms that they cannot have any contact with the outside world and swallow whatever medication Dr. Wilcox and her team prescribes them. Several indicators prove that the testing of Ravenix' new drug isn't kosher like the decaying state of the hospital facility and the lack of medical staff involved but the new drug appears to show off positive results immediately. The recovery ratio in case of illnesses and the healing processes in case of physical wounds increase at phenomenal speed and after a few days it even occurs that cutting wounds heal instantly. But like usually the issue with new medicines the side effects and shortcomings are quite extreme. Most notable is the fact that the human lab rabbits become completely inadvertent to all kind of emotions. And of course what to do in case of urgent surgery when the body can't be incised? I watched Bloodwork at the annual Brussels Festival of Fantastic Films where it got promoted as a stateoftheart and innovative thriller. This isn't quite correct unfortunately as far too often the film comes across as derivative and mundane but it's nonetheless a very entertaining thriller with a handful of original aspects and occasional flashes of sheer suspense. Particularly the unfolding of the drug's side effects is adequately demonstrated. We initially witness how the group indifferently reacts to a rotting animal's carcass in the cafeteria and you actually wonder why they're not repulsed. A little while later there's even a couple having sex in a cockroachinfested room and remain unbothered. Regretfully however after a fairly solid and plausible middlesection Bloodwork rapidly descends into a bad spiral of dull clichs and routines. Obviously the project supervisor will stop at nothing to continue the experiments and naturally the tests are all part of a secret government scheme led by one political big shot. None other than Eric Roberts  civilized bervillain 1  makes a less than 2 minute cameo appearance for this part and presumably also received the largest paycheck. But still if you manage to switch off your brain functions and look passed all these hopelessly annoying defaults you'll find a worthwhile thriller perfectly suitable for a lazy Saturday evening in a comfortable couch. As said the film contains a few admirable ideas and highlight sequences the motivated acting performances from the ensemble cast are much better than the routine script deserves and supportive actress Mircea Monroe demonstrates that she has beautiful breasts.".

But I actually found out it really wasn't as bad as I feared.So first a little summary  with quite a few spoilers so be warned if you haven't seen it two college boys accept to be part of an experiment in a pharmaceutical lab for what is presented to them as a test for a new drug for allergies. The test quickly proves itself to be something completely different though as the drug being tested aims at making people more or less invulnerable. The problem being that it has quite nasty sideeffects first removing all feeling of disgust then basically every kind of social inhibition and also being extremely addictive. In the end the movie gets into zombiemovie territory even though there are actually no zombies in it but flesh eating people who are almost impossible to kill are close enoughSo of course the characters are quite monodimensional and there isn't a lot of surprise here. The most complex character seems to me to be Dr Wilcox and I think Tricia Helfer did quite a nice job she has obligations and wants it to work she's probably paid a lot for it and she might also know how everything will end up if she fails knowing who her clients are. But her doubts show more and more as the experiment turns slowly into a complete disaster. So of course she has cheesy lines but after all she hasn't been the one writing the dialogue I found the acting mostly quite good considering the obviously low budget and the simple enough characters.I thought the atmosphere was quite good too and I really ended up weirded out and wondering as the side effects started to show. The scene with the couple having sex while they are run over by cockroaches and don't seem to care the least definitely worked for me. The idea of having one of the study subjects needing an operation and ending up dying because it was impossible to cut her open as the wounds healed instantly was also very nice.There are a few things that were quite bad though mostly because they were completely unbelievable the team of 'specialists' putting explosives more or less randomly in the building the two college guys miraculously succeeding to escape after we've seen them running before the explosion when they were like on the 4th or 5th floor hint the only way they could have escaped here would have been to jump out of a window and from this high they would be dead or severely injured the Aaron guy still alive in the end but with a wound around his neck either he has taken the drug and he wouldn't have the wound or he didn't and he would be dead and the guy chopping a head off with an ax which is so unrealistic that is is quite laughable.But in the end I found the movie quite enjoyable.

The movie is about to College students GregTravis Van Winkle and RobJohn Bregar who take part in a pharmaceutical study. A new drug for allergies it needs to be tested and the pharmaceutical company needs it's Guiana pigs. The roommates want to take a trip to Amsterdam for Spring Break so they sign up regardless. I would too for 3000 dollars who wouldn't. The drug is RXZ19 and the viewer will find that out later in the film when they are at the clinic facility. Once they are there they are searched for alcohol cell phones and any personal devices. The personal items are are stored until the trial is over. They meet others there Nigel who is a trial freak other students one excon and an older lady are there. The trials begin with blood tests Aaron who is a Phlebotomist comes around to Rob to get blood. Aaron gets the crap scared out of him when he is just doing his job. The trials begin with blood work drug stages and observations. Dr. Wilcox Tricia Helfer is a Dr that is going to push the envelop with this study. The study is usually in 5 doses but she is going the distance to do more than 5 doses. If you know anything about drug trials half the group gets the drug  and the other half placebo. This is where I think they got it wrong with the study usually more than one person gets the sugar pill. In this study they all get the juice except Greg. He is curious about what is going on and goes to Dr. Wilcox's office. Once there he uncovers animals that have undergone serious surgeries and wonders what is going on. Just then Dr Wilcox walks in and explains what she has done and tells him what this drug is capable of doing. She finds out he is on the placebo suffering from no effects of the medicine. He is normal has no transformations and is grossed out by rotting food dead animals bugs and E.T.C.. The others are not and are turning into zombie like creatures. Greg truly finds out the effects of the drug a drug that can heal a person in no time at all a regenerative drug. When Greg finds out he wants out but the others don't. Dr. Wilcox is willing to pay 8000 to the trial subjects and staff. This is were she pushes the limits regardless of the outcome. She gives everyone 2 extra doses and the group becomes more violent and dependent on it it gets to where the test subjects what more and more of the drug. The group starts turning into zombie like creatures capable of anything. In the end she realizes something must be done and starts the detox Rob Greg's friend is the first. While Rob is going though detox the remaining subjects are out of control killing the staff and keeping Greg from leaving the premises. Greg finally sees Aaron The Phlebotomist and Aaron tells him he is still in the clinic. I have no idea why Eric Roberts is in this film except to show up look menacing and kill the only personAaron that can help Rob and Greg. The movie has some far out stuff but other than that it is worth the 1.00. In Conclusion Greg saves Rob they get out and finally find a car to take them to safety. The car is driven by Aaron and both of them think he is O.K. WRONG. The ending could have been better but this was a cool movie for a B horror film. I would recommend it for anyone who likes great old school horror flicks. This is one of todays horror flicks that has plot and plenty of thrills.THX Kris L. CocKayne".

The movie is about to College students GregTravis Van Winkle and RobJohn Bregar who take part in a pharmaceutical study. A new drug for allergies it needs to be tested and the pharmaceutical company needs it's Guiana pigs. The roommates want to take a trip to Amsterdam for Spring Break so they sign up regardless. I would too for 3000 dollars who wouldn't. The drug is RXZ19 and the viewer will find that out later in the film when they are at the clinic facility. Once they are there they are searched for alcohol cell phones and any personal devices. The personal items are are stored until the trial is over. They meet others there Nigel who is a trial freak other students one excon and an older lady are there. The trials begin with blood tests Aaron who is a Phlebotomist comes around to Rob to get blood. Aaron gets the crap scared out of him when he is just doing his job. The trials begin with blood work drug stages and observations. Dr. Wilcox Tricia Helfer is a Dr that is going to push the envelop with this study. The study is usually in 5 doses but she is going the distance to do more than 5 doses. If you know anything about drug trials half the group gets the drug  and the other half placebo.

	schema:reviewBody "Dragon Rapide was an ordinary small private De Havilland DH89 aircraft that played an important role in the outbreak of the 2nd Spanish Civil War in July 1936. It was chartered in London by the part of the military conspirators who were about to rise in rebellion against the legitimate Republican government communist de facto since the advent of the Popular Front with the mission to fly discreetly to the Canary Islands to take General Franco from here to Spanish North Africa Morocco nowadays to meet the bulk of the rebel faction of the army he'll eventually lead through three dramatic years of civil war until the rendition of the capital Madrid.The movie opens showing the weeks prior to the military uprising and how the conspirators react and complete their plans. Some of the highest ranked generals Franco Mola Goded Fanjul are of course men who were conservative religious and raised in the traditional values. They as about half of the Spanish population and Military are growing increasingly worried about the reign of terror that is becoming Spain under the atrocities made by the armed and uncontrolled communist militias and the lack of interest and authority of the Republican government to stop them. Finally the generals make the decision to go ahead with the uprising and to protect the Nation... even against the legitimate Government.If you are not Spanish just consider this In your standard Civil War there is a geographical factor North against South East vs West and so on but in the case of Spain it was mostly a political and moral gap that made the difference It was lefts vs rights and that implied religion versus laicismatheism... so in many many cases the civil war divided tragically families cities and neighborhoods fathers against sons brothers vs. sisters.The Spanish politic and social factors involved in the Civil War and its causes and consequences are much too complex to be fully analized in the film or in this humble synopsis. Even today the wounds of the Civil War 193639 and the subsequent 36 years of military governmentdictatorship under Franco 19391975 are so fresh in every individual in every family on both sides. It is still a hot and conflictive subject where little objectivity is achieved There is no political center on Spain just Lefts and Rights. I was born 34 years ago just when Franco died and even many people of my generation have grandfathers and elder relatives who fought andor died andor were imprisoned in both sides so opinions use to be so HOT.Due to the complex background of the Civil War some very important factors on it are not shown at all and others are shown or explained only slightly but that's not the intention of this movie  it's not a documentary after all. In general terms I must say it is a quite impartial fair version of both sides' points of view  just a little bit lefty but definitely far more impartial than the bulk of movies made about Spanish Civil War in Spain and abroad. It is the only film that I can recall that reflects the very important fact that Franco was not the only highranking General that was involved and he had roughly about half of the military and the people with him The depictions of Generals Franco and Mola are well portrayed and their motivations are seen and explained with a fair objectivity. In the average lefty Spanish movie all the National side from Franco to the last soldier are just insane nazi bad guys with the only interest of killing and causing terror withour reason  just like Freddy Krueger or Leatherface. That's totally unfair and that's ABSOLUTELY not historically true and that's not funny or interesting neither. Right or wrong they were exceptionally prepared generals and intelligent individuals and their decisions were so complex and painful  to go to war against half of their own country which they swore to protect. All those movies done from political resentment lose that juicy main point from the very beginning considering only one side of the story THEIR side of course.In all the main highlevel political and historical facts are well intertwined with the smaller layer composed by the individual characters and their minor stories helplessly caught in the unstoppable spiral of violence of a divided country that they know will lead to a civil war. The costumes and props also show a good job without excess  the atmosphere created looks like an adequate recreation of the Spanish 1930's. A nice clean wellbalanced movie in general terms in my humble opinion.".

I was born 34 years ago just when Franco died and even many people of my generation have grandfathers and elder relatives who fought andor died andor were imprisoned in both sides so opinions use to be so HOT.Due to the complex background of the Civil War some very important factors on it are not shown at all and others are shown or explained only slightly but that's not the intention of this movie  it's not a documentary after all. In general terms I must say it is a quite impartial fair version of both sides' points of view  just a little bit lefty but definitely far more impartial than the bulk of movies made about Spanish Civil War in Spain and abroad. It is the only film that I can recall that reflects the very important fact that Franco was not the only highranking General that was involved and he had roughly about half of the military and the people with him The depictions of Generals Franco and Mola are well portrayed and their motivations are seen and explained with a fair objectivity. In the average lefty Spanish movie all the National side from Franco to the last soldier are just insane nazi bad guys with the only interest of killing and causing terror withour reason  just like Freddy Krueger or Leatherface. That's totally unfair and that's ABSOLUTELY not historically true and that's not funny or interesting neither. Right or wrong they were exceptionally prepared generals and intelligent individuals and their decisions were so complex and painful  to go to war against half of their own country which they swore to protect. All those movies done from political resentment lose that juicy main point from the very beginning considering only one side of the story THEIR side of course.In all the main highlevel political and historical facts are well intertwined with the smaller layer composed by the individual characters and their minor stories helplessly caught in the unstoppable spiral of violence of a divided country that they know will lead to a civil war. The costumes and props also show a good job without excess  the atmosphere created looks like an adequate recreation of the Spanish 1930's. A nice clean wellbalanced movie in general terms in my humble opinion.";

Not colorful or exciting. There's only about 10 minutes of what I'd call fun in the whole 2hour package.That doesn't make Where the Wild Things Are a bad movie.

Was that supposed to be funny? Is she being sarcastic or serious? Is Max in real danger now or not? That's not because the movie is actually confusing but because it all seems vaguely wrong and inappropriate. I left scratching my head saying I guess that was good? In the end I decided I didn't like it. I felt that this was either the wrong script for this movie or the wrong movie for this script. Either way it didn't click for me and felt awkward to the end.Nevertheless there is quality here and I recommend you watch it yourself and reach your own conclusion.".

One who greatly admires filmmakers will wait especially for a filmmaker who takes his time in creating something after years of speculation. Now the filmmaker who first came on the scene with Being John Malkovich once again gives me a oneword response with this third film of his Wow. Hot damn. That's two more. This is simply a classic work of filmmaking but also on a particular subject that so few filmmakers even attempt to make let alone get right which is what it's like to really be a child. Films that come to mind like this could also include the 400 Blows Fanny and Alexander arguably Tideland and E.T. Now here's another and one that is directed with an original eye and an inspiration of texture and feeling a look like out of our own wanted childhood playgrounds. Or some kind of playground.If you don't know the story by Sendak and to be fair it's only several pages long and its story was loosely used for this film is about Max who not entirely pleased with his life in the real world ventures into the world of the 'Wild Things' a place where he can be king or rather makes himself one and tries to create a paradise with his fellow creatures. This is the main bit of what the story is about but how it's about it is a whole other matter. It's a movie children can see and hopefully adore but it's more than that. What it's going for is childhood itself what makes up a young guy who has little experience in the real world and can only really see things through imagination and in a prism of what the 'real world' represents.We see Max in class for example learning about how the sun works in relation to Earth. It's a truthful but pessimistic lecture considering to elementary school kids no less about how one day the sun will die and so will all life. This is carried with Max when he ventures into the world of the Wild Things and when he mentions this to Carol there's a perplexed response to this. It's so small Carol says of the Sun and while it doesn't bother him at the moment it later comes back as a bit of real inner turmoil that Carol can barely contemplate. Or anyone else for that matter. Can one really be expected as a child to understand the full scope of the sun dying out and life as everyone knows it ending? It may be billions of years away but to a little boy it could be just around the corner.That by the way is one of the brilliant things about the movie  all of Max's collected experience and who he is as a person and what he can see and understand around him in his family and surroundings is represented in the bunch of Wild Things. All of Max indeed is split among all of them Carol KW Douglas Ira Alexander and a particular 'quiet' Wild Thing that barely says a word they're all Max and yet because of their split pieces they're never fully whole either. This makes it easy perhaps for Max to be crowned as their king hey he did lead vikings after all! and to lead Carol's dream of a fortress for them all where everything you would want to happen would happen. There's magical moments experienced among them and all of the Wild Things thanks to the Jim Henson creature shop work are all in front of us and live and breathe as real things in this set of 'wild' locations woods desert beach rocky coast. As soon as you can open up yourself to these being real beings not just animatronics the whole emotional core of the film opens up as well.But oh it's also such an unusually beautifully realized film. From its vivid and inthemoment use of handheld cinematography and sometimes the stillness of looking at the creatures and Max in the backdrops to the songs from Karen O. that are always supportive of the scenes never the obtrusive kinds in other kids movies to the complex relationships between all of the characters that one can see reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz it's a piece of popart that lets the viewer in. Its welcoming refreshing and kind of staggering to see someone who knows the way children think and how we don't have to be a mixedup little boy to identify and see ourselves in Max and also how we can't fully identify with things as a child like divorce re Carol and KW's 'friendship'. Where the Wild Things Are works as spectacle and comedy and as the best Jim Henson movie the man never made so it works for children. But for adults because it's really about us it can work wonders for us too.Let the wild rumpus start!".

	schema:headline " A bit misleading.";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw that Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers were adapting Where the Wild Things Are into a featurelength film one question kept coming up how do you turn a nine sentence children's book into a movie? Unfortunately after seeing it the question remains. My initial reaction was that I felt dazed. Part of this reaction was derived from the awe of seeing topnotch jawdropping CGI and puppetry bring the illustrations from Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book to life. Another part was the appreciation of the fabulous voice acting of James Gandolfini Forest Whitaker Catherine O'Hara Paul Dano Lauren Ambrose and Michael Berry Jr. which added depth and names to monsters that never spoke in Sendak's book. However the overriding reason for feeling dazed is that the viewer is unfortunately beaten over the head with heavyhanded metaphors for the duration of Max's Max Records time on the island.It takes the viewer little time to figure out the role each monster plays in Max's psyche. Carol Gandolfini is mostly Max and represents his wildlyswinging emotions switching from happiness to destructive anger to crushing depression with little warning while Douglas Cooper is Carol's safety blanket and represents the same for Max a friend who is nearly always obedient and agreeable. In Max's real life we never see this person so perhaps Douglas is an imaginary friend in Max's waking hours. At least we can only hope he's imaginary after seeing how Carol treats Douglas. K.W. Ambrose is Max's sister Claire not only emotionallyboth characters keep leaving the family to hang out with cooler friends breeding jealousy in Carol as Claire does to Maxbut also physically as both the puppet and actress Pepita Emmerichs have shaggy brown hair a slow smile and that alltoodetached teenage voice. Alexander Dano is Max's fear and insecurity. Physically Alexander is smaller than the rest of the monsters which is a nice detail for a character that always feels ignored and attentionstarved.While the main conflict lies between Carol and K.W. the two most telling monsters are Judith O'Hara and Ira Whitaker. These represent Max's parents. When Max stormed out of his house to begin his adventure it was rage towards his mother that served as the catalyst which even manifested itself in Max biting her shoulder. It's no wonder then that Judith displays all the things Max dislikes about his mother she is the one that doubts him questions his motives and generally ruins his good times. If Max had stormed off into the woods after the opening sequence involving Claire's friends destroying his igloo it would have been K.W. that played this role while Judith would have been the reassuring yet distant character.Ira is most definitely Max's father who is never shown in the film but doesn't have to be. Max obviously longs for him and shows nothing but jealousy and anger towards his mother's new boyfriend. The most obvious clue is that Judith and Ira are the only couple on the island. Ira is a pleasant lovable character which is how Max would idealize his father if he was mad at his mother. Furthermore Ira is the monster that Max goes out of his way complimenta bit of a rolereversal from fathertoson now kingtosubjectand Ira is the only monster that Max hugs when he departs. It's an interesting concept turning a children's book into Freud 101 but is seems dark and oppressive. I realize Sendak's book was visually dark but emotionally is was vibrant and happy much like the melody to Wake Up by Arcade Fire that was used in the trailer. Unfortunately this film desperately fails to be vibrant and happy and for a movie based on a children's book that many parents will take their children to see it's a major flaw.".

Unfortunately after seeing it the question remains. My initial reaction was that I felt dazed. Part of this reaction was derived from the awe of seeing topnotch jawdropping CGI and puppetry bring the illustrations from Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book to life. Another part was the appreciation of the fabulous voice acting of James Gandolfini Forest Whitaker Catherine O'Hara Paul Dano Lauren Ambrose and Michael Berry Jr. which added depth and names to monsters that never spoke in Sendak's book.

It is such an odd movie! And yet when it was over we turned to each other smiling a melancholy smile and said I loved it. The expansion of the tiny story into a featurelength film is so subtle that you barely sense it happening. There isn't an artificial new plot laid over the bones of the original  it's simply expanded at every turn and very gently stretched out to feature length. The voice performances are wonderful and the costumes are magnificent as is the one major visual addition to the material which I won't give away. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night we went to see Spike Jonez's film adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak. I can't say that the film was bad. Considering that everyone in our party who ranged in age from 7 to 42 had an incredibly strong reaction to it I have to admit that it probably is quite good. It doesn't mean however that any of us liked it. None of us did.As a child I found the book a little creepy and maybe even sad but the last images those of Max returning to his own room on the very night that he had left it and finding his supper left for him still warm redeemed some of the angst of the book. Those last few lines left this little reader feeling relieved and hopeful that tomorrow would be a better day for young Max. The film offered no such relief from the considerable gloom and sadness it inflicted.In fact Jonez's adaptation was overwhelmingly sad from beginning to end. Worse there was a weighty hopelessness to it all. Jonez's characters whether human or monster were so wholly deficient that they appear forever locked in a cycle of longing for love understanding and acceptance without any apparent means to make it happen. Not one of them presented the strength in character to make those slight alterations of growth and understanding that would break the barrier and connect with the very creature standing next to him who although desirous of the exact same thing is somehow rendered unreachable.The effect was so powerful that even the chatty joyful eight year old girl in our group left the theater legitimately depressed an emotion that is completely new to her. If the director's intention was to leave his audience with this level of hopelessness then the film is brilliant. I myself will not be purchasing the DVD.".

	schema:headline " Bold but beautiful risk for a children's book adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Spike Jonze's imagining of Where the Wild Things Are is nothing like  you'd expect from a film adapted from a beloved children's book. It's  dense with topnotch visuals from the cinematography to the incredible  fusion of costumes puppetry and CGI used to bring the Wild Things to  life but its plot is very frank in its approach to anger sadness and  loneliness.   It should be noted that this is not so much a children's film as it is  a film that children are capable of enjoying. I refuse to insist that  this is not for children but it would be untruthful to say that this  is a film intended for them. Wild Things is likely going to be  appreciated most by those who already have experienced what the main  character Max is going through emotionally with regards to his family  and his peers the wild things. To put a number on it I think that   depending on the child  kids ages nine or older will not only be able  to enjoy it but take something away from it. As for adults it should  be a touching and somewhat nostalgic filmgoing experience.  Jonze pretty much perfectly captures the essence of childhood within  the first 20 minutes of this film. Whether it's the way Max Max  Records who is excellent looks up at his mom Catherine Keener from  underneath her desk or his imagination taking over as he sails a toy  boat over the curves of his covers Jonze creates moments that  reconnect us to childhood in simply poetic fashion. Immediately we're  ready for Max's adventure to begin because he helps us so easily recall  that childlike state of mind.  After a bad dispute that ends with Max biting his mom he runs away and  discovers the island where the wild things are. If you've seen the  trailer nothing more needs to be said about Jonze's incredible choice  to go with puppets and blend in CGI elements to give it a breath of  realism. As for the characters themselves Jonze and longtime cowriter  Dave Eggers take an interesting approach.   The wild things are voiced by adult actors and give them a sense humor  appealing to adults but give them the social functionality of  eightyearolds. It ends up creating this schism between what we expect  will happen they're going to behave either like children or adults it  can't be both and what does they carry themselves like adults but  they interact like children. The results of this concept fall  somewhere between hysterically genius and bizarrerandom. On one hand  their childlike behavior makes for some elegant teaching points for  Max and on the other you have one wild thing knocking two gulls out of  the sky and then telling Max their names are Bob and Terry. It's  simultaneously goofyimmature and completely fantastic.  One of the challenges of the film had to be expanding the story to  adapt instead of condensing like most adaptations require. Jonze and  Eggers use this as a chance to establish the real world issues Max is  dealing with how to handle his need for parental attention and his  anger and manifest them in this imaginary way in the world of the wild  things. The scenes with the wild things are very physical which will  help to keep children's attention. They have a dirt clod fight and go  running through the forest before falling into a pile we all know what  that was like as children.  Some parents who are very sensitive to what their kids see might have  trouble being okay with some of the anger and other extreme emotions.  If there's one good way to put it it's that the emotional transitions  can be abrupt. One minute is playful and fun the next can instantly  become lonely or sad and then immediately one of anger mild violence  follows. Some might wonder why this wasn't catered more directly to  kids but if you stop and think don't instant emotional mood swings  sounds like a pretty spoton portrayal of childhood?  Jonze telling of Wild Things is a mature albeit truthful one. This is  not pure syrupy children's entertainment. A child should come out of  this movie knowing disputes between family members happen but that it  doesn't change how much we love each other  that it's okay to get  angry sometimes but we should try and understand everyone's feelings  so that next time nobody will do anything they regret. That's daring  storytelling considering the expectation was for something lighter.  Absolute kudos to Jonze and Warner Brothers for letting this unique  film happen. You don't see movies about childhood as beautiful as this  one more than once a blue moon which is plenty cause for a wild  rumpus. Steven C".

	schema:headline " Gritty Weighty and All the Same Childlike...Pure Sendak!";
	schema:reviewBody "Maurice Sendak who recently passed away was one of the most controversial yet still imaginative authors to ever have been published. The stories he wrote are very much like Grimm's Fairy Tales whimsical and fun but still dark and threatening. He didn't pander or sugarcoat his stories simply because he didn't feel a need as well as a rather unpleasant childhood that introduced him to mortality in a less gentle light than most kids but that's another story. These come through in such books as 1981's Outside Over There 1970's In the Night Kitchen and in the case of this review 1963's Where the Wild Things Are.The funny thing about the latter is that this book is only 9 sentences long! That's a short book even by children's standards despite the story being told more with pictures than words. So naturally director Spike Jonze and writer Dave Eggers had to go out on a limb with the extra effort if they were to successfully make a movie based on it. The effort is an interesting and impressive venture No embellishment no sugarcoating just a stripped down but still whimsical tale of a child's curiosity and imagination.The story is pretty much the same Max Max Records believably a kid an imaginative but frustrated kid gets into a fight with his stressedout mother Catherine Keener runs away and soon finds himself floating to a strange land wherein dwell creatures that are both terrifying and fascinating at the same time. It's a simple story but as said before they get across a lot with what they have.The performances in this movie are stellar. Max Records plays Max as...well a kid. He doesn't pander to the audience or become cloying and 'pweshuss' at any point in the movie. He's angry bratty imaginative playful greedy attentionseeking kind and all those other things a normal kid is. This doesn't make him a bad person but it does make him humble and endearing when coming across what he sees and experiences with the titular Wild Things. Speaking of which these creatures not only look great but are also something of which has been made abundantly clear by most of the critics but it's still there a representation of Max himself. Take the imposing but enthusiastic Carol James Gandolfini aka Tony Soprano for instance. He's Max's pentup frustration creativity and longing for love. Loudmouth Judith Catherine O'Hara a scene stealer is Max's brazen independence. Gentle Ira Forest Witaker is Max's artistic ideals. Shy Alexander Little Miss Sunshine's Paul Dano is Max's longing to be heard as well as his fragile navet. And the gentle KW Lauren Ambrose is the feeling of maternity that Max has not felt from his own mother in a long long time. Once he discovers these fragments and puts them together he realizes that there is more love to be had at home than he realized. The visuals in this movie are also great. The place where the island is doesn't have any magical places aside from the Wild Things themselves but its full of trees dirt and desert plains that are barren and empty. But it's what they do with it that makes it impressive. They have huts made of branches a dirt clod fight long walks along the desert and even the building of a huge hut. It's so massive just like an imagination.The only problem with this movie is that it can gets pretty depressing at times. It's probably supposed to be pushing boundaries as the original book did but the conversations dialogue and themes can become quite weighty and brings the movie to a grinding halt. This is especially true towards the end when Carol becomes more and more savage and tensions rise between Max and the Wild Things. But that being said it does give the movie some conflict and raises the stakes for Max's safe return home despite his strong bond with these creatures.Overall this movie is like the book a portrait of childhood at its core. There's no talking down to the audience but at the same time it's more for nostalgic adults than kids. But the adults that enjoyed the book will enjoy what Jones Egger Sendak and this movie have to say. It also looks beautiful with fantastic sets creatures and characters to ogle at. There's so much love and detail put into this movie that all that can be said is...well...I'd eat this movie up I love it so...even though Roger Ebert beat me to that it's still true.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a vision of eightyearolds leaving the movie in bewilderment. Why are the creatures so unhappy?  David Denby from the New YorkerI'll start by admitting that I had very high expectations for Where the Wild Things Are. Though I loved the book as a child I never developed a particular attachment to it. Rather I was impressed with the audacity of the concept of adapting such a short story into a feature length film though including a version of Arcade Fire's brilliant Wake Up in the preview certainly didn't hurt. I had a mixed reaction to the movie  in terms of quality I found it to be the utterly lopsided. The first half it all the right notes eloquently capturing a child's perspective and achieving a perfect balance between the wonder of the creatures and the setting and the underlying layer of sadness. For an hour Where the Wild Things Are is a masterpiece. The second half unfortunately scraps everything but the sadness. The creatures cease to be interesting. The charm and humor disappear. I understand that Spike Jonze is trying to say something deep and meaningful about leaving childhood understanding the limits of imagination and learning the difficulty of pleasing other people but the point is as subtle as a charging rhino. I haven't seen this much moping since Hayden Christianson in Attack of the Clones. It's like halfway through the production Spike Jonze left to be replaced by Thom Yorke.The best part of the film is the first fifteen seconds. We see Max Max Records in his wolfpajama costume chasing a dog around the house and the movie pauses on a blurred closeup on his face. It's a delightful moment. Let me say something about Max Records. He's absolutely amazing in this film. He crawls runs and speaks the way a child would. Watch him wield his staff as king or listen to how he explains his unlimited powers. Even when the rest of the film doesn't work Max Records is always in top form. Jonze's chief accomplishment is in capturing Max's point of view. As he crawls around an 'igloo' he build at the start of the story the camera is close enough to make us feel like we're inside of it too.The introduction of the 'wild things' works just as well. The creatures are magnificent creations. They are CGIenhanced giant puppets but never for a second do we question their physical existence. They are alternately amusing sympathetic and scary. Max proclaims himself a king dons a crown and the fun begins. There's a delightful sequence where the wild things jump all over the place eventually landing in a huge pile in perhaps the most magnificent effect in the movie which is significant praise as every special effect looks great.The setting is impressive. The cliffs and trees of the island dwarf Max. The island fades into a desert where an old English sheepdog wanders for no apparent reason. It's a great effect. The fort that Max has the wild things build is awing and creative as is the miniature city constructed by wild thing Ira voiced by James Gandolfini.Jonze imbues these early scenes with some significant dramatic elements as well. Max throws an tantrum early in the film and it feels appropriate. Curiously the wild things start off with problems of their own. They're an unhappy bickering bunch who've apparently eaten all of their past kings.Max decides to organize a 'good guys' v 'bad guys' fight an obviously awful idea that once again feels appropriately in character but it's here that the film starts to fall apart. The fight though fun and visually spectacular goes out of hand. Many of the wild things become angry or hurt. Fine. It's just that the wild things whine incessantly. Everyone's mad off all the time. Ira destroys his own model city. Max fears for his life. One wild thing's arm gets ripped off. I'm serious about that. The sadness is so overthetop that it approaches parody. It gets tiring. The most egregious scene occurs when the wild things ask Max to prove his powers and act disenchanted when he cannot. The problem is that whole sequence is beside the point. The wild things aren't supposed to be rational beings who question that sort of thing. The effect is devastating to Max and the viewer. When he leaves his motivation seems to stem less from homesickness or character development than from simply wanting to get away from these angry monsters. We get the impression that everyone has had a rather miserable time. We sure have.Maurice Sendak has praised Spike Jonze's film for keeping the essence of the material and expanding upon it. I disagree. I think the first half did that but that the second half was overfilled with boring character conflict. Two things were continuously phenomenal Max Records' performance and the special effects. Once again I understand the point of the darkness. Where the Wild Things Are is meant to be a multilayered bittersweet story. Jonze was on the right track for a while but the essence of childhood captured so well early was replaced with waves of depression. Childhood can be sad. Jonze knows this and relates that fact well with Max's early tantrum. Pleasing everyone is difficult. Max learns that. Again and again and again and again and again. The simple fact is that this film's wild things have serious emotional issues far in excess of what the story requires.".

	schema:headline " Pure nonsense and the main character is neurotic.";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember reading the book that was the basis for this movie when I was a child. It looked like a fun book for a kid when I looked at the cover illustration but when I read it it came across as silly nonsense that I soon found boring. Now warranted most kids books of that nature are written for the under 10 set and usually full of funny goofy stuff but to me the book was not full of the fun kind of imagination or silliness rather a weird dull boring daydream  especially the child wearing the ridiculous wolf costume  where it came from and why he had it is not explained in the book. Now on to the review of the film.I caught this movie when I was in a club this past weekend that shows movies in the back area usually the newest DVD releases. It was free so I figured why not watch. The movie is one big long mess. Max is not like he is in the book rather than being portrayed as a mischievous daydreamer he comes across as a neurotic schizophrenic who suffers from ADD and multiple personality disordershe also looks like he's on drugs half the time. In the movie's opening prologue he chases his dog around and grabs it by the neck and jerks it around while growling and wearing the stupid wolf costume whoa now that was disturbing.He looks as if he's going to break the dogs neck. Then a whole story of feeling ignored from his mother and sister which seems to cause his bizarre behavior and drives him to bite his mother and run away  this after standing on the kitchen table and exclaiming to his mother Feed me woman which totally embarrasses the mothers bf. Evidently the boy feels that since he has no father anymoreI can't remember if his parents are divorced or the father died  he feels jealousy and is also to me selfish of his mothers feelings wanting her attention all the time. He even trashes his sisters room  I will sympathize with him there a scene in the film has him in what starts out as a fun snowball fight with some of his sisters male friends however it turns serious when he tries to hide in an igloo and the larger boys jump on it almost crushing him.They watch him cry and walk away barely even caring whether or not he got hurt His sister does not even run over to make sure that he is OK  she simply shrugs in annoyance and rides off in the car with them.I thought that the reworking of the story in this way was unnecessary. It made it seem mean spirited and basically turning it into a neglected child feel sorry for him rather than a typical naughty 10 yo who gets punished for chasing the dog around and basically being a brat. Max is a really scary child in this movie. I don't know why the producer and writers made him a little nutjob. The monsters on the island are nothing more than large Muppet like creations and I soon felt like I was watching an episode of the Muppet show. It plods and drags and you want it to just end already. Most of the dialog is utter nonsense even for a child to say lets build a fort and then a robot and then lets make a TV that shoots rockets that will serve us ice cream. Where did they come up with this crap. I cant imagine any kids over the age of 8 that would find any of it amusing or even interesting. By the time the movie ends and he goes back home  you feel like you just sat out in the woods watching the grass grow for an hr and 40 minutes.I don't understand all these awards and such for it  it seems that a lot of really bad movies come across as creative or inspiring or that its such a wonderful storytelling thing when to me its utter nonsense and stupid. 1 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Will you keep out all the sadness?  Where the Wild Things Are";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is rated PG but I will say that its dark overtones could be a bit much for really young children. Is it to the point where rumors swirled that it might have been completely reshot due to Jonze's vision being too scary for its target audience? I don't think so but buyer be warned anyway. Sendak's book shows a glimpse of temper and anger a child acting out after not getting what he wants soon becoming the king of a band of giant monsters looking for direction much like him. These beasts are the manifestations of our sorrow our frustration and our demons they are the voices living within us kept down by selfcontrol and overcome by happiness and love. However when those emotions are brought to life unchecked the end result can be nothing short of war retribution and malice. It becomes the duty of young Max the creator of this imaginary world to not only discover the love he has waiting back at home but also to defeat the anger that has been bubbling to the surface allowing him to even bite his mother in this cinematic version. We all need some time to let loose and run wildhowling to the moonit is what we do after the burst of energy subsides that counts. Sometimes looking into a mirror is the only chance we have of becoming the people we should and hope to be.Eggers and Jonze add so much depth to the tale creating a world and life for Max Max Records to take for granted. His father is assumingly deceased his mother Catherine Keener is busy supporting the family when not trying her best to cultivate Max's imagination and court a new boyfriend Mark Ruffalo and his sister is at the age where acting cool for her friends trumps any remorse or sibling bond with a lonely and tossed aside brother. As KW Lauren Ambrose says later on in the film It's hard being a family. Everyone is trying their best and working hard to stick together but as Judith Catherine O'Hara ponders Happiness isn't always the best way to become happy. Loneliness is a huge theme here and we all face it even when surrounded by people we live with and cherish. To be able to accept others one must always be able to accept oneself. This becomes the biggest obstacle for Max to overcome right alongside his fantastical equal in Carol James Gandolfini. The two are kindred spirits wanting to stay in the past where they remember happier times throwing tantrums and fits if they don't get their way unknowingly pushing those they want closer further away as a result.It is some weighty stuff to deal with for both children and adults alike a parable that spans all ages with its intrinsic focus on compromise sharing and seeing what is right in front of us for the pure gift it can be. Kudos to the filmmakers for never shying away from the darkness that inhabits each and every one of us when the world begins to crumble characters get angry cause destruction or cower in fright at what may happen next. We all fear the unknown we all get scared when we see someone we love in trouble but sometimes we forget that those by our side fear for us too when it is we who are lost. The true success of this story and film lies in the little things like Alexander Paul Dano really adding some feeling to this ramlike beast and Douglas the always wonderful Chris Cooper knowing the game going on with Max but trying their best to let the others be happy even at the detriment of their own joy. Here are the two unselfish creatures in a land of egos. The other wild things prop up the film as well however in their vocal performances as well as puppetry. If you ever thought that costumed monsters from Jim Henson Studios couldn't make you cry or at least feel something you will know they can before the end credits roll.Where the Wild Things Are needs these fantastical beings to have the emotional range of a human being in order to succeed. It also needs young Max Records to bear a large portion of the weight on his shoulders he is alone on screen with the wild things for about eighty percent of the film. I will admit to being pretty confident on the first point but a bit skeptical on the second after watching the trailer how beautiful is that minimovie with Arcade Fire playing in the background?. However I was completely wrong about Records because his innocence is what keeps this tale pure. His childlike expressions of joy and fright are utterly realistic taking him on a journey inside himself discovering what it is to grow up and accept responsibility for oneself and those around him. As for the wild bunch of half animalshalf humansthey are absolutely brilliant. The art direction is phenomenal and the use of practical effects meshed with CGI mostly in the faces provides a sense of realism that fully computerized beings never could. Heck even that Karen O soundtrack that I was so disappointed in last week became a magical score that breathed life into this classic story. I truly believe this film will become the treasured piece of art that its source material has. It deserves all the praise it gets for its ability to touch each audience member to the core without ever preaching. It will touch you on a level so pure that you won't know what hit you and you'll be remembering it hours afterwards wanting to find that person you love so as to give them a hug to let them know how important they are to you.".

In one part of the movie you can even see someone's fencedoff estate I THOUGHT THIS ISLAND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WILD!!! This movie sucked... i want an hour and a half of my life back.";

Most viewers will not grasp it and those few who do will probably not have need of it. If you dare watch this cinematic abominationwhich lifesucking action I would never recommendplease understand that you will be subjected to displays of emotional instability the likes of which have not been witnessed since Anakin Skywalker graced the screen. At least Anakin had a cool lightsaber to vent his frustrations besides using a fork and his teeth our dear friend Max can do nothing but track snow into the house defiantly stand on the kitchen counter and conjure up a pile of dysfunctional overgrown tater tots and a goat to help him explore every ugly facet of his consciousness.You should also be prepared for some ambiguity I believed for an overlong period that Max's older sister was actually some acrossthestreet neighbor that Max had a crush on so imagine my surprise when Max's mother suddenly asked the girl to clear her things off the table for dinner! Another confusing bit is the fact that the main tater totcreature is named Carol even though he is male and this character is first seen when he is destroying houses for a reason which will remain unclear unless you can decipher his shouts amidst all the bangs booms and gnashing of teeth.The movie has an air of being steeped in symbolism or in child psychology but really all that comes across is alarming juvenile psychopathy with a shallow incomplete and onesided resolution.Several inconsistencies appear in the film the most upsetting of which has to do with physical injury. When one character is sharply struck with a dirt clod his resulting wound and suffering are clearly evident yet when another character loses his arm in a scene which is not graphic but still gruesome the filmmakers conveniently gloss over any expected pain and replace it with a cheesy joke.

	schema:reviewBody "Where the Wild Things Are one of the most beloved children's books comes to the big screen in one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Spike Jonze the man responsible for Being John Malcovich Adaptation and several Beastie Boys music videos including Sabotage brings the tale to life. I must admit I have been anxiously awaiting this film for several months something I don't like to do too often as it sets up for a potential major let down.Well that didn't happen this time.We follow Max Max Records a boy who is lonely and misunderstood. His sister doesn't pay attention to him his mother is busy with work and her boyfriend and he has worries at school. All he wants is attention and to belong. One night he finally breaks and runs away. He makes his way to the woods and to the waters edge. There he finds a small boat and set out on the open sea leaving everything behind him.He comes across an island and goes ashore. There he finds a group of monsters in turmoil. Max seizes his opportunity and confronts the group. He tells them that he is a great king and help them solve their problems.I don't want to give too much of the story away because I feel like telling it would ruin some of the magic. This is one of the most visually pleasing films I have seen in a long time. Jonze filmed in Australia. We are given vivid landscapes of lush forests arid deserts and beautiful shorelines culminating in an almost Lord of the Rings like experience. These spectacular settings would rarely be beaten in magnificence in another film but here they come second to the unbelievable special effects used for the monsters.There are seven monsters on the island. Carol Ira Judith KW Douglas Alexander and The Bull. They all have unique features and are of massive size. Jonze could have gone two ways here. He could have completely made them all CG or he could have gone Jim Henson and turned them into Muppets. Instead he carved a third path and combined the other two options. Max is able to interact extremely well with the gigantic puppetsuits but the faces are edited with computer graphics giving them startlingly realistic features and expressions. Making these monsters any different way would have been disastrous.Another key aspect of the monsters is giving them a voice. Jonze chose excellent voice actors with James Gandolfini Forrest Whitaker Catherine O'Hara Lauren Ambrose Paul Dano and Chris Cooper. They each have their own personality that compliments their physical and emotional characteristics.Aside from the monsters I was very impressed with Max. He is asked to do a very demanding thing be a kid. That sounds easy but it is very easily messed up. I'm interested in finding out how much freedom Jonze gave Records in certain scenes that called for him to go wild. I can imagine directing young actors is not the easiest thing to do but sometimes you catch a break when you get a talented one.Giving life to these characters is a spectacular screenplay by Jonze and Dave Eggers who wrote Away We Go. Their writing speaks to both kids and adults using language that is meaningful and easy to understand. The things Max goes through every child feels growing up loneliness fear belonging etc.There is so much to love about this movie. It speaks to the heart. But before you head out with the whole family heed this warning. Some parts of this film might be too intense for younger audience members. Certain scene involving the monsters might be a bit too overwhelming. Yes these monsters are friendly but they are monsters meaning they are large intimidating and somewhat scary.Where the Wild Things Are will satisfy entertain and open your eyes. Spike Jonze poured everything he had into this film and the wait was well worth it. I hope you will fall under its spell just as I did.".

Without a doubt it was the worst movie I have ever seen.The kid Max had something friggin wrong with his head. He was insane! He would go from happy to crying to yelling to breaking things to bored to PLAYING WITH HIS MOM'S FOOT wtf and he always had a weird look on his face. And his mom was too busy with work and bringing her friend over to notice her son was a mental case. Max is destructive and bratty and needed some serious mental help. Everything about him was so depressing.As soon as he enters his little monster world the story jumps all over the place and a bunch of random semiviolent unfollowable things happen. I thought if I watched it all the way through it would end happy and it would start making sense but it didn't! It was just awful. If you want to take your kids to see a happy movie don't choose this one. It was boring depressing and made no sense.The directors of this garbagedump need a slap in the head for destroying such a wonderful children's book.".

He would go from happy to crying to yelling to breaking things to bored to PLAYING WITH HIS MOM'S FOOT wtf and he always had a weird look on his face. And his mom was too busy with work and bringing her friend over to notice her son was a mental case. Max is destructive and bratty and needed some serious mental help. Everything about him was so depressing.As soon as he enters his little monster world the story jumps all over the place and a bunch of random semiviolent unfollowable things happen. I thought if I watched it all the way through it would end happy and it would start making sense but it didn't! It was just awful. If you want to take your kids to see a happy movie don't choose this one. It was boring depressing and made no sense.The directors of this garbagedump need a slap in the head for destroying such a wonderful children's book.";

Many people learn to cope with life's troubles in their own way and Max does so by becoming a wild thing.The movie adds some unique elements to the original Maurice Sendak storybook.

Energetic tracks filled with wild instrumentation and playground yells lend credence to the playful scenes in the movie and Karen O's soft vocals fit in perfectly with the sentimental points.Book purists won't be pleased to learn the extent of added material of course but may find comfort in the heavy involvement of the original author in the making of this film. Spike Jonze was specifically given the permission of the author who had previously seen and highly regarded his work.

There are more shakycam running scenes in the film than an episode of 24 which could have easily become redundant and intolerable had it not been for the expressive and enthralling soundtrack. Fortunately the movie manages to work as presented and members of the audience may be inspired to search out the wild things within themselves once more.The easily queasy should be warned much of this movie is shot by handheld camera leading to what has become known as the shakycam effect.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie lacked the humor life playfulness imagination and other human emotions. Max should have been betrayed as a regular brat boy at the age of 7 or 8. I always liked wolves and thought that a boy would like them too. If you like symbolism he could a lone wolf. The book also uses words in a playful manner. For example Max tells his mother in a playful but mischievous way I'll eat you up. In the book the mother and son seemed to have a great relationship but Max was just acting like any kid would. When disciplined he imagines going to the wild things which he treats just like his mother treated him. His parents didn't have any dramas in their lives as this movie portrayed but he was reacting as any kid would when they are not getting their own way. Kids also tend to copy their parents' behavior which was done nicely in the book but not in the movie. Max's stomach started to growl which made him want to go back home. Also in the book he felt lonely and knew his mother loved him which made him leave the wild things. The movie didn't show this at all. Becoming a king was also meaningful because all kids dream about being a king queen prince or princess. The wild things were supposed to be his friends and part of Max's mind for they also said we love you so we could just eat you up. This is also what adults say when they think a kid is cute and Max probably heard that from adults. I would have rather seen a scene with that in the human world than the other added crap they included in this movie. The monsters bored me and were completely lifeless. Basically Max was unbelievable and crazy which made the wild things unbelievable and crazy too. The characters that were added were not necessary. The director should have spent the time expanding on the ideas included in the book instead of adding unnecessary and confusing situations that destroyed the heart of the story and the moral values that made the book a children's classic. I felt bored let down sadhopeless confused and bewildered at the storylineplot. What was the point of it all? How did the story become so complex? The simplicity of the book made it enjoyable for children and adults. The director tried to make a reason for Max's behavior to make the story more interesting but it just made it into a movie that do one could relate to nor enjoy. Come on really? What was the reason for Max's behavior? He was a kid. Just that. His mom? Just a mom. No adult 'dramas.' My suggestion is to just read the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Max is a little boy 10 yr old I think and he is a loner as in he doesn't have any friends and he wants to play games with his sister who's a teenager and doesn't have time for Max. Max builds an igloo and his sister's friends destroy it while fooling around and he is very sad and angry so he wrecks his sister's room as she doesn't do anything about it and goes with them ignoring him. His mom is sweet and she cares for him and loves him very much. When she has her friend over Max behaves recklessly and bites her. She is angry and shouts at him as to what is wrong with him and that's when Max runs away from the home in his wolf costume. He boards a small boat goes to sleep and when he wakes up it is night and he is in a strange magical island where the animals can talk and they behave socially. Through a turn of events he befriends Carol and the storyteller that he is tells tall tales of him being a king and defeating the Vikings so as to avoid being eaten by the animals. The animals need a king and believe he has magical powers and that he could bring happiness to their lives. He has good times and bad times with them but through Carol and K.W's lives he realizes that he needs his mom now more than ever and comes back home to his worried mom.This a wonderful and magical film about friendship and relationships. The director Spike Jonze doesn't tell if the world Max visited is real or whether it was all in his head because frankly the adults will know and the children will be thinking that the island and its inhabitants are real. I liked the way that the film was made. It wasn't completely filled with CGI animals real people dressed up as animals and minimal CGI effects made this film very real to me. Max Records gave a beautiful performance as Max even the voice actors and the animal suit actors gave good performances. It had to be expected as the voice cast consists of James Gandolfini Catherine O' Hara Forest Whitaker and others. Catherine Keener is a very talented actress but is given a limited role here which she does justice to. The music scored by Carter Burwell is amazing and gels so beautifully with the story that you can't but nod your head along the tunes. I became a fan of Carter Burwell from Twilight and he doesn't disappoint with this one. The humming tune of the little kid is still playing in my head  There is a scene where Carol is taking Max to his favourite place and on the desert Max sees a gigantic dog and Carol advises Max to just ignore it and if he fed it it will just follow around that was hilarious. This film brought back memories of my childhood when I ran away from home to go to Aladdin's land to get a wish from the genie and getting scared that I didn't know my way back home when I was hungry and didn't know where I was going with no money. It was a nightmare back then but now its turned into a sweet memory which I had almost forgotten.Moving on this has all the makings of a classic. Try seeing this at least once and you will definitely fall in love with Max and the creatures. But be forewarned this isn't a Disney film there are plenty of dark terrifying moments and little children will definitely be scared by it and some older ones will probably find it boring as this isn't filled with laugh out loud moments or eyepopping CGI effects. As for 20 yr old me this was a good entertaining film which had a lot of heart.910".

But be forewarned this isn't a Disney film there are plenty of dark terrifying moments and little children will definitely be scared by it and some older ones will probably find it boring as this isn't filled with laugh out loud moments or eyepopping CGI effects. As for 20 yr old me this was a good entertaining film which had a lot of heart.910";

	schema:headline " Solid decent good superhero movie about the gretest superhero of all time Superman";
	schema:reviewBody "Man of Steel is really solid decent and good origin story about the greatest superhero of all time Superman. I am a huge fan of Superman I grew up watching Christopher Reeve's Superman. I like this movie more than Superman III or Superman IV The Quest for Peace and Superman Returns. This is my third favorite Superman movie. I was one of the haters of this film but now since I am making a Superman marathon and I am watching every Superman movie I can say I enjoy this movie the second time around. It is better than Superman The Movie? no. But it is a good movie I know it is reboot of Superman I and II and   the second half in the movie is much better than it gets praised. I like the action in this movie it was much better than in Superman II the romance didn't slow down the film. Superman sacrifice his home world Krypton for Earth and I think it was really heroic thing to do. This movie still has problems and flaws in the movie that I didn't like the first half had flaws that is why I can't say it is the best movie or better than Richard Donner's version Superman The Movie but it is an okay movie. Hans Zimmer score I have enjoy it very much I love the music score. The action special effects CGI and the actors in this film I enjoy it very much. Henry Cavill as KalEl Clark Kent Superman did a good job portraying the Man of Steel. I love his performance in the movie he is a good Superman. Amy Adams is fantastic as Lois Lane in my opinion much better than Margot Kidder she did an excellent joy portraying Lois Lane than any other actress did. Michael Shannon was better General Zod than Terence Stamp did in Superman II. I enjoy those three actoractress in the movie so much. The story is not week the romance does not slow down the movie. The action is a badass action in this movie. Superman II took 1 hr and 30 min. until Superman went to action while in this movie we have action right after 1 hrs and it was pure badass action. I like Superman that he turn him self to authorities and to General Zod so that our planet Earth will be safe. I like that in the film. Superman didn't save only one soldier or Lois he saved more people in the film. He sent back Kryptonians in to black hole  The Phantom Zone. I like that the film doesn't copy the first movie again in which Superman Returns did. I did not want to see another disaster movie that we already had in the first movie and Superman Returns copied it. I did not want to see Lex Luthor again scheming the plot for the third time. Man of Steel is a solid decent superhero movie. I like Zod praising JorEl Russell Crowe this time around. I like that the story in the movie is fresh and does not copy the first movie. The fight between General Zod and Superman is excellent pure badass in the film and kicks ass. I enjoy it so damn much. The story is about the codex which Zod is after it. He wants to build Krypton and kill all people on earth and Superman fights for us. He stops Zod on the end by killing him.Pete Ross and Dr. Emil Hamilton are in this movie right from comics in which in other Superman movies they weren't mentioned but only Smalliville Tv Series. Things I didn't like in the movie General Zod stabbing JorEl I did not like that sequence at all. Clark Kent stealing cloths I hated that he shouldn't have done that. I didn't like that Jonathan Kent Kevin Costner said Clark should have let those kids to die. Maybe he shouldn't have said that. Clark insults pa Kent that his not his father and during hurricane he doesn't save his father and Jonathan doesn't let him I don't like that in the film. Lois Lane find out Superman's secret too soon while in Superman The Movie Lois find out the sequel Superman's Identity. Superman twisting necks I don't like that idea either I don't like it.Clark destroys a truck about the trucker who throw him a bear in his face.Directed was by Zack Snyder who also directed Dawn of the Dead 300 and Watchmen. Yes I enjoy Dawn of the Dead and 300 to death. 810 Man of Steel is a good movie solid excellent decent good superhero movie I like it.".

	schema:headline " An Epic Ride!";
	schema:reviewBody "At first I was very nervous at the prospect of another Superman movie. Especially considering how horrible Superman Returns was however Man of Steel was a roller coaster of a ride as we not only witness Kal El's Clark Kent's origins but we are shown Superman the way he is supposed to be.With expert direction brought to us by Zack Snyder and the assistance of Christopher Nolan Man of Steel is packed full of action and emotional depth. No Superman movie has ever come close to achieving the atmosphere illustrated in the comics or the cartoon series until Zack Snyder's Man of Steel. Sure it has a lot of action but anyone who is a true Superman fan knows that Kal El's battles were almost always explosively long. Furthermore the biblical metaphors were absolutely brilliant! As Superman was intended to be portrayed as a Christ Like figure you see his journey in Man of Steel not all that much different from the New Testament. Ex When Clark Kent asked the priest for advice behind him was a stained glass window of Christ praying to His Father before He was arrested and crucified. Next scene Clark Kent willingly submits himself to be arrested ascends into the heavens and than descends in a crucified form As Superman's story is not about becoming the best but an immigrant facing the challenge of home VS heritage we see Zack Snyder's portrayal of Superman reflect the Man of Steel originally designed by Joseph Shuster. Furthermore who could forget such actors like Henry Cavill Clark Kentor Amy Adams Lois Lane. Every actor in this movie left their mark but I needed very little convincing to believe that Cavill was the face of Superman or that Adams could be a persuasive Lois Lane. And although I am not particularly a fan of Michael Shannon he was the perfect General Zod. With the level of ferocity Shannon provided not to mention his one liners this was by far his best role yet!This movie soared through my expectations and it will be the first time I ever give a Superman movie a perfect 10!".

	schema:headline " Who the f cares about the critics?";
	schema:reviewBody "I know what the critics has said. They complained about too much action superman being too serious lack of romance etc. Since Zack Snyder directed this movie I don't think he cared about the critics. Don't get me wrong he DOES care about the fans' opinion. Seems like he really wanted to really satisfy the fans. I see why critics complained about too much action. For me it's just his way to satisfy the viewers. This is the kind of movie that is just really satisfying. When the movie ended I got that 'satisfying' feeling instead of the 'wanting more' feeling. It's like it was really enough. Even Snyder's best movies before this which were 300  Watchmen didn't have more ratings than 64 on Rotten Tomatoes. I think the fans should have anticipated the bad reviews. His style is actually what critics hate. The over the top action and CGI is actually his trademark. So even from the beginning I think this is actually the kind of movie the producers wanted. About the lack of romance I really do think it's saved for the sequel. The sequel will definitely explore more about the relationship between Clark and Lois. This film focused on 2 aspects the origin kryponstruggle finding his place  the action Zod and his army. Don't expect humor or romance.The visuals were spectacular! What's best about this movie is its action scenes. The action were just relentless. I think the fans would not be disappointed at all. Yes I know there is only a very few humor this movie but that actually doesn't even matter. The battle between Superman  Zod will definitely 'wow' everyone but the critics. I mean who cares about the critics opinion? A superhero movie MUST NOT be judged by the critics opinion what's more important is the audience's opinion about the movie and especially the fans'. I think the movie really delivered. Most people will definitely like this movie. I am really sure that many fanboys will consider this as the best comic book of all time. This is a MUST SEE for people who like action movie. The action were better than last year's The Avengers. The sequel really have a great potential. Considering the minimum amount of romance in this movie since they just knew each other and superman was also more focused on Zod the next movie could explore more of that. One of the things missing from the movie was also the presence of Clark Kent at the daily planet. It's one of the trade marks. But I believe the sequel will show more scenes in the Daily Planet which is interesting to see. As a conclusion I think Man of Steel is so far the best action movie this year. This movie really is a Snyder movie. But it also has a quite lot of nolanesque feel to it especially in the around first 45 minutes.If this was compared to Iron man 3 if Iron man 3 was a 7 this movie is a 8.6.".

	schema:headline " One of the stupidest movies ever made.";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is going to be full of spoilers because I am going to mention various gaping plot inconsistencies and outright idiocies in this dog of a film.Sure it looks great and the special effects are generally well done. But some people need their movies to at least make some sense.Let's start with a really basic one the planet Krypton is going to be destroyed and no one can be saved except one baby presumably because they don't have any spacecraft.Oh but wait they do have spacecraft. In fact they have so much spare technology they use it to send criminals into space... so that they will survive and provide enemies for Superman later in the movie.JorEl steals the Codex which apparently contains the DNA of the Kryptonian race. Somehow there are no backup copies. Oh but what about the actual Kryptonians who are running around destroying things... surely they each have their own DNA? Apparently not somehow. And how about that babymaking machine in the scout ship what was it supposed to use if there's only one Codex? Clark just happens to hear about some top secret ice digging and somehow knows to go there. How? And Lois Lane is somehow given a tour of the dig and a free place to stay even though she had to sue to be allowed there at all.Clark discovers the spacecraft and somehow knows how to pilot it and land it somewhere. But then it never gets used again for example to help fight the invaders later on. Doesn't it have the same kind of engine that's needed to destroy them? And it actually can fly rather than needing to be dropped via an airplane as Clark's baby spacecraft is at the end of the film. But somehow no one thinks of this. When Clark is taken to General Zod's ship he loses his powers because he supposedly needs the gasses in earth's atmosphere to gain and retain his powers. Yet he's shown repeatedly operating in the vacuum of space. If he needed Earth's atmosphere to retain his powers he should lose them in space.In numerous fight scenes massive damage is caused to probably inhabited buildings which must have resulted in massive loss of life. Why wouldn't ClarkSuperman immediately lure his enemies far away from the city fight over the ocean in the mountains etc? In one scene he deliberately throws an enemy through a bunch of buildings apparently not caring who gets hurt.At the end when the world engine is working Superman flies into its gravity beam where his powers shouldn't exist because the conditions it's creating are like those of Krypton. But after being unable to do anything he somehow just decides he's going to do it and then instantly destroys the machine. Because if you really really decide then you can do anything. General Zod's ship will be flipped back into the Phantom Zone if its drive field comes in contact with another drive field of the same type as found in Clark's baby spacecraft. But wait don't all their small spacecraft use the same engine? Why don't they cause the same problem?At the end Superman and General Zod have an extended fight and appear to be equally matched but when Zod threatens a prototypical family of Father Mother and Child with his heat vision and which he somehow doesn't manage to hurt although all he'd have to do is move his eyes slightly Superman easily kills him although he was completely unable to damage him until then. Again just deciding to do something makes it happen.These are just some of the really obvious major problems how about some minor but equally stupid ones? Perry White Jenny and Steve are walking away from General Zor's ship when Perry says where's Jenny? Oh she's suddenly stuck under rubble that apparently no one noticed falling and she hasn't bothered to scream or make any sound at all. They struggle to free her when suddenly the beam stops and they say He saved us! even though they didn't know anything about Superman trying to save them nor that the destruction wouldn't resume or in fact anything about what was going on.Martha Kent is violently flung 20 feet or more. But apparently she's completely unhurt even though she's elderly and even a simple fall should have been damaging.When Superman and Zor are fighting they fly a great distance and end up falling through the ceiling of something that looks like Grand Central Station. After a few seconds Lois Lane suddenly appears out of nowhere because she should be in that scene. In a 'heartwarming' scene at the end Jonathan Kent sees young Clark playing with a cape and gets all misty eyed. Wait how did he associate a kid playing with a cape with anything at all? Why would a cape signify something to him? It wouldn't.This is a movie that didn't bother to make any sense and the fact that people accept all the illogic plot holes and dumbness of it really depresses me. Special effects shouldn't be enough to make a movie popular. The story and the logic of the story should count for at least as much and more.".

When Clark is taken to General Zod's ship he loses his powers because he supposedly needs the gasses in earth's atmosphere to gain and retain his powers. Yet he's shown repeatedly operating in the vacuum of space. If he needed Earth's atmosphere to retain his powers he should lose them in space.In numerous fight scenes massive damage is caused to probably inhabited buildings which must have resulted in massive loss of life. Why wouldn't ClarkSuperman immediately lure his enemies far away from the city fight over the ocean in the mountains etc? In one scene he deliberately throws an enemy through a bunch of buildings apparently not caring who gets hurt.At the end when the world engine is working Superman flies into its gravity beam where his powers shouldn't exist because the conditions it's creating are like those of Krypton. But after being unable to do anything he somehow just decides he's going to do it and then instantly destroys the machine. Because if you really really decide then you can do anything. General Zod's ship will be flipped back into the Phantom Zone if its drive field comes in contact with another drive field of the same type as found in Clark's baby spacecraft. But wait don't all their small spacecraft use the same engine? Why don't they cause the same problem?At the end Superman and General Zod have an extended fight and appear to be equally matched but when Zod threatens a prototypical family of Father Mother and Child with his heat vision and which he somehow doesn't manage to hurt although all he'd have to do is move his eyes slightly Superman easily kills him although he was completely unable to damage him until then. Again just deciding to do something makes it happen.These are just some of the really obvious major problems how about some minor but equally stupid ones? Perry White Jenny and Steve are walking away from General Zor's ship when Perry says where's Jenny? Oh she's suddenly stuck under rubble that apparently no one noticed falling and she hasn't bothered to scream or make any sound at all. They struggle to free her when suddenly the beam stops and they say He saved us! even though they didn't know anything about Superman trying to save them nor that the destruction wouldn't resume or in fact anything about what was going on.Martha Kent is violently flung 20 feet or more. But apparently she's completely unhurt even though she's elderly and even a simple fall should have been damaging.When Superman and Zor are fighting they fly a great distance and end up falling through the ceiling of something that looks like Grand Central Station. After a few seconds Lois Lane suddenly appears out of nowhere because she should be in that scene. In a 'heartwarming' scene at the end Jonathan Kent sees young Clark playing with a cape and gets all misty eyed. Wait how did he associate a kid playing with a cape with anything at all? Why would a cape signify something to him? It wouldn't.This is a movie that didn't bother to make any sense and the fact that people accept all the illogic plot holes and dumbness of it really depresses me. Special effects shouldn't be enough to make a movie popular. The story and the logic of the story should count for at least as much and more.";

And with the usual criticsknowabouteverythingnothingisgood tome reviews the chances of be confused about this are increasing. As high as the expectations were raised after trailers i have to tell you that you will not disappointed with this movie. Is different in many ways to the usual superhero movies but is a solid product that fits in what you expect from this kind of film. Nice references to previous movies are well executed and new plot additions are well received too. As you can expect from a Zack Snyder movie there are several scenes that try to resemble graphic novel arts and in my opinion are very well made. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The most of them unfortunately i can't say all of them look very realistic according laws of physics the CGI are so well made that you wish that development for many movies you seen before. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality. About the plot i believe this is the more controversial point of what i see in reviews across the internet. Most moviegoers like it a lot but are critics the ones  not all of them that are giving mixed reviews. What you realize is that critics expect another Dark Knight but this movie is not looking to be a darker one of your beloved Superman. If you are smart enough to understand that this is ANOTHER hero you will be happy with the story. If you are looking for a fourth darker than Batman movie for sure you will agree with critics giving bad reviews. This is a Superman movie and in that scenario this is a very good one.The movie has some flaws to me for sure  i don't know about a perfect movie but i will not comment about that as i believe everyone need to discover by themselves what  if any dislike for their preferences. In summary this is a super hero movie that even Marvel fans will appreciate as is giving a whole new level to a classic story turning the most beloved hero in an actual hero and mixing a great graphic novel specialist with great digital artists to give you a full action packed movie that make a good foundations for sequels.".

For the last 75 years Superman has been a pacifist. He JUST DOESN'T KILL...NO MATTER WHAT.. HE JUST DOESN'T KILL....SPOILER ALERT 1. The movie shows that the blue suit was given to Superman by JorEl. But this hasn't appeared in any version of Superman so far. In fact its Martha Kent who gave the suit to him.2. Clark finds the suit on an abandoned Kryptonian Scout Ship. Now the point to be noted is... the ice around the ship was found to be over 3000 years old... So the ship must have landed there over 3000 years ago... While Clark's age is shown to be only 33 years... Does that mean JorEl sent a ship to Earth 3000 years ago with a suit that he wanted to give as a gift to his son 3000 years later??? 3. Jonathan Kent didn't die in a tornado... he died of a heart attack in all versions of Superman ever published...4. The Genetic data of all kryptonians was never a part of Superman's body cells.. In fact there were only a handful of survivors which escaped in the bottled city of Kandor.5. Clark Kent grows up on Earth and spends 33 years of his life adjusting to his powers... Zod does that in minutes?????? 6. The much awaited Superman's Rippled Shield of the house of El which was much advertised... I didn't see in on Superman's suit... I saw it at the endcredits...7. Superman goes supersonic??? Blasphemy.... He is the guy who can travel faster than the speed of light... and they only manage to make him go supersonic??? 8. Superman never lets innocent civilians get hurt... NEVER... He will give up his own life to protect them... Yet in the entire fight sequence he never tries to take the fight away from Metropolis. Instead he keeps on ramming Zod into buildings and brings down half the city...killing God know how many...9. Helicopter sequence... Superman saves the guy who fell from the Helicopter which has gone out of control... But he lets the pilot and remaining crew perish and crash to the ground.10. Superman coughs up in smoke... as shown in the movie itself... when he was a kid... he saved a bus from drowning... and then saved Pete Ross too... He is able to hold his breath under water... In the oil rig scene... he stays under water when the oil rig explodes... When he takes flight for the first time he goes in the orbit in the outer space... all of that... and amidst a little smoke... he stars coughing like he has contracted Tuberculosis??? 11. Superman collapses and BLEEDS from the mouth when he enters Zod's ship... Dude.. seriously... Kryptonite makes him weak... and he becomes like an ordinary human in presence of a Red Sun like Krypton had... But never does he BLEED...12. And the best one of all of them... Zod is trying to kill a few people with his heat vision... Superman has Zod in a vice and he is holding Zod's head... perfectly capable of directing Zod's heat vision wherever he pleases... or he could have covered up Zod's eyes with his hand... But instead... He chose to break his neck... Wow Superman... way to stand by everything to symbolized for the last 75 years...Believe me when I say this... the movie was good.. but it just wasn't Superman... it was some random guy in a blue suit who flies around killing people.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman KalEl being born and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They show some of his growing up through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3D version and I am not a big fan of 3D.

	onyx:emotionText "I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman KalEl being born and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They show some of his growing up through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3D version and I am not a big fan of 3D. While this movie did not give me a headache like 'The Hobbit' I didn't think the 3D added that much and I would recommend seeing the 2D version! Overall I gave it a 910.

It told the very beginning of Superman and then yeah his adulthood.The special effects here I think it is as awesome as Marvel's Avengers. Yeah alien and superheroes what do you expect? Battle scenes are good I can feel Zack Snyder 300 sensation in here.Henry Cavill succeeded bringing a whole new version of Superman to the big screen.

The story is decently paced and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe. The character Perry White wasn't used to his full potential but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman you might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty up tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous making him less charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future. that makes for an awesome showdown by the way. To summarize I give Man of Steel an 8.6 for it's portrayal of a classic American hero.".

His loving father DurEl rescues his son by sending him to Earth as a last resort to continue the Kryptonian bloodline. KalEl grows up on a farm in Smallville with Super Powers and the name Clark Kent. This is where the similarities between Man of Steel and the Superman series end. Which is why it got a few peoples backs up.When watched with an open mind and seeing it for what it is A whole new movie it's actually very good. The specials are incredible though some times slightly overdone Especially the shaky camera. The acting is top notch and Henry Cavill plays the role excellently.I think it's 7.5 Overall rating on IMDb is where this movie belongs and should be viewed by everybody.MY OLD REVIEW If you can overlook any Superman film or series you've ever seen put aside a million and 1 inconsistencies and watch with an open mind. Then this is the film for you. Superman is not just a man with superpowers but a man with strong morals that means more to him than his own life. Under no circumstances does Superman endanger the lives of civilians. The big battle will have killed thousands and thousands of people and left millions injured or trapped.

I am sick of giving the benefit of the doubt to people who quite clearly are making millions doing something they are unqualified to do tell stories.If you want characters likable or interesting or funny or curious just some  any sense of character this is not the film for you.if you want humour wry wit cheesy gags gentle social commentary daft slapstick this is not the film for you.if you want mystery intrigue wonder this is not the film for you.if you want relationships conflict born from fear and hope blossoming romance unrequited love this is not the film for you.if you want dialogue that stays with you that will be quoted years from now that makes you lean forward as if physically pulled into the story this is not the film for you.If you want mindless violence and a battle scene that lasts for three quarters of the movie then this is the film for you.If you want to know the entire story in the first five minutes this is the film for you.if you want the same story that every superman before this has already told in a thousand rehashed reheated ways.. this is the film for you.In twenty years people will still revisit the original film. No one will revisit this. Its special effects will be outdated in a year  so will any possible appeal.I will repeat this is a truly awful film. And that is not an opinion.";

	schema:headline " Great Superman film and this film is Comic Book Superman post crisis Not Donners Silver Age version";
	schema:reviewBody "All in all i have to say Man of Steel is a great film saw the early screening and believe me this film is up there with TASM and Batman Begins. I expect the film to be divisive for the reasons being this isn't the Donner Continuity. Matter a fact most of the critics of this film kept referencing to the Donner Films every paragraph in their reviews. Let me get this out of the way right now and this is a sad reality to people who are fans of COMIC BOOK Superman. Nobody knows comic book superman a lot of people claim superman was always light hearted that is BS when Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster made superman he was a very serious character and wasn't a boyscout the popular idea of Superman being who he is  which is slowly changing with MOS and post crisis version is Silver Age and that's a fact a lot of fans don't want to admit. Man Of Steel does a amazing job and giving us Modern Superman better then Brandon Routh ever did in all honesty. His Superman was too selfish. Henry Cavill Superman serious demeanor is pure Kingdom Come superman and Golden Age Superman and Bruce Timm superman from the 90s the original vision of the writers superman was supposed to be taken has a serious science fiction character has superman earliest adventure dealt with crime and corporate greed and a lot of his villains dealt with Transdimsional travel like some Bioshock Infinite stuff. Comics Code came along and we have Silver Age campyness. Anyways the special effects and the acting are solid. Superman is a bit to serious but i really don't care there are Superman in comics that are very serious like Kingdom Come Superman and to me Cavill Superman falls under pure Golden Age Superman personality.Russel Crowe was awesome in this film he has more screen time and everyone will agree this is the best Jor El ever in all honesty better then Brando IMO. Micheal Shannon has Zod was the only this that was disappointing but he was still good none the less and still way more threatening then the Mandarin of Iron Man 3 or the Real Mandarin i might add. DC at least showing that there villains are not throw away characters.Amy Adams has Lois Lane is great and i expect there relationship to expand more in the sequel to this film  which will definitely be better since WB wants Star Wars Empire Strikes Back Writer and Lost Ark Indiana Jones film I have a feeling that she is the best Lois Lane and why some people may think its a miscast it is not IMO it isn't.Kevin Cosner and Diana Lane are great in this showing a more realistic depiction or should i say NOT the Silver Age Superman's your destined for great things Pa and Ma Kent like we had but the more Golden Age Version when they were very over protective of Clark has a child.Action in this film rivals the avengers and the spectacle is absolutely incredible MOS fight scenes have Heart the critics are BS a lot cause i didn't see them say anything about Iron Man 3 fights don't you. Man of Steel has raised the bar on action in Superhero films and i expect the action will be toned down for the sequel a bit more cause of the possibility of Lex Luthor has the villain. Man of Steel for me has a Comic Book fan of Superman and love for DC and Marvel characters Man of Steel is a thrilling experience and will entertain Man of Steel will be the Anti Iron Man Fans love it audience love it critics pan it. But for me Man of Steel is a 9.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Man of Steel  I thought it's gonna be like The Amazing Spiderman at first. Same storyline same plot and just a little bit fresh look and technology touch up for a new millennial version of a superhero movie. Watching it for the first hour I was about to give it a solid 45 until it went up to such perfection level of watching satisfaction. The storyline was quite impressive without losing its originality but a better improvement in line. The plotting of the synopsis was done amazingly different than the other versions of Superman we ever saw in the theater. And characteristically it was perfectly put on such great screenplay. I wasn't sure if Henry Cavill was a suitable role player with Amy Adams for the ClarkLoise characters but through out the movie they seemed like doing the best as it should. Clark is a good choice. And I can see there's somewhere in the scenes Tom Welling is never left behind for the heroic role. He resembles him very much. And not to forget there are some extra credit deserved to this movie which somehow balanced the movie to its perfection. I even love the arts of its photography. It was full of drama and actions emotions and everything else needed to be there in a great legendary film should be. Everything was perfectly there from the storyline itself the plotting the casting the cinematography the screenplay the actions and all the effects the plus and minus and the everything. It was perfectly superb! If you're ever wanted for a great movie this is one of your definite option! Almost there full stars!".

	schema:headline " This movie has no soul";
	schema:reviewBody "I was really excited to see this movie considering all the creative and successful names that were attached to it. However I came out of it more frustrated than anything else. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't and here are some reasons why Straight from the beginning I couldn't help but notice that the movie was trying too hard to be similar to recently successful sci fi films rather than trying to find its own style Avatar The Avengers Batman Begins and the Matrix come to mind. Then there were the minor plot holes inconsistencies and lack of believability or followthrough that would have brought that extra touch of realism. But the real downfall of the film was the matteroffact and detached style by which it was presented to the audience. This left the movie emotionally empty and with no one to identify with. As the movie continued it became more of the same going through the motions ok now this happened and now this happened oh and now this is happening to the point where I didn't really care about the movie or characters any more I just wanted the monotony to be over. This is the reason it felt rushed and long at the same time like key elements were underdeveloped and missing. This is a great example of how you can have the most massive amazing grandiose scale special effects and world altering events on screen but without the proper build up and audience investment I didn't really care about the characters and continued to grow bored until I just wanted it to end. The trailers were more suspenseful than the actual movie for crying out loud.I'm not sure whose fault it was the editor the director the script post production but a little more than half way through it started to feel like it was dragging. You can walk out of a really enjoyable film after 3 hours and not realize how much time has gone by. I would not have minded if the movie was 15 minutes longer but had the slightest bit of suspense emotion or character development in it. It felt like it was cut down to its bare bones you cant omit that stuff to make room for more special effects if that is in fact what they were doing. No amount of action can ever replace good story telling. Instead what we got was clichd one liners and characters going through the motions interacting with themselves so to speak instead of playing off each other like in a bad video game. Even great acting from Michael Shannon and Russel Crowe wasn't enough to elevate their characters from appearing as onedimensional cliff notes. It's not being too picky when you want something essential and basic that every movie should have and when many people didn't like the movie for the exact same reasons. I also found the writing to be lazy and without giving too much away certain plot elements could have been used to show that Superman was not just all brawn but brains as well. Plus Lois knows and thats just boring. It seems to be a growing trend in blockbuster movies these days while trying to make the movie more modern technologically up to date and fit for a younger audience story telling takes a back seat to cheap thrills and special effects to get more people into the theater. It's a shame then that this movie feels like an attempt to mash together as many unoriginal blockbuster genres with as much mindless action special effects as humanly possible most likely in an attempt to compete in the 'how big can we make this' superhero franchise. I like special effects and I know its good for business but does the movie making process have to suffer to such an extent as a consequence? Even the Avengers with its multitude of characters was able to pull of an engaging thrill ride compared to this. To those trying to undermine the critics I have a few things to say. I like Snyder's previous films and particularly enjoyed Watchmen so I would have had no problem with a darker of more serious version of Superman except this movie was none of those things. I feel a lot of people who will defend the movie don't have much to say besides 'superman was a badass compared to other movies' and 'it was visually impressive'. They refuse to see the whole picture and realize that a shiny toy is just a shiny toy. The critics didn't rate this movie poorly because it was serious dark or they didn't like Snyder's style it was because the movie didn't have a unique character or any style Snyder is famous for. While that 'satisfied feeling' you had at the end of the movie instead of the 'wanting more' feeling really shows how mundane it really was. A movie of this magnitude should leave you wanting more for a sequel or at least for a second viewing. After watching this movie I had no desire for either of those things. Just because a film has amazing special effects does not automatically make it a good movie. What this movie did was ironically give me a new appreciation for Superman Returns. While Bryan Singer's approach to the character and story was somewhat dated it was a polished work that while it didn't appeal to everybody was executed very well in all aspects especially story telling. The difference is that people didn't like MOS not because it had a unique style but because it wasn't a complete film and the difference shows. An ideal Superman movie in my opinion would combine the best aspects of both films. A modern approach with exciting and relatable character development and story telling that Superman deserves. Just felt like I needed to express my disappointment and frustrations at this squandered potential.".

	schema:headline " Wow what a supermess.";
	schema:reviewBody "The biggest question going into Man of Steel is whether or not Christopher Nolan can bring the same downtoEarth psychology to Superman that he did to Batman. The quick answer not entirely. Yes he and director Zack Snyder have created a wellmounted action picture  they get the fight scenes just right  but in trying to deal with the deep scars of Superman's origins they have put together a movie that sometimes feels choppy and more than a bit hurried.The movie opens beautifully on the Planet Krypton wherein Superman's father JorEl Russell Crowe is dealing with two problems at the same time. First his planet is dying and no one will listen. Second Krypton's military leader General Zod Michael Shannon has organized a coup against the planet's elders and intends to overthrow them. As you already know JorEl's plan is to send his son named KalEl to Earth where he will be safe. Zod who learns of his plan vows revenge. These scenes work well. Krypton looks appropriately apocalyptic and the movie establishes some information unspoiled here about little KalEl that we haven't seen before.Then for the next hour or so the movie becomes a chaotic mess. Scenes of Superman's origins as a child are intercut with scenes of Superman as an adult so that we never have a clear story to sink our teeth into. One minute he's an adult working as a crab fisherman and the next minute he's a little boy saving kids on a school bus. We never get the great homages to Americana. We don't get scenes of Clark's Kansas upbringing where he discovers his powers. Scenes are so hurried that you feel as if you are just watchng highlights rather than completed scenes. The movie is in such a hurry to move things along that we never feel that we're getting to know the man of steel. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner play his Earth parents who dispatch homespun advice but they pop up almost as cameos.The third act of the movie when Superman and Zod square off is where the movie picks up. Zod now a Kryptonian prisoner wants to turn the Earth into a new version of Krypton at the expense of the population already residing there. That idea comes to life mostly due in part to the performance of Michael Shannon. Shannon is one of our best and most intense actors  check him out sometime in the great Take Shelter. Here he brings General Zod down to Earth so to speak. He wants a planet to rule but there's nothing flashy or erudite about his personality. Shannon plays the role pretty close to the bone and that's appropriate.British actor Henry Cavill in the title role has a great screen presence but as you watch him you sense that he will grow into the role if given another chance. He's not given a lot to say.And his relationship with Lois Lane? What relationship? Her role played by Amy Adams is to be a nosy journalist follow her leads and smoke out the identity of Superman but there is nothing resembling a romance here. Except for one chaste kiss they almost seem like just good buddies. There is a suggestion that their love affair is being held over for the sequel but why not deal with it here? Of course the standard for the man of steel lies is Richard Donner's 1978 classic with Christopher Reeve. That film was a beautiful four act play laying out Superman's origins from Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis and to his adventure in California. Some of that energy is here but in trying to give the movie the same tone as Nolan's Batman pictures it's often wobby. It's a good movie at its best moments but in truth it needed some work.".

Here he brings General Zod down to Earth so to speak. He wants a planet to rule but there's nothing flashy or erudite about his personality. Shannon plays the role pretty close to the bone and that's appropriate.British actor Henry Cavill in the title role has a great screen presence but as you watch him you sense that he will grow into the role if given another chance. He's not given a lot to say.And his relationship with Lois Lane? What relationship? Her role played by Amy Adams is to be a nosy journalist follow her leads and smoke out the identity of Superman but there is nothing resembling a romance here. Except for one chaste kiss they almost seem like just good buddies. There is a suggestion that their love affair is being held over for the sequel but why not deal with it here? Of course the standard for the man of steel lies is Richard Donner's 1978 classic with Christopher Reeve. That film was a beautiful four act play laying out Superman's origins from Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis and to his adventure in California. Some of that energy is here but in trying to give the movie the same tone as Nolan's Batman pictures it's often wobby. It's a good movie at its best moments but in truth it needed some work.";

But seriously are we so foolish that we consider such a movie with no decent plot and no clever twists or character development not only good but GREAT.Well its not.The first half is basically introducing kalel and his extraordinary abilities and hiding them from the world. It is slow  uninteresting but however provides decent possibility of a lift up in the second halfNow is when it gets worse.The second half is filled with special effects CGI and nothing more.The last half hour had me yawning and cursing zack snyder.This could have been a masterpiece. It had all the elements but missed the thread that ties it all together. And i do not think that nolan was associated with the project in any creative way. The first half was nothing special and the second half was just blowing stuff and 'aliens' beating each otherbuildings been torn apart and similar BS.Almost all the actors were wasted.Although Kevin Costner was good in the screen time he had. Russel Crowe was completely wasted and so was adams. Henry Cavill didn't have to do much but to make weird sex faces while flying. Nothing special about the others either.I had great expectations from this but they were not met. Rather i left the theater bored cheated and poorer.So i suggest not to waste your money on this.The 3d was nothing special either. Overall this was a huge disappointment.And please don't compare this to Batman Begins. Its not even in the same class.110 and thats because i am a generous fella........and i don't have a choice.".

After the successful politicalsentimental trilogy formed by Asignatura Pendiente1977  Solos En Madrugada1978 and Verdes Praderas1979  director Jose Luis Garci changes genre and shoots this noir film imitating the American style and popular actors as Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum . Here the premise is simple  Areta is assigned by an old gay man to investigate his exlover  it leads him to the dark  underbelly of Madrid  he realizes that he is not only one looking for this old homosexual . In spite of slowness  the picture is pretty well  filled with suspense  thrills  emotion and a complex intrigue . Although it contains a weak pace  slow developing and a difficult storyline dealing with homosexuals  chemical laboratories  false medicines  a dark Mafia and many other things . Here Jose Luis Garci and screenwriter Horacio Valcrcel adapt the American Noir to Democratic Spain with an adequate homage to this classic genre . As Garci pays tribute to it  including some frames from The asphalt jungle1950 with Marilyn Monroe and Louis Calhern . The film is dedicated to Raymond Chandler  while the first part The Crack I was dedicated to Dasiell Hammet . The main aspect results to be its excellent cast and stands out Alfredo Landa giving a fabulous performance  including some breathtaking scenes in the beginning when AretaLanda faces a group of smalltime delinquents . Support cast gives nice interpretations such as Maria Casanova as his sweetheart  Miguel Relln as his helper  Arturo Fernndez as a wealthy mobster  Rafael De Penagos as a veteran  higher class gay  Jos Manuel Cervino as an Inspector Chief  Fernando Bilbao as a corpulent bodyguard and  of course  the great Jos Bdalo . Most of them played in The crack I adding Manuel Tejada  Francisco Vidal  Raul Freire and Maite Blasco. Enjoyable and appropriate settings by Felix Murcia . Sentimental and repeated musical score by Jesus Gluck  being composed and performed by piano . Colorful cinematography by Manuel Rojas  showing wonderfully the city of Madrid . The motion picture was compellingly written along with his usual collaborator Horacio Valcarcel  financed by his production company called Nickel Odeaon S.A. and directed by Jose Luis Garci  though it was strongly criticized by melodrama trending and a very maudlin soundtrack . Jose Luis knows very well the American Noir genre and here he translates it to the Spanish idiosyncrasy . Jos Luis Garci is without a doubt one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film in Spain and perhaps the best known writer in the country . Garci won one Academy Award for Volver a Empezar. He has left a distinguished talent in his successful movies throughout the years  as writing as shooting  such as  La Cabina 1972  Las Verdes Praderas 1979 Sesin Continua  Volver a Empezar 1982 Cancin De Cuna 1994 La Herida Luminosa 1997 El Abuelo 1998 Tiovivo c. 1950 2004  Ninette 2005  Luz Del Domingo  among others.

And there is enough of the core star Stravinsky's 'Le sacre du printemps' of the 'biography' to make it musically stable. But the problem with this otherwise tasty peak into the lives of Coco and Igor is the lack of accuracy of fact. Perhaps that is what writers Chris Greenhalgh Carlo De Boutiny writerdirector Jan Kounen had in mind drop a few elements of fact mix those with a huge dollop of imagination and create a moment of lust and frustration that usually accompanies the public and private lives of stars. Perhaps in their eyes fiction is stranger than fact. What we do know is that prior to the May 29 1913 at the Thatre des ChampsElyses in Paris scandalous premiere of 'Le sacre du printemps' Igor Stravinsky Mads Mikkelsen was a very successful composer of such favorites as 'The Firebird' and 'Petrouska' and before his premiere of 'Le sacre' was presented by the Ballet Russes under the direction of Diagilev Grigori Manukov with choreography by the notorious Vaslav Nijinsky Marek Kossakowski in a very bland portrayal Stravinsky would later write in his autobiography of the process of working with Nijinsky on the choreography stating that the poor boy knew nothing of music and that Nijinsky had been saddled with a task beyond his capacity. In the audience is the icy Coco Chanel Anna Mouglalis who still grieving for her deceased lover Boy Patel Anatole Taubman connects with the primitive passions of the production. The film then cuts to 1920 with Stravinsky and his four children and tuberculous wife Katerina Yelena Morozova barely existing in Paris when Diaghilev introduces Stravinsky to the wealthy patron Coco Chanel who invites the poverty stricken Stravinsky family to stay in her lavish villa outside Paris where Stravinsky composes while Katerina copies her husband's music and Coco keeps her successful Parisian business and seeks out her famous perfume Chanel No. 5. Some history books including memoirs by Stravinsky himself state that the stay lasted for only 2 weeks and that the two were simply close friends but the creators of the film would have us believe that a torrid love affair occurred under the eyes of Katerina a lusty sexual fulfilling of a need for both geniuses which ends in Katerina and the children moving out to Biarritz and distance develops between Igor and Coco the secretive patronage of Coco to the Ballet Russes is supposed to have allowed a new performance of the 'Sacre' with costumes designed by Chanel and rechoreographed by Leonid Massine  the truth of these elements cannot be proved. So what we have here is a two hour nearly wordless study of the needs of two famous people colliding in an affair but also focusing the world of Paris' attention on new ways of creativity. Mikkelsen and Mouglalis are terrific if cold the 'love' scenes are beautifully photographed and the decor of Chanel's house and all of the costumes are splendid. Gabriel Yared provides a musical score that is based on phrases from Stravinsky and makes for an exciting background for this visual outing. It is worth viewing if only to step inside the Paris of the time of the two main characters. Just don't expect solid facts to reign! Grady Harp".

It takes the viewer into a special unique world with incredible Camera direction a rich beautiful texture of a backdrop and a lust story unlike any you've seen. The acting is superb and completely invisible especially the character of Chanel played by Anna Mouglalis. Every aspect of this movie seems to have been measured to the millimeter just the right amount of dialogue just the right amount of music at the right moment.

	schema:reviewBody "I just want to comment upon the review by Chris Knipp. I saw this wonderful film to me as someone who is well versed in classical music and fascinated about what was going on musically in this period. The fact that there was a riot at the first public performance of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring comes as no surprise as this was music that forever changed classical music. Conventional Camille SaintSans saw a rehearsal of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring and stormed out saying that he had never been so offended in his life. I have never seen anyone do a performance of the original ballet The Rite of Spring and I wish that I could see performances of the original Stravisky ballets particularly The Firebird and I watched this recreation with great interest. People needed to know that the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky was the toyboy of Sergey Diaghilev at the time and that this is the reason why he got to do the choreography for Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Vaslav Nijinsky is only momentarily referred to in the film by his given name and you need to know this. I watched all of the first night of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring with great interest as I've read much about this and to see it recreated on the screen I found revelatory. Sergey Diaghilev stage managed this first night and I was mesmerised seeing it on the screen.I feel that I should add what we saw in the film Mao's Last Dancer of Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring was nothing like the original ballet and I'm grateful for this film for seeing the original ballet.I disagree with Chris Knipp on various things and I found the sex scenes between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky to be intense and passionate exactly as I would expect them from a passionate Russian.There was much that I found interesting in this film apart from the first night of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring such as how Stravinsky composed. What I found initially very odd in this film was Stravinsky appearing to be composing The Rite of Spring at the piano seven years after its first performance and this should have some way been explained in the film. I researched this and what was going on was that Stravinsky moved to France in 1920 to work with the French piano manufacturer Pleyel. Stravinsky arranged and to some extent recomposed many of his early works including The Rite of Spring for the Pleyela Pleyel's brand of player piano.I watched this wonderful film with great interest and I want to thank the people who made this film for what they have done.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to some historians the couturier Coco Chanel and the modernist composer Igor Stravinsky had a brief affair in the early 1920s. Stravinsky was married with a family while Coco was unattached. According to the scriptwriters their paths had crossed before in 1913 when the The Rite of Spring a ballet by Diaghilev with music by Stravinsky opened in Paris causing such a commotion that the police were called. Coco was one of the audience who liked the piece. Seven or so years later she invited Stravinsky and his family to live in her elegant suburban villa. Stravinsky's wife Katerina was suffering from TB. It's not long before he and Coco are making passionate love and not long after that the rest of the household twigs to what is going on. The affair does not last long though it impels Stravinsky to the completion of one of his major works. To him charming and successful as she is Coco is not an artist merely a shopkeeper and he does not dissent when Katerina points out Coco buys people.Coco went on to make a fortune out of perfume as well as clothes and Stravinsky became a major 20th century composer. She seems to have gotten over Stravinsky fairly quickly and indeed continued to support anonymously his work. Stravinsky on the other hand seems to have been shaken to the core. He did after all have something to lose whereas Coco was a free agent.This production is all that you would expect from a European director  it is all beautifully framed and shot  Coco's own designs are much in evidence  and the story proceeds at a stately pace. As Stravinsky Mads Mikkelsen best known as a Bond villain in Casino Royale is every inch the uptight Russian composer while Anna Mougladis is rather enigmatic as Coco. She likes the music and likes to support artists but just why she takes a liking to Stravinsky is not evident unless you accept Katerina's view that she likes to buy pretty people as well as things. Here the film makers have given us a film of beauty but one which does not explain itself. Nothing wrong with that I suppose we can all work out our own scenarios but aesthetic considerations seldom amount to the full story.".

	schema:reviewBody "To say a film is strikingly subtle may sound somewhat counterintuitive yet director Jan Kounen's Coco Chanel  Igor Stravinsky abounds with such precarious artistic contradictions and exploits them with impressive ease. In fact it seems hardly accidental that Kounen's chosen tone and aesthetic are not far removed from those of Chanel herself serene impeccably beautiful yet with more than a dash of icy aloofness with a creeping pace and lengthy silent interludes often occupied by nothing more than characters staring with vaguely furrowed brows. Yet in many ways such stillness and silence serve to articulate volumes about the titular characters the ambiguity of such an approach allowing the viewer to 'fill in the gaps' and piece together the mystery of the characters in the same way they are prompted to envision almost all narrative context. Kounen's film could hardly be less typical as a biopic in the sense that it eschews any exposition whatsoever forcing the viewer to independently pursue the cause for Stravinsky's banishment from Russia Gabrielle Chanel's establishment as an independent fashion designer or the significance of almost every other character in the film  a risky touch which ultimately proves beneficial adding a more interactive element to the narrative and ultimately trimming all extraneous content to instead dwell on the central emotional arc. Apart from an arresting and mesmerizing 15 minute opening performance of Stravinsky's abrasively modern 'Rite of Spring' ballet and the audience's subsequent cataclysmic uproar Coco  Igor proves aptly titled its scope boldly remains one of proximity and intimacy throughout. Concentrating on the passionate affair between the two creative icons their mutual inspiration and the eventual unravelling of both Kounen leaves exterior concerns such as the mutual cultural significance of both central characters largely left to the audience to supply apart from precisely placed thematic nuggets when Chanel in a dispute with Stravinsky articulates her having more money and fame than Stravinsky the composer spits back You are not an artist Coco  you are 'une vendeuse de tissues'  a line whose English translation as 'shopkeep' loses an enormous amount of its acidic contempt.That said for a film that skims to the bare essentials of story Kounen's editing could hardly demonstrate a more contrary knack for distilling. With cameras consistently gliding slowly across empty halls up winding stairwells or past brooding characters the film's hypnotic slowness and cloistered atmosphere is executed with a largely elegant flair but with a pace so sluggish it threatens to become still photography on numerous occasions such an approach feels undeniably excessive and unnecessarily restrained the film's ending scenes in particular are agonizingly slow. Although Kounen's brilliant use of the staggeringly beautiful and concussively powerful music by Stravinsky helps inspire the film with passion and the few yet extensive sex scenes do breathe some well needed fire and rawness into the film there does remain a sense of corseted formality throughout which detracts from the film's engagement factor capturing the stiffness of a traditional biography in lieu of its inundation of facts. It is a taxing job indeed to retain audience interest through two largely unlikeable albeit respectable characters whose emotions are largely glimpsed in traces of the utmost subtlety under grimly stoic exteriors yet Anna Mougalis and Mads Mikkelsen prove easily up to the task as Chanel and Stravinsky. Both tremendously capable performers manage to convey so much through a frown a stare a wintry smile that even their character development being reduced to vaguely disconnected actions Stravinsky's starting the day with a grim routine of pushups and drinking egg yolks lying in leafy fields or slowing sinking into a bathtub Chanel's energetically cutting open corsets imperiously appraising her workers' nails or secretly contemptuously donating to Stravinky's 'Rite of Spring' for myself seems to betray volumes of inner demons. Similarly Yelena Morozova delivers an equally remarkable performance as Stravinsky's ill haunted wife Katarina her silently accusatory presence constantly looming to the forefront and serving as a constant reminder of the off centre moral core of the affair and wounded protagonists. Mesmerizing daringly sparse and elegant to a tee Coco  Igor channels the poise and essence of a Chanel concoction at the cost of lacking somewhat of the innovative fury of a Stravinsky effort. While hardly the most informative in regards to the factual history of either character Kounen's film proves more telling of the pain and passion of either figure than any factual account could be ultimately proving a serenely audacious and ambiguously compelling success in the vein of either subject.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky A mixture of Chanel No. 5 and the music of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. It depicts a love story between two geniuses madness passion pain and aesthetics. With her beauty and her deep voice Anna Mouglalis embodies her character with grace and talent. She's truly sublime. The cast is very good and it is beautifully filmed full of gorgeous details. The historical reconstruction is also almost perfect.Although this film is quite different from Kounen's previous movies it is primarily a film which is qualitatively very solid. One of the most memorable sequences of the film is the moment when after a short sequence introducing Coco Chanel we watch the famous sequence of the Rite of Spring. Although you cannot compare Stravinsky with Kounen this sequence refers in a way to the reaction he got with some of his previous films adored by some and totally rejected by others. After this sequence we enter directly in the plot that tightens the relationship between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky. Through this story of feverish passion and this both intense and particular relationship Kounen questions the turmoil of creation and thus plunges us into the intimacy of two of the most influential figures of their time each being on the verge of achieving something extreme in their work fashionperfume and avantgarde music. A very interesting film that demonstrate that Kounen has the ability to capture a new subject not really a biopic more a tale of an intense passion and confusion. The question remains whether this film is a parenthesis in his career or a new development.".

It depicts a love story between two geniuses madness passion pain and aesthetics. With her beauty and her deep voice Anna Mouglalis embodies her character with grace and talent. She's truly sublime. The cast is very good and it is beautifully filmed full of gorgeous details. The historical reconstruction is also almost perfect.Although this film is quite different from Kounen's previous movies it is primarily a film which is qualitatively very solid. One of the most memorable sequences of the film is the moment when after a short sequence introducing Coco Chanel we watch the famous sequence of the Rite of Spring. Although you cannot compare Stravinsky with Kounen this sequence refers in a way to the reaction he got with some of his previous films adored by some and totally rejected by others. After this sequence we enter directly in the plot that tightens the relationship between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky. Through this story of feverish passion and this both intense and particular relationship Kounen questions the turmoil of creation and thus plunges us into the intimacy of two of the most influential figures of their time each being on the verge of achieving something extreme in their work fashionperfume and avantgarde music. A very interesting film that demonstrate that Kounen has the ability to capture a new subject not really a biopic more a tale of an intense passion and confusion. The question remains whether this film is a parenthesis in his career or a new development.";

This film is director Jan Kounen's attempt to portray Coco how she really was a meanspirited conceited femme fatale.Only the avantgarde artistry of Igor Stravinsky's music is enough to mollify Coco Anna Mouglalis. The Russian composer's controversial work repels most for being too audacious and violent but it entrances her and after the Russian revolution leaves Igor and his family penniless Coco invites them to live with her. Igor accepts and thus begins a cataclysmic affair.What begins as a 'Remains of the Day'type attraction  where Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson were at pains to disclose their true feelings for each other and could only do so through knowing glances  very quickly descends into a sexcrazed love affair rivalling the one in 'Last Tango in Paris'.A subject you can usually trust French filmmakers with however what's missing from the plentiful love scenes between the two is frankly love. In fact their entire relationship is rather curious. It's redolent of the relationship a drug addict has with drugs It's the feeling the substance gives that's sacrosanct not the substance itself.I was unmoved by what I believed should have been an intense performance for the part of Igor Mads Mikkelsen. It is staid and lacklustre interrupted by the occasional paroxysm when he is writing or playing music. The filming of Stravinsky's seminal piece 'The Rite of Spring' in the grand Champslyses theatre as in actuality is very impressive the suspense drama and sheer creepiness convince you that you are seeing the spectacle for real.It may be reasonably assumed that Coco was purely a product of her insular background  provincial orphaned raised by nuns  but she is never worthy of pity. The only person who deserves this is Igor's wife Katherine Yelena Morozova. Her characterisation of a powerless woman who sees her husband slip away from her inch by inch is so full of pathos that it leaves you contemplating whether to buy a bottle of Chanel No. 5 ever again.For all her brutality though there's a wonderfully dainty scene where she formulates her signature fragrance. As with everything else she's very pernickety and it's only after playing Goldilocks that she arrives at the correct blend of the 80 ingredients.Asked if she ever felt guilty for her deeds Coco simply says 'No' unbearably cavalierly which left me wondering If she never had any humanity for herself why should we have any for her?www.scottishreview.net".

	schema:headline " Cheer up Igor";
	schema:reviewBody "This lugubrious exercise begins with the recreation of a spectacular event in the history of European modernism at which both famous subjects are present. It's the premiere of Stravinsky's Rites of Spring with choreography by Vaslaw Nijinsky presented under the auspices of Sergey Pavlovich Diaghilev at the Theatre des Champs lyses in Paris on May 29 1913. It's a hot night fans flutter in the audience. Gradually the public breaks out in shouting and argument. The house lights flash on and off. The gendarmes are called in. The evening is a disaster but an unforgettable one. Nijinsky's rhythmic jerky choreography performed by dancers in exaggerated makeup and peasant costumes seen up close here still seems barbaric and shocking. The music as much as you can hear of it over the murmurs and shouting is raucous and gorgeous. Unfortunately nothing else in the film is as exciting as this or has one hundredth the historical significance. A little affair between two famous people Igor at loose ends and Coco still mourning the death of her great love and early sponsor Arthur Boy Capel this never adds up to much. Coco Chanel views the momentous 'Rite of Spring' performance with the expression the actress is to have throughout the running time a cool halfsmile plays over her lips.She doesn't actually meet Stravinsky till seven years later in 1920 when she invites him to come to live at her country villa with his tubercular wife and their bevy of young children who are never individualized. He protests that he is selfsupporting but he's not doing particularly well he's an exile and he's living in hotels so he gives in. Chanel offers him a large room with a piano to work in and comfortable bedrooms for his family. Eventually she also offers him her body.Stravinsky's wife who is constantly unwell and has no eyebrows and who has to put up with knowing this is going on is never without a pained expression. Poor Katarina Stravinskaya Elena Morozova! We feel for her but we don't like her. The Stravinsky's spread around Slaviclooking cloths and even a gilded Russian icon to make their surroundings homier. Don't you like color? the wife asks Coco during a tour of the house. As long as it's black she answers. Everything in Chanel's world is black and white. That should be a warning.As we learn in a dutiful interlude in Grasse the perfumemaking center in the South of France this was not only the year of the designer's affair with the Russian composer but also the one in which Chanel No.5 perfume was developed. Historically that was an event of more significance.There is too little dialogue in this film. The affair doesn't seem particularly passionate. Why was the Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen chosen for this role? Because he has thick lips like the real Stravinsky? Because he can speak Russian and play the piano? Or just because the Dutchborn French director Jan Kounen felt some affinity with him? He never seems to possess the energy of the real Stravinsky and certainly lacks the wiry physique. He has been wonderful as a villain and a spy but as a Russian musical genius and a lover he's merely stolid and sad.Or were he and Anna Mouglalis chosen because the film was done in English and French versions and both could do that? The halfGreek halfFrench Anna Mouglalis with her husky voice elegant face and long neck is a high fashion presence. In fact she has been chosen elsewhere by Karl Lagerfeld the present incarnation of the house of Chanel as the official ambassador of Chanel perfume. She also played briefly the Fifties singer Juliette Greco in the recent biopic about Serge Gainsbourg. Clearly she had Lagerfeld's blessing and she's more chic than the sweetfaced Audrey Tautou of Amlie who played the designer in this year's other more entertaining Chanel flick. But Mouglalis has just the one expression the half smile. It's hardly surprising that there is no chemistry between the two actors.And with the focus on visuals rather than words you can only wonder where all this is going what the point of it is. Partly it's to show off the spectacular period interiors of Chanel's black and white deco villa and a succession of striking outfits handsomely modeled by Mouglalis all this doubtless supervised by the indefatigable Lagerfeld prancing around her house taking them off to have sex with poor old sweaty Igor delivering imperious commands to underlings at her couture house being driven around in her Rolls Royce convertible.Daytoday life at the villa is deadly. Madame Stravinsky admits that her husband's music is going well but nobody seems to be having much fun. The adulterous couplings are perfunctory. The Stravinsky boys know they're going on. Everyone is polite but miserable. Don't you feel guilty? asks Katarina Stravinskaya. By now we know Chanel will answer with a quick cool No.She feels something though because after it's over and she and Igor start criticizing each other she boasting that she's more successful and he dismissing her as a shopkeeper Chanel goes to Diaghilev and gives him a large anonymous gift for the Rite. The great impresario's campy gayness is mocked just before Coco comes in he's seen interviewing a potential secretary by having him strip. Chanel's handsome gift is enough to fund the whole season. It allows the Rite to be staged again to great acclaim this time so that Le Sacre du printemps bookends the film though we don't see it performed at the end we only hear Igor drunkenly banging away at it on Chanel's piano after his wife has gone off with the children. Cheer up Igor Coco says toasting him. What is he suffering from exactly? Apparently that cinematic disease Tortured Artist Syndrome. You will be welladvised to avoid this goodlooking but otherwise empty film.".

They are presented as they evidently were two individuals intensely devoted to their work work that took a lot of solitary creation.

We never see much of any relationship between him and Chanel just the sex.It took me three days to get through the whole thing. I just couldn't keep watching for but so long at a stretch and only finished it so that I hadn't totally wasted my money on renting it.Coco before Chanel shows that Chanel could be interesting. I'm willing to believe that Stravinsky could be interesting too. But I didn't get that from this movie. We see Chanel's involvement in the creation of Chanel No. 5 but there's no joy in it so we don't get excited about it either.We get even less involved in Stravinsky's composition.It looks like a Masterpiece Theater where all the money went into the production values and nothing into the script.

This one is in fact more Stravinsky than Chanel and could be been retitled Le Sacre du Printemps  from disaster to triumph. When Chanel asserts that she is as powerful as Stravinsky he retorts that he is an artist while she is only a shopkeeper. I'm not sure how much is lost in translation from the original French meaning in these two quoted words that appear in the subtitle. I suspect quit a bit. On a less artistic plane there is simply no symmetry. Stravinsky is torn between two women and one with a family to boot a predicaments to which Chanel is immune. The third lead in this movie is The Rite of Spring Stravinsky's masterpiece is featured in a 20miuntes scene at the beginning of this movie. This is an orchestration of a ballet performance in which a young girl dances herself to death as a sacrificial offering. If the subject matter was controversial at the time the music was outright outrageous  way ahead of the contemporary early 20th Century audience's capacity to appreciate. Pierre Monteux conductor of the Ballets Russes upon hearing Stravinsky's piano demonstration of the score considered him raving mad. The sequence in the movie recreates the scene from descriptions of people who were there squirmed at first then began to murmur and then the whole theatre erupted into a monstrous cacophony of hoots catcalls and hisses. The scene however also conveys the beauty of the music described by Stravinsky himself each instrument is like a bud which grows on the bark of a venerable tree it becomes part of an immense ensemble. And the entire orchestra the entire ensemble must take on the meaning of a rebirth of spring. Moving from instrument to instrument  melancholy woodwind echoing brass pulsating percussion and finally harmonizing string  the camera did full justice to Stravinsky's music.The simple plot unfolds after this masterful introduction. Successful and wealthy Chanel undertakes the financial support of this unfortunate artist moving his entire family wife and 4 kids into her plush villa purportedly motivated entirely on her appreciation of his musical talents. To no one's surprise she eventually becomes his mistress. The subtle duel between wifeguest and mistresshost is underscored from the very beginning when Catherine Stravinsky combats her host's fetish for black and white dcor by strategically placing in their bedroom red tapestry the only thing she is really able to do under the circumstances. The first sex scene appears at exactly midway through the 2hour movie. Both protagonists know exactly what they are doing. The movie drags on a little from there and moves slowly towards a somewhat unspectacular conclusion.The performance of Anna Mouglalis is mesmerizing. With her full lips deep sensuous voice and modelperfect poise you can't find a better Coco Chanel. There is never a moment's doubt as to who is in the driver's seat. Mada Mikkelsen I remember well from King Arthur 2004 as Tristan the taciturn coolascucumber Sarmatian knight wielding a Tartan curved sword and carrying a scouting hawk on his shoulder. Here as Igor Stravinsky he is dimmed by Mouglalis whenever the two appears together in a scene. But still it's an adequate job. Yelena Morozova as Catherine Stravinsky is not to be overlooked. While An absolute underdog with her sometimes almost eerie persona she proves to be a match for Mouglalis' Chanel.".

The accompanying Making of featurette on the DVD shows much more violent action than made it into the final film.All of Stravinsky's music throughout the movie is played slowly and sentimentally which is not what this composer was all about.We can only conclude that the director is more interested in baroque visuals than telling his story. In fact it's impossible to believe that a blank stick like Mads Mikkelsen wrote such violent music. The lens is much kinder to Anna Mouglalis who effortlessly steals all their scenes together except for the bloodless sex scenes in which neither are interesting.But I can't believe we'd be talking about either of these personalities today if they'd been as boring and cataleptic in real life as they are in this film. If you want to see character in action watch Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad which compared to this is one long firecracker display.".

In a way this recreation justifies the film right thereit's a bold and believable staging of the original which has huge importance in the history of music and dance.Then there is a party after the war with typical early 1920s abandonment. A new era has arrived and Stravinsky and Chanel meet.The rest might seem to be history but it's not. The whole rest of the film is really fiction overall a supposed affair between the two and the supposed results of it in their work Chanel No. 5 and some of Stravinsky's middle period works. It's a slow unfolding in part because there is little to work with. The first half hour is made up of just two scenes the ballet and the party. Then there are mostly quiet and upscale domestic situations some intimacies some quiet times between. The period details are pretty wonderful and the filming is respectfully beautiful much like a Merchant Ivory film which might be set in the same general period. Acting? This is a puzzle. Both Chanel French actress Ann Mouglalis and Stravinsky Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen play everything with painful restraint. Who's to say exactly what these people were like but surely the music is nothing if not crazy for the times and beautifully crazy for sure and the fashions were nothing if not radical and beautifully so? But things develop as if everyone is psychotically shy and inhibited.Most of you know there was another Coco Chanel movie released this same year Coco before Chanel about the young woman's life before her fame and in a way the Coco there played by Audrey Tatou makes more sense. That movie was imperfect too and it might be said that between the two a glimpse of the real woman might be possible which is in a way remarkable enough. The addition of Stravinsky and his music is compelling on an artistic level but not a dramatic one. The movie in its own way tries to be romantically dramatic. The camera moves around people as they speak and follows them into rooms and around corners. The music mostly Stravinsky's is vivid and rich and Modern and the sets are filled with plain old prettinesswallpaper and light through doorways and a room full of flower petals leading we find out to perfumes. It's all a great place to end up for an evening.If only the company were more interested and interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is strange how two otherwise unrelated films on the same topic can sometimes suddenly appear within a short time of one another. In 1960 for example there were two filmed biographies of Oscar Wilde a writer whose life had never previously been the subject of a film and in the early seventies two separate studios were quite by chance working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire. When they discovered the coincidence they decided to join forces and produce the film now known as The Towering Inferno.Coco Chanel  Igor Stravinsky is another example of the same phenomenon. It was one of two French biopics of the fashion designer Coco Chanel to come out in 2009 the other being Coco avant Chanel. It deals with the supposed affair between Chanel and the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. The two were certainly friends but whether they actually had a sexual liaison is open to question.The film opens in Paris in 1913 with the notorious first performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. Although the French have a reputation for being artistically progressive they did after all contribute the word avantgarde to the English language they did not live up to that reputation on this occasion rioting in protest against what they saw as the work's aggressive modernism. Stravinsky was lucky that his composition was first performed before a Parisian audience as their reaction caused a succes de scandale and helped create his reputation as one of the founding fathers of modern music. Had the premiere taken place in London the British audience would doubtless have sat through the performance with a stiff upper lip delivered some polite if uncomprehending applause at the end and then retired to the nearest pub to pontificate on what a crashing bore the whole thing had been and how that Russian fellow whateverhisnameis was not a patch on our own dear Edward Elgar. The work itself would have been quietly forgotten.The action then leaps over the First World War to 1920. Chanel's fashion business is flourishing and she is branching out into perfumery. Stravinsky who despite his artistic radicalism was something of a political conservative is now an antiCommunist refugee from the Russian Revolution. She invites him to live in her villa outside Paris along with his wife and children and the rest of the film traces the development of their alleged affair.Like that Paris audience in 1913 French filmmakers can often belie their country's reputation for bold artistic experimentation. British film critics sometimes assume that heritage cinema is something unique to our own conservative nostalgiaobsessed little island but greater familiarity with the French cinema would reassure them that our friends across the Channel can be just as nostalgic as we can. Coco Chanel  Igor Stravinsky is a case in point. Its director Jan Kounen is Dutch by birth but most of his work has been done in France. It is a French film of a type with which we are familiar in Britain a historical romance about the artistic or welltodo classes set in a country house complete with a lovingly detailed recreation of the dcor and costumes of the period. What might be called Laura Ashley cinema.Certainly the opening scenes have plenty of vigour and energy but then it would be difficult to recreate The Rite of Spring without being vigorous and energetic. This initial energy however is dissipated as the film progresses and in the second half it becomes little more than the cinematic equivalent of an adultery in Hampstead novel all done very tastefully but leisurely slowmoving and rather dull. A film about love among the artistic bourgeoisie of the 1920s needs to offer something new and exciting if it is not to seem overfamiliar and this one frankly has little to offer in that department. 510".

I would also like to comment the respect and kindness among the members of the Russian family. The film admits that Russians are strongly related to art and education. Even ordinary people appreciate the value of arts particularly music as it's shown in the film. On the other hand we can see a love story between two different people a family man and a woman that she has only one goal to live her every moment as it was her last. She doesn't care about moralities and relationships as Igor. Coco and Igor move aside their beliefs and cultures and let their passions to guide them.".

Some daily soaps and slightly more ambitious porn flicks have just as much depth.To make things worse it is quite likely that there never was an affair between the two. Coco Chanel was a notorious liar sort of like a female Baron Munchausen and a lifelong drugaddict. She had fabricated large chunks of her own past in order to hide her humble origins and was otherwise caught lying on numerous occasions. Hence the claims she listed to her biographer  after decades of being a lying junkie  that she had a bit of the ol' inout with Igor cannot be taken too seriously. It's not even certain whether she'd dreamed it all up as a result of her morphinecocaineinduced confusion or whether she made it up just to attract attention to herself either way the events in CCIS have a whiff of bull's dung about them. Stravinsky certainly never confirmed these allegations and the people around him deny everything which doesn't serve as concrete proof naturally but doesn't exactly help in supporting the existence of a hot RussoFrench Winter fling. In short there is no evidence of this alleged affair at all.Even more false was the portrayal of Stravinsky. He was said to have been a friendly courteous chap not at all the gloomy silent morose antisocial almostautistic quasimisfit as Mikkelsen plays him. While it is hinted here and there what a bitch Coco was CCIS doesn't even scratch the surface that lies above the unscratched surface of her bitchiness opportunism and sheer evil. This was certainly not a woman to be anybody's rolemodel not even Sean Penn's. Though perhaps Oprah might have enjoyed her immoral compass a tad.Considering how interesting both of their biographies are I find it stupefying that somebody would develop a script centered around a tiny speck of time less than a year in their very long eventful lives. Stravinsky married his first cousin wrote some amazing music was forced to leave Russia opposed Lenin's and Stalin's regimes was a monarchist who hated communism and even met Mussolini on one occasion declaring himself a Fascist to him. Coco a lowerclass bastard partly brought up in a monastery an aspiring singer who became a starlet then a harlot rose to business glory with the aid of her wealthy male lovers had been a morphine addict for much of her life threw cocaine parties was a spy for the Nazis during the French occupation in the 40s had a Nazi officer as a lover during that time financedaided a former Nuremberg warcrimes SS psycho after he'd been released from jail in 1951 and was strongly antiSemitic. Furthermore she helped fund a foreignerloathing Far Right French publication in the 30s  and then even funded a Far Left publication right after the owner of the Far Right one died. THAT'S how insane immoral and confused she was. All these things offer much more interest than two actors fking in a blackwhite room.But why wonder. The vast majority of movies these days are geared toward women and teens. Who amongst those sheep would want to see a true biography of Stravinsky? We can soon expect an Oscarwinning JayZ biopic but forget Stravinsky.The main casting isn't great. Mouglalis has an uncomfortable megabass deep voice that would shame Saruman or any alphamale Orc in his service. She has no breasts either as flat as 15thcentury Earth. What she lacks in effeminate tones and chestiness she makes up for  unfortunately  in sheer height. She manages to tower over most of the male cast which makes her look even worse. She must be about a head taller than the real Coconut. Casting squarejawed toughlooking Mikkelsen to play a skinny very ugly classical composer isn't exactly the height of realism but at least female viewers could benefit from it rather than have to watch a moreorless attractive woman have sex with a narrowfaced nerd. I could see Mikkelsen as Conan the Barbarian but as Igor the Stravinsky his credibility is stretched.All in all you're much better served going to Wikipedia or YouTube. This isn't a biography.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mao's last Dancer tells the true story of Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin who grew up in rural poverty in Mao's communist before being given the opportunity to dance in the West in the early 80s. Li is forced to examine his conscience as he must choose between his career family culture politics and love whilst having to make heartwrenching decisions of what he must choose to sacrifice and what he must choose to save.Li Cunxin is played magnificently by Chi Cao as an adult as well as Chengwu Guo as a teenager. Chi Cao a highly recognised ballerino in his own right must receive the bulk of the accolades for what is truly a seamless breakthrough performance by a first time actor. The rest of the cast are also fantastic including Bruce Greenwood who plays the difficult and complex part of a slightly camp Ballet Director who must confront his own values.Kyle MacLachlan Sex and the City takes a relatively brief but delightfully forceful turn as a Houston lawyer and Australians will delight in the cameo by the ever wonderful Jack Thompson.As an Australian production I was extraordinarily proud. Bruce Beresford has produced arguably his finest picture to date and yes I've seen Driving Miss Daisy as the pacing musical score use of ballet on camera and story structure were all pitch perfect. The film jumps around between 80s USA and Li's Chinese upbringing at the beginning before settling into a groove during the middle and end. And just when the film could be in danger of straining it's audience Beresford delivers moments of levity and humour that remind us of the characters' humanity.The backdrop of politics against which the film plays is neither ignored nor focused on. Had it gone one way or the other the film wouldn't have worked nearly so well but Beresford dealt with this delicate theme with such craftsmanship that it never becomes an issue for the audience.Jan Sardi who also wrote Shine and the Notebook has also produced a highly commendable script for what must have been a daunting project  given the success of the book the movie is based on.At 132 minutes the film is long and this can be felt slightly in the middle. However the fault is only minor and I defy any viewer to watch this without being moved by Li's story.Many who have read Li's memoirs as I have will be anxious to know whether the movie does the book justice. I'm overjoyed to say that it does. I openly wept several times in the film as did most of the audience members around me. There were a few subplots and parts of the novel left out but I found that unusually this didn't bother me as much as it normally does with movies based on true stories.This is because the film told the essence of Li's story extraordinarily well in this irresistibly moving telling of one man's struggle as he's caught between two cultures at a time of when they were pushing against each other.This year's Slumdog Millionaire upstart is Mao's Last Dancer.".

The story itself nave young dancer from totalitarian regime defects to the freedom of the West is pretty hackneyed but is framed by some exquisite dancing scenes. My former Red Guard colleague Robin thought that the protagonist Li Cunxin was a bit of a goose for given his extraordinary talent if he had gone back to China he would have reached the top of the dance establishment. Instead seduced by the shopping malls and high rise of Houston as well as by a young American dancer and outraged when he discovers the Party has lied to him about America he defects causing a minor diplomatic incident and cutting himself off for the time being at least from his family. Still he was only 18 at the time.The two actors portraying Li Chengwu Gao as a boy and Chi Cao as an 18 year old do excellent work given that neither is a professional. In fact all the Chinese actors were terrific. The American  Australian support cast was OK Jack Thomson reprising his good ole legal boy act Kyle Maclachlan playing a straight role though I found Bruce Greenwood as the Houston Dance Company director Ben Stevenson mildly irritating. One does see his point however about most of the Chinese dancers being athletes rather than artists. There were some sloppy aspects. Some of the Houston scenes were filmed in Balmain Sydney green street signs and all which by no stretch of the imagination looks anything like anywhere in Houston. Yet Beresford filmed in Houston and went to considerable trouble to film in China. The Qintao village scenes are beautifully composed and the very last scene shows how Beresford must have convinced suspicious local party officials that he was making a movie they could approve of. I guess he didn't show them the scenes with the Madam Maolike character chucking her weight about.It's not mentioned in the film but it's well known that when Li's dance career came to an end he retrained as a stockbroker an unlikely happy ever after scenario. He now lives in Melbourne. Beresford and Jan Sardi based the script on Li's own bestselling memoir and there's no doubt they have added something if only some great ballet scenes  the extract from Stravinsky's Firebird was fabulous.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I've never actually finished Li's book. I had the vague idea its about a boy from my hometown that went on to become one of the best ballet dancers but then being a Chinese immigrant myself I'm not particularly pleased with people 'cashing in' on their stories. After all his story in fact was of particular interests to westerners because of the clashes of cultural identities between two worlds which i and many thousands if not millions more overseas Chinese experience everyday. But after watching the movie I have to say I loved it. The directing truly captured the struggle of a man torn apart between what 'ought to do' and what 'should do'. I was born in Qingdao China.So the connection between me and Li's story is very strong. Mr. Li is just about my parent's generation so in a way I can see his struggle in my own world everyday. Qingdao is never short of artistic talent to many artistic talent is the only way out. 'There's no national boundaries in art' my parents used to tell me. When I was five my parents bought me my first piano which cost them an entire year's savings but it was seen as a valuable investment 'art will pave the way to success' they used to say. Like my classmates in the piano class I used to rise up 5 in the morning and practice until its time to go to school only to come home then stay practicing until 10. Going to Beijing and to study in one of the national music academy would be many of my fellow classmate's dream. I can feel the pride Li's parents had when he went to America I can also feel the pain he felt when he decided to stay in America. To Li and many others to become what he was when he went to Beijing would be everything anyone could ever wanted. What more can he hope to achieve? He could've been the best ballet teacher in China with fame and fortune to boot but he threw all that away because of love and freedom. I don't believe it was because of money or fame it was simply a choice made in a heartbeat by a young man who believes in himself.Was it selfish? I don't know. I'm confronted with this question everyday while I'm in Australia to many Chinese and spectators Li's action is selfish indeed abandoning his duties his parents and his place in the society pursuing freedom and love in a westerner's world. But the longer I stayed in western world the harder I ponder that question what is duty? and more importantly what is a son's duty to his parents? to his nation? The value system is obviously very different back then Li who's seeking individual happiness didn't fit into a collective society like China. But he also had the fortune to be plucked trained and nurtured to become what he was. Should he repay his 'debt' by going back to China? or should he capitalise on what he has gained and achieve greater personal glory? It's easy to answer for anyone in a particular value group but for Li and many Chinese overseas it can be a lifelong dilemma. After all Li's fortunate enough to be sitting comfortably somewhere in Australia writing his book many buried talents are somewhere in a dusted corner in China tutoring next generations of wannabe talents. But his fortune also comes from perseverance and handwork from a heart to pursue what he truly believes in. To that end the movie tells a brilliant story of a brave young man.".

Beresford's direction married to the acting and dancing ability of Chi Cao result in a movie about dance but that theme is only the canvas upon which this moving and quite dramatic story unfolds. The resulting movie is far far more complex than I thought as I entered the theatre. Yes of course the ballet sequences are glorious to watch but this film as I said is not just about dancing. The script explores international politics domestic trauma family bonds interpersonal tension and these are only my random memories. At the start of the film I could not believe that so many hugely dramatic instances could flow from the life of a young man born into less than salubrious circumstances in rural China. There are many different scenes Beresford edited the film in fast sequences and the total is amazingly complicated I am in awe of such a complex life so richly lived.

He is forbidden to return to China and has no news of his parents and family. Meanwhile his marriage with Liz ends and he misses his parents. But five years later he has a great surprise during a performance. Mao's Last Dancer is a film about the true story of the Chinese ballet dancer Li Cunxin. The engaging biography of Li Cunxin is an example of discipline and strength associated with courage to make the right decisions and it is amazing how a boy from a poor village in China could have become a great ballerino in the West. Bruce Greenwood Kyle MacLachlan and Joan Chen are well known actors and are fantastic but Chi Cao Chengwu Guo and the rest of the cast and dancers have also topnotch performances. Everything is perfect in this film from the direction of Bruce Beresford to the cinematography and art direction. My vote is ten.Title Brazil O ltimo Bailarino de Mao The Last Ballerino of Mao".

Other than the major moment in Li's life  his refusal to leave America  I was unaware of what was to come and as such felt the full effect of every emotional twist and turn that Li and those around him took. Equal parts depressing heartwarming gutwrenching and uplifting Li's tale was meant for the big screen.Bruce Beresford's Driving Miss Daisy direction is occasionally hampered by overindulgence a small price to pay for allowing the freeflowing ballet performances all the air they need to breathe. When focussing on the younger Li in China it is slightly clichd even the score sounds somewhat stereotypical and runofthemill however by the time we settle in on the adult Li Beresford has really hit his stride and delivers an absolutely engrossing and affecting film. The tears may flow for a lot of people but these scenes are authentic and touching escaping the melodrama that often rears its ugly head at those moments.The drama plays a big part in this extraordinary tale although it wouldn't have worked if the mesmeric dancing wasn't front and centre. Without these sequences showcasing what the ballet virtuoso was really capable of we wouldn't be able to believe the lengths these people went to just to ensure Li got his chance to shine. Fortunately the resplendent performances we witness are breathtaking and showstopping each terpsichorean routine able to tell an entire story whilst allowing Li an outlet for his deep emotions.In his first ever acting role the Beijing Dance Academy and Royal Ballet School student Chi Cao doesn't so much as act as Li Cunxin he is Li Cunxin. At first glance his silly sounding broken English and awkward attempts at romance seemingly come from lack of acting experience but then you slowly realise this is what the real Li was most probably like. As Ben Stevenson the venerable Houston Ballet artistic director who campaigns for Li to study in the U.S. Bruce Greenwood displays terrific diversity his portrayal is elegantly realised and he ensures Ben's culturally savvy and flamboyant personality stops just short of being priggish. Elsewhere we have fine performances by Joan Cheng Chengwo Guo and Ferdinand Hoang with Amanda Schull and Kyle MacLachlan proving the weak links.Get through the slow first 30 minutes then be prepared to be swept away by an epic real life saga that is best viewed at the cinema.4 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Ordinary 3  Good 4  Excellent 5  Classic".

	schema:headline " A Chinese Ballet Dancer Does Good";
	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to Qantas' great inflight entertainment programme I was able to watch a very good Australian film entitled Mao's Last Dancer. I watched it not because of the ballet which does not really interest me that much but more about the Cultural Revolution in China which the title seems to suggest.The story tells the truetolife experience of a a boy Li Cunxin born sixth in a poor peasant family with seven sons. He was picked out by the powers that be from a provincial school to train as a ballet dancer in Beijing in the 1970s. In the early 1980s a visiting American choreographer from Houston noted Li's talent and brought him to the USA to dance where Li gained fame as a premiere danseur in the short time he was there. After experiencing firsthand the differences between the living and cultural differences of China and America Li was faced with a monumental dilemma. Should he return to the motherland to which he had always been taught to be loyal? Or should he remain in his newly found land of freedom and home of the girl he loved?I really liked the scenes depicting the scenes set in China rather than those set in the USA. The culture in the community the filial piety the rigorous training the clash of art and politics even the scene with Madame Mao were very revealing and touching. Li's conversations with the Chinese consul to the USA were also very interesting.Chi Cao who played the adult Li is a very good dancer more than he was an actor but that was quite understandable. He ended his performance of a ballet solo in Don Quixote with such a passionate flourish  that for me was the best dance scene and Cao's best acting moment in the whole film. I don't know why it was but every time Li's mother lovingly played by Joan Chen appeared on the screen my eyes would cloud up which was not too easy to hide in a packed plane haha! Overall I liked the film. Director Bruce Beresford went a little too melodramatic but that's fine for me. I do note that most films about that time in China's history would tend to some emotional melodrama. Li's difficult decision makes a riveting conflict but unfortunately that part was handled with a rather rushed and simplistic manner and with a pointofview that might be biased.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't normally watch many movies about ballet I respect it as an art form but as a guy just don't get it. This movie however transcends the ballet aspect because it involves a personal and truetolife story. I think the film captures well postrevolutionary China and the US in the early 1980's.Even though the story is based on a actual events and you know actors are portraying these real people the acting is quite believable both Chinese and Western . The dancing scenes are quite good this coming from a layman. Chi Cao's acting was a bit forced as it was apparent that though he was Asian probably was probably well versed in Western culture. Being an Westen cultured Asian myself it takes one to know one. This very slight oversight can be forgiven given that Chi Cao's dancing is obviously authentic.The early relationship of Li Cunxin and Elizabeth is very well portrayed capturing the cultural differences which were a bit more pronounced 30 years ago. There were some very touching family scenes that made me cry.I had not heard of Bruce Beresford before but I see by his filmography that he has had a long and distinguished career and may check out more of his films. Yet another underrated and unappreciated gem of a film which deserves more exposure squeezed out by the big studios and their big marketing budgets churning out inferior self gratifying fare.".

A real babe who was not much of a dancer compared to him attracted him into her honeypot and they married and setoff an international diplomatic incident as the consulate attempted to seize him and send him back to Communist heaven. After he was released Cunxin's marriage fella apart he went on to stardom married his new Australian prima ballerina partner and moved to Australia hence the Australian movie by Bruce Beresford.

There are some time line goofs and I certainly remember the craziness when he went missing. I won't say much else about the personal part but I did like the movie as an artistic venture. I can tell you that I would have loved to have seen the night Li's parents came to see him dance. Unfortunately I had already left the company. In watching the movie it was a very touching scene.

There are some time line goofs and I certainly remember the craziness when he went missing. I won't say much else about the personal part but I did like the movie as an artistic venture. I can tell you that I would have loved to have seen the night Li's parents came to see him dance. Unfortunately I had already left the company. In watching the movie it was a very touching scene. The memories just come rolling back ... A job well done Li.";

The frog trapped at the bottom of a well is one. He hears from a toad at the top of the well that the big wide world is worth seeing.The whole film is a story with a message  and the message is one that uplifts without in any sense being cloying. Beresford the director even manages at several stages to invoke the idiom of Chinese revolutionary film and theatre. The scenes actually shot in China are some of the most authentic in the film which is not uniformly good in this regard. Somehow the slightly stagy acting of some of the Huston Ballet Company characters ceases to matter because the lead parts are well carried and the storyline is strong.Li Cunxin defected to America partly for his art and partly for love. The wonders of the materiality of Huston are perhaps a poor substitute for losing your country yet that country was deeply scarred by the Mao's cultural revolution. To watch the part early on where the benefits brought by Chairman Mao to the Chinese people are laid out by Party Functionaries has a dark poignancy given that today we know he was directly responsible for the death of many many millions.The dance sequences are done very well and the film pleases at that level as well as a tale with more twists and turns than you might imagine.

Then there's the scope what years of this person's life and what events does the filmmaker focus on? Also how much embellishment can be applied to the film while staying true to the life story? Mao's Last Dancer tells the tale of Li Cunxin Chi as an adult Guo Chengwu as a teenager Huang Wenbin as a child born into poverty in a Qingdao village and at the age of 11 selected by Madame Mao's cultural advisers to enroll in her Beijing Dance Academy. He leaves his mother Chen father Wang Shuangbao There he endures grueling hours and Communist brainwashing.Li becomes one of the first Chinese dancers to go to America to study dance. He is hosted by the Houston Ballet's artistic director Ben Stevenson Greenwood. At the last minute Li is called in to replace the injured principal dancer in a performance of Don Quixote with VicePresident George Bush one of the guests. Li's passionate dancing takes the community by storm.Eventually Li falls in love with fellow dancer Elizabeth Liz Mackey Amanda Schull. Li and Mackey rush their marriage so that the former may remain in the United States without defecting. An international incident unfolds as the Chinese Communist Party detains Li against his will in their Houston Consulate.Cut off from his homeland and unable to return Li continues to dance but yearns to see his family once again. He gets the chance to perform at the Kennedy Centre in Washington DC and two special guests to that performance bring his life full circle.In many ways Mao's Last Dancer is a textbook biopic. Li has lived an interestingenough life. The film shuttles efficiently between his time in Houston and flashbacks to his past as a poor village boy and later student at the Beijing Dance Academy. The film is also based on Li's autobiography of the same name so chances are it is very true to life.Director Bruce Beresford of Driving Miss Daisy fame brings Li's remarkable story to life in sweeping fashion with the scenes in the Qingdao village almost reminiscent of nowclassic Chinese films like Not One Less. Li's time in the Beijing Dance Academy is also wellportrayed. In one striking scene Madame Mao herself visits the school and watches the students perform a European ballet. She then demands to see guns politics and communist ideals. The students then emerge against a red background in communist uniforms carrying guns not so much dancing as marching as Madame Mao looks on approvingly.The film is a bit of an expose on Communist China under Mao Zedong and will be an eyeopener for many viewers unfamiliar with that period in the country's history. Beresford is careful not to turn his film into an overlypolitical anticommunist spiel keeping the focus square on Li Cunxin but also addressing the brainwashing and hothousing as well as the vilification of capitalism and imperialism.Mao's Last Dancer is definitely a tearjerker but not in a superficial Marley and Me kind of way where the Kleenex moments are painfully engineered. Here themes such as love family and personal identity take their place next to those of east meets west international relations and political standings and to marvelous effect.A good cast is essential in bringing any biopic to life. Principal Dancer with the Birmingham Royal Ballet Chi Cao handles both the acting and the dancing laudably especially considering that this is the professional dancer's first film role. Bruce Greenwood is alwaysdependable as an authority figure given his pedigree as President in National Treasure 2 The Book of Secrets and space captain in Star Trek. His warmth and kindness towards Li effectively contrast the coldness of the communist regime.Joan Chen often dubbed the Meryl Streep of the East eschews her normallyglamorous demeanor for the grubby face and hands of an honest hardworking farmer in rural Qingdao. Kyle McLachlan looks the part as a lawyer who sorts out Li's immigration woes and veteran Australian actor Jack Thompson cameos as a judge.Li Cunxin's story is one that deserves to be told on screen and fortunately it is told well in a film equal parts artful and emotional concise and beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Communism vs. Democracy interesting that a movie about ballet can present this issue in such a clear light. I guess one could say art always mirrors society. Mao's Last Dancer never really chooses sides it's more about the freedom of the heart the tolls and the triumphs associated with it.The movie tells the true life story of ballet dancer Li Cunxin. Cunxin was born in Communist China to peasants where at a young age he was handpicked by government officials to attend the Beijing Art Academy to learn dance. There he became a star and got the opportunity to study for three months in Houston TX problem is once coming to America Cunxin finally learns to fly and does not wish to return to Communist China.The movie was competently directed by Driving Miss Daisy director Bruce Beresford though I feel some of the dance sequences could have been suited better not filming them as if a spectator and rather as the dancer themselves. Never do you get the rush of exhilaration or the stimulation of dance through the visuals that while doesn't deter the emotional impact it could have added more though many of the dances showcased symbolically link to the story. The whole relationship between Cunxin's future wife Mary is never really explained through dialogue like the relationship between Cunxin and his first wife Liz Cunxin's marriage of convenience to stay in the States after getting defected from his home country. Unlike the relationship with Liz the relationship with Mary is all done through dance and dare I say it the way the dancers perform their dances is sensual.The beginning jumps around from flashback to modern day from Li's childhood in China to his time in Houston and it is a touch jarring. No character is ever given a proper introduction they're just thrown in there which works more as a detriment than it helps. Regardless once Li starts training ballet at the Beijing Arts Academy the movie really finds its groove and excels from there on out. Professional ballet dancer Chi Cao plays the role of Li Cunxin well but he is still a better dancer than actor the real stand out being Blist actor Bruce Greenwood who plays the artistic director of the Houston Ballet selfishly wanting the best talent unless that talent reflects poorly upon him.Arching over the entire movie is Li's relationship with his parents and how Li cannot see or contact his parents after being defected. Ultimately Beresford makes you feel Li's yearning to return to his home country and see his family again that you actually soar alongside Li as he dances with Mary when they are finally allowed to return to his home village in China. Mao's Last Dancer is cinema at its finest it transports you to another place and time and even through a rocky start and maybe a too classical visual style the movie manages to touch the heart and uplift the soul.I give Mao's Last Dancer an 9 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film surprised me in a couple of ways the first being an unbiased look into China during the peak of its Cultural Revolutionthe Mao Era. Americans often view the Chinese as being oppressed victims during this time but most of the Chinese were in fact committed to their leadership. Earnest and hardworking many Chinese families believed socialism was a goal that would benefit the many and opposed the individualistic capitalism of the West. In a closed society Mao was what was known and Beresford respects that period and presents it quite objectively. Western viewers will see these scenes in the schools as more indoctrination than teaching but the contrast of the two worlds that of the U.S. and China are quite fascinating.And of course we all know that the Chinese don't fool around when it comes to training and learning. Children are chosen quite young to train for the arts or athletics taken from their families and put in schools for years to learn their craft. We see the results at the Olympics for example where the Chinese are always formidable competitors. The govt selected Li as a child to train for ballet took him from his family and put him in a Bejing school where he danced and trained dailystretching jumping lifting working out  until one day he was noticed by a Houston choreographer and invited to study for a couple of months in Texas. Li's choice to remain in the UlS. isn't deeply examined in the filmit must have been agonizing to resist Chinese pressure knowing that his parents and siblings might suffer as a result of his actions. But we can forgive the shallowness for the beauty of the dance while we watch the actor playing Li move so impossibly on stage.I wish Beresford had devoted more time to Li's evolution as a dancer and person rather than focused so much on the political and social intrigue which I would have found more captivating. Still it's a fine film and of course I cried toward the end. If you love the arts and dance you'll love this film. Robert Altman's The Company focuses more on dance than love which makes it for me a superior film. But Mao's Last Dancer is definitely glorious.".

Americans often view the Chinese as being oppressed victims during this time but most of the Chinese were in fact committed to their leadership. Earnest and hardworking many Chinese families believed socialism was a goal that would benefit the many and opposed the individualistic capitalism of the West. In a closed society Mao was what was known and Beresford respects that period and presents it quite objectively. Western viewers will see these scenes in the schools as more indoctrination than teaching but the contrast of the two worlds that of the U.S. and China are quite fascinating.And of course we all know that the Chinese don't fool around when it comes to training and learning. Children are chosen quite young to train for the arts or athletics taken from their families and put in schools for years to learn their craft. We see the results at the Olympics for example where the Chinese are always formidable competitors. The govt selected Li as a child to train for ballet took him from his family and put him in a Bejing school where he danced and trained dailystretching jumping lifting working out  until one day he was noticed by a Houston choreographer and invited to study for a couple of months in Texas. Li's choice to remain in the UlS. isn't deeply examined in the filmit must have been agonizing to resist Chinese pressure knowing that his parents and siblings might suffer as a result of his actions. But we can forgive the shallowness for the beauty of the dance while we watch the actor playing Li move so impossibly on stage.I wish Beresford had devoted more time to Li's evolution as a dancer and person rather than focused so much on the political and social intrigue which I would have found more captivating. Still it's a fine film and of course I cried toward the end. If you love the arts and dance you'll love this film. Robert Altman's The Company focuses more on dance than love which makes it for me a superior film. But Mao's Last Dancer is definitely glorious.";

In most dance films the director abandons the totality of the performances by inserting closeups of faces and feet whereas Beresford knows when to just leave things alone. The edits only happen when another point of view is necessary and thus are never gratuitous. Restraint in art is always admirable.I was also amazed by the actors many of them amateurs and by the scope of the production. Maoist China appeared authentic to me having seen many documentary films about the cultural revolution and life during that period. And Beresfords depiction of 1980s Houston reflected the era quite accurately even if  as some comments here detect  some of the street scenes were clearly shot in Australia. So what!For me and my family Mao's Last Dancer is one of the best films we've seen this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "MAO'S LAST DANCER is a gem of a film that proves that true stories of the travails of artists who must have freedom to express make excellent stories. And in this case the story is true. Adapted from the autobiography by the same name by Li Cunxin and adapted for the screen by Jan Sardi and directed by Bruce Beresford Driving Miss Daisy Bride of the Wind Breaker Morant Double Jeopardy etc this story gradually unfolds in both China and America and is in both Chinese and English. In the author's own words 'In a small desperately poor village in northeast China a peasant boy sits at his rickety old school desk interested more in the birds outside than in Chairman Mao's Red Book and the grand words it contains. But that day some strangers come to his school  Madame Mao's cultural delegates. They are looking for young peasants to mold into faithful guards of Chairman Mao's great vision for China. The boy watches as one of his classmates is chosen and led away. His teacher hesitates. Will she or won't she? She very nearly doesn't. But at the last moment she taps the official on the shoulder and points to the small boy. What about that one? she says. This is the true story of how that one moment in time by the thinnest thread of chance changed the course of a small boy's life in ways beyond description. One day he would dance with some of the greatest ballet companies of the world. One day he would be a friend to a president and first lady movie stars and some of the most influential people in America. One day he would himself become a star Mao's last dancer and the darling of the West.' The film opens when Li Cunxin Chi Cao who joined Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1995 and was promoted to Principal in 2002.Trained at the Beijing Dance Academy and the Royal Ballet School.His parents were two of Cunxin Li's former teachers at the Beijing Dance Academy. Li wanted Cao to portray him is only a peasant boy of 11 played at that stage by Wen Bin Huang and proceeds to show us the above described aspects of his life as a teenager played by Chengwu Guo during his training in Beijing and finally in his visit and eventual defection to America in 1979  81. Representing the American aspect of the story is the kind generosity of Houston Ballet choreographer Ben Stevenson Bruce Greenwood and dancers and members of the support teams for the ballet. Once in America Li discovers his true talent in classical ballet and wants to remain in America but the Chinese consulate refuses to let him remain in America even though Li has met and fallen in love and married. Li is torn  between his love for the family he might never see again Joan Chen is remarkable as his mother his love for his wife and his need to remain where he can polish his gifts as a classical ballet dancer. The well publicized hostage situation in 1981 is included in the film as is the gradual transition of the Chinese growth after the death of Chairman Mao. The ending is a bit saccharine but by the ending the audience is so enraptured with the story that it all works well. Grady Harp".

Having read book after book both fiction and nonfiction about the Armenian Genocide I hoped for and expected a better movie. The acting was awkward the cinematography was lacking and so much of the book was left out or changed that I doubt I would have been able to keep track of who was who or what was going on if I hadn't read the book and I read it some 4 years ago. Having said this I still think it is worth seeing if for no other reason than to support a film that no American distributor is willing to touch and no American filmmaker or studio has the guts to make.

They have contributed so much to the contemporary Italian filmmaking industry and their epic films such as Padre Padrone and La Notte di San Lorenzo are landmarks in not only Italian but also global film history.Therefore you could guess how much of a disappointment this movie was for me. If the attempt was to make an Armenian Schindler's List the endresult is far from it. The plot is predictable to the extent of being boring the characters are flat the acting is hammy and there are so many gaps and contradictions in the storyline. More importantly you do not get even a glimpse of the usual luring cinematography of Taviani Brothers something which they are deservedly famous for.All these might be because probably for the first time in their career the directors are indeed not very familiar with the topic they are treating. They do not feel as comfortable as they do when they move on Italian terrain the people and the stories of which they know almost by heart.Hence you end up with unrealistic the scene on the forced march to Aleppo or not thoroughly explained who were the Young Turks did they have a plan to massacre the Armenians if so what exactly was the plan or the motives behind it??scenes. Add to this the overexaggerated acting the love story between Youssof and Nonik fills you with pain not because of its eventual horrible ending but due to the inadequacy of its acting...you get a very very weak film indeed.The whole controversy about the Armenian genocide...well I leave it to the Turks and the Armenians to discuss that and hopefully!! come to an agreement between themselves in the future. However it is indeed such a pity that two very important Italian directors succumbed to the temptation of making a film on a hot topic probably with the idea that it would sell and sacrificing in between all artistic considerations.

Without omitting the cruelty and atrocities that Armenians so painfully recognize from the stories of our parents and grandparent the film focuses on the humane more than the inhumane the beauty rather than the ugliness of humankind without being unrealistic or contrived.I enjoyed the costumes the sets the cinematography and most of the acting.

	schema:reviewBody "I would describe the La Masseria Delle Allodole as a very weak film. When I first watched the film the first idea that came into my mind was that the film was produced by a foreigner not by an Armenian filmmaker. The plot is too primitive I would describe it even somehow without logic. You can understand at the very first sight that the film is produced by a person who didn't live the tragedy that he tries to transfer us. The characters are fake.. The character of Nunik the Armenian girl seems to have nothing to do with real Armenian girl her behavior is disgusting and not adequate. I am very disappointed with this movie. By watching this movie you can't understand what Armenian people in fact passed through. The inhuman tortures of Armenian people their starvation cruel deportation from their motherland described in the movie totally correspond to the reality however the producers weren't able to show the true emotional experience of Armenians. Their real sufferings and feelings are much deeper and tragic. I think you should be an Armenian so that you really describe that pain. Unfortunately I have to say that I didn't like the acting either. It was not persuasive it was artificial and insincere.".

Dillon is a bank employee hoping for a raise on his upcoming review and looking forward to marrying his livein girlfriend. This feels like an indie film but it's a bit too clever clever for it's own good. Steve Zahn has some really awesome moments in this movie when he is ripping on everyone within talking distance of his character. His delivery was perfect. You will notice one of the actors from Kids in The Hall fame his part matches what he is good at that was an excellent casting choice as well.So even though the script fumbles at the end all the other parts of the movie work well.".

It was kinda funny infact really funny in some parts. I read that one reviewer here was 'dissapointed' but I think that's because he was told ie expecting it to be more like 'Office Space'. I wouldn't compare it to that except that it's about a guy who just stops caring about his job  his life starts to unravel. To me it was more like 'Saving Silverman' or 'One night at Mcools' but it was allowed to be a bit more 'Suicide Kings'like in its gritty darkness mixed with humor.  Some people don't like it when a movie makes a sharpcut from surreal  silly humor to dark  gritty violence in the span of a few beats but I think its fine I like that I think it keeps the viewer's attention when it takes quick unexpected turns like that but thats just me. The only person from Strangers with Candy that I recognized was Stu  the guy who has a beef  but aside from wanting to see more SWC cast or writers I enjoyed it  will rent it again and show it to others who like that kind of cynicalhumor. Matt Dillion was great in this as he was in 'drugstore cowboy' 'mcools'  'to die for'...his voiceover narration really set the tone for the whole story that was being told.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mitch Rouse's Employee of the Month was a good discovery. Not having seen it when it was released we took a chance at it the other night and it paid off. Mr. Rouse is a man that has worked extensively on television as well as his coscreen writer Jay Leggett who also has a minor role in the film. These men prove they can write and keep their public involved.The start of the film shows David and Sara toasting to their happiness something that will be broken in the course of the movie. On the surface we are watching David at his bank job. He seems to be successful and going places until he receives the bad news from the bank's director that he is being fired because of his poor performance when all indicates he is a good employee. On top of that Sara who is seen with her parents at a dinner in a restaurant proceeds to tell him she is walking out on him because she has found out he is having an affair with Wendy another bank employee and a friend. How much can a guy take?The film then changes as David decides to take things into his own hands seeking justice. What we are not prepared for is for the deception on most of the people around and even David seems to be guided by greed. The surprise ending in retrospect seems to make a lot of sense because David is outsmarted by the same ones we didn't have a clue were involved at all.Matt Dillon is a good actor to watch. He carries the film because he is the most interesting character of all the ones we meet in the film. Steve Zahn as the crazy Jack does amazing things. Christina Applegate and Andrea Bendewald are also good as the duplicitous women who seem to have figured out their men and what make them tick.The film is great fun. Forget the expectations and just have a good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that after about 20 minutes of this movie I was this close to just turning it off and moving on to The Grudge which I watched right afterwards. Man I'm glad I didn't though because this movie goes from pretty boring to not so bad to pretty good to VERY good. It's odd that this film has been so completely overlooked by critics and denounced by IMDb reviewers who either understood how wellmade this movie is especially the script which is brilliant or it went completely over their heads and they couldn't wait to log on and berate the film as a total failure. One reviewer calls the movie the dregs but then again this genius also gave Memento probably one of the three best films released in 2000 a vote of 310 so utter cluelessness coming from this person is hardly lightning out of a clear sky for unexpectedness. Another user gave it a lukewarm response but also called Lost In Translation a real yawner American History X waaaaaaaay overrated A.I. the most boring movie I've ever slept through and the absolutely ridiculous 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake one of the better slasher flicks !!. Now I hesitate to call this last user clueless because he really seems like a nice guy I'm sure he's a good father as well but his list of reviews betrays the fact that he may be wired completely backwards when it comes to movies. The Texas Chainsaw remake better than A.I. Lost in Translation and American History X?? PLEASE. Now I normally don't go on this much about what other people have to say about any given movie. Notice that I'm not getting into the two external reviews posted for the film Scott Weinberg and Movie House Commentary at the time of this writing which is amazing because they are both so completely wrong that it's difficult not to elaborate on my incredulous disbelief. It's sad that when a movie comes along that is actually wellwritten so many people can't resist comparing it to a similar film that came out previously completely ignoring the new film's good qualities and simply writing it off as a ripoff. This happened a lot with the wonderful comedy Runaway Bride about which so many people immediately said things like You know I've seen this movie before...When it was called Pretty Woman like it just absolutely must make them the cleverest person on earth. Personally when I see a movie that looks stupid but turns out to be a very wellmade thriller like Wild Things I don't generally complain when a similar movie comes along as long as it is also wellmade and stands on its own and Employee of the Month certainly does that. There are scenes in the movie that I thoroughly disliked such as some stupid sex jokes too much profanity and anything involving dead people and jewelry but Steve Zahn is great in his role Matt Dillon gives a wonderful performance in a wellwritten character and the plot twists start small and then get faster and faster and by the time they're done you're halfway through the end credits. People are really quick to criticize the twists in this movie. The twists are either too predictable or too unpredictable or there are too many of them or they're dumb or some other such nonsense. When the twists first started I was impressed by where the movie was going because I thought it was going to be something completely different but by the last one the movie had made very clear that many of the twists were done with tongue firmly in cheek that you were meant to have a good time. This movie is all in good fun and while it slips up by getting a little too vulgar for its own good from time to time it most definitely deserves to be compared to Office Space because it is certainly one of the great dark comedies.".

And then she steals his car. But all done SO sweetly.As for the minister's wife? Sitting there with this compassionate smile on her face all through dinner then you find out she's lit to the gills. What a great job she did!!!As Matt Dillon plays the good guy the bad guy the funny guy the lover and the killer in all his films in this film he plays all those characters. To watch him soulfully do his thing whether it's at work where he schmoozes up all the folks and makes them feel good BEFORE he's fired and then how he lays it to them AFTER he's fired is an inspiring thing to see. Working in a Stepford Wife corporation myself it's great to see all these stereotypes that I deal with daily and probably so do you. Ironically when he tells these folks the truth he's doing them more of a favor than when he panders to them.When Matt tells the pregnant woman to go home you know something is up and he's going to be in the middle of it. Of course the end tells you that the entire thing is a fantasy but in the meantime you really enjoy the ride.Do NOT turn off the movie after the 'show' is over. As the credits go rolling by you'll see scenes that explain all the little quirks that weren't explained in the movie. And for the spoiler?  Matt Dillon does not play a dead guy well. I think I saw either his eye flicker or his body twitch but he was good in the bag. See it. It's hilarious and satisfying.".

His humor is completely off the wall and he almost doesn't even fit into the movie at all yet fits perfectly. Matt Dillon is so laid back and cool throughout most of the movie and you almost forget that he doesn't really have a scar in the real life until half way through the movie. The rest of the cast do their jobs perfectly. The entire movie takes a turn equal to Fight Club in my eyes. Even my friend who figures out EVERY movie 30 minutes in never saw that coming. Then it turns on you again then you think you know whats going to happen next. Then it doesn't happen and then it does. Every single performance is right on the music is perfect and the miscellaneous humor is spot on. I think the best part is that almost everything about the movie is given to you up front you just have absolutely no idea.".

	schema:reviewBody "The demographic breakdown of IMDb voters reveals a progressive slide of interest in Employee of the Month based upon age. The young viewers rated the film highly the respondents in their 30s ranked the film as average and the voters over 45 had rated the film even lower in the 5.6 range. The truly astonishing statistic is that viewers under the age of 18 ranked this film in the range of 8.59.0. What did those young people find redeeming in Employee of the Month?At the outset the film's premise is intriguing as we follow a day in the life of a bank executive Matt Dillon and his engagement to a woman who is the love of his life Christina Applegate. Dillon's character David must cope with the sudden and shocking loss of both his job and his fiance. Dillon has a winsome personality and is effective as the Everyman character. And the talented singerdanceractress Applegate seems perfectly cast as the fiance.Unfortunately the film's good idea is not fulfilled due to the gimmicky plotting the raunchy dialogue and the enormous holes in the script. For example there is one scene outside a nightclub where David is taunted by two men. A fight ensues and David pummels both of the men into the ground. Were the men killed? Was a police report filed about the incident? Or was this scene merely occurring in the imagination of David? The scene could have been deleted without missing a beat in the film.The screenplay for Employee of the Month seemed derivative of the popular TV series Six Feet Under. In fact Steve Zahn's character is a coroner just like the Fisher family in Six Feet Under. He is also a vile character both in his language and in the despicable acts of stealing watches rings and money from the corpses. While the story and dialogue of Six Feet Under are thoughtful and engaging the scenes and language of Employee of the Month are distasteful and offensive.The film seemed almost like a rough draft as opposed to a final completed film. Hence the reliance on outtakes rolled through the final screen credits in order to fill in the gaps in the muddied script. The fine performances of Dillon and Applegate were wasted. In the end the statistical viewer responses on the IMDb demographic summary were more interesting and more revealing about our culture than the film itself.".

Was a police report filed about the incident? Or was this scene merely occurring in the imagination of David? The scene could have been deleted without missing a beat in the film.The screenplay for Employee of the Month seemed derivative of the popular TV series Six Feet Under. In fact Steve Zahn's character is a coroner just like the Fisher family in Six Feet Under. He is also a vile character both in his language and in the despicable acts of stealing watches rings and money from the corpses. While the story and dialogue of Six Feet Under are thoughtful and engaging the scenes and language of Employee of the Month are distasteful and offensive.The film seemed almost like a rough draft as opposed to a final completed film. Hence the reliance on outtakes rolled through the final screen credits in order to fill in the gaps in the muddied script. The fine performances of Dillon and Applegate were wasted. In the end the statistical viewer responses on the IMDb demographic summary were more interesting and more revealing about our culture than the film itself.";

In certain scenes Steve Zahn Matt Dillon and Christine Applegate give great performances. I found myself laughing and wondering what was going to happen next.

I love comedy's and I love movies that actually have a decent plot and this one did. I tend to shy away from movies that have something take place and then as the actoractress snaps out of their dreamfunk the real deal takes place. This movie isn't full of these but does contain a few and it didn't disrupt the movie at all. It also keeps you guessing in a way and it's pretty easy to figure out at the end. Even the final twist you know who the person is walking up to the car. Or at least you should! I checked spoiler even though I don't think I leaked anything but really not sure what the guidelines are here. Also I probably could have ranked the movie a bit higher.".

He gets off ship in Genoa because he has a toothache and has his wallet stolen meets Isa Miranda and her daughter Vera Talchi and they all fall in love. Miss Talchi is a fugitive herself from Marseilles. Her wifebeating husband has just gotten out of jail and wants his punching bag back.In broad this movie could have turned out like one of the movies Gabin had made with Duvivier back in the 1930s full of Poetic Realism. Now however the Second World War has destroyed the worldand there is no poetry left just bombedout buildings for people to live in and dentists who pull your teeth for 450 lire  800 if you want anesthesia. Director Rene Clement and DP Louis Page give us a tired ugly world where people are hungry for a little kindness simply because it has grown so rare. It's a great movie and I hope someone locates and makes available a good copy before it is forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le mura di Malapaga 1949 is a ItalianFrench movie directed by Ren Clment. It stars Jean Gabin as Pierre Arrignon a French criminal who escapes to Genoa Italy. Ren Clment was a famous French director in the mid20th century. He is sometimes called the father of French New Wave Cinema although the directors in the New Wave were younger than Clment. Jean Gabin was the leading French male actor of his day. Clment and Gabin made a great team and what resulted was a great movie. As others have pointed out this film is a mixture of film noir and neorealism. We see film noir touches everywhereshadows steel bars crimes. Neorealism was easy if you were shooting in 1949 Genoa. The rubble left behind by WW II was everywhere. People speak of living in the rubble or playing in the rubble is if this is just part of everyday life. I assume it was part of everyday life.The movie also stars Isa Miranda as Marta the Italian woman who falls in love with Pierre. She's easy to distinguishthe beautiful slender woman with high cheekbones. That's a joke because it describes every French movie star of her day. However she really was beautiful and she really was a great actor. However for me acting honors go to Vera Talchi as Cecchina Marta's daughter. At age 15 it couldn't have been easy to play alongside Gabin and Miranda but she managed it extremely well.This film won the Oscar as Best Foreign Language Film in 1950. We saw it in 35mm at Rochester's wonderful Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum. However it will work almost as well on the small screen. If you love film noir and 1940's neorealism it's a must see. Even if those are not your favorite type of films it's still worth seeking out and seeing.P.S. The Walls of Malapaga in Genoa still exist. It was hard to get information about them because my search brought up either the movie or a restaurant in Genoa. However I finally tracked down the fact that Malapaga was a terrible debtor's prison for centuries. It's these walls that physically keep Pierre from getting away. Of course there are emotional walls as well.".

The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is unlike a lot of its recent descendants less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful  showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making and to those who enjoy the horror genre though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think George Romaro ever had in his mind the masterpiece he created when he made Night of the Living Dead one of the greatest horror movies of all time and gave birth to the zombie genre. The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film White Zombie but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked scarred up chewed up zombies eating human flesh there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life birth and death the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees with the killer in pursuit eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the halfeaten corpse. Running out of the house she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck drags Barbra back into the house and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile hiding in the cellar are a married couple Harry and Helen Cooper their daughter Karen and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar but Ben deems it a deathtrap and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead which was so unheard of at the time I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends however when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it it's all about the gore Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel her mother screaming Baby! and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death God what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.910".

Topping this off with Romero's at the time large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film.

Being the only sole voice of reason is shot which at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other AfricanAmerican leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake.".

As far as modern low budget horror films go this is nearly the best of them surpassed only by Sam Raimi's masterpiece The Evil Dead.Night of the Living Dead isn't scary because of the zombies although the flesh eating sequences are still among the greatest and most horrifying horror scenes ever made.

A group of people board themselves up in an abandoned house to try and hold out against a small army of the undead. This is the classic lowbudget horror film that is the model for recent hits such as the Evil Dead and The Blair Witch Project.  George Romero stages a national disaster but reduces it to a single house for greater effect.  The story focuses on the weaknesses of each of the characters in the house  their cowardice their greedy their stupidity etc.  This makes the drama inside the house almost as palatable as the danger from outside and makes the characters more believable and important.The undead are not huge works of special effects nor are they anything other than lumbering beasts.  But the threat they pose is well demonstrated  the film makes them feel unstoppable and relentless and makes their lingering presence more menacing and less comical than it could have been. The use of an unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage.  Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben  who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie succeeds in many respects that it is the prototype of modern zombies and many movie situations. It's also good as to where the emphasis is story and characters and that it has substance.The emphasis isn't so much on the zombies but on the characters and how they deal with the zombies the debate as to the best defence the escape plan. The characters aside from Harry Cooper are sympathetic Ben is just trying to keep the zombies out and figure an escape Barbara is shocked and delirious Tom and Judy want to stay together Helen trusts the judgement of others and cares for Karen and Karen is unwell. The movie is not boring either it doesn't drag out and long.Not only is it the beginning of the zombie genre as we know it it's also appears to be the beginning of the concept of being besieged that make up many horrors and scifis. While there is a debate in the farmhouse the zombies know what they want and they all want it. And while they aren't a team they do not fight amongst themselves. In modern movies where the protagonists are besieged the enemy is intelligent physically strong fearless stealthy in some cases unusual works together often has superior numbers and has often never been fought before. A number of these factors are possessed by the zombies in this movie. The besieged protagonists in many movies have to deal with limited resources frightened members injured members and an enemy from within. This concept has been passed on to numerous movies since such as the other Dead movies Aliens Ghosts from Mars and Dog Soldiers as well as many others but none have really given the entertainment and substance that this has with Aliens being the only exception. I cannot speak of the succeeding Dead movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance however even though most horror movies are predictable plot less and clichd that is what quite often makes them my escapism but this one is still superior there is a plot the story flows well has structure and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers quite literally. And even if you disregard the socialcommentary it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all the result is a good movie good characters structure and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 910. Romero and Russo do many proud judging from the votes.".

I cannot speak of the succeeding Dead movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance however even though most horror movies are predictable plot less and clichd that is what quite often makes them my escapism but this one is still superior there is a plot the story flows well has structure and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers quite literally. And even if you disregard the socialcommentary it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all the result is a good movie good characters structure and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 910. Romero and Russo do many proud judging from the votes.";

Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man Ben Duane Jones who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors windows and openings in the house.

There have been countless movies since this one that have been made for a hundred times as much money that I have seen and forgotten but I am sure this one will always stay with me.This film does such a fine job of shocking and frightening that it is easy to forget how George Romero made it remarkable in other ways.  It was quite a coup in the late 60's to give a black character the lead in a movie and Romero quite cleverly satirizes race relations throughout the film.  I think he is making a point of asking if human beings are really any better than the flesheating zombies.  This is most potent at the end when the black character is assumed to be a zombie and is shot and killed.  Would they have made that mistake with a white person?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  This is also a point that was severely botched in the 1990 remake when they actually had Tony Todd's character become a zombie.  In a way that misses the entire point of the original.Regardless if you are a horror movie aficionado or someone interested in sociology this movie must be seen.  One thing is for sure.

	schema:reviewBody "It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that 112000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness though Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomachturning horror the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless logical approach and for being so utterly uncompromising.Not much more needs to be said about the plot it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesheating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his coscenarist John Russo who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 endoftheworld vampire novel I Am Legend show however is the strain built up by the way the characters especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film's coproducer Karl Hardman react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor or to hide in the cellar and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out of course there is no real way out and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.Romero who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades shot this film in blackandwhite largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has in many ways the feel of a 1950s invasion film think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic THE BIRDS and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh though brief in nature were then and in many ways still are shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn't been seen in horror films before but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Even after four decades of parody imitation and sequels NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers it will likely seem painfully oldfashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs it is up there with the very best and is an essential film of its kind and its era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Carnival of Souls this movie stands out as one of the definitive blackandwhite horror movies of a bygone drivein movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.This movie showed something that could have only occurred preWatergate. At one point the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington reporters confront a government official about the situation the government official tells the reporters the truth and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens government and the media. Also although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living each time a victim is bitten that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves producing a problem that grows geometrically just as vampires do.Finally this film has something important to say about race. Unique to 60's films the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben Duane Jones an AfricanAmerican man as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an AfricanAmerican as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. The ending is quite powerful and you have to ask yourself did race have something to do with the actions of the rescue posse? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignore.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie used to be broadcast on TV every year on Halloween when I used to live in Pittsburgh. One year it was even broadcast in unliving color. That was how the colorized version was described. Colorizing the original black and white movie was a huge mistake as the colors wound up looking fake. The ghouls were given green faces and the Molotov cocktails were colored bright orange.There was also another version I remember seeing on TV one year. Someone had done a parody of the movie by splicing together scenes from the movie and dubbing in their own dialog. In their version the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests.

That was how the colorized version was described. Colorizing the original black and white movie was a huge mistake as the colors wound up looking fake. The ghouls were given green faces and the Molotov cocktails were colored bright orange.There was also another version I remember seeing on TV one year. Someone had done a parody of the movie by splicing together scenes from the movie and dubbing in their own dialog. In their version the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests.

We are talking about a 30 year span here and I still love it!As a MAJOR horror movie buff since the age of about 10 this is the ONLY one that ever terrified me. I saw it in an extremely cut version as a Saturday afternoon TV movie and it still left a big impression on me. Most of the gory scenes were cut but it still scared the heck out of me. Everything about this movie works from the claustrophobic atmosphere to the blackandwhite cinematography ... and everything in between. Director George Romero is and always will be the king of the flesheating zombie movies.This is the gold star of low budget horror flix. If you have not seen it and are a horror movie fan this is a MUST see. Do NOT hesitate see it now but remember this movie was made in 1968 and much of the shock value has faded as it has been done in 1000 movies since then. Keep in mind that THIS is the film the pushed the gore envelope and was the first modern zombie horror film and you can not help but be impressed. Once you see it you will also be compelled to see Romero's equally good sequels ... Dawn of the Dead 1978 Day of the Dead 1985 and Land of the Dead 2005. The other 2 Diary.. and Survival .. are not up to par but still better than most of the other movies of this genre no matter what the critics on IMDb say.In closing I cannot recommend this film enough for the serious and open minded horror movie fan.".

	schema:headline " The one that started it all....";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it is not needed to be said for any zombie fan it is anything but obligatory to view this movie because director George A. Romero is the guy who started the whole trend of making zombie films. For the year 1968 this movie had a lot going for it. As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes gore.The premise is very basic a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesheating entranced humans otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this the actors in this movie remain noname actors.Which brings me to my next point characters. In most cases when a movie has such a basic premise character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough one would think that because zombies move so slowly it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also the musical composer William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A. Romero has brought a treasure to generations to come even if many would call it at the time malignant. When in fact zombies are exactly that in our culture today. Night of the Living Dead is well constructed and boasts gross imagery even for 1968.".

I did like the ground breaking original so eagerly awaited seeing the 1990 version which started with a car driving down a lonely country road just like the original  it was also filmed in black and white just like the original and it was at this point I realised I wasnt watching the remake I was watching the original . This wasnt the first time a certain TV guide got films mixed up because a couple of weeks ago it confused the 1967 war film THE YOUNG WARRIORS with the 1983 vigilante thriller about high school students and their poodle wiping out scumSlightly disappointed I wouldnt be seeing the colour remake I still sat down to watch the original because as I said I remember liking it from years ago . I wasnt disappointed with what I saw but the flaws do jump out at you and bite you in the neck . The acting isnt very good with Judith O Dea over acting with the rest of the cast under acting . This a great pity because if we had the same type of performances seen in something like 12 ANGRY MEN this movie would have been a masterpiece . I also couldnt help noticing a few editing errors where its suddenly pitch black outside then it flicks to broad daylight then its pitch black again  and I dont think Ive seen many films recently with such an intrusive soundtrack . I can however forgive these flaws because NOTLD is guerilla film making at its very best  its got a simple strength and that is it has a very good script where both imagination and drama grabs you and doesnt let go  A crashed satillite returning from Venus reanimates the dead ? Utter nonsense of course but the scenario is so well written you cant help being swept along with the terror as the protagonists watch the world disintergrate on TV . Compare this movie to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and tell me what one is more enjoyable ? No contest is it ?I liked this movie many years ago and still like it today . Such a pity the production values didnt come up to the standards of the script  but that said its still more compelling than the stuff coming out of Hollywood today".

	schema:reviewBody "This is possibly the most influential zombie movie ever made. Astonishingly made with a small budget but still dreadfully terrifying. Director George Romero writers John Russo and George Romero year of release 1968 genre horror themes desperation apocalypse survival and division. Now the plot is simple a group of people barricade themselves inside an abandoned house in order to survive the onslaught of reanimated flesheating ghouls. But what makes the movie most interesting is the story and interaction of the characters. None of them were heroic they seemed pretty human and empathetic. They were divided because they each had their own agenda which led to division between them. They could work together but they could not agree upon how to get out alive. That eventually led to the characters demise because although they were all human they were not able to stand together. Ironic since man has reason in contrast to the ghoul who had no reason the ghouls were better at working together than the characters.That is a pretty strong social commentary because if we reflect on reality we have war pollution and division between the rich and the poor. Through our values culture and norms we create division among ourselves. That is a pretty interesting theme and a stable of Romero's later on in his movies. Out of 'Night of the Living Dead' a question such as who is more dangerous man or ghoul? might arise. Actually I feel it rises such a question so in a way the movie is questioning our values. Because although that is what makes us strong as a race that is also our downside because we might not be able to compromise our values. Anyhow before 'Night of the Living Dead' movies were not this gory. This movie had explicit gore which lead to controversy with critics at that time calling it an unrelieved orgy of sadism. Of course times have changed and the gore and violence in movies have tremendously increased. So by today's standards the gore in this movie is pretty tame. But it still delivers unrelenting terror and dread. I remember watching it the first time and I got petrified. I also watched it with a friend  who is a gore and horror movie hound  and the movie completely stunned us both.It can be attributed to the script story and characters because as time went on in the movie the more desperate the characters became. So the suspense and tension was slowly building up as well as the dread. Then the audience had no choice but to embrace the terror of doom and dread.A cultclassic that has definitely stood the test of time. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "This is possibly the most influential zombie movie ever made. Astonishingly made with a small budget but still dreadfully terrifying. Director George Romero writers John Russo and George Romero year of release 1968 genre horror themes desperation apocalypse survival and division. Now the plot is simple a group of people barricade themselves inside an abandoned house in order to survive the onslaught of reanimated flesheating ghouls. But what makes the movie most interesting is the story and interaction of the characters. None of them were heroic they seemed pretty human and empathetic. They were divided because they each had their own agenda which led to division between them. They could work together but they could not agree upon how to get out alive. That eventually led to the characters demise because although they were all human they were not able to stand together. Ironic since man has reason in contrast to the ghoul who had no reason the ghouls were better at working together than the characters.That is a pretty strong social commentary because if we reflect on reality we have war pollution and division between the rich and the poor. Through our values culture and norms we create division among ourselves. That is a pretty interesting theme and a stable of Romero's later on in his movies. Out of 'Night of the Living Dead' a question such as who is more dangerous man or ghoul? might arise. Actually I feel it rises such a question so in a way the movie is questioning our values. Because although that is what makes us strong as a race that is also our downside because we might not be able to compromise our values.

Everything from the constant squealing of Oh My God the stream of clichs and the sheer ridiculousness of some of the dialouge pointed in the direction of a complete waste of time. Somehow however Aquamarine managed to win me over through charm and its child like determination to please. The movie centers around two teenage girls Emma Roberts and JoJo who are spending their last summer together before Hayley Jojo moves away to Austrailia. Their summer takes a surprising twist when they discover a mermaid Sara Paxton in a pool after a terrible storm. They spend the rest of the summer trying to help her find true love. Both Emma Roberts and Jojo are newcomers to the screen and do a surprisingly good job at playing bubbly girls without making the audience want to wring their necks 10 minutes in and though each have yet to develop their skills especially at showing a wide range of emotions they certainly are charming and enjoyable to watch. Sara Paxton looks and talks the part and though this role wasn't one to exhibit any real acting abilities she embraces the part full on. Yes Aqaumarine features a mean blonde girl and yes there is the hot guy but if you watch this movie for exactly what it is a fluffy escape from life then it shouldn't bother you. So if you are ever in the mood wait until it comes out on video and don't pay 10 dollars on it it is definitely a rental.".

The mermaid is very gorgeous and they decide to name her Aquamarine. As the three gals hang around each other Aquamarine explains that she must show her father that love exists all around. She meets and falls for a lifeguard named Raymond and tries to get him to fall for her. However she is reluctant about telling him that she is a mermaid. Fortunately during the daytime when the sun is out she has legs like an ordinary human being. Once the sun sets though she has a tail again. The movie also features a rival girl named Cecilia who is the daughter of a local news reporter. Cecilia is very arrogant dishonest and greedy. She wants everybody everywhere to treat her like a queen. In the end she gets what she deserves! I recommend this movie to everyone that I interact and communicate with!

I was pushing for Failure to Launch or She's the Man but my sister was determined to see Aquamarine. So fifteen dollars later we were all nestled in. The movie starts off extremely slow and was in my opinion painful to watch. I must admit I was much more entertained with thinking of ways that I could sneak in to The Hills Have Eyes which was playing at the theater across from ours. But in the end I stayed for the movie giving me plenty of time to think over my criticisms. I think Emma Roberts timid and diminutive Claire may be a rare star who started out acting fairly well and is getting worse. I thought her early Unfabulous days were good but now I can barely stand to watch the show. Her overthetop mugging drives me insane. I wasn't expecting much out of JoJo bold and strong Hailey at all. I knew it wasn't exactly fair writing her off for being a singer but that's what I did. And I was extremely pleasantly surprised. She did a great job I thought. I wasn't expecting much from Sara Paxton the titular mermaid Aquamarine judging by the painful I see we're going to have to take this slow Mer Maid in the trailers but she ended up doing okay. All in all it wasn't a great movie but it picks up in the second half and finishes well so it was a pretty decent way to spend almost two hours on a cold Saturday afternoon. Although next time I think I'll pick the movie.".

WE loved it and it also had a similar message as The Princess Bride. True love can mean more than anything else. It was funny sweet and lighthearted. You might not want to bring young kids though. it was really fun to watch and we had a great time and if I saw this movie as an adult it might have been a bit girlish yeah but girls will love it like heck!".

	schema:reviewBody "Aquamarine By Dean Kish For hundreds of years we have been fascinated with the nautical myth that there are beings in the oceans who are  fish and  woman. They are always young beautiful and completely naive. Some classic films have captivated this obsession. The first biggest and most memorable film was the classic 1984 comedy Splash which really brought the myth back into the forefront of our minds. Next was 1989's The Little Mermaid which stole our hearts and relaunched Disney's animation division.Probably the most obscure reference and the most bizarre use of the mermaid myth was used in the shortlived TV series Maximum Bob where an ultra rightwing judge Beau Bridges marries a psychic mermaidperformer Kiersten Warren. There are a lot of scenes with Warren in an aquarium and dressed in her fish tail.OK I have covered the biggest to the most obscure which brings me to Aquamarine.Aquamarine is a lighthearted preteen comedy about a naive mermaid Aquamarine Sara Paxton who comes ashore to uncover the human myth called love. Helping her in finding this mythical emotion are two best friends Claire and Hailey Emma Roberts and JoJo who befriend the mermaid. It turns out that the friends maybe separated forever when Hailey moves away. Aquamarine promises them a wish if they help her find true love so the girls desperate to stay together help her out.This film is probably not a classic or will be fondly remembered in five years but for the audience it is aimed at it succeeds on many levels. I liked the performances of Emma Roberts and Sara Paxton. I even warmed up to JoJo a little.What I kept saying as the film went on was how these three girls looked like junior versions of established actors. I felt that Paxton reminded me a lot of a younger Reese Witherspoon and Roberts reminded me some of her aunt Julia Roberts. JoJo did also remind me of Lindsay Lohan but there isn't much of an age difference between them so you can't really say junior version.I think that Paxton and Roberts have a lot of potential in their Hollywood careers. JoJo could have a career in film but does she have the ability to manage music and film like say Hilary Duff. Only time will tell.Aquamarine is a great little film if you have girls who are between 8 and 15 but other than that I can't really recommend it to anyone else. But you have to give it marks for succeeding so well in a pinch demographic. 3.5 out of 5 So Says the Soothsayer dwkishshaw.ca".

	schema:reviewBody "I took my nineyearold sister to see this movie today. It was between this movie and Chicken Little and she admitted she wanted to see this more so that was fine with me. Remembering the display of ultimate mediocrity that was A Cinderella Story one of the last movies we saw in the theater together I was prepared to hate and be bored by this movie. That is to say I went in expecting crappy dialogue a predictable yet forced and contrived plot and acting that ranged from mediocre to awful. Its having below a 3.0 on IMDb compared to A Cinderella Story's 5.2 certainly didn't help matters.And I have to say . . . I was pleasantly surprised. Not because the dialogue was brilliant the plot was novel and the acting was amazing. It was just all better than what I expected. Okay a lot of the dialogue was pretty cheesy and you can see the plot twists coming a mile away. But I have to admit I chuckled out loud a couple of times and as for the acting it wasn't NEARLY as bad as what Ms. Duff had led me to expect from these young women. Actually this movie turned out to be dare I say slightly charming at times and even when the mermaid annoyed me with her unfunny quips about life on land versus life in the sea which was at least half of the time she was on screen the other two main characters were actually fun to watch together. They're not future Judi Denchs in the making and probably not even future Keira Knightleys or Natalie Portmans in the making but I'd GLADLY choose them over Hilary Duff any day of the week.And this is the real reason why I'm commenting here. I can understand that if you didn't go into the movie knowing how tweeny it was going to be you would loathe it with your entire soul. I don't really know how that would happen considering who two out of three of the leads are but still . . . if that's what happened to you I understand. But come on . . . this movie was not worse than A Cinderella Story so please let's stop rating it as such. A Cinderella Story was less charming less unique and less valuable in the What Lessons Can We Learn From These Characters? Department than Aquamarine by a long shot.So do I think this was a good movie? Well I'm 21 so that's pretty much impossible. Like I said . . . thin and predictable. But is it a BAD movie? No. It accomplishes what it sets out to do. My little sister loved it and I can see why. Therefore I give this movie not a 10 or a 1 but a 5 that is a rating of perfect mediocrity. If you know a girl between the ages of 8 and 13 feel free to take her to see it because she'll probably love it and honestly you're not going to mind it all that much. I promise.".

My daughters are 6 and 9 and I am in my 30's and we all found something that tickled our funny bones and lots we laughed at together. It was wonderful to sit in the cinema and watch the smiles on my girls faces and twinkles in their eyes at the magic this movie holds.

I've seen Mermaids with Cher and that was also awful. Continuing cinema's love affair with beautiful mermaids and the Little Mermaid story Sara Paxton plays Aquamarine a reallife mermaid who changes the lives of two best friends forever. Emma Roberts and Jojo play the two friends who must deal with possible separation as one of the girl's mother is resolved to move out to Australia for a highpaying job as marine biologist. The two girls make a wish that something will keep them together. Aquamarine shows up and soon she changes the girl's lives making them stronger smarter and altering their status from unpopular girls to the girls everyone roots for. Arielle Kebbel plays the meanspirited Cecilia whose father is a wealthy news reporter and whose goal is to humiliate the girls. Aquamarine falls for the sexy hunky California surfer dude boy Jake McDorman. The Little Mermaid story is now acted out in present time as he discovers her secret she is a mermaid by night and human by day but still continues to pursue her romantically. Possibly this film is terrible but for preadolescent girls and or younger this is a real delight. The girls do learn a lesson in friendship and loyalty. Aquamarine learns that love is not merely romantic but platonic. These lessons aren't really delivered with enough power as this film is mostly comedy. But this film is enjoyable and has its own merit even if it is predictable in Little Mermaid manner. But what story hasn't been told and retold ?".

Aquamarine falls for the sexy hunky California surfer dude boy Jake McDorman. The Little Mermaid story is now acted out in present time as he discovers her secret she is a mermaid by night and human by day but still continues to pursue her romantically. Possibly this film is terrible but for preadolescent girls and or younger this is a real delight. The girls do learn a lesson in friendship and loyalty. Aquamarine learns that love is not merely romantic but platonic. These lessons aren't really delivered with enough power as this film is mostly comedy. But this film is enjoyable and has its own merit even if it is predictable in Little Mermaid manner. But what story hasn't been told and retold ?";

I didn't really enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed the movie. That says a lot because I read the book Freaky Friday after I saw the movie and I thought the book was better. I also read the book Harriet the Spy after I saw the movie and I still thought the book was better so I didn't like the movie better just because I saw it before the book. Also I like Sara Paxton. I already saw her in the movie Sleepover and then after I saw this movie I saw Sara Paxton in Return to Halloweentown on Disney Channel. It's amazing how Sara Paxton has the ability to change characters in so many movies. If I didn't know already that Sara Paxton played someone in all three of these movies I would have never guessed!

	schema:reviewBody "Due to a special affection for Scottish comedy legend Billy Connolly I saw Beautiful Joe.  I love low budget film and I love a good heart tugging story. Connolly's Joe is a charming character that one can't help but like from the films opening.  A Scot playing an Irishman amused me particularly that the extent of his Irish accent was to say Tanks instead of Thanks but Connolly's charm sees this of little annoyance. Sharon Stone who I normally don't care for hits all the right notes in a very good performance as the tough as nails barhopping single mother. The two leads play off each other wonderfully without being drawn into the sentimentality of the piece.  The two child actors are also first rate particularly in their scenes with Connolly.  Ian Holm Dan Florek and Gil Bellows provide some lovely touches in their small roles. The problem? The script is quite predictable and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to put it together.  The unforgivable aspect however is the constant view of the boom microphone in the shot.  This doesn't happen just once it happens several times and so obtrusively that it detracts from the viewers ability to get stuck into and believe the film at least with this viewer it did. That aspect tainted the film badly which is a shame because the work of Connolly and Stone is truly first rate. Visible boom microphone aside Beautiful Joe is well worth seeing as a nice feel good film with some top notch acting.".

A lot of movies have that aspect but sometimes there's other things that are so well done it kinds of takes the focus off that aspect. Not here. There's a lot that just seemsfor lack of a better term put on. And the amount of bad things that keep Cropping up and happening just when one is over with almost makes that the focus of the movie.Then there's the amount of screeching and melodrama. And when Hush and Joe were fighting in the casino how come nobody even batted an eye except the kids? Wouldn't SOMEBODY have told them to be quiet? It's things like that which took away from my enjoyment of this movie. Then toward the end it got really tough. I mean every five minutes something would come up to make it seem like Joe and Hush were finished. After awhile it's tough not to think Just get together already.The movie is not at all unwatchable. It's not what I'd call bad. But I'd only Give it a 5 or 6 or so for the reasons mentioned above. In terms of positives there were a couple of things that really stuck out. One was Sharon Stone in this role. When she lessened up on the screeching she was excellent and I wish her character had been a littlewellCALMERbecause Stone is a really good actress when she's playing quality Roles and I think though she brought some nice aspects to the role of Hush she could have brought even more if the role had been toned down a bit.Now the SECOND and most important thing I liked was Billy Connolly as Joe. He created a lovely character and even though I didn't love the movie I did think he did a 10 of 10 in his portrayal of Joe. That was without a doubt the highlight of the movie.I kind of wish this movie had been either a straight out noir with quieter characters more mystery and less screaming or a sweet family drama. There seems to have been a lot of potential here because the storyline in general sounds somewhat intriguing. But there was a lot that seemed forced. The movie is not bad but was not great however the character of Joe is one that I'll remember and if one is going to see this movie they should see it for that reason. My vote for the movie overall is about average.".

Of course a big part of the reason are the leads since I like both Billy Connelly and Sharon Stone who in their different ways are not the typical sugary romcom stars such as Meg Ryan Julia Roberts Hugh Grant etc. A film with any of the mentioned is sure to make me want to throw up. One of the setbacks is that I often get annoyed by actors doing a Southern accent and it was no different here but I got used to it after a while. However the performances are uneven. The plot with the bad guys is very bad. The mobsters are very unconvicing and the guy from Ally McBeal is really awful. He was obviously trying to shed the good guy image and show he has 'range' but he's cartoonish and overthetop. His character really hurt the film the most.On the other hand Connelly Stone and the kids are fine but I want to point out another performance that impressed me the most. Another TV face not very famous  Roger Cross who played the aliens JoshuaCain in SF series 'First Wave' shows up in one scene for about 2 or 3 minutes as Stone's ex who's in jail and proves that there are no small roles. If anything impressed me in this film it's that scene  which proves you don't need much screen time or many lines to make a memorable character.".

They are an unlikely pairing but it works. The jist of their plot is whether Stone's character can finally settle down with a worthwhile guy Joe instead of the marginal losers she normally ends up with. Then there is the whole gangster subplot which involves gangsters after both Stone and Connolly with reasoning and results so convoluted that all you can do is groan when they come on screen again. Maybe these movies get financed when the producers hear the word gangsters. I can come up with no other reason why they are being inserted into every other film I am seeing these days.I was delightfully surprised to see Sharon Stone and Billy Connolly in a movie together. An unlikely match you say! But the story and plot were superb! Billy has toned down his humor but it shines through. Sharon was an excellent love interest for him. He plays his role with tenderness humor bravado and extreme likability. She has a role which is not typical for her nevertheless a good one.

	schema:headline " uneven romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Though likable in many ways Beautiful Joe' is one of those maddeningly inconsistent movies in which the plot keeps getting in the way of the finer elements of the picture.  Here we have a film that is far more effective in its moments of quiet contemplation than the moments in which it indulges in grand melodramatic gestures.  The latter do not happen frequently enough to actually kill the picture but you can't accuse them of not trying.Writerdirector Stephen Metcalfe has concocted a screenplay that is part romantic comedy part road movie' and part petty gangster picture.  The mixture never really jells.  The film focuses around a sweet goodnatured hopelessly optimistic Irish immigrant so beloved in his heavily ethnic Bronx neighborhood that his neighbors have affectionately nicknamed him Beautiful Joe.'  One day Joe is informed by his doctor that he has a potentially life threatening brain tumor.  Conveniently for purposes of the plot Joe also happens to discover on that day though everyone else seems to have long known it that his slatternly wife has been cheating on him.  This frees him up to load his van and set out in search of the adventure he never really experienced in his peaceful but humdrum existence.  While in Kentucky he meets Hush' Mason a downonherluck gambler and exotic dancer with two children who also happens to be involved with a parcel of petty gangsters led by one George the Geek' whose sadism emerges in his various dealings with Joe Hush her children and his own loyal henchmen.Beautiful Joe' is at its best when it concentrates on the quiet moments that occur between these two oddball people  one a rock of stability sanity and virtue in a cruel chaotic world and the other a mess of insecurities weaknesses and vulnerabilities who needs someone like Joe to help pull her out of that world.   When Sharon Stone and Billy Connolly share screen time together along with Jurnee Smollett and Dillon Moen who play her children the film is believable and touching.  However Metcalfe seems unwilling to leave well enough alone because he has injected into the film a truly awful subplot involving a group of bumbling gangsters who manage to bring the film crashing down every time they appear in a scene. Luckily for us and for the film they disappear through long stretches of the movie's running time allowing time for us to concentrate on the individuals at the story's core.  Even here however some of the plot details seem unnecessarily hokey and distracting such as Hush's son's refusal to talk being overcome at the last minute  an obvious device to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as is legally possible.  Indeed the whole final act overindulges itself on syrupy sentiment. Connolly and Stone are both excellent in their roles Connolly appearing strong compassionate and virtuous all at the same time while Stone displays just the right amount of feistiness and vulnerability to make her character ring true and likable.  A pity Metcalfe doesn't display the discipline of tone and plotting necessary to make this film a total triumph.  But for the elements that are good in it  and they are indeed manifold  Beautiful Joe' is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed.".

Here we have a film that is far more effective in its moments of quiet contemplation than the moments in which it indulges in grand melodramatic gestures.  The latter do not happen frequently enough to actually kill the picture but you can't accuse them of not trying.Writerdirector Stephen Metcalfe has concocted a screenplay that is part romantic comedy part road movie' and part petty gangster picture.  The mixture never really jells.  The film focuses around a sweet goodnatured hopelessly optimistic Irish immigrant so beloved in his heavily ethnic Bronx neighborhood that his neighbors have affectionately nicknamed him Beautiful Joe.'  One day Joe is informed by his doctor that he has a potentially life threatening brain tumor.  Conveniently for purposes of the plot Joe also happens to discover on that day though everyone else seems to have long known it that his slatternly wife has been cheating on him.  This frees him up to load his van and set out in search of the adventure he never really experienced in his peaceful but humdrum existence.  While in Kentucky he meets Hush' Mason a downonherluck gambler and exotic dancer with two children who also happens to be involved with a parcel of petty gangsters led by one George the Geek' whose sadism emerges in his various dealings with Joe Hush her children and his own loyal henchmen.Beautiful Joe' is at its best when it concentrates on the quiet moments that occur between these two oddball people  one a rock of stability sanity and virtue in a cruel chaotic world and the other a mess of insecurities weaknesses and vulnerabilities who needs someone like Joe to help pull her out of that world.   When Sharon Stone and Billy Connolly share screen time together along with Jurnee Smollett and Dillon Moen who play her children the film is believable and touching.  However Metcalfe seems unwilling to leave well enough alone because he has injected into the film a truly awful subplot involving a group of bumbling gangsters who manage to bring the film crashing down every time they appear in a scene. Luckily for us and for the film they disappear through long stretches of the movie's running time allowing time for us to concentrate on the individuals at the story's core.  Even here however some of the plot details seem unnecessarily hokey and distracting such as Hush's son's refusal to talk being overcome at the last minute  an obvious device to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as is legally possible.  Indeed the whole final act overindulges itself on syrupy sentiment. Connolly and Stone are both excellent in their roles Connolly appearing strong compassionate and virtuous all at the same time while Stone displays just the right amount of feistiness and vulnerability to make her character ring true and likable.  A pity Metcalfe doesn't display the discipline of tone and plotting necessary to make this film a total triumph.  But for the elements that are good in it  and they are indeed manifold  Beautiful Joe' is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed.";

And if she seems different Gil Bellows is a far cry from the Allie McBeal attorney. I recognised Ian Holm but I couldn't recall from where. The British actor gives an incredible performance as a tough mobster who may have just met his match. Or not.

The lead role could have been a Jerry or a Walt or anybody else and the title would have worked even better for this movie. But since we know the two groups of people in this country most cut off from reality are always those in Washington and those in Hollywood we get Beautiful Joe.This movie would be just the thing for a middle aged or older couple on a date or romantic evening at home. I bought the VHS tape at a yardsale for a quarter it is represented as a dark comedy perhaps similar to Get Shorty or A Fish Called Wanda. That is only in their dreams as it really is not funny beyond the most basic of stock gags. In fact from what I watched about a third of the entire movie it is really nothing but tired stock bits strung together. E.g. mugger attacks couple but woman kicks his butt man goes home with sexy woman but ends up buying food for kids instead. Safe proved techniques all very boring to me.Sharon Stone's character is your slightly aging could stand to lose just a few pounds but still hot Miami or Catskills resort golddigger type. She doesn't do badly but she doesn't do enough. If this is to be a sexy funny movie she could have been a bit sexier and a bit funnier. In general the film works harder not to be sexy than to be sexy and not to be funny than to be funny. As a date movie or a chick flick for the right people this movie could do just fine.

The plot is sometimes too rushed like in the scenes involving Joe's brain cancer but that happens in order to bring the story's main subject more quickly the romance. Joe abandons his former life to discover the world out there and albeit he gets involved with a troublesome woman he finds a new happiness along with her. On the other hand I may admit that the story feels too generic and ordinary to be told in a featurefilm but it can still be enjoyed as long as the spectator buys the spirit of it. Also I disagree with its synopsis that has been written on IMDb Joe is nothing close to a really nice guy whereas Hush isn't a really bad girl as well. That being said in my opinion and in conclusion Beautiful Joe doesn't bring anything new to the genre that it's been produced in but it is surely a humble project that entertains the average audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shot in Costa Rica in 1988 'El Dorado' is one of a rare breed a Spanish film about its own role in America in the 16th century. However this film doesn't tell a story of glory and conquest but one of failure and slow descent into madness.The story is about an expedition down the Orinoco river in 1560 undertaken by Spanish soldiers with the aim of finding the famed land of El Dorado where gold is supposedly plentiful. I suppose that it is not a spoiler to say that the place doesn't exist and that what the expeditioners find is something completely different.The film is 142 minutes long and not exactly actionpacked so a prospective viewer should realise that the leisurely pace is meant to reflect the utter boredom provoked by the long and uneventful days in the journey but these 'dead' days as in many expeditions are punctuated by moments of high intensity and tension in which the travellers will have to react to the challenges thrown at them by the jungle... or by themselves. In this sense the film is a study on how to face or not insurmountable obstacles in extreme conditions in particular when greed pride and lust are thrown into the mix.The filming on location does half the job for the filmmakers. The river and the jungle are like one additional character and one can feel the stuffy Oldworlders slowly stewing under their heavy shirts and armour as the days pass. I find a bit of fault with the way Lope de Aguirre the main character is played. The film goes for understated menace from a quietly unscrupulous man which ends up adding to the slowness of the film. Of course that's the director's choice but I feel that a bit of energy and feeling of danger coming from the villain of the piece would have been welcome.All in all it's an effort that meant a lot for Spanish cinema in the 1980s having been filmed only four years before the 5th centenary of the discovery of America and just a decade into full democracy after the Franco dictatorship. But it if has to be enjoyed one must come with 'Apocalypto' Mode firmly shut off.".

	schema:headline " An expedition formed by Spanish soldiers down the Orinoco and Amazon rivers searching for the fabled city of gold";
	schema:reviewBody "Epic film in big budget produced by great producer Andres Vicente Gomez and well directed by Carlos Saura . It deals with an expedition under command of Pedro Ursua Lambert Wilson with various officers Patxi Bisquert  Eusebio Poncela  Feodor Atkine  Jose Sancho  among others . The travelers who are overdressed for the heat in their old world clothes and armour must survive the crises of jungle life and human badness . The river  jungle scenery and several dangers dominate the motley characters in the risked journey . But later on  Lope De Aguirre Omero Antonutti takes over the explorers .Historical and interesting film that contains thrills  intrigue  swordplay  doublecrosses and wonderful scenarios . The picture is overlong  142 minutes long  and has been criticized for its plodding argument  with brief moments of tension when the travelers must survive the risks of jungle life and human frailty . Good performances from Omero Antonutti  who plays this actual historical character with quiet  understated menace  plus  Lambert Wilson  Jose Sancho  Francisco Algora  Francisco Merino and many others . Furthermore  Ines Sastre film debut . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Teo Escamilla . Evocative score by Alejandro Masso based on Renaissance music and 'Tristan and Isolda' by Richard Wagner . Because of a similarity in plot and characters the movie suffers by comparison with 1972's Aguirre the Wrath of God  by Werner Herzog but stands on its own as a less fantastic version of the same travel of obsessed adventurers .The motion picture is well directed by Carlos Saura who also wrote the screenplay  he is a good Spanish movies director. He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 dealing with juvenile delinquency and similarly long time after Deprisa  Deprisa . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in the Berlin Festival for  La Caza or The Chase 1966 his most successful film  and for Peppermint Frapp 1967 in 1967 . Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975 . Also the Awardwining Saura filmed Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 and got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. Saura made several films just a few years before and after the end of Francisco Franco's dictatorship  thus the search for political themes and symbols is mandatory for all . In 1990 he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director for Ay Carmela! . Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as Carmen  Amor Brujo  Bodas De Sangre  Sevillanas  Iberia  Salome  Fado Flamenco and even recently Opera as Io  Don Giovanni The picture is based on real incidents  these are the followings  Lope De Aguirre together with his daughter joined the 1560 expedition of Pedro De Ursa down the Maran and Amazon Rivers with 300 Spaniards and hundreds of natives  the actual goal of Ursa was to send veterans from the former Peruvian civil wars away to keep them from troublemaking using the Eldorado myth as a lure . A year later he participated in the overthrow and killing of Ursa and his successor Fernando De Guzmn whom he ultimately succeeded. He and his men reached the Atlantic  probably by the Orinoco River  destroying native villages on the way. On March 23 1561 Aguirre urged 186 captains and soldiers to sign an act which would proclaim him as prince of Peru Tierra Firma and Chile. He is reputed to have said in 1561 I am the Wrath of God the Prince of Freedom Lord of Tierra Firme and the Provinces of Chile In 1561 he seized Isla Margarita and brutally suppressed any opposition to his reign killing many innocent people. When he crossed to the mainland in an attempt to take Panama his open rebellion against the Spanish crown came to an end. He was surrounded at Barquisimeto Venezuela where he murdered his own daughter Elvira because someone that I loved so much should not come to be bedded by uncouth people. He also killed several followers who intended to capture him. He was eventually captured and shot to death. Aguirre's body was cut into quarters and sent to various cities across Venezuela.".

These two men put to shame what Mr. Saura has done to El Dorado.Again we are taken to Peru where the conquering Spaniards are searching the legendary gold the rich commodity that seems elusive to them and the big scale mission undertaken by Ursua and his men. Little prepared these Spanish invaders to what they were really going to have to face in their quest for riches. Alas the mission for finding the gold is a total failure and El Dorado just another myth never have been found.The Europeans only brought their diseases greed and cruelty to the new world. We wonder how the native culture in the conquered lands would have fared if these men who thought they had the power to exterminate and make them practical slaves to their whim never found them. For one thing they might have survived better with the customs and rituals they had practiced before the advent of the white man. A lot of suffering would have been spared if these poor natives would have been left alone.Mr. Saura doesn't add anything new with this film to his otherwise interesting career in the cinema.".

Whether it was the directing or the wonderful screen presence of the actors somethng about this film had the ability to capture the emotions of the viewer. I can say that having been used to watching generally American films Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is a romance that stands out from the typical Hollywood love story  paying attention to detail and character development in a way in which I've rarely seen before. Although I was quite new to Indian musical numbers in which they incorporate within their films and even found the performances in them a little bit on the cheesy side I throroughly enjoyed some of the songs as well. Great melodies especially the title song  which added to the emotional impact of the movie itself. I wll definitely be looking out for more Indian films in the future.".

This was the starting point of glitzy orchestrated and professional movies in the Indian cinema. Attention was paid to the smallest of details as well as being the first to bring designer clothes brought into the movies modern dressing was addressed sets were realistic and well created and most importantly the characters were well developed  we knew where they were coming from where they were and where they were going.SRK and Kajol are the best pairing in modern day's hero's and look wonderful together. They have the kind of chemistry that really complements each other and they know how to hold themselves against each other. Rani looks good in her role. It is clear to see that she has great potential and will accomplish a lot in the years ahead. Anupam Kher Farida Jalal and Johnny Lever are great in their roles and really well suited.The story is well developed with a great direction and writing credits it can be seen that Karan Johar will be a milestone in Indian Cinema. It is really excellent the way the story in split into two halves and after the intermission one gets the feeling that they have been transported into a different world from the one we just saw before the break. I shall not indulge into the story too much but its is not your run of the mill love story. All I really have to say is that I saw this movie again recently after a few years and it still looks fresh and modern and it still makes me laugh and cry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Karan Johar's directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is one of those films you can always watch and enjoy with your family and friends. In spite of being a bit of a fairy tale it works very well within its limitations. It is one of those beautiful Hindi romantic comedies that actually form the unique cultural and artistic style of Bollywood's most famous mainstream flicks. This is an enjoyable and charming picture which can make you laugh cry at times even cringe with annoyance but then it will keep you consistently entertained.The film introduces Johar's famous statement that the first step towards love is friendship and does it in a slightly cheesy yet rather convincing way. The film is a poignant story of two friends a guy and a girl who understand they actually love each other perhaps too late. And that's how it goes on. It flows well with wonderfully composed songs nicely written characters several clichs here and there many comic sequences some melodramatic ones as well but more importantly a lot of Bollywoodstyle colour and fun.Shahrukh Khan and Kajol work with electrifying chemistry. Their scenes together are pure magic. Both give crafted performances. Kajol is more impressive as the cool tomboy who transforms into a womanly attractive and sensitive Anjali. She displays the pain joy happiness and confusion that her character goes through with great conviction. Shahrukh is fantastic as the young cool guy friend and boyfriend and later on as a loving and caring father who has lost his wife and suffers her loss.Rani Mukherjee is beautiful and vibrant and makes for a very effective intelligent and dreamy girl. This is not an accomplished but very sincere performance which deserves full praise. Salman Khan is very good and surprisingly enough manages to impress even in a brief seemingly insignificant appearance. It may be because his character makes a great impact on the film's story and on the viewer. I really liked the film's music the title song being my favourite and among other songs the melancholic Tujhe Yaad Na Meri Aayee is very beautiful. Towards the end there are some overly melodramatic sequences but they flow well enough to bring the longawaited ending. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is overall great entertainment and a mustwatch for lovers of Hindi cinema and its films. It is compelling moving and memorable and is always fun to revisit. I recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film in my cinema history class. I have never really watched many Bollywood films but I was really impressed what I saw. It was almost like an 80's pop culture musical with a touch of Grease in it.What makes the film so enjoyable is that it's not only colorful in it's style and environment but all of the characters have very colorful personalities that make the film work. In the sense of the plot it is easy to predict what is going to happen but the movie is so well made your not really occupied with that though. Another factor is that it also has very convincing emotional content. The movie starts off very emotional when Raoul loses his wife Tina. I even almost cried at the end when I saw how heart broken Anjali and Raoul were because she was getting married to Aman.I give this film an 8.5 out of 10. Both Shahrukh Khan and Kajol both did an excellent job in this film. If your bored with the same old crap you watch all the time then watch this. Just be warned it's a very long film and remember to display your subtitle on your DVD player.".

It was almost like an 80's pop culture musical with a touch of Grease in it.What makes the film so enjoyable is that it's not only colorful in it's style and environment but all of the characters have very colorful personalities that make the film work.

KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI has the best songs of any Hindi film I've seen. They are so good in fact that you tend to forget how long and dragged out the film is! As soon as you get to a new song it is like a complete battery recharge. There are some real moments of laughter tears and drama which is more than you get in most movies. Also to set the record straight ALL HINDI FILMS ARE PADDED OUT TO APPROX. 3 HOURS. Live with it! It means there will be stupid comedy boring scenes etc. You make your way through those with the remote if you are REALLY impatient to get to the gold wonderful costumes music scenery etc. If properly edited and released in the U.S. this could be an arthouse hit. The musical numbers rank right up there with GREASE. If you're tired of crappy American films watch KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI. You may not love it but you will leave the theater or couch humming the songs!".

Then I wonder what is the commotion about ? The next thing I did was come to the theater and watched it It had played for five months and what else reason  I should  use ?  and.................... I fall in love with this one. I don't know how many times I have watch it but it never fail to entertain me.It's a beautiful journey through love even it's nothing but just a love tale or a love fantasy or a love dream for some of us but it's a superb thing for me. The plot is not so original. It took from others famous movies but mixed nicely by Karan Johar and played by wonderful cast such as Shah Rukh Khan Kajol and Rani Mukherjee. The most important thing from this movie is  that this movies is remains us to always reach for our true love and keep struggling for it.I know it's not suitable for a serious audience but I promise this movie is not that bad. Just rent it and enjoy this classic tale and believe me once is not enough !910".

	schema:headline " Friendship Love and Lust!";
	schema:reviewBody "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is Karan Johar's first foray into understanding relationships in the Indian family context. This is a film from an era before he got into big cinema and expatriate Indians. The ensemble cast consisted of highly popular or young and upcoming stars like Shahrukh Khan Kajol Salman Khan and Rani Mukherjee. Rumors are that the film was actually the brainchild of Kajol and SRK who had worked with Karan on Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and believed that KJo had it in him to direct good films. They helped Karan sort out a rather muddled story and had their way with the character development for the most part. It is quite fitting that a young director of 26 yrs would want to explore romantic relationships in the environment of young folks in a college setting. What is the most important factor in love? Is it lust or is it friendship? SRK plays Rahul the continuation of his DDLJ Raj persona whose best buddy is the tomboy Anjali Kajol in a tomboy Simran persona. There is lots of friendship but not much attraction on either side. Then a young different attractive young woman Tina Rani in an excellent hottie role arrives on the scene and the mixture gets stirred up. Rahul feels the attraction lust? for Tina and at the same time Anjali discovers that she loves Rahul but has no wiles to attract him. Rahul confesses to his best buddy his love for Tina and Anjali leaves the scene and goes away. Tina dies in childbirth but leaves letters for her daughter asking her to make sure Rahul and Anjali hook up again as she felt that she came between the true love they had for each other. The rest of the film deals with Rahul meeting Anjali again only to find her with another man in her life and how the story gets resolved to give us the obligatory happy ending.What I did not like about Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 1. It is like a penny romance with no real deep meaning  I hate when that happens to what otherwise has the potential to be a good film. 2. Everything is stereotyped  relationships are perfect lives are perfect. I wish some more exploration of the conflict between love and lust had been done in a more substantial manner. 3. The characters were dressed in Lycra for the entire first half  no doubt to make them look young! But it was kind of annoying 4. The basketball matches were not really played as per rules were they? Even I know how many steps you can take before it is called walking! 5. I am so conflicted about this film  it is like a candy bar that one cannot help taking guilty pleasure in but you know that in the end it leaves nothing of substance behind.What I like in the film 1. The overall feelgood feel of the film. 2. The story  it begins with a funeral pyre and ends with 15 minutes of copious tears but the middle is funny romantic and happy. 3. Many moments between SRK and Kajol  this is why the duo was the best romantic pair out there for so long. In many moments when Kajol is a tomboy buddy in the second half when she is the demure Anjali  she and SRK sizzle on screen. Some moments are my particular favorites  when Anjali leaves and goes off  the entire train station scene is brilliant  Rahul watching the train leave Anjali watching him. The first meeting between the two at the summer camp the scene at night on the bench the second basketball matchup at the camp  the friendshipattraction is palpable. 4. The music  the movie has some of the best music and awesome song picturization. Koi Mil Gaya remains my favorite stage song I love SRK's tongue in cheek Elvis impersonation and the contrast between the hot Tina in a short short silver dress and the tomboy Anjali in red overalls! The title song is contemplative and beautifully picturized  sets the stage immediately for the conflict between these three characters. 5. The summer camp stuff is campy to the max  but who will not feel good about a bunch of kids singing dancing and having fun! 6. The supporting cast is actually very good  Farida Jalal as the Mum Anupam Kher Himani Archana even Johny Lever. The kids are a bit annoying  but aren't most film kids? 7. The acting  Shahrukh does extremely well in this film as the young man who is conflicted about his own feelings unable to sort them out unable to understand the difference between love and lust and in the end almost unable to express his true feelings when he does realize them. He also shows considerable maturity as the father the widowed son  this is a role that allows him to express a lifetime of personal growth and to do it well. Kajol is brilliant as the tomboy who grows up fast as the demure young woman who has always known her mind but never really expressed her feelings  good girls don't do that you know! She is consistently good throughout the film  maybe her best role opposite SRK. Rani is excellent as the sexy Tina even Salman is less annoying than usual.A word of warning to lovers of serious cinema  there is nothing for you here! But if you want to be entertained by a feelgood film then by all means rent it. If you do not hate SRK and Kajol you could even buy the film  you will watch it more than once! And if you show the film to your nonIndian average movie watcher friends they might get seriously addicted to Hindi cinema.".

At first I wasn't too sure about Kajol playing this part throughout the beginning of the movie I was thinking more for Priety to fit better for Anjali's role but later I find myself enjoying Kajol as Anjali esp. after she and Rahul met up again 8 years later. I also thought the part of Tina was written really very well and it fit the movie perfectly. Rani did a great job of portraying Tina and I can't think of a better actress who can play that part and do as well as Rani did. As far as Salman Khan I don't have anything negative to say. Although his role wasn't small his character impact was big and I got to say he pulled it off. Finally the role of Anajali Khannaamazing acting by Sana Saeed hands down.Overall I give this film an 8.610. It's a great movie to watch with the family so enjoy! You won't be left disappointed! ".

The music is awesome Shah Rukh is a good lipsincher but Kajol could brush up... and its quite obvious that they use the same voice for big Anjali Tina AND the grandmother whose REALLY funny btwAnyway the acting  Shah Rukh Khan is great as always but hes stereotyped as the weepy guy who gets the girl once again Kajol is a very good actress  I loved the way she looked in that black linka when her hair was really long Ronnie did great  her and Kajol are cousins you know i liked seeing them in this film together they are both very beautiful also I also thought that the little girl Sana Saeed that played young Anjali did a GREAT job heh HiSexy!    Salman Khan is VERY hot indeed but he can't act he's just there for his stunning good looks  big muscles hes kind of the Hindi equivalence to Keanu Reeves ... Other notable performances Anupam Kher as Mr.Malhotra was absolutely hilarious i was laughing so hard when he was asleep and Ms.Bridganza called him.. he woke up giggling like a little girl it was so funny. I'd recommend this movie to anyone of all ages some people will tell you this is is overrated but it's just NOT true this is a great movie... and  NEELAM ROCKS!".

Other notable performances Anupam Kher as Mr.Malhotra was absolutely hilarious i was laughing so hard when he was asleep and Ms.Bridganza called him.. he woke up giggling like a little girl it was so funny. I'd recommend this movie to anyone of all ages some people will tell you this is is overrated but it's just NOT true this is a great movie... and  NEELAM ROCKS!";

This is Karan Johar's debut film produced under YashRaj and Dharma Productions.The film starts off with Rani Mukherji's death and and a mourning ShahRukh Khan. The next scene is eight years later when their daughter is eight years old. We see that Shahrukh is still in love with his wife Tina Rani. On his daughter Anjal's eighth birthday she reads a letter from her mother telling her about Anjali Kajol who loved her father and was ShahRukh's best friend at collage. However after she learned that ShahRukh Rahulloves Tina she left the collage with no trace of her. Then Tina realized that Anjali loved Rahul too much and he would have probably loved her too. Here the flashback ends and little Anjali San Saed promises her mother that she will get her father and Anjali back together.In the next half Anjali tries to find out about Big Anjali and after some time she find her. But now Anjali Kajol has turned into a beautiful woman and she is engaged to Aman Salman Khan who loves her like anything but Anjali doesn't love him and she still hasn't forgotten Rahul.Watch this beautiful movie to see what happens in the end. The performances of all the actors is superb. ShahRukh and Kajol's chemistry can be seen again. I normally can't stand Salman Khan but i managed to like him in this. This movie has excellent music and funny jokes. A must watch.".

I love Kajol in this movie. She steals the show. I heard that Twinkle Khanna was actually considered as the first choice to play Anjali. That would have been the biggest mistake as I can't envision anyone else playing the role of Anjali besides Kajol.Shah Rukh Khan was also good. He was less irritating back then. His performance actually had some soul behind it. Rani was the perfect choice for Tina.Looking back at this movie now the only aspect that seems a bit redundant is the choreography. But you can't blame Farah Khan as things like dance moves revolutionizes with time.On a whole this is a beautiful piece of cinema and all I can say to Karan Johar and his entire cast and crew is thank.

But Tina knows that Anjali loves Rahul. And Anjali knows that Tina loves Rahul. But they both know that Rahul loves Tina. So Anjali goes away to USA. Tina marries Rahul and after delivering a baby dies. Now after 8 years its upto the daughter Anjali to unite Rahul and big Anjali. Salman Khan plays guest role as big Anjali's lover.SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERSame old boring story. Only the angle is different. I think kajol looked young and beautiful in the beginning when she was in the college scenario. She looked a good 10 to 15 years older when doing the USA Anjali part. Shahrukh is just the same. Good OVERACTING little comedian.  I just wish at least some director would realise his potential and give him some strong roles. Well Salman is just a goofy lover. I think Yash Johar chose him for his good looks ONLY. No acting talent there. Rani also I think is on a guest role. But she does her bit with absolute perfection. Now isnt that surprising !?!?!?Well I strongly recommend NOT TO WATCH this movie. But if you are a diehard Shahrukh Khan fan then......My verdict  DONT WASTE MONEYMy Rating  410".

Now isnt that surprising !?!?!?Well I strongly recommend NOT TO WATCH this movie. But if you are a diehard Shahrukh Khan fan then......My verdict  DONT WASTE MONEYMy Rating  410";

	schema:headline " Western parody including noisy action  songs  shootouts  musical numbers  entertainment and amusement";
	schema:reviewBody "Fun  hilarious and surrealist comedy by the famous and popular Spanish duo  Chiquito De La Calzada and Bigote Arrocet . Rightly enjoyable but middling and funfilled  milestone comedy which neatly combines humor  mirth  entertaining events and mayhem . The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes from the start to the ending with some lively touches . It deals with two drifters Chiquito De La Calzada  Bigote Arrocet meet a lost Naim Thomas boy who is looking for his dad . All of them join forces  then  the trio sets out in search for his father and scheme the discovery a golden mine called El Dorado De Manitu . Along the way the bad guys Maria Jose Nat  Aldo Sambrell of the band commanded by El Tuerto Julio Tejela encounter the peculiar trio and bury them  being stalked by hungry vultures . This is a slightly funny film with entertaining as well as bewildering events  giggles  craziness  twists and lots and fun . In Condemor there are pursuits  Indian attacks  Buffalo stampedes  crossfire  saloon brawls  cutthroats gunslingers and many others things . This bemusing movie is packed with tongueincheek  slapdash and slapstick  a steady stream of gags  lively situations abound  sheer belly laughs  crazy humor  too much fun and to be perfect for the kiddies and adolescents .The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable  with some moments frankly hilarious and others ridiculous and embarrassing . Humor is sometimes cheesy and grossout with some embarrassing and picaresque situations . As the silly vicissitudes of the starring are so repetitive and the most part results to be rich in absurdities and implausibilities . Filmmaker Alvaro Saenz Heredia often uses disconcerting and surrealist situations to give us a passable movie plenty of funny happenings  absurd incidents and many other things  and that  at least  kept me entertained for the almost half an hour of duration . The comedy and humor are interminable for that reason the viewers will laugh uncontrollably with the habitual quirky and lunatic characters . Amusing screenplay by Alvarez Saenz De Heredia  he usually writes his films . Duo protagonist is fun  Chiquito De La Calzada and Bigote Arrocet  both of them get sympathetic performances  though they give exaggerated interpretations . Although Chiquito De La Calzada steals the show with his known sentences Hasta Luego Lucas Te Das Cuen among others . Support cast is pretty well  including familiar faces  such as Maria Jose Nat as a beautiful bandit  Jose Yepes and Fabian Conde . Special mention for the illustrious secondary Aldo Sambrell who starred lots of SpaghettiPaella Westerns . Aldo appeared in his first spaghetti western in 1963 . Sambrell was perhaps best known for his gritty portrayals of scruffy bandit gang members in Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns For a fistful of dollars 1964 For a fistful of dollars more 1965 The Good  The Bad  and the Ugly 1966 . 1973. Sambrell gave a memorably chilling performance as ruthless bandit gang leader Mervyn Duncan in Navajo Joe 1966. He had a rare lead role as voodoo priest Gatenebo in the laughably lousy horror clunker Bloody voodoo 1974 and he played all kinds of genres . The motion picture was regularly directed by lvaro Senz De Heredia and it achieved big success at Spanish box office . Heredia directed various vehicles for popular comedians as Chiquito De La Calzada  Bigote Arrocet  Condemor  followed by Bracula Papa Piquillo  Emilio Aragon  Policia  Freddy  El Crupier  Andres Pajares  Hoz Y El Martnez  Javier Gurruchaga  R2 Caso Cadaver Sin Cabeza  and Martes Y Trece  Aqui Huele a Muerto  El Robo De La Joyoya . Alvaro is an specialist on comedies  as he has proved in  2010 Venganza Ira Vamp  2005 R2 Caso Cadaver Sin Cabeza  2002 Esta Noche no  2001 Corazn De Bombn  1998 Ppa Piquillo  1997 Brcula Condemor II  1996 Aqu Llega Condemor El Pecador De Pradera  1994 Una Chica Entre Un Milln  1992 Chechu y Familia . This raucous Western spoof is a Chiquito De La Calzada vehicle  if you like his crazy maniac performances  you'll enjoy this one".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely can film satire make you laugh and be worried about the future at the same time. Levinson's film does just that with a great cast and great writing this film succeeds.You may have noticed that many of the posts and reviews argue that this is not plausible. Obviously these posters do not realize that satire is supposed to be over the top and show what can happen in extremes and ironically this came out just after Clinton's sex scandal and is still relevant today with George W. and will continue to be regardless of the president. Also some may think it oversimplifies the public as idiots but this isn't true especially if they are being deceived and information is withheld. There are some implausibilities as in why no reporters went to Albania or how other countries didn't get involved other than denying the charges but these are small and even addressed in scenes with the rival candidates news reporters and even CIA head William H. Macy.Really I don't know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around. This is an American political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes on.OVERALL 910. Buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality.".

There are some implausibilities as in why no reporters went to Albania or how other countries didn't get involved other than denying the charges but these are small and even addressed in scenes with the rival candidates news reporters and even CIA head William H. Macy.Really I don't know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around. This is an American political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes on.OVERALL 910. Buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality.";

However for most of the way this is sharp biting and yes funny though when I first saw it I thought it was more accurate in its Hollywood satire than on its government satire.  Time of course proved me wrong.David Mamet will never be universally loved because not only does there seem to be a large group that doesn't get him but that thinks those of us that like him are degenerates.  Myself I happen to think he's one of the best playwrights and screenwriters working today though I'm split so far on his novels.  His writing may be highly stylized but I guess I'm in tune to the rhythms of his dialogue.  And he doesn't assume his audience is dumb rather he seeks to challenge them by asking you to come to your own conclusions rather than hit you over the head.  And he does that very well in this movie at the beginning we may think Conrad Brean and Stanley Motss are real sleazebags but at the end while we deplore the action they take of faking a war just for political ends we can't quite dismiss them either.Of course a lot of that has to do with the performances of Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman Anne Heche is also a standout as Winnifred Ames the increasingly bemused presidential aide.  DeNiro seems at first like a teddy bear here with his beard his hat and his bow tie but he transfers the energy associated with his more volatile roles TAXI DRIVER RAGING BULL GOODFELLAS et al to guile and street smarts here.  The way his eyes probe whoever he's talking to and the way he anticipates almost every verbal comeback the other person has demonstrates thathe can't anticipate every event of course but once he gets used to it he can.But the standout here is Hoffman.  There's been a lot of comment on Hoffman basing his character on Robert Evans.  My own theory is he read Lynda Obst's excellent book HELLO HE LIED which talks about the producer's role and simply played that.  I formed that theory because of his mantra whenever things go wrong This is nothing! especially when Winnifred reads him the riot act after their plane crashes.  There's a part in the book where Obst talks about having to argue budget with the studio and realizes it's all a game where they have roles to play she argues for more money the studio for less.  Just as Winnifred's role is to be pessimistic and Stanley's is to be optimistic.  And Hoffman never condescends to Stanley instead showing a talented maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his lifeF my life I want the credit! is one of the best lines of the film.  Contrary to his line this film is not nothing.".

To divert attention spin doctor Conrad Brean is called in to manage the fall out and hold it off for the 11 days till the election.  Conrad employs Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to produce a war in Albania to divert the media away from the real story.This was made before Clinton was accused of misconduct with Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent restart of military action in Iraq.  This seemed to give it a much greater feel of realism and much more credibility.  However even before this happened it was still a very sharp and very good satire on political spin but also managing to have a dig at Hollywood movie types. The story is told in a very stageplay fashion and is dialogue driven with very funny moments throughout.  It's not as terrifying as a real look at media manipulation could be because it chooses to be a comedy instead but it still makes plenty of valid points.The two leads are excellent at the head of an allstar cast.

This film doesn't make hugely serious points but it does make you think about how the media is used to shape public perception and make us think what those in charge want us to think.Overall a very funny very clever satire that has a great cast the only criticism being that it stretches it's point a little too far with the old shoe section.".

Prior to Wag the Dog my answer would be no but watching and now rewatching it for a second time in the past week this film could be watched today watched next year or even watched prior to the next four elections and it would continue to feel current real and modern in today's politicalcinematical world. The power of the dialogue the intense chemistry of the characters and the constant interruption of the television generation into the political world will continue to keep Wag the Dog out of the black hole of cinema  it will not be dated never forgotten and forever enjoyed. As we continue to allow CNN to give us our news this film will remain as vivid as America's apple pie.Act I The Chemistry of the Characters Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman could play chess for three hours and it would capture my attention from beginning to end. DeNiro is a powerhouse of an actor not just because he can play the tough gangster type but also because he can take a character like Brean and give us simple verbose and intelligent. His range can be seen throughout this film. He commands each scene that he is in focusing our attention on each of his words and lingering on his next move. In my eyes it is more powerful than Goodfellas or Casino because of his subtle nature. The scene that stands out for me in Wag the Dog that requires viewing for DeNiro's talent is that between CIA Agent William H. Macy and DeNiro discussing the honesty of the war on Albania. To me this shows the power of his talent.Jumping onto the other side of this film there is Dustin Hoffman. While DeNiro pulls his obvious strengths with this film Hoffman makes Wag the Dog more than just a political film. Listening to the commentary Hoffman discusses the fact that he nearly didn't make this film because he couldn't find Motss's character. Thankfully he did due to his compelling portrayal we are taken from political conspiracy cinema to this raw human drama. The final act was sublime due to both DeNiro and Hoffman's chemistry but also because we believed Motss' words. As audience members we wanted to see him tell his story knowing that he never would. It was the human element the Motss' true self that we were drawn to and Hoffman stayed true to those moments until the very end. This isn't your typical Hollywood happy film this basis itself on  albeit conspiracies  but honest conspiracies. Could you survive the greatest hoax ever and promise not to tell a soul? Surrounding these characters we had Willie Nelson Denis Leary Anne Heche Kirsten Dunst William H. Macy John Michael Higgins and  who could forget  Woody Harrelson. These are our players and they take us from scene to scene with the greatest of ease.Act II The Writing  the Directing David Mamet. Does anything else need to be said? Having been a full time follower of his work I was not surprised to see that it was his quickwitted words coming from our characters' mouths. It is the fastpaced level of intellectual banter that transforms Wag the Dog into the powerhouse that it is. It works because you finish watching the characters actions and it is the words you find yourself quoting for weeks after. Mamet's political punch to this film was reminiscent of Kubrick's ideas behind Dr. Strangelove. The two were films that were absurd but it was also the ideals that they were satirizing that makes both viewable today just as powerful as they were when they were released. Mamet's words with Barry Levinson's direction takes Wag the Dog into perfection. There are no heroes there are no villains and we know so little about the characters that it is simply the story or the words that pull us into this film. The beats are hit the angles are crisp and tight and our characters are perfection  possibly the best casting in years. With this in mind we have only the third act remaining  cause as everyone knows  there is always a third act! Act III The Final ThoughtOverall Wag the Dog is perfect. Very few films in my eyes fully carry the honor of being watchable at any time any decade or any political year  but Wag the Dog does. Watching with a group of friends I was surprised as to how many had not seen this feature remembering that it had been birthed nearly 11 years ago it still seemed surprising. Wag the Dog overturns those political conspiracy theories and makes you laugh think and realize the impact of our commercial media. It was enjoyable to hear the current terms like plumber and commercial president in this 1997 film boasting the truth that this film was made before its time. Looking back there are those that could complain about our premise being too clich that the same conspiracy theories have been done again and again but to me this was fresh. This entire film was fastpaced amazingly acted and media driven. In the commentary it is talked about how it is rumored that the media doesn't even check sources any further and this is a glowing example of that regime.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The story is probably familiar so I'll just summarize it. The president of the USA gets caught having sex with a teenage Firefly Girl and DeNiro and Heche hire Dustin Hoffman an old Hollywood hand to produce a distracting event like a war with Albania to flood the media and distract the public's attention for long enough 11 days for the president to be reelected.One thing after another goes wrong and each time Hoffman comes up with yet another colorful lie to extend the life of the story. The CIA publicly ends the war prematurely? No problem. This is NOTHING! cries Hoffman You ought to try shooting 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' when two of the four horseman die two weeks after the beginning of principal photography! No war? No problem. Hoffman invents a hero who was left behind in an Albanian prison camp. Every war has a hero. The man chosen to be the hero  Woody Harrelson  turns out to have spent the last twelve years in a military prison for raping a nun. Lies are piled upon lies.We all know that political spin is put on everything that happens in Washington. This movie came out in 1997 during Clinton's presidency but he never started a war to deflect criticism. And yet the way Levinson has directed it and the way the performers attack their roles it is almost completely believable that deceptions like this take place. Hoffman stretches his acting a bit but he is never so hammy that he is unbelievable as a Hollywood producer. Ramon bring me my veggie shake now. And They told me I couldn't make 'Moby Dick' from the point of view of the whale! He brings to the part some of the smoothtalking duplicity that he showed in Papillon and Midnight Cowboy. He glows with self satisfaction as he spells out his accomplishments to DeNiro. This is the greatest thing I've ever done bringing this war to a satisfactory conclusion. DeNiro But there was no war. Hoffman That makes it all the more difficult. Nobody else is in the least bit over the top. They play it the way Levinson directs it as a realistic straightforward story.

The whole thing is a  fraud and yet it's 100 percent honest! A victim of his own egotism Hoffman decides that he wants credit for the production and is perfunctorily disposed of having suffered a massive heart attack poolside. This was probably a funnier movie when it first appeared. President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp and all that. A war built on a string of lies seemed so outrageous that it was impossible to take a movie like this seriously. Well circumstances change. The movie is still a great success but my heart sank at the sight of the flagdraped coffin returning from Albania. The story seems equally outrageous now but in a very different sense of the word.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The story is probably familiar so I'll just summarize it. The president of the USA gets caught having sex with a teenage Firefly Girl and DeNiro and Heche hire Dustin Hoffman an old Hollywood hand to produce a distracting event like a war with Albania to flood the media and distract the public's attention for long enough 11 days for the president to be reelected.One thing after another goes wrong and each time Hoffman comes up with yet another colorful lie to extend the life of the story. The CIA publicly ends the war prematurely? No problem. This is NOTHING! cries Hoffman You ought to try shooting 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' when two of the four horseman die two weeks after the beginning of principal photography! No war? No problem. Hoffman invents a hero who was left behind in an Albanian prison camp. Every war has a hero. The man chosen to be the hero  Woody Harrelson  turns out to have spent the last twelve years in a military prison for raping a nun. Lies are piled upon lies.We all know that political spin is put on everything that happens in Washington. This movie came out in 1997 during Clinton's presidency but he never started a war to deflect criticism. And yet the way Levinson has directed it and the way the performers attack their roles it is almost completely believable that deceptions like this take place. Hoffman stretches his acting a bit but he is never so hammy that he is unbelievable as a Hollywood producer. Ramon bring me my veggie shake now. And They told me I couldn't make 'Moby Dick' from the point of view of the whale! He brings to the part some of the smoothtalking duplicity that he showed in Papillon and Midnight Cowboy. He glows with self satisfaction as he spells out his accomplishments to DeNiro. This is the greatest thing I've ever done bringing this war to a satisfactory conclusion. DeNiro But there was no war. Hoffman That makes it all the more difficult. Nobody else is in the least bit over the top. They play it the way Levinson directs it as a realistic straightforward story. None of the actors seems to know that he or she is in a comedy and it works very well.I don't think I'll mention any more of the gags because I don't want to spoil it. But it's hard to forget the scene near the end of the film when Hoffman is looking out the window at the funeral of Harrelson's character. Huge American flags the casket being carried by the men of the 303 invented for the occasion. Hoffman spreads his arms expansively and says to DeNiro  Look at it.

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood is sometimes able to produce satirical films that in retrospect appear to predict future developments in American politics. Being There' the story of a simple man whose homespun philosophy is taken for profound wisdom and who as a result becomes a candidate for President may look like a satire on the Reagan administration but in fact it was actually released in 1979 during the Carter years. Dave' which features a womanising President called Bill whose marriage is in trouble because of his adulterous relationships and his trimming of his radical principles came out in 1993 just after Bill Clinton had taken office. It must however have been planned well in advance and was presumably not actually intended as antiClinton satire but that is how it tends to come across today.Wag the Dog' is another film that proves to have been unintentionally prophetic. Shortly before an election the President is embroiled in a potentially explosive sex scandal which threatens to end his presidency in disgrace. In order to distract the public's attention his advisers concoct a wholly fictitious military crisis in the Balkans and hire a Hollywood producer to provide the necessary harrowing footage of war scenes. When the Albanian government protest that their country is not in fact at war the aides present this as a triumph of American diplomacy that has averted the threatened crisis and in order to keep the affair in the public's mind concoct a further subplot involving a supposed military hero in real life a convicted rapist in a military prison held prisoner by a rebel faction.All of this may seem very familiar but bear in mind that this film was made in 1997 two years before President Clinton faced with a potentially explosive sex scandal which for a time threatened to end his presidency in disgrace took America to war over a crisis in the Balkans. At least he didn't need to concoct a fictitious war. The parallels with the more recent Iraq war are perhaps less exact although the scenes involving the supposed hero Old Shoe' were strongly reminiscent of the ballyhoo surrounding Private Jessica Lynch.Like Being There' Wag the Dog' is not of course a work of social realism. In real life a simpleton like Chance could not become President without being found out and no administration could actually get away with inventing a bogus war. That's why they have to provide real ones.  In order to make a satirical point both films exaggerate prevalent tendencies in modern political life. Being There' among other things is about selfdeception Chance never pretends to be anything he is not but those around him deceive themselves by seeing him as what they want him to be. Wag the Dog' on the other hand is about political spin' and the deliberate deception of the public. Politicians try and deceive as many of the people for as much of the time as they think they can get away with and the media will go along with such deception for as long as it is in their interest.Wag the Dog' has some sharp points to make and there is a very good performance from Dustin Hoffman as the Hollywood producer Stanley Motss. Motss is recognisably suffering from status anxiety in its most acute form the form that afflicts the brilliantly successful and wealthy man who still feels undervalued by society and will do anything however unethical or even dangerous to his own safety to win public recognition. He complains that there is no Academy Award specifically for producers ignoring the fact that one is not needed because the producer traditionally receives the Best Picture award.Despite that however I felt that the film as a whole was not as sharp or as funny as it could have been. I think the reason is that it is basically a onejoke film once the war story has been exploded the plot tends to lose direction. The idea of concocting a wholly bogus war is a brilliantly surreal satirical conceit the idea of concocting a bogus hostage drama although more inherently plausible lacks the same inventiveness so the Old Shoe' scenes come as something of an anticlimax after what has gone before. I felt that Robert de Niro as the presidential aide Conrad Brean was less effective than Hoffman I have never thought that comedy is his forte and that he is at his best in serious roles. I may be judging unfairly as there are several of his comedies that I have not seen. I also felt that it was a mistake not to show the President in the film this may not be a realistic film but the idea that a spin doctor could create a fictitious war without even the President being aware of what is going on strains credibility past its limits. Moreover as we found out with Nixon and his attempted coverup of the Watergate affair the culture of spin involves our elected leaders themselves not just members of their staff. Overall the film had its moments but could have been better. 610.".

In that way this movie is comparable to Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.The main cast is very good. Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman are great in their second movie together Sleepers was the first which was also directed by Barry Levinson and they can now be seen together again in Meet the Fockers. It sounds weird but they really have some chemistry together. Anne Heche however at times irritated me and also isn't exactly the most talented actress I've seen. There also is a very good and entertaining supporting cast with actors such as Willie Nelson William H. Macy Woody Harrelson a still very young Kirsten Dunst and Craig T. Nelson in a uncredited role as 'enemy' Senator John Neal. Really entertaining are all of the Woody Harrelson sequence's they are highly fun and might very well be the best parts of the movie.A very fun entertaining movie with a realistic feel!

	schema:headline " Stinging political satire";
	schema:reviewBody "Barry Levinson has always been a director that yanks the rug out from under his audience when they least expect it. He starts his films off with a knowing grin that sets a playful tone and then the trap snaps and schit gets real in ways we didn't see coming. He never loses the lighthearted tone to his work though and even when things get decidedly grim there's always a winking light at the end of the tunnel that somewhat restores the airy note we rode in on. Wag The Dog walks this tightrope terrifically a buoyant political satire with dark flourishes in all the right places but a piece that knows it's place and when to pull up its britches and pad it's daring dark ending in surreal mannerisms that make it easier to swallow. When the U.S. President is caught up in a torrid sex scandal spin doctor Conrad Brean Robert De Niro is brought in to fix the situation using any means he can. His brilliant idea involves utterly fabricating a war with Albania in order to smother the affair and distract the American people using a shameless smokescreen. The scary thing is and not just for the film but the sad state of affairs in the states these days even that it works splendidly. Using the help of of eccentric Hollywoood producer Stanley Mottss Dustin Hoffman spacey songwriter Johnny Dean Willie Nelson spiffy 'Fad King' Denis Leary and head honcho politico Anne Heche Brean concocts an entirely false and unnecessary conflict just to facilitate the whims of their commander in chief. This is another film that eerily predicted the internet atrocities of the future which plague us today.

	onyx:emotionText "Barry Levinson has always been a director that yanks the rug out from under his audience when they least expect it. He starts his films off with a knowing grin that sets a playful tone and then the trap snaps and schit gets real in ways we didn't see coming. He never loses the lighthearted tone to his work though and even when things get decidedly grim there's always a winking light at the end of the tunnel that somewhat restores the airy note we rode in on. Wag The Dog walks this tightrope terrifically a buoyant political satire with dark flourishes in all the right places but a piece that knows it's place and when to pull up its britches and pad it's daring dark ending in surreal mannerisms that make it easier to swallow. When the U.S. President is caught up in a torrid sex scandal spin doctor Conrad Brean Robert De Niro is brought in to fix the situation using any means he can. His brilliant idea involves utterly fabricating a war with Albania in order to smother the affair and distract the American people using a shameless smokescreen. The scary thing is and not just for the film but the sad state of affairs in the states these days even that it works splendidly. Using the help of of eccentric Hollywoood producer Stanley Mottss Dustin Hoffman spacey songwriter Johnny Dean Willie Nelson spiffy 'Fad King' Denis Leary and head honcho politico Anne Heche Brean concocts an entirely false and unnecessary conflict just to facilitate the whims of their commander in chief. This is another film that eerily predicted the internet atrocities of the future which plague us today.

Viewed from today's perspective 2002 this movie is far more relevant than when it first appeared because it understands the politics of terrorism suitcase bombs the increased role of the CIA and at the end the need to go back to Albania nee Iraq and finish up the job.

	schema:reviewBody "I personally don't like the news. All news just takes stories and negatively embellishes the heck out of them. Wag The Dog somewhat supports my theory but it really shows how the news can fake things just to make themselves look good. Although the movie is about the news it's very concept can apply to all forms of mass media. Wag the Dog is a political satire. It's whole point is to show how manipulative media is and how gullible the public is. Barry Levinson has a knack for making feelgood movies so there's nothing too outrageous. The movie is about the President of the US who has sexual misconduct with an underage girl and breaks into the public two weeks before election. We never do see or hear him. Excellent move by Barry Levinson. De Niro plays a spin doctor who is determined to make the President look like a hero by creating a fictitious war with Albania. Why Albania? Albania is a very tiny country who many people have not heard of. De Niro gets a Hollywood producer Hoffman to help create the war by using fake stories and fake footage. The public buys it all. While watching this keep in mind that the movie is a satire. Kirsten Dunst is an actress who plays an Albanian victim in a battleground in the phony newsreel. Wouldn't her parents think That girl looks exactly like my daughter? Wouldn't headlines break about Albania's proof of denial of the whole war? As a satire no. The movie's main focus is to make you laugh. Sure it is unrealistic but that is where my mention of gullibility ties in. The stories are convincing the footage looks real as can be it is the biggest story in the country so why not believe it? The movie puts everything in perspective by having a wild crew make every little thing convincing. Make a Top 10 list of Hoffman and De Niro performances and movies Wag the Dog would appear on all of them. Hoffman was nominated for an Oscar for his role as a smoothsailing flamboyant producer. De Niro who I found to be just as good as Hoffman plays a cocky spin doctor who is very admirable. Both guys are very funny. It is also funny to see just how realistic and possible Wag the Dog is. Who's to say fakeness isn't used to cover things up? This was released one month before the ClintonLewinsky scandal. Anybody that knows that scandal could see the connection between that and this movie. If I could change anything in this film I would increase the clarity from Albania's side and add more to the news footage. Other than that the movie is very real and gets you thinking. What is real and what is fake? How smart are we?".

But Wag the Dog I am sad to say has a fatal flaw in common with most conspiracy theories its credibility ceases about five minutes after the opening credits. We are made to believe that every single person enlisted in Brean and Motss's project can be trusted to never say a word about this to anyone. Surely only dead men tell no tales but a trail of dead actors gaffers and special effects people would be noticed okay maybe not the actors. It's never made clear to us whether the war is completely fictional or its causes are fictional but the war is all too real. In the former case any journalist arriving in Albania would presumably notice a marked lack of US troops in the latter one would expect more in fact any footage of Brean threatening the careers of various generals.

He joins up with Hollywood producer Stanley Motss Dustin Hoffman and creates a war. Crisis averted but how long can they hold on? An important aspect to this is the lack of general compliance in the conspiracy theory. Dark meetings are held under the capital but the CIA aren't informed. The President is fully knowing of the buildup but becomes a primadonna performer too distracted with theatrics to play ball. Reporters are subjected to the power of suggestion but are willing to demand answers too.This movie shares thematic and stylistic connections with Levinson's latest film with de Niro What Just Happened? but Wag the Dog I think will stand the test of time much better. Oh and did I mention that it's hilarious? I almost forgotdeep belly laughs throughout.PolarisDiB".

An important aspect to this is the lack of general compliance in the conspiracy theory. Dark meetings are held under the capital but the CIA aren't informed. The President is fully knowing of the buildup but becomes a primadonna performer too distracted with theatrics to play ball. Reporters are subjected to the power of suggestion but are willing to demand answers too.This movie shares thematic and stylistic connections with Levinson's latest film with de Niro What Just Happened? but Wag the Dog I think will stand the test of time much better. Oh and did I mention that it's hilarious? I almost forgotdeep belly laughs throughout.PolarisDiB";

If the people who were there say this is a realistic account of events and emotions then that's the best accolade a film can have. I was scared and moved by it and would recommend it highly.

Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav. Randy wanted to see it. I reluctantly agreed I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films. He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia but all the technical details are wrong and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it. And about one and all he says It wasn't like that.He was silent through the film and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought. He said They finally got it. That's what it was like. All the details are right. The actors were just like the men I knew. They looked like that and they talked like that. And the army wives too they really were like that at least every one I ever knew. The he was silent for a long time. At last he said You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off? Something like that happened to me once. It was at a helicopter crash. I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off. It looked just like that too. I've never told any one about it. In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambushbut the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground. And in this it is extremely meticulous detailed and often horrifically successful. Neither Randy nor Inor any one in the theatre I could seewas bored by or dismissive of the film. It grabs you and it grabs you hard and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN which seems quite tame in comparison.Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job and they do it knowing the risks and they do it well in spite of the odds. Mel Gibson although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being is very very good as commanding officer Hal Moore and he is equaled by Sam Elliot Greg Kinnear Chris Klein and every other actor on the battlefield. The supporting female cast seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages is also particularly fine with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The script direction cinematography and special effects are sharp fast and possess a you are there quality that is very powerful.I myself had a criticism there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic newagey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place. And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle to be improbable and faintly absurd. But these are nitpicky quibbles. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie. I'll give Randy who served two tours of duty in Vietnam the last word It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie. I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie. But they pretty much get everything right. That's how it looked and sounded and that's what I saw and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen. Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "I was privileged to see a preview of Mel Gibson's new film We Were Soldiers based upon the book written by his real life character Lt. Col. Harold Moore along with Joe Galloway. I attended a showing along with numerous other Viet Nam vets and it would seem that there were as many opinions about the movie as there were viewers.  Like the war itself each person in attendance probably had some personal experiences that the movie brought back from that deep and sometimes distant place we have put them.The movie was almost overwhelmingly graphical but afterwards I realized this was instrumental in the telling of the story.  For the movie is truly about the leadership that Col. Moore brought to his men of the 1st of the 7th and his determination that they would not suffer the fate of the French in Viet Nam nor his own unit's most infamous battle that of Custer's Stand at Little Big Horn.It was his determination and commitment that his men be as highly trained as strongly molded as a unit and most importantly as well lead as possible that stands out. This determination is obviously rooted in his deeply abiding belief that military leaders shall never forget that when they lead men into war many of those men will never come back alive but that those who lead shall never abandon them even in their shared darkest hours.And while the movie highly succeeds in conveying the horror and tragedy that war is....has been...and always shall be it was more difficult for me to realize that our War Department and Army could have been so callous as to have delegated the responsibility of notifying nextofkin of the death of their loved ones to the local Yellow Cab company. Then I realized that in late 1965 it was all so new and no one knew that this war was going to grow and consume so many young American lives over the next nine years.The two most significant scenes in the movie for me were firstly the scene when the course of the battle teeters on the brink of either disaster or success and the most important communication that Col. Moore's superiors have to convey is that General Westmoreland would like for him to leave the battlefield and fly to Saigon so the general can have a briefing. This more than anything pointed out how tragically we were doomed to failure in Viet Nam due to the political will not the military will being in control. The second most significant scene was in the airport where one soldier is pushing his buddy through the concourse and the voice over says...They did not fight for God.....country.....right. They fought for each other a fact that every Viet Nam vet would attest to.This a movie worth seeing. It is another testament with a worthy cinematographic effort to the futility and absurdity of war and how that among madness can be greatness. It is a movie that will unlikely leave the viewer devoid of emotion.  What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal as the strength of their feeling.".

This determination is obviously rooted in his deeply abiding belief that military leaders shall never forget that when they lead men into war many of those men will never come back alive but that those who lead shall never abandon them even in their shared darkest hours.And while the movie highly succeeds in conveying the horror and tragedy that war is....has been...and always shall be it was more difficult for me to realize that our War Department and Army could have been so callous as to have delegated the responsibility of notifying nextofkin of the death of their loved ones to the local Yellow Cab company. Then I realized that in late 1965 it was all so new and no one knew that this war was going to grow and consume so many young American lives over the next nine years.The two most significant scenes in the movie for me were firstly the scene when the course of the battle teeters on the brink of either disaster or success and the most important communication that Col. Moore's superiors have to convey is that General Westmoreland would like for him to leave the battlefield and fly to Saigon so the general can have a briefing. This more than anything pointed out how tragically we were doomed to failure in Viet Nam due to the political will not the military will being in control. The second most significant scene was in the airport where one soldier is pushing his buddy through the concourse and the voice over says...They did not fight for God.....country.....right. They fought for each other a fact that every Viet Nam vet would attest to.This a movie worth seeing. It is another testament with a worthy cinematographic effort to the futility and absurdity of war and how that among madness can be greatness. It is a movie that will unlikely leave the viewer devoid of emotion.  What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal as the strength of their feeling.";

	schema:reviewBody "Saving Private Ryan' redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  Black Hawk Down' took the graphic violence to a new level with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR but of a duration that was almost unbearable.We Were Soldiers' is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood. In many ways I consider this to be the most complete of the three. WriterDirector Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart Pearl Harbor and the screenplay for this film takes the understanding of war to the next level by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films this film has the best workup the best character development and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences but introduces the NVA perspective the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.Based on real events this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD which presented the characters in a very anonymous way we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.Of course the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary. However Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like Pearl Harbor' which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure both to his children and his men. Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played so charismatic and heroic that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in The Contender' with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since Full Metal Jacket'.  I rated it a 1010. This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.".

Well this is it. The movie is nonstop action after the first fifteen minutes of character development is finished. Having experienced what it is like to be overrun by the NVA during the third week of my first VN tour I can tell you that this movie does an excellent job of showing the excitement tension exhaustion chaos and courage of an extended battle. While this is by no means the best war movie I have ever seen it is the first Viet Nam war movie which has provided me with a sense of satisfaction after leaving the theater. Mel Gibson turns in a good performance Sam Elliot is a bit stiff. The wives of the soldiers are believable. Including a bit of the NVA's attitude about the war adds a balanced flavor to the film. Overall I would say that you will experience at least a small part the intensity of war if you go to this movie. I took my female companion and she was shocked touched and thrilled with it. As Americans we need to remember that freedom is not and never has been free. It is always paid for with the blood of those who fight to get it sustain it or expand it. The politically correct may not like this film but then who cares what they like. Thanks for making this film Mel. I've been waiting over 30 years to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "We Were Soldiers is based on a real life battle of the Viet Nam war that took place in 1965 in a remote part of Viet Nam. It is based on a book by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway who are portrayed in the film by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper respectively. The film opens with a depiction of the 1954 slaughter of French troops by the Vietnamese army. Twenty one years later Lt. Col Moore Gibson and his battalion of 395 men are thrust unknowingly into the same hornet's nest consisting of some 4000 battle hardened Viet Nam regulars who have been fighting their enemies for many years.  Director Randall Wallace tells the story from three perspectives. Firstly from the viewpoint of the Americans. Outnumbered ten to one they face impossible odds. How Col. Moore rallies his troops and gets them to pull together as a team is a central theme of the picture. Secondly the story is told from the viewpoint of the wives and families left behind and the problems they have to deal with. Lastly the Vietnamese army is shown not as unfeeling monsters but as a professional army defending their beliefs and territory. The battle scenes are as realistic and convincing as any war movie that you will ever see. We suffer through the casualties both on the battlefield and at home along with the participants. The special effects are seamless and exciting. Mel Gibson gives a convincing performance as Moore and if you watch the DVD you can see the amazing similarities between the two men. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore and Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan two of the wives who take on the unenviable task of delivering those dreaded telegrams to the widows from the War Department. Chris Klein plays Russell's husband Jack a new officer and father. His scene with Gibson in the base chapel is memorable. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Crandall the head of Moore's helicopter fleet. Don Duong is very effective as the Vietnamese commander. But acting cudos go to veteran Sam Elliot as the crusty Sgt. Major Plumley. We Were Soldiers is a gripping Viet Nam war drama told in a way that reflects ALL of the participants in an impartially realistic way. As Hank Moore says on the DVD They finally got it right.".

To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda you obviously didn't watch the movie hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film.

I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda watch almost any John Wayne movie or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men  on both sides. Yes the only way we survived that battle was superior technology but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies not the film! If you want to get picky then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris who is retired and was there says so. Even my exboss and a couple other friends who were either at that battle or at Nam said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.My apologies to everyone else for that rant.".

The film also takes the viewer into the home of the soldier. It invades the private life of the loved ones at home. We feel as though we are a part of the family in one scene and the buddy of a fallen soldier in the next. A wife child friend of a soldier gone to war to fight for an ungrateful nation one minute and the next the brave and loyal soldier. This moving and true story will take its viewer and bestow upon them a closer understanding and a greater respect and gratefulness for our nation's true heroes.";

SGM Plumley was a soldier's soldier with five combat jumps in three wars and an astounding three combat infantry badges. LTC Moore was the sort of leader who could keep his head and lead his troops through the worst of battle. People who complain of clichs in this movie might as well complain that people in 18th century movies wear threecornered hats.To those looking for an antiwar message it is there. When Moore goes to Division headquarters and gets his mission he asks about projected enemy in his area of operations. The staff officer standing next to the general says a manageable number. To this Moore responds with words to the effect of which means you have no idea. It turns out that Moore's battalion gets dropped on top of a vastly larger enemy force if I remember correctly they get dropped right next to an NVA brigade. Ordinarily it order to assure success in attack you want to have three times the numbers of your enemy. In this case the ratio was 41 going the other way. Then the battle is about how artillery and air support makes up the difference in numbers.The obvious criticism here is that the command was fumbling around in the dark. At the end of the movie the names of the 70 men who died are prominently displayed on the screen. A military mind is not treasonous and will not disrespect its superiors but it will let facts speak for themselves.The next comment is only tangentially related to this movie. However many voices here have taken the opportunity to vent their views on Vietnam so I feel compelled to put things in a broader historical context. There was a war that did not take place between 1945 and the fall of the Berlin wall. It would have been called WWIII. The Soviet Union and the US stood eyetoeye for 40 years but did not blink. It was an ideological conflict with an evil that meant death to 50 million people in communist countries in this century. It was conflict with a system that vastly constrained freedom. Fortunately for the world the US finally prevailed. The struggle fought between communism and the west was fought in a variety of ways in public relations in sports in propaganda and in a series of proxy wars. In Korea Greece Vietnam Afghanistan and a variety of smaller stages East contested with West. To the people caught up in these local conflicts these wars were absolute tragedies. However in the grand scheme of things these conflicts pale to insignificance when compared to the 500000000 who would have died in WWIII.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to stand out and be a unique war film. They've been making war films pretty much since the invention of film it seems. So you would think by now that it's all been done before and for the most part it has. Yet We Were Soldiers manages to separate itself from the pack and give us a unique take on one particular battle in one particular war. Depicted here is the first major battle involving American troops in the Vietnam War. The fact that this battle takes place in what is known as the Valley of Death tells you all you need to know about what awaits the men who head into combat.The central figure in the movie is Lt. Col Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson. Moore leading the 7th Cavalry will train his men and lead them into whatever hell awaits them. The film begins back home as Moore assembles his new unit and begins to whip them into shape. Here we learn much about what makes Hal Moore tick and begin to see him for the true leader of men he is. These opening scenes are important as they show many of Moore's motivations and also the obstacles which are placed in his way. The time back home also allows us to see Moore the family man with his strong stoic wife played by Madeline Stowe and their young children. We also meet other key characters. There is Moore's secondincommand battletested Sgt. Maj. Plumley played with wonderful gruffness and all the appropriate seriousness by Sam Elliott. There is helicopter pilot Bruce Crandall played by Greg Kinnear and young Lt. Jack Geoghegan played surprisingly well for someone who came to prominence in a silly farce like American Pie by Chris Klein. But the key figure throughout is undeniably Moore and Gibson's strong confident portrayal is a key to the movie's success.While important in establishing the key characters and the emotional ties that bind them to each other and those whom they are leaving behind the opening scenes back home have a feeling of just biding time about them. The film really takes off when the 7th Cavalry is dropped into the Valley of Death and confronts the overwhelming enemy force which awaits them. The rest of the film deals with this one epic unrelenting battle. It sounds clichd but the battle scenes are so well choreographed and photographed that you do truly feel as if you are there. The intensity of the conflict jumps off the screen. The focus is on the valor and heroism of the American soldiers but unlike so many war films which present a nameless faceless enemy we also get to see things from the Vietnamese perspective. We see the enemy leaders detailing their strategy and also are presented with reminders that the Americans are not the only ones with loving concerned families back home. We see the toll on both sides not just for the soldiers but perhaps most poignantly in scenes intercut from home where soldiers' wives wait to learn the fates of the men they love.We Were Soldiers is a brutally honest unflinching look at the hell that is war. It is a story which begged to be told. Seeing as it is adapted from a book by two of the central figures in the conflict Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway who found himself thrust into the middle of the conflict and who is played wonderfully by Barry Pepper in the film you can rest assured that unlike so many other war films this one would focus on getting it right. The film tells it as it truly was. It is at times invigorating and inspiring and at other times truly heartbreaking. All in all it is a fitting tribute to as the film states at the beginning the men on both sides who died in that place.".

Well so many great things have been said about the movie and I can't think of anything negative to mention so I can't relate to those who did if you have seen the movie you'll know that most of the negative reviews here are bullsht.Anyway I want to point out the scene where Mel was leaving his home. That entire scene was eerily effective I could really feel the impending danger he will face every hair on my body was rising! I liked the way the camera panned very quickly when he turned to face the road as if Mel said this is really sad but I have work to do. I think that entire scene was very very well set up. And when the action started the tension never stopped! I now really have to read the book because I find the tactical warfare very interesting.Anyway I saw something interesting while watching the movie. There's this teenager sitting beside me and I was really sorry for him because he probably didn't know what he came in for. When the war action started his eyes were really popped out! I swear to god I could have picked them with ease! His arms were gripping the armrest so hard and half his body slightly leaning forward. He was difficult not to notice even by the side of your eyesight because he looked shocked as hell. When I tried to quickly look at him just to see if he's still breathing he got embarrassed and leaned back to his chair. Five mins. later he was back in the same position. He was probably around 16 or 17 yrs. old so I realize that age might not be the right age to see it.What really amazes me is how the movie was able to convey the chaos and horror of the war when it actually they didn't seem to use too many CGIeffects. I look so much like the REAL THING!Definitely now on top of my list of war movies.And I have seen A LOT.".

It also tells the story from the wife of the col. who receives the telegrams of the dead soldiers.There are moments of action which are needed in a war movie. The actionmoments are good and the special effects look real. There are also moments of drama so the movie does not have full action only which is good to stay concentrated. But the drama does not hurt the movie because there's not to many of it.Overall it's a movie which keeps your focus to the last minute. It's not the best war movie ever but you should certainly see it. Not only because of the very good acting of Mel Gibson.".

It  so hard to comprehend what happened. Not just to the 7th as the first to Fight but for all 58000 who died and those who were wounded and survived with so many kinds of scars.The brutality and reality of war had to be close to the real thing. Gut wrenching and shocking but they handled it well. It doesn't need to be more real. The messages were all clear.  Including how inept their command and intelligence structure were. NO ONE Was truly prepared except the Vets who went. And they went in anyway. Think about it.Mel should be nominated for Best Actor. The Movie should be for best picture. Best Director as well. There were way too many good supporting performances to pick just one.I vividly remember the Draft Lottery in High School.  I was lucky and drew a high number.  But I can't count how many times I've wondered what may have happened with a lower number. It angers me still to know how some in our country treated those young men and women returning alive. Shame is the only word kind word that comes to mind. A movie worth seeing if you have a strong stomach. Whatever events were altered for the Cinema can't overshadow the final result.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much from this film because many of the reviews I'd read at the time of its release argued that it and the book it was based on were retrograde. The US soldiers provide the heroes and the North Vietnamese the villains. But it wasn't nearly so simple as that.Obviously it's been heavily influenced by Saving Private Ryan at least in one respect. It's even gorier than SPR. If a phosphorous grenade explodes we see the Grunt with the flaming stuff stuck to his skin and clothing burning holes into him and we see a buddy cutting away the burning flesh of his cheek with a knife. When a Grunt is caught in a friendlynapalm blast he really burns and afterward his charred flesh is blackened so that when a buddy tries to take his legs and pull him towards a Medivac the flesh of both legs from the knees down peels off into his buddy's hands. And of course there is squib charge upon squib charge exploding in slow motion an unfortunate clich by now.One wonders just in passing how far this trend towards realistic gore can go  and what the purpose behind the trip is. Well it can't go much farther than it has. It seems just a short time ago that MASH had one shocking scene in it  a wounded soldier in a hospital whose arterial blood pumped out of his body towards the surgeon. Actually it was more than thirty years ago. But our cinematic carnage has progressed by leaps and bounds. MASH was an early milestone. So was Bonny and Clyde which introduced slowmotion death to American movies. Saving Private Ryan was a shocking blood bath. Now we have Blackhawk Down with a stillliving soldier whose lower half has been blown away. And now there's We Were Soldiers.As for WHY there has been such an increase of realism in violence well that's a different question whose answer can only be guessed at. Many cinematic movements like this one seem to follow a trajectory in which each film must outdo the previous examples of the genre. If gore is good box office then more gore is even better box office. There may be a sincere desire on the part of the producers to show combat as it really is but like all motives this one may be mixed with some commercial interests thrown into the stew. And the motives of the audiences who turn these films into marketable products? It would be nice to think that they leave the theaters having learned something about the results of combat. But if that's the case we don't seem to be showing much evidence of having grasped the lesson. In a sense sensational gore cheapens and degrades the experience of the men and women who have lived through these extreme situations. So much suffering brings tears to the eyes especially when we see the survivors visiting graves and monuments after the battle as we do both here and in Saving Private Ryan. And then having wept the audience leaves the theater and embraces the next war. The arousal jag is over. Good intentions when viewed from a slightly different angle have an uncanny way of resembling exploitation.Okay. Enough philosophy. The movie is better than I'd expected it to be the excess of gore and the slowmotion clichs aside. I was also confused by the topography although locations are clearly labelled. Where exactly is the creek bed? There isn't much in the way of homefront scenes but what there is neatly reflects the anxiety and pain of those left behind. The combat scenes are exhausting. A few hundred Americans opposed by some four thousand regulars of the North Vietnamese army. About the same ratio of Americans to adversaries as General Custer faced only he had no air support. Custer is brought up several times. But most important this is the first film I can remember seeing about the Vietnam war in which the enemy is presented as something other than outright evil. There is a good deal of irony in the movie. Mel Gibson prays before the battle. Take us under your wing and so forth he asks. Then throws in Ignore those pagans praying to a different God. Much later in the film long enough for us to have forgotten Gibson's racist plea the commander of the North Vietnamese army is also seen praying  presumably to the same God. And one of the NV soldiers is humanized to the extent of keeping on his person a diary written to his wife. The soldier wears glasses so we can tell him from the other North Vietnamese and remember him. He dies heroically and when the Americans take the diary from his body and flip through it they find a picture of his wife a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gibson's wife played by Madeleine Stowe. We win the battle Ia Drang of course but even this is undercut by irony. The NV commander looks at the piles of bodies after the Americans leave. He shakes his head and says What a tragedy. The worst part of it he muses is that the Americans will treat this as a victory and the war will go on to its necessary end although now it will mean just that many more deaths.Should you bother watching this? I think so. This one would have been a true original if it had appeared twenty years ago.".

Unfortunately most of them are largely philosophical and don't paint the American soldier in a very positive light. The film makers usually take a leftist position towards the government and try to use the conflict on the ground as some sort of metaphor for the existential purpose of life. Thus we get subjected to films like Apocalypse Now Platoon and Casualties of War. Although those film makers are certainly free to show us these interpretations of Vietnam it gets old seeing our military trashed and our brave soldiers painted as drugged up sadists who were fighting for an immoral cause.From the beginning you could tell We Were Soldiers is something different. It clearly shows the American soldier as what heshe usually is Professional brave intelligent and resourceful. There are no higher moral questions draped over this film. We simply see war as what it truly is. It is a conflict built up in the minds of our governments and carried out on the battlefield by our soldiers. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ultimately it is just about the man next to you and the men you're fighting against. We Were Soldiers focuses on this and this alone. The Ia Drang battle scenes which take up most of the screen time are ferocious. Mel Gibson shines as Col. Moore. He is the ultimate personification of masculinity. He ignores repeated requests for him to leave the battlefield as his troops are cut off and outnumbered. He seems to take the loss of each man personally as each commander should do. The combat footage is very graphic. This is not a film for those with weak stomachs.This film also gives us another thing other Vietnam War films are reluctant to even touch. It shows us behind the scenes footage of the North Vietnamese Army planning their assaults and evaluating American tactics. It's about time some movie showed the human side to the NVA. They are usually portrayed as heartless soulless savages. This is ridiculous. They were family men who took just as much pride in a job well done as our own troops.We Were Soldiers is an experience you won't soon forget. It is the pinnacle of what a war film should be. Not much time wasted on politics or existential philosophy. It is simply a graphic a realistic portrayal of war. For the soldiers on the battlefield it isn't a matter of politics or a question of should we be here or not. What it comes down to is this you have to kill your enemy or he will kill you!4 12 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the trailers this looked like just another war movie starring Mel Gibson. At first glance I thought it was just a generic war flick. How wrong I was. I'm glad I'm not one of those people who shuns movies just because of lack of interest. That is how I got to loving movies like the Matrix and Desperado. This movie caught my eye because Mel Gibson is great in everything he's in but again this looked like another war movie that wasn't as deep as its older brothers. We Were Soldiers separates itself from Mel's other War flicks. While Braveheart and the Patriot focus on one soldier and his life along with several battle scenes We Were Soldiers focuses on the lives of many soldiers their families even one of the Viet Cong soldiers as their lives are affected in a deadly battle.This film takes place in the Vietnam War the only war we ever officially lost. The first half hour revolves around training the troops... basically the exposition. Soon after they fall into battle. This battle makes up most of the movie. This isn't necessarily bad. For people who like seeing blood and guts you will love this movie. Those who want to see some story you will also love this movie. In fact the acting was done so well in We Were Soldiers that I nearly burst into tears in the end in sympathy for a Viet Cong soldier. That's another reason why this movie is so great. While some movies portray the other side to be barbaric and want to spill our guts We Were Soldiers actually gives the Viet Cong soldiers feelings. Even the leader who was shouting out orders to kill us all... Our leader was doing the exact same thing. However we only see the Viet Cong leader being barbaric because they are the antagonists. That I highly disagree with. If you should see this movie keep in mind that the antagonists are NOT the Viet Cong but the war itself. This movie as generic and unoriginal as the trailers made it seem was oneofakind and if you have not seen it yet make it a point to. It pays tribute to all the fathers brothers husbands and sons who died in 'Nam. Braveheart and the Patriot are better but this one should not be looked down upon. On a scale 110 10 best I give We Were Soldiers about a 15. Soldier DISMISSED!".

Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? Thats the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you cant help but be reminded of these two films .First of all whats with that Scottish lament thats played three times in the movie  four if you count the end credits ?

Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like  Theyll never take our freedom  The hell they will  and its impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movieWhen not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs  its based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice  it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in IndoChina but if thats the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French IndoChina war  indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied  he had nothing to learn from the French  Who havent won a war since the days of Napoleon  so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie  when in 1965 the American high command  brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . Its like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are  but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960sTheres a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to whos been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise were not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesnt strike me as much of a director  and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming  Tell my wife I love her  . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here theres no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising  and hes not the only character to mouth the words  Tell my wife ...  while mutilated or dying  I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? Ive no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservationsI sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW  PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water  I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET  I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER  and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to begin my defilement of this work because it's really rotten to the core. One word best sums it up and that is CONTRIVED. Every single scene is fabricated to be sentimental propaganda in step with current trends and political correctness. Even Spielberg couldn't reach these heights of notsosubliminal American gungho all supported by a vulgar soundtrack that tells you exactly what to feel and when to feel it.Also I hear this movie is based on a book. I can't for my life believe that the book is as boastful and selfindulgent as this nonsense. Mel Gibson's character is nothing short of Jesus himself  he's a wonderful father and husband and a godfearing Christian who only fights to keep his Family safe from the Twin Evils of Communism which indeed is a pestilence but that's beyond the obvious and Heathendom. On the battlefield he'll know no fear will always be the first in line for a bullet and will gladly sacrifice himself for his imperial comrades. And on and on. Every other soldier is also a family man and Protector of Democracy Baseball and Jockstraps. Well all except Sam Elliott's character who is supposed to be a Tom HighwaySergeant Hartman clone only humourless.Let's just list some of the most deplorable scenesGibson praying in church with a fellow officer telling him that God is on their side. Gibson praying with his children and cuddling with his wife. Gibson explaining to his daughter what a war is and how they are the good guys In God We Trust. Gibson's speech about brotherhood in his unit and how he will sacrifice himself this scene is really too laughable for words it has to be seen to be believed. Gibson after the war saying that his only regret is that some of the men under his command died and he did not.The soldiers' wives are generously portrayed. They are in the movie for the sole purpose of receiving notes whenever their husbands have died. Again to show that they have sacrificed themselves for their families. A tear spent is a dollar earned.The scene when Gibson returns from the war and his wife only sees a cab stopping outside fearing it is a death note for her. Pathetically predictable and melodramatic.And then we have the laundromat scene which has probably the most forced PC dialogue I've ever seen. Are we supposed to believe that an American woman in the '60s and I believe in the South? had not heard the term Whites only before?As for the war scenes have you ever noticed how German and Vietnamese soldiers always die instantly but American soldiers always live on for 30 another seconds? Just enough for a violin piece his comrades holding his hands as the lights in his eyes flicker and go out and of course a glorious parting line.And the death scenes here are truly fabricated beyond ridicule. Everyone accepts death with a smile and no fear whatsoever. One dying soldier says I feel privileged to die for my country TWO say Tell my wife I love her one is dramatically shot dead just as he heroically lifts his wounded comrade onto a helicopter and yet another has his newborn's name flaunting about  just so we are reminded that he's one of the good guys and that we should be extra sad when he dies because he died to protect them another unwritten rule of Hollywood war movies is that whenever someone shows a picture letter or something to that effect of a loved one  he will die.And propaganda aside even strictly as a war movie it falls flat. The movie knows full well that it is dishonest and preys on sentimentality that is has no plot to speak of that is has only the most rudimentary strategical and tactical elaborations and that it is completely devoid of characterization let alone character development!. So it goes for the graphic and macabre instead  faces burning with napalm etc. This is what can be expected because the movie was obviously made for the very easily impressed the drooling mass that WANTS to be told what to feel and think because it's easier than doing it themselves.Pathetic.".

There are great transitions effective dynamic time warping speed up or slow down a shot like a bullet flying through the air and if you thought Maynard Zed and the Gimp were bizarre in Pulp Fiction wait until you meet the creepy married couple who through their sick hobby make every other evil character in this film look like Buddhist Monks. It's a fast furiouslypaced film certainly aptly titled. A great cast beginning with Paul Walker and Vera Farmiga. And certainly the main kids stand their ground especially Cameron Bright. Also worth mentioning is the end title sequence animated by Gary Hebert. Bottom line if you were disappointed by films like Kill Bill and Sin City films you really wanted to like but found them too cartoonishly clichd you'll be more than satisfied with Running Scared.

Five years ago this film would've been toned down by whichever studio released it in order for it to receive the lowest certificate possible.

One of these weapons with particular value over all the others falls into the hands of his son's best friend and is used to startling effect. Here is where the real fun starts. Joey can find neither the child nor the weapon in question and he has only 18 hours before either the police the Russian mafia or his own employers catch up with him.Walker is surprisingly impressive considering the strictly onedimensional roles he played in movies such as The Fast And The Furious and Into The Blue. Here he plays Joey as someone well aware of his impending death should he fail and throughout he is totally watchable and believable. No more will audiences giggle to themselves every time he delivers a dud of a line.The story occasionally flags particularly in the middle of the film but Kramer is not afraid to play with the camerawork to keep the audience's attention  whippans CSIstyle extreme closeups super slowmotion sepia filters and colour bleaching are all used to give the film a gritty and somewhat unique look  take for instance the kitchen shooting about half an hour into the film played from multiple viewpoints in both forward and reverse.The film's charcoaldark tone may be too relentless for some viewers and the paedophilia subplot could be considered as taking things one step too far but as long as you've got a strong stomach and can face hearing lashings of creative swearing there's a lot of enjoyment to be found here. Unbearably tense visually inventive and superbly acted from start to finish Running Scared is the first real surprise of 2006  it pulls no punches and thrills from its excessively bloody opening to its foulmouthed conclusion.".

Drug addicts hookers mobsters wife beaters pedophiles crooked cops and pimps cross the path of Oleg and Joey as they run through the city looking to stay alive. Tarantino comparisons will abound as with any clever and violent film these days but Wayne Kramer imprints Running Scared with his own wonderful style. I watched Richard Roeper give this a thumbs down by saying that Kramer throws in everything but the kitchen sink I wholeheartedly agree but consider that a compliment. The climactic finale that takes place in a hockey rink starts off reminding me of one of my favorite scenes from another cult classic Philip Kaufman's The Wanderers which was derived from The Hustler but it only starts off there and then it becomes perhaps the best all out violent mess that has ever been filmed. I can't say enough about this film. I even thought Paul Walker was terrific. He shows promise that he has never shown before by eschewing the pretty boy shtick. I just watched the film a second time upon it's DVD release which is something I seldom do and I realized that Kramer views the film as a fairy tale. The evil characters are so over the top. They are the creatures of the night that populate our nightmares as opposed to the evil actually populating the streets. The film is about legends and myth. If the bad guys are the ones portrayed in the film the good guys are John Wayne. If this sounds a little strange just watch the ending credits carefully.People will discover this film. It is pure testosterone. But it sure kicks ass. I liked Wayne Kramer's the Cooler a lot as a simple character piece. I also enjoyed Mindhunters more than most but now I anxiously await his next film. I think Wayne Kramer is going to create a great body of work over the next few years.".

The action in this movie is nonstop and it keeps you guessing up to the very end. I enjoyed how the movie was shot with New Jersey as a backdrop the movie covered a lot of ground and used various locations that added to the intrigue. This movie provides a nice twist on modern day mob movies.

It reminded me of Training Day the way the story unfolded while we went along for the ride. The plot is freaking awesome and I can't wait to get the DVD. An AWESOME movie!! Definitely must watch this again. The thing to remember when you watch this movie is that it's a ride just sit and enjoy it. I've never felt a need to promote a movie but this one is too good to let others miss it. It is painful to watch in some scenes and at times you're actually totally disgusted once you figure out what's going on. It's crazy the emotions that this movie brings out.".

I was enticed throughout the entire movie and it kept me from yawning. I loved the story the characters and the twists and turns this movie provided.The acting was quite good and believable. Paul Walker impressed me in this one and I ate up the gangster and cop stereotypical roles as well. The kids did well also except the main character's son is a bit annoying simply because he never listens to his parents but this is not due to his acting but the character he plays.I went to see the movie last night and the theater was completely empty! Either people don't see movies on Saturday nights anymore or people didn't feel that they wanted to see this film. I have no idea why. It's a shame like most other reviewers have pointed out that this movie did not do better at the box office.Go see this if you like action movies with an interesting plot.".

And as far as I knew it was a remake of the movie with Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines. Well it's not! It's actually a rather bizarre actioner. I'll get to that in a minute.First of all if you are kind of annoyed at the lack of good oldfashioned Rrated action movies these days then this film will definitely set the balance straight. There are many many MANY gory and even sometimes shocking deaths in this film that make A History of Violence look like an episode of Sesame Street.It plays like one of Robert Altman's multistory character dramas. At the very beginning we are treated to a bloody gunfight in a motel room after a drug deal goes sour. Head thug Tommy 'Tombs' Perello Johnny Messner instructs henchman Joey Paul Walker to dispose of his gun. He was going to right after dinner but the battered kid next door nicks it to shoot his abusive father and legs it across Brooklyn. Joey must then find him and make up a story to prevent a zillion plot threads involving crooked cops rival Mafia families evil pimps child rapistskillers from snapping.The gun itself is a curious MacGuffin. It passes through the hands of many people who's lives all connect. There doesn't seem to be any main story as the film spends equal amounts of time developing every one and although it seems interesting it also feels like loads of different films crammed together. It's constantly meandering and going in another direction and revealing twist after twist. Yes it keeps the film interesting but by the time the main twist comes at the end you're too exhilarated too care. Running Scared is probably one of those films that improves upon repeat viewings.Besides the schizophrenic story what really brings the film down to a slightly aboveaverage experience is the fact that director Wayne Kramer uses every editing technique he can think of despite whether they are appropriate or not. They may be technically impressive but they lack class and pull the film into a kind of Michael BayArea where it doesn't belong.I was also kind of weary of the fact that it headlines Paul Walker. I've never liked any of the teenoriented movies he's been mugging in but I have to say that this is definitely his most demanding role yet and he tries really really hard to convince. But I'm still undecided about him. If he can pull off this kind of this kind of role again and ditch the prettyboy image I'll forgive him for previous crimes.But the highlight of the movie is Cameron Bright who plays Oleg the abused kid. He's a way better childactor than Dakota Fanning and can express loads of different emotions even with a blank face. The amount of nasty stuff his character goes through is probably unfamiliar and difficult for a childactor to understand but he handles it extremely well and his scenes with Paul Walker are faultless.Don't put the lack of publicity for this film put you off. It's not perfect but it's far from being a failure. Like I said it'll probably be better on a second viewing but the first one will still be a thrilling experience.".

Then top it all of with child molesters glow in the dark hockey players and Paul Walkers favorite roll  the undercover cop. The film makers must have just sat down and said We should put every cool thing we've ever seen in an action movie and put it in ours that will be awesome. Well they were wrong Running Scared is more comical then thrilling. If Will Ferrel played Paul Walkers roll this would have been the comedy of the year.Now I have no problem using the F bomb but it can't be in every sentence. Its like a 17 year old kid with a drinking problem wrote this movie. Get out your high school English book and use some other words.One note to Paul Walker never fake an accent again. You sound retarded.And I'll F'ing smack the next F'ing guy that compares this F'ing movie to great F'ing movie like Training F'ing Day.".

The film makers must have just sat down and said We should put every cool thing we've ever seen in an action movie and put it in ours that will be awesome. Well they were wrong Running Scared is more comical then thrilling. If Will Ferrel played Paul Walkers roll this would have been the comedy of the year.Now I have no problem using the F bomb but it can't be in every sentence. Its like a 17 year old kid with a drinking problem wrote this movie. Get out your high school English book and use some other words.One note to Paul Walker never fake an accent again. You sound retarded.And I'll F'ing smack the next F'ing guy that compares this F'ing movie to great F'ing movie like Training F'ing Day.";

Instead he hides the gun in his basement where his son  the son's best friend are hiding. Moments later there are shots fired at the son's friends house there the stepfather is shot in the shoulder and the kid is running scared. From there we meet a bunch of colorful characters the Kidwith his stolen gun bumps into a crackhead a pimp the cops his step dad child abductors The Mob and his mother blows up at the end.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not quite sure why I went to see this film It has been poorly marketed apart from the slightly misleading trailers on t.v. I have seen no other advertising for it and the fact that I could not find one single review for it was entirely off putting. However I went along with a friend who is not a big action movie fan and was more unsure than myself of what we where going to see. What we did see was one of the most shocking gripping disturbing and quite frankly oddest films we've seen in a while. Paul Walker who by the way was on top form and giving his best performance to date plays a bottom of the ladder criminal. Walker is told to get rid of a 'hot gun' that was used to shoot a 'dirty cop' during a drug deal gone wrong. He stashes it in his basement without the knowledge that he is being watched by his son and his son's friend Oleg played by the staggering Cameron Bright. Oleg steals the gun and shoots his own abusive father with it. Oleg inturn goes on the run it is then a race against time for walker who needs to get the gun back so it can't be traced back to him or his goons. This film has a very original feel to it whilst at the same time borrowing from recent directors. For example the action sequences are superb but look like they've been pulled from a John Woo movie. When the action and shocks stop the film does drag a little. It feels like the writer had a load of different ideas for scenes in his head but wasn't quite sure how to sow them together. So what you left with is a film that is excellent in parts drags in others and has some surprising moments of genius. Quite how well some of the delicate subject matter is going to be received is left to be seen but I just hope that Running Scared is not dismissed as another action movie Paul walker vehicle it is not without it's fault's but it does not deserve to be ignored.".

Paul Walker plays a tough talking' New Jersey low level mobster with a dislike for Russians and proper grammar...and thank God it's Paul Walker otherwise the irony of the last twist He's really an undercover cop? Who knew? would have been entirely lost. He spends most of the film swearing at his family and generally sprinkling blood and violence around New Jersey like so many daisies. His primary target is Oleg his son's best friend who is acutely capable of staring blankly but little else. I would attempt a more thorough plot summary but it's really not important since everyone dies in the end. Oleg's mother? She kills herself in a methlab explosion. Oleg's father? He dies in a mobrelated blood bath on an ice hockey rink. The albino pimp in pinstripes that calls himself a mack daddy? His throat is slit by the evercapable Mr. Walker. The pedophiles couple that films child pornography and then kills the children? Oh they're shot by Mr. Walker's trashy but lovable wife. This film was overthetop in all the wrong ways filled with entirely violence and language so gratuitous it bordered on the absurd. Don't go to this movie don't waste your money.".

He is this reality's version of Ward Cleaver because as a drug running thug he brings his family up in a well adjusted household full of love and warmth. Instead of coming home from a hard day at the office he comes home after a botched drug deal shootout and explains the whole thing to his wife as if it is an everyday experience. And in this world it is. Everyone is somehow a full and willing participant in a seedy enterprise the men are either pimps or dealers and women are whores strippers or housewives. There isn't a household or a street corner where someone is cooking up dope getting beaten or shot or engaged in crime. However what separates the good criminals from the bad are that the ones we cheer for all have hearts of gold which seems to be the message the screenwriter wants to convey.The special effects in this film are interesting but the story and acting are so completely amateur that it comes off as an absolute farce. Who cares for these characters when they are all scum? Certainly nobody in the theater that I viewed this film. Of 40 people 25 had walked out before the hour mark and the rest of the audience was laughing riotously at each implausible scene.One note of interest pay attention to actor Chazz Palminteri who portrayed the shapeshifiting Detective Rydell as he morphs from Bela Lugosi to Ed Sullivan to Richard Nixon!

The only reason I stayed for the whole movie was I thought there is no way this movie can get worse it has to get better. Yet I was wrong. I urge you do not go see this movie and definitely do not pay to see it. I got to see it for free and I still feel like I was ripped off. Anyone who pays to see this movie is only encourage production of more P.O.S. movies such as this one.";

Which plays as a lowbudget homage to Shinya's 1989 Cyberpunk classic with a bit of the famous Korean revenge style type flicks mixed in. Just as in Tetsuo Nam opts more for visuals and atmosphere than a coherent plot line. Which is not necessarily a bad thing though... you don't watch films named Teenage Hooker Became a Killing Machine for the plot.But the plot goes something like this as best I could tell. SoYun Lee plays a teenage hooker who is mentored by her teacher Daetong Kim. Their relationship is not a platonic one and after long her teacher impregnates the nameless high school girl. In order to avoid controversy the Teacher kills the girl's baby and then enlists his brothers for a immensely disturbing murder scene involving a doublehandled saw! Anyway Teenage Hooker is then rebuilt by whom is unclear into a mechanical Killing Machine. After her first mission the girl goes on a revenge spree going after her murderers and the sadistic Teacher.As mentioned the plot is truly insignificant. The real reason you watch films like this is for the brilliant visuals and the exploitational aspects. Both of which Teenage Hooker has plenty of. Shot in a multitude of grainy hues the film seems to straddle the line between art and trash. Some scenes are exquisitely crafted which is quite an accomplishment considering the extremely lowbudget nature of the film. It seems to be shot on digital video but what it lacks in production values it makes up for in imagination.While I enjoyed the film on various levels mostly for the visual nature and the shear ambition of Director Nam KiWoong's vision the film has one crucial flaw. It's not long enough. At it's 60 minute run time including a very longand bizarreopening credit roll Teenage Hooker doesn't have enough time to expand on the theme's it produces. Some scenes seem a bit rushed and I wished the filmmaker would have lengthened the film a bit in order to let the revenge storyline gel in the viewer's brain.Teenage Hooker is what it is though and maybe I was expecting to much. But what it is is a fun trashy and visually arresting flick worthy of a view. Especially if you take into factor the low production value's most other director's wouldn't have done half as good a job with twice the money Director KiWoong did a good deed bringing this bizarre vision to life.".

It probably served to inspire them but as it stands it's a complete dud.".

An exploitation movie with added zest that's exploitation as in plot and narrative and too genre. This concoction of scifi  horror and surreal black comedy is director Geewoong Nam's coming together of the generation gap represented by Soyun Lee as the young schoolgirl and her middleaged teacher Daetong Kim and each character having no name except being called by their respective parts. This is where youth is seen as promiscuous beautiful and in the same breath being independent to the limits of selfexploitive to further her own gains. The older generation is seen as square and exploitive of their young ugly and controlling while at the same time forming the next generations path for their own needs nasty business indeed from both sides.Most definitely a love it or hate it movie if bizarre and surrealism is your thing with its unforgettable dance ritual between Teacher and Teenage hooker that can quite possibly be translated as sexual foreplay the films highlight and most surreal moment. The soft focused and gritty imaginary can also be translated as to replicate a dream like state that this young Teenage hooker resides but somehow the horrors of reality are more than evident with the political stance it takes. This may have its surreal fantasy overtones but its underlining concept of social controls and its menacing delivery is never far away. Macabre and unsettling to say the least.Wronged and betrayed by a society that is meant to care for her she is finally put to rest by what can only be deemed as a corrupt and hypocritical system in the guise of three morality killers who then go about cutting and chopping our young lady to pieces.Exploited from beyond the grave reborn and rebuilt think of Fritz Lang's 1927 classic Metropolis Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Luc Besson's Nikita and roll them all into one. Using her schoolgirl charm once more to infiltrate her targets as she once had with her puntersofthenight this sweet and innocent looking demeanour has transcended into a highly skilled robotic killing machine a creation of SDH Division 6. A manmade tool this killing machine's thoughts are very similar to her past life's thoughts socially programmed a means to an end. But has it all been a very bad dream? With the Teachers final insights are we to believe that this young girl is not metallic but still in fact human but subconsciously and unknowingly still a byproduct of the system eroding away any form of individualism and will? Geewoong Nam's film of fantasy and science fiction has evolved into a midnight movie classic that when finally surfacing from the underground movement shall become one of Koreas finest moments. Seek it out. Be amazed.".

The older generation is seen as square and exploitive of their young ugly and controlling while at the same time forming the next generations path for their own needs nasty business indeed from both sides.Most definitely a love it or hate it movie if bizarre and surrealism is your thing with its unforgettable dance ritual between Teacher and Teenage hooker that can quite possibly be translated as sexual foreplay the films highlight and most surreal moment. The soft focused and gritty imaginary can also be translated as to replicate a dream like state that this young Teenage hooker resides but somehow the horrors of reality are more than evident with the political stance it takes. This may have its surreal fantasy overtones but its underlining concept of social controls and its menacing delivery is never far away. Macabre and unsettling to say the least.Wronged and betrayed by a society that is meant to care for her she is finally put to rest by what can only be deemed as a corrupt and hypocritical system in the guise of three morality killers who then go about cutting and chopping our young lady to pieces.Exploited from beyond the grave reborn and rebuilt think of Fritz Lang's 1927 classic Metropolis Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Luc Besson's Nikita and roll them all into one. Using her schoolgirl charm once more to infiltrate her targets as she once had with her puntersofthenight this sweet and innocent looking demeanour has transcended into a highly skilled robotic killing machine a creation of SDH Division 6. A manmade tool this killing machine's thoughts are very similar to her past life's thoughts socially programmed a means to an end. But has it all been a very bad dream? With the Teachers final insights are we to believe that this young girl is not metallic but still in fact human but subconsciously and unknowingly still a byproduct of the system eroding away any form of individualism and will? Geewoong Nam's film of fantasy and science fiction has evolved into a midnight movie classic that when finally surfacing from the underground movement shall become one of Koreas finest moments. Seek it out. Be amazed.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNING This is a very low low low budget film from South Korea a country that for the last 5 years has experienced a boom in its film industry. Two years ago a film called Swiri defeated Titanic at the South Korean box office. Last year Chingu a film seen by over eight million people in Korea became the alltime box office champion. The plot is very simple and the title is selfexplanatory too. A teenage hooker gets pregnant by her teacher. He hires three killers who chop her to pieces. A mysterious onlooker takes the pieces away a reconstructs her as a cyborg. She then takes revenge on the four men. The teenage wearing a typical schoolgirl sailor uniform represents the three archetypes of mother whore and Madonna. The film starts as a really funny comedy. She asks a client if he wants to do it right there on the spot or go for a mile this meaning playing a raping game where she runs for a mile followed by her customer and finally gets raped. To another customer she asks Honey or Dad ?. She then meets her teacher and they start to dance to the rhythm of a song by a South Korean rock band. This is probably the funniest and also weirdest sequence in the whole film. John Travolta and Uma Thurman GET LOST!!!. This is followed by the schoolgirl's announcement that she is pregnant and her desire to be a good mother. She wants to forget her days as a prostitute including having recently had sex with her new stepfather. She also tells the teacher how much she loves him and reminds him of how even though she sucked every single penny from the Ethics  Biology teachers she never charged him. Just as she is being rebuilt into a killing machine there is a shot where she is seen with tubes connected to her body in a position that looks like the Madonna in numerous paintings. The halo of light surrounding her gives her an even more heavenly nature. This sequence borrows imaginary from the anime Ghost in the Shell. It also borrows from Test especially in the final sequence where she kills her teacher with a mechanical penis gun. The film has an atmospheric but perverse feeling thanks to the use of surreal compositions colour filters and wide angle lenses But it gets bogged down with the use of too many shots of the schoolgirls walking around the centre of Seoul. The music does not help much either apart from the above mention rock song as it levels the film down to a music video. Nevertheless is a reassuring film for filmmakers beginners'. Shot on DV on an ultra low budget it has actually been shown at the London Film Festival this year.".

The title of the movie as bizarre and odd as it may sound does seem interesting on some level but don't get suckered in by it because you are in for one boring movie experience.The storyline is slow moving and often falls to the ground entirely when injected with strange dancing scenes and scenes of laughing and other such pointless and meaningless things. It disrupts the flow of the movie and just becomes a nuisance to watch.This movie will definitely test your ability of suffering and torture as it drains away your will to live. Teenage Hooker Became a Killing Machine is a great swing and miss from the otherwise good movie production company Third Window Films that have some impressive Asian movies to their name but they failed horribly with this one.The characters in the movie are onedimensional and lacking personalities and you don't really get any kind of emotional bond or connection to either of them as they seem like cardboard characters.I enjoy Asian movies a lot but Teenage Hooker Became a Killing Machine was really a disappointment and a test to sit through.

There are some interesting decisions in the visual aspect of the film which could be described as either good or bad depending on your taste however it suffers from poor pacing and an unsynchronized soundtrack and you get this feeling that maybe the film makers should have spend a bit more time in the editing room.The story is about well the story is about exactly what the title implies. A young schoolgirl turns hooker in the night playing around with customers in some rather perverse scenarios date rape she calls it. Basically the customer pays to chase confront and have sexual intercourse with the girl unfortunately when that moment occurs in the film they begin to... do their thing nearby the house of a lady who later turns out to be the mother of our unlucky heroine's schoolteacher. The teacher confronts the girl the girl strikes a bargain followed by a weird dance scene followed by the date rape thing again followed by a scene where the girl says to the teacher that she loves him and then it gets interesting. I won't spoil that much put from that point on the film picks the pace gets pleasantly weirder more interesting and outright violent. The ending was a bit random though.Visually the film is impressive considering its budgetary limitations Geewoong pulls quite a few rabbits out of the hat and succeeds in making the film feel if not by much at least a little artistic. The shootout scenes are handled well enough showing of some impressive camera work during the last few scenes. Some use of light and wonderful design concepts further strengthen the film's appeal. The score on the other hand like that ending felt random tracks from different genres and time periods interwine and while that is hardly a minus what bothered me was that these tracks most of the times hardly felt right. Just didn't fit the mood in the specific scene.It's a short little film with a long title and you can't really hate it knowing how hard it must have been for these people to write shoot and edit the footage into an enjoyable if a bit forgettable 60 minute surrealcyberpunkrevenge film.".

There's no excuse no matter how budget a movie is to allow such poor acting. The editing and filming is just as bad as the acting where the movie appears to go for artistic and clever shots in order to intrigue the viewer like many other budget movies the reality is that it's just annoying and ruins any form flow in the movie and does definitely not intrigue.

It's definitely video and the lighting and saturation of the image makes everything burn feverishly. It's kind of hard to see sometimes and other times it's hard to tell what exactly the videomakers are trying to do. Some of the more standout moments include when the teacher and prostitute are dancing in the street and when the killing machine jumps onto the car probably the most brilliant moment in editing and visuals in the movie.This movie seems to be inspired by video games anime and Eurotrash features and I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't enjoy those kinds of things and doesn't have a twisted sense of humor.PolarisDiB".

This was produced in the 1950's and all movies of this time are a bit over acted and fanciful. Try to view it for what it isnot a biographical documentary about Sheila Graham and F. Scott Fitzgerald but a sweeten Hollywood version of their story. Very enjoyable.. Gregory Peck is at his understated best!! Deborah Kerr is very believable as a woman who loves this man despite his problems. This movie is very understated. The scene where Scott hits Sheila and threatens her with the gun is well acted the violence is not used to make the movie more watchable as it is now a days. It is a film the evokes many different emotions from the viewer. There are the highs of being in love and the lows of despair and fright. It encompasses all. A great film!!!!".

We know that Fitzgerald was handsome intelligent and charming three things which made Peck an excellent choice to play him on film.  Furthermore there is a pretty amazing scene where violence erupts between Peck and Kerr it's truly believable which heartbreakingly portrayed the depths to which Fitzgerald had sunk.  Obviously when the story is based on Sheilah Graham's recollections it will be purely personal and she may have softened the truth or by the same account exaggerated it. The look of the picture is beautiful especially the wardrobe for Kerr.  I say simply to get a look at two stars in their prime it's worth it to muddle through.  Kerr and Peck have a tangible chemistry.".

Scott Fitzgerald who is still a legend in American literature and a genuine legend in his own time.That's the key to the film. Can you imagine in the previous century Charles Dickens whose works in the United Kingdom were also acclaimed in his time getting a contract and asked to turn out potboiler drama three or four times a year for the London stage? In the late 1930s F. Scott Fitzgerald was in Hollywood having to pay mounting bills for his wife Zelda's care and his daughter schooling and the way to quick cash was in Hollywood writing screenplays.But the studios don't want genius they want entertainment churned out quickly on a mass scale. That isn't how Fitzgerald operates. So he's fired and returns to the alcoholism that was his lifestyle during his literary hey day in the Roaring Twenties. As Fitzgerald Gregory Peck's one consolation in his final years is the love affair with Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham. I have to disagree with the other reviewers who say this film is too rosy a portrayal. Remember this is Sheilah Graham's work this is based on and it's through her eyes we see Peck's disintegration. Deborah Kerr is once again a prim and proper Sheilah Graham whose slum background she's worked like a demon to overcome. Peck and Kerr work well together but as this is a Henry King film from 20th Century Fox I wouldn't be surprised if the film might have been intended for Tyrone Power at one point. If it had been Power would have been well cast in the part of Fitzgerald.This is also Henry King's next to last film and take a look at his film credits and the astonishing list of classic films that he did over 50 years in Hollywood. I guess as a followup to Beloved Infidel King chose to do a film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night. That one for some reason is never shown.Beloved is a classic old fashioned romantic drama the kind that sadly is not being made any more.".

There is one scene that does work  Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs.

Deborah Kerr is so wrong for this part that it is ludicrous. It appears that she was chosen for the role because she had an English accent as did Ms. Graham.

This dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I couldn't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was...as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo. NO ONE experiences moments like thisno one. Now how much of the rest of the film is true I cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 Rolexand leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correctthe film is a lot of bunk. However I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up either. Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like? What I do know about Fitzgerald however does seem different from what I saw in the film. Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film? Well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish I'd assume he wasn't. Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film? Perhaps but if he was this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be a complete dummyand not someone you'd like to see featured in a film. And if he wasn't then the film does a poor disservice to his memory. Either way it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience.The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people. In a dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way! Unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place?. The bottom lineit's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your timeeven if like me you are big Gregory Peck fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film seems to have been vilified above and beyond the call of critical duty at the time of its initial release and a couple of posters on this page have seen fit to heave the old harpoon at a very underrated film. Though far from an expert on Scott Fitzgerald I have a strong feeling that he was around forty when he died and Gregory peck was forty three when he portrayed him so realistically that's about right Deborah Kerr was thirty eight so that's also more or less realistic. By all accounts Fitzgerald retained a certain youthful charm even in alcoholic middle age and if you're looking for an actor who can do charm with one hand behind his back without resorting to the gauche bashfulness of a Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper then Peck is definitely your man especially if as here he's also required to brush the charm away as if swatting a fly and reveal the cruel and brutal streak beneath the surface. I've always had a problem with Deborah Kerr as a sex object even in From Here To Eternity she didn't really convince me I always found her far more believable as the repressed spinster of the kind she played so well in Separate Tables. The upshot was that I came to this as a great admirer of both Peck and Fitzgerald and someone prepared to tolerate Kerr. Perhaps because I was familiar with many of the situations  not least the episode which Budd Schulberg has written about so memorably both in his roman a clef The Disenchanted and in his own recollections of the time he and Fitzgerald left Los Angeles by train bound for New Hampshire where they had been engaged as cowriters on Winter Carnival completely unaware of Fitzgerald's status as onthewagon Schulberg broke open a parting gift of champagne and shared it with Scott with hilariousdisastrous results depending on your point of view  and enjoy nothing more than movies about moviemaking I enjoyed virtually every frame of this and found the moment at the very end when Scott is working away on The Last Tycoon and Sheilah is reading in the background and suddenly magically they both look up and smile a tender loversonly smile resume what they are doing and then seconds later Scott slumps forward and is dead before his head hits the desk one of the most moving moments I've ever experienced in a cinema.

	schema:headline " Might have been better with different casting";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the quirks of the English language is thatalthough the words infidel and infidelity both derive from the same Latin root meaning unfaithful they normally have differing meanings in English. Infidelity generally refers to adultery or sexual unfaithfulness whereas an infidel normally means someone who does not believe in the tenets of a particular religion. It would be unusual to say the least to use the word infidelity to mean religious unbelief or to call an adulterer an infidel. This film however is not concerned with the religious beliefs or lack of them of its main character the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. He was raised as a Catholic but does not appear to have been a particularly devout one in adult life. I can only therefore assume that the title refers to his infidelity to his wife Zelda.When I heard that the film was based on the life of Fitzgerald I assumed that it would be about his wild and tempestuous life with Zelda during the twenties and early thirties. Instead it concentrates on the last few years of his life the period 1937 to 1940 and his relationship with his mistress the journalist and gossip columnist Sheilah Graham. Indeed Zelda does not appear in the film although she is referred to. By 1937 Zelda was suffering from mental illness and was confined to a psychiatric hospital but she and Scott were still married. Indeed the two were never to divorce and she legally remained his wife until his death.The main problem with the film is that of miscasting. Gregory Peck's most frequent screen image was that of an authoritative rational and gentlemanly figure so he does not really seem a natural choice to play a notorious hellraiser like Fitzgerald. Peck occasionally succeeded in his efforts to break away from his normal persona as in Duel in the Sun The Boys from Brazil or MobyDick in which he made a notable Captain Ahab but in several other films attempts to cast him against type fell flat. A good example is Macarthur from the latter part of his career in which he never succeeded in capturing General Macarthur's aggressive combative personality. In the initial part of this film Peck portrays Fitzgerald as yet another quiet charming gentleman and his portrayal is certainly convincing although I did find myself wondering how close it was to the real Scott Fitzgerald. His past struggles against alcoholism are referred to but for a while it seems as though he has conquered his addiction. Midway through the film however Fitzgerald falls off the wagon after he is sacked from his job as a Hollywood scriptwriter and Peck is much less convincing as a violent abusive drunk than he is as a gentlemanly intellectual. For a film made in the 1950s with the Production Code still in force this one is remarkablysympathetic in its treatment of adultery. Sheilah Graham is very much the heroine of the film not its villain. That is perhaps not surprising given that the film was based on her own memoirs. Fitzgerald had died in 1940 but Graham was still very much alive in 1959. She is portrayed as a kindly and understanding lover patiently trying to help Scott deal with his problems rather than as the heartless seductress which during this period was the standard cinematic image of women sexually involved with another woman's husband. Deborah Kerr was one of the screen's most famous good girls although she also had the ability to portray characters who hid passionate natures beneath a quiet reserved surface such as Karen the adulterous Army wife in From Here to Eternity the troubled Sister Clodagh in Black Narcissus the haunted governess in The Innocents or another haunted governess Miss Madrigal in The Chalk Garden in that case haunted by guilt rather than by anything supernatural. In Beloved Infidel however Kerr seemed unable to draw upon this ability and her Sheilah comes across as a character who is all surface with nothing much going on underneath. Kerr also fails to make the most of another aspect of her character the toughness and determination which enabled her to rise from poverty in Britain to become one of the most famous women in America.  There are some good things about this film the script is a good one and it is attractivelyphotographed. For a film of its period it has touches of originality breaking away from the traditional eternal triangle concept of marital infidelity a triangle composed of a weak erring husband a saintly longsuffering wife and a wicked other woman. This concept was not confined to the fifties or even to the Production Code era Fatal Attraction is a good example from the late eighties and examples can still be found today. I felt however that it might have been better had alternative actors been found for the two leading roles. 610".

For a story about two professional writers the script fails to properly develop the characters.

In between well done emotional outbursts Peck reverts to his traditional stoicism which works well in many of his other roles but feels slightly out of place here. There is also a surprising no appearance by or hardly a mention of Fitzgerald's wife Zelda. A fascinating person who at this point in her life was in a sanitarium.

He is truly believable when he allows liquor to insult and almost end his tempestuous relationship with Kerr.We're dealing basically with 2 very insecure people. Sheila Graham coming from a very poor background acted like a prima dona in comparison. Fitzgerald could not deal with disappointment and failure.Eddie Albert's role is also complex here. For one he acts by giving advice similar to his Burt McGuire in 1955's I'll Cry Tomorrow. Yet in the following scene he wants Kerr to get a detective to stop Peck's apparent harassment. Interesting that Peck and Albert had appeared together in 1953's Roman Holiday and that Kerr was married to Philip Ober in 1953's From Here to Eternity. He played Kerr's editor here.I loved the beach scene in this film when Kerr literally lets her hair down and confesses to Peck regarding her humble beginnings.

Scott Fitzgerald in Beloved Infidel based on Sheilah Graham's autobiography. 20th Century Fox gave this a big glossy production with Henry King as director.In the movie Sheilah goes to the set of In Old Chicago with one Mr. Harris Zanuck and we see an actual scene from the film reenacted. Graham has apparently criticized the actress Jane Pierce Alice Faye and Miss Pierce isn't happy to see her. In the cafeteria there is a large photo of Shirley Temple and next to her is Tyrone Power. Yes we're at Fox all right.Graham is an aspiring writer looking for work and at a party she meets F. Scott Fitzgerald who has come out to Hollywood and is writing screenplays. The two fall in love. Zelda Scott's wife has been institutionalized by then and his daughter Francis is in school. Fitzgerald needs the film work to pay his bills.History tells us that Fitzgerald was a big flop writing for movies most of his work is uncredited or just not used. His glorious prose did not translate to the screen. In this version of his story he starts drinking heavily after he is fired from the studio. In reality he had been an alcoholic since college. The alcohol temporarily breaks them up.Certainly one of the most fascinating people who ever lived is F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham pulled herself up from nothing to become an important columnist. But neither of these people come off as especially fascinating or interesting.For me Gregory Peck was miscast as Fitzgerald whom I believe was for one thing much less robust had a weaker character and was probably drunk most of the time. Peck does as well as he can but I think he was smart enough to know there was no way he could convey the personality of the real Fitzgerald. It wasn't in the script. Deborah Kerr in my opinion was an underrated actress and she gives a marvelous performance here. But she probably wasn't playing Sheilah Graham.The script simply isn't specific or detailed enough to give us an idea of who these people really were.People have speculated how much of this story is true. Most of it  Fitzgerald did move to Hollywood he did flop out in movies he did fall for Sheilah Graham they did live together he did start to write The Last Tycoon the incident toward the end of the movie at the theater did happen and the end of the film was basically correct. As far as what they were both like  you'll have to find another source for that.".

The book tells of Murray the old Scot patriot who has had his eyes torn out and his house taken away during the English invasion. Intent on exacting bloody revenge on the reunited English friends Murray possesses the body of a guest and turns him into a murderer. He seems impossible to stop as when the possessed guest is killed Murray passes into the killer to continue his mission of murdering all nine of them.

First the film stars Paris Hilton even though she has the smallest role in the movie. I suspect her presence is the only reason the film was picked up at all even though she serves no purpose and cannot act in this movie to save her life she's worse in this than in House of Wax.When the Lions Gate logo came on my friend and I thought we might be safe. Lions Gate makes some great films. Well they make bad films too it seems. What possessed them to put their name on here I don't know. With all due respect I hope they lost money.The first half of the film is a dinner scene with people sitting and talking about literally nothing. Nothing of interest nothing related to the plot nothing. A brief philosophical debate arises but goes nowhere. As my friend says this film was very innovative for a horror film it might have been the first one that tried to kill the audience.The death scenes are horrible. Basically all deaths consist of a stabbing in the stomach a magic stabbing! Shirts are never torn but somehow a small blood stain appears and the victim becomes quite dead at a rapid pace.None of the actors are worth caring about and the whole film is in shambles. Most annoying for me besides the utter boredom was the tendency to remind us we were in Scotland the words Scotland or Scotish were repeated many times... for no reason. And there was a golf club.This film is even too slow and pointless for Mystery Science Theater 3000 so if there is a way to make something blink out of existence like a memory hole someone please make this your first target.".

After the shameless pilfering of the Halloween theme in the opening the music was constantly overdone andor the wrong emotion for example many times it takes on a heroic sounding trumpet theme when there is nothing heroic happening or about to happen.

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst staying at my cousin's house recently he showed me a film starring Paris Hilton that left me overwhelmed by her talent. What a performance! From start to finish she was totally convincing and she certainly had feelings for the err part. No it wasn't Nine Lives. Actually it was her starring 'roll' in that 'other movie' which probably grossed a damn site more worldwide than this British slasher flick ever would. Now I'm no expert on porn actresses. I never really went through that whole topshelf magazinevideo phase. Perhaps it was because ever since I can remember I've been in one relationship or another? Or maybe it was because I got married at the tender age of 21? Now I'm 24 and still haven't got much knowledge on all things Xrated. But I do have a fairly good eye for talent which has served me well throughout the years of enjoying cinema. I soon realized that if this feisty young heiress could show that much conviction dedication and ahem experience when the camera is concentrating on her facewellwho knows? I first learned about Nine Lives from an extremely generous preview in Empire magazine late 2002. After that the movie mysteriously seemed to vanish and I heard nothing more until I came across the DVD in Amsterdam under the alias title The Terror in summer 2004. To the best of my knowledge this wasn't released in Britain until June 2005 which seemed like a long delay for a homegrown movie. In fact it graced American shores at least a year before it hit UK shelves. I couldn't track down any information anywhere concerning the belatedness of Andrew Green's debut feature. I can only assume that not many distributors were rushing to pick it up for release? Nine high school pals head to their friend's remote mansion in Scotland to join him for his birthday celebrations. Emma Rosie Fellner Lucy Vivienne Harvey Jo Paris Hilton Laura Amelia Warner Linda Maureen Turner Tim Patrick Kennedy Andy Ben Peyton and Damian James schlesinger are soon joined by Pete David Nicolle who was late arriving due to a hazardous snow storm that is crashing against the secluded house. British weather eh?. The group is pleased to be together again and they spend hours drinking and reminiscing over old times. As the evening gives way to a severely weather beaten night the drunken youngsters decide to retire and sleep off all the alcohol. Before they have even had the chance to turn out the lights the tranquillity is shattered by an ominous scream. On exploration they find Jo's mutilated corpse sprawled across the bathroom floor. It seems that there's a maniacal killer amongst the group and he's intent on making this the last reunion they'll ever share. But these 'friends' have known each other for years surely there's no motive for mass slaughter amongst them? In all honesty Nine Lives starts really well. The location is fairly alluring the characters interesting and Green manages to pull off a decent early shock. It's somewhat ironic then that as soon as Madame Hilton checks out twenty minutes into the feature things go down hillDRASTICALLY! It seems that Ms moneybags' onscreen demise starts a chain reaction of badmoviesyndrome that doesn't take long to completely engulf the entire feature. You'd think that nine victims is more than enough to pad out an eightyminute runtime. But the murders are so poorly constructed that it doesn't take too long for things to start feeling tediously humdrum. The embarrassing lead performance from Amelia Warner didn't help and the rest of the cast seems to spend too much time staring blankly at the camera as if they're thinking What do I do next? What's going on? Why am I here? HELP! I'm going to give away the crux of the plot which isn't really a spoiler but if you don't want to know then stop reading now. OK it seems that the spirit of an ancient Scotsman that was tortured by the English when they evaded his homeland has taken possession of one of the kids in order to get revenge on the three lions. So we have a deranged Scotch killer that wants to bump off the English. So why does he kill Paris Hilton  a blatant American  first? Perhaps he had seen what Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace did with Braveheart? When it comes to plot holes Nine Lives is the cinema equivalent of a kitchen sieve. You'll laugh out loud when Warner manages to work out the killer's methods and motives from nothing more than a couple of scrappy pictures. The closing dialogue is no less than hilarious and sounds like an ambitious sevenyearold wrote it for a homework project. There's no gore suspense or attempts at building tension and by the 45minute mark the whole movie has pretty much fallen apart.It's a shame because Andrew Green is a fairly talented director. You also have to give him credit for managing to get Paris Hilton to come all the way to Hertfordshire for a cameo just a few months before 1 night in Paris was about to make her a superstar. He certainly picked the right time to offer her a contract. But with that said though his screen writing abilities are nonexistent and next time that he's hired to direct a feature he should make sure that the scrip is someone else's. Unfortunately Nine Lives is yet another British horrorfailure to add to the list. Maybe one day someone somewhere will make a good UK slasher. Hitchcock was English so why have they failed so since his demise? I guess I'll just have to wait a bit longer to see if Hilton can match the skill of that ahem breathtaking breakout performance".

What's going on? Why am I here? HELP! I'm going to give away the crux of the plot which isn't really a spoiler but if you don't want to know then stop reading now. OK it seems that the spirit of an ancient Scotsman that was tortured by the English when they evaded his homeland has taken possession of one of the kids in order to get revenge on the three lions. So we have a deranged Scotch killer that wants to bump off the English. So why does he kill Paris Hilton  a blatant American  first? Perhaps he had seen what Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace did with Braveheart? When it comes to plot holes Nine Lives is the cinema equivalent of a kitchen sieve. You'll laugh out loud when Warner manages to work out the killer's methods and motives from nothing more than a couple of scrappy pictures. The closing dialogue is no less than hilarious and sounds like an ambitious sevenyearold wrote it for a homework project. There's no gore suspense or attempts at building tension and by the 45minute mark the whole movie has pretty much fallen apart.It's a shame because Andrew Green is a fairly talented director. You also have to give him credit for managing to get Paris Hilton to come all the way to Hertfordshire for a cameo just a few months before 1 night in Paris was about to make her a superstar. He certainly picked the right time to offer her a contract. But with that said though his screen writing abilities are nonexistent and next time that he's hired to direct a feature he should make sure that the scrip is someone else's. Unfortunately Nine Lives is yet another British horrorfailure to add to the list. Maybe one day someone somewhere will make a good UK slasher. Hitchcock was English so why have they failed so since his demise? I guess I'll just have to wait a bit longer to see if Hilton can match the skill of that ahem breathtaking breakout performance";

One of the better elements within this one is the rather enjoyable setting here with the increasingly elaborate layout in the different floors overflow of rooms and snowbound setting all creating an absolutely phenomenal setting for the events here that not only plays into the isolation of the group but the disorienting nature of the house makes the stalking even more chilling. That also becomes another big part of this one in that the prettytense stalking here throughout the film comes off rather nicely with the tension starting with the initial attack in the bathroom and the discovery of the body that affects the group rather deeply being a fine start here. There's a couple of rather intriguing assaults here based on the knowledge acquired from that attack comes into play for them as scenes of the group going through the halls or down into the basement that follows up the film's best part in the fun chasing in the final half as the impact of the storyline and the layout makes for some really fun action scenes with a sense of tension from the feeling of who's who in here as the possession really takes hold for a frantic enjoyable time. There here are enough to hold this off somewhat from the flaws within here. The biggest issue with this one is the fact that the film never manages to go all the way with anything in here as the gore is simply nonexistent relying solely on knives impaled in places which is just quite dull both in concept and execution as the same continuous death scenes just get old after awhile. Likewise the lack of action here from that lowkey nature really stands out by managing to drain the tension out from a large portion of the film by never going all out the way its premise provides the potential for. That as well is the film's final flaw which really stands out here being the rather puzzling premise which certainly allows for a great time here with the possession and stalking angle yet never does anything really interesting or original with it. These here are what keep the film down.Rated R Violence and Language.".

The dialog was in typical horror movie fashion and gave a bit of a cheesy unrealistic vibe. Some of the acting is quite frankly laughable. The standouts are Ameila Warner and David Nicolle who give the most emotion filled and honest performances. The biggest flaw is heiress Paris Hilton it's not that she's a bad actress persay but I feel like the only reason she was cast is because she is so widely recognized. Her picture is front and center in the poster and yet she is the first victim dying in the first 30 or so minutes. I find that very unfair to the above mentioned standouts who are clearly the main focus in this movie.Camera work lighting special effects are all casualties to the lowbudget that this movie had to work with which the storyline strongly needed.Overall I recommend that if you are a Paris Hilton fan and want to see this it is better to rent it or else you are wasting you money. It is decent not as bad as I expected honestly I think it would have been much better sansParis or at least not make her the center of the poster which is almost like false advertising and with a bigger budget.".

Her acting ability is very average and could have done better. While Warner is doing her best efforts to make this film interesting Hilton has a lazy tone in her dialogue when she speaks in the film. Being the only American character it can be expected that she will stand out from the crowd.The film starts off well with edgy music a scary house and a bunch of innocent students ready to be slaughtered. However after the first kill the film just goes down hill with endless searches for the killer a poor twist and bad acting.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and ZBoys adequate research material. This is not to be confused with Lords of Dogtown that sorry Hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original Dogtown revival. Directed by Stacey Peralta a former ZBoys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade and cowritten with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from Southern California's mean streets known as Dogtown who formed the ZBoys skateboard team actually there was one girlPeggy Oki revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews from nearly all of the ZBoys Chris Cahill's whereabouts are unknown with the most noteable being bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest Jay Adams who's talents along with Perlata seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. There are interviews of the team's and the Dogtown shop founders surfboard designer Jeff Ho Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews of folks like Tony Hawk obviously Ian McKaye Fugazi and Henry Rollins who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains. It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks pool skating became immensley popular and thus gave way to vert skating but also facilitated the sport though not into the extreme commercialism it is today as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long over as the Dogtown at least through the publicity of their skate team paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown got all the attention they were able to push skating to the next step.It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini moviesskate demos like Ban This and Search for Animal Chin. Narrated by Sean Penn the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack contains lots of terrific archive footage and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the ZBoys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.".

Directed by Stacey Peralta a former ZBoys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade and cowritten with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from Southern California's mean streets known as Dogtown who formed the ZBoys skateboard team actually there was one girlPeggy Oki revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews from nearly all of the ZBoys Chris Cahill's whereabouts are unknown with the most noteable being bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest Jay Adams who's talents along with Perlata seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. There are interviews of the team's and the Dogtown shop founders surfboard designer Jeff Ho Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews of folks like Tony Hawk obviously Ian McKaye Fugazi and Henry Rollins who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making it's influence on skateboarding skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains. It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks pool skating became immensley popular and thus gave way to vert skating but also facilitated the sport though not into the extreme commercialism it is today as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who's waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long over as the Dogtown at least through the publicity of their skate team paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown got all the attention they were able to push skating to the next step.It's a great documentary in the way that it is put together though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini moviesskate demos like Ban This and Search for Animal Chin. Narrated by Sean Penn the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack contains lots of terrific archive footage and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the ZBoys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.";

	schema:reviewBody "My skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my twobyfour skateboard with steel rollerskate wheels hit a rock and I tumbled for days it seemed down the sidewalk outside my parent's house in Boston. By the time the cast came off my arm summer was gone.But I have always admired the Xgames types and surfers especially. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California on the beaches and piers watching the surfers bemoaning that fact that I had missed my calling. It's the sort of thing you should learn young before the horrible senses of selfpreservation and selfawareness burrow in. Or else at best you'll be so worried about not getting hurt or laughed at you'll wind up looking like a trained bear.I always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment that wave that experience. At one with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there is nothing else but that wave right there and the way you interact with it. There's a lot of Zen in it to me.This documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps downgrades low sweeping curves while interacting with the cement waves beneath their feet. In their day and time this was all new. radical. Prior to the Zephyr Skate team the idea apparently was to go as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard hence my long Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace like tumble down the front walk.This film is a look back through time to an America before EVERYTHING was labeled tagged marketed and jamforced down our throats as Extreme. Seriously what's so extreme about an Extreme value meal at Taco Bell? Other than the fact that it is an extreme hazard to your colon... Watch this film and watch the birth of 'extreme sports'. Before there was an Xgames before Boomboom HuckJam before Crusty Demons before the ASA...there were these young street urchins who created 'extreme sports' without really trying. They were just doing it for the purity the pure pleasure of skateboarding in the sun with friends. I hope they get a cut of the 'extreme' money out there. Goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this film can correct that.Excellent film with a great soundtrack a portrait of a Southern California indeed an America that no longer exists.I don't care for Sean Penn but he does a decent job narrating.".

It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I have found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters well skate. Sure there is a very dark side to the whole seen which the movie does touch on slightly. But it tends to focus more on what is at the core of skating.

	schema:reviewBody "First off the movie was great. It did what it was supposed to do.. and that was to tell the story of a certain time place and people. Maybe the ZBoys weren't choir boys and one girl but they were real people kids and they took the whole idea of skateboarding to new levels... I absolutely enjoyed this movie.. not only because I am from Dogtown Venice Mar Vista S.M south of Wilshire used to skateboard I sucked and that I dealt with the ZBoys a few times when they were using my aunt's pool and were scaring my grandma.. but because this movie was about them the ZBoys and the time and the place. Sure there was a semi skateboard culture in the 60's that died out pretty quickly... but the ZBoys restarted the whole skateboard thing again.. and not only did they restart it they resurrected and recreated it. Nowadays it is almost a regular thing to see some guy flying out of a pool or a half pipe getting air etc.. But back then it was something new. They revolutionized the whole thing. There were electric guitars and guitar players before Hendrix but he took it to a whole different level and what he left in his wake is the same thing the ZBoys left in their's.To the people who seem to want to criticize the movie or the ZBoys for talking about themselves.. well the movie was about them.. Remember what it is like to be young and invincible.. and to revolutionize something that they loved by just doing what they loved.. sure it is easy to get an ego.. just ask a kid who learns how to finally play a Hendrix song on a guitar... it is the same thing except the ZBoys defined the revolution that was to come. They were young brash and from a place that was a slum by the shore. Sure it was wrong to trash and terrorize people who came to their beach or whatever.. but by the same token.. people from this side of the hill would get a lot of abuse when they went to the Valley or other areas. That doesn't make it right but it does make it what it was. There was a sectional divide in the greater L.A. area. The ZBoys just happened to be at the forefront of the beach wars.The ZBoys rocked and they weren't perfect angels but they were real.. look what happened to Jay Adams.. They were part of the times and places that was the L.A. beach scene.Finally I think the style of this movie fit the subject very well. Stacy Peralta was part of the ZBoys and he did this film as a tribute to what they were all about. It was a rebellion not for the sake of ego but for the sake of something they all enjoyed doing. The camera work the killer soundtrack and the memories were great. The best part though might have been the fact that they themselves seemed to document their own history with still pictures and film.To quote the Surf Punks My beach my waves my chicks go home.Rock on!!!!".

As I watched all these kids ripping and doing the moves we strived so hard to emulate I could feel the old stoke returning to my veins.  Peralta a great skater himself really captures the electricity and energy of the time and the place.

That being said I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary.  Some reviewers have said that these dudes were sort of waving their own flag a bit but what the hell? It looks to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving the skateboarding world a jolt and they've provided some good footage of their innovations to back it up. It's great the way viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were teens growing up in California provides some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. I never would have realized where extreme skating came from but this films sort of ties all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary.  I'm sure it's at least a tad biased but aren't all documentaries?  Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or as in my case anyone who grew up in the 1970's.".

For all of those who criticized the self promotion of the Z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you.  That was their whole deal we're better than all of you and here's why....insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable This was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not.  It was THEIR opinion of their skating that mattered..... not yours or mine.  I thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 70's.  The reality is that they DID revolutionize skateboarding they WERE the impetus behind extreme sports and they DID inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana. This movie gave rebirth to images of Bertleman on a wave and Alva and Jay Adams ripping up the coping that WAS the California Dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad!  As I watched this film I realized that it was these images that I lived with every day until I was old enough to move out and back down to So Cal after my family had moved to Nor Cal when I was five.  Until I could get back my buddies and I built and thrashed ramp after ramp searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything Stecyk covered about these guys.  We are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who I was at that age and why I still surf.  This is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely. Whenever it comes on cable I can't change the channel.  Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!".

It was a piece of junk complete with clay wheels and everything.  I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the Dogtown crew.  Skating never became a way of life for me but in some ways it has always been a part of my life whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.This film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating.  Watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slackjawed for 90 minutes.  It's amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film and thank god for that.  The footage is brilliant.  It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton film I've seen some of the tricks Keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's amazing that not only were they the first person to try it successfully but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless.  That's the feeling this film gave me.  Yeah I've seen people skate pools before but to watch the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window.  It's absolutely brilliant to watch something that up until that point had never been tried before but since has been tried by almost everyone.This film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to.  The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a film.  This is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not.  I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. As for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory I think that's an unfair disparagement.  I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past.  They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever.  They have the right to pat themselves on the back.  They were stars for doing what they loved to do.  Most of these guysgirls never achieved the staggering success Tony Hawk enjoys today but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters then.  Sure they had some success but more importantly they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do and as we see in the end almost all of them still surf skate or work in the surfskate industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can.  My hat's off to the Dogtown and ZBoys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.".

It started with the zephyr team who where a fine group of surfers. This is taking place in a not so nice area to live in. At a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on. So they try something else. skateboarding was a fact. If you were a part of the zephyr team in that time you where one of the cool guysgirls. Because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team. So they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard. In no time skateboarding was popular again. There were a couple of competitions and one national competition. The zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one. But what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. But the jury didn't now how to judge them. So they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.Anyway i can tell you the rest of the filmdocumentary but you must see this one with you're own eyes. Because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. This movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8.Greetings from gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.".

But what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable. But the jury didn't now how to judge them. So they put the whole skateboarding world on it's head.Anyway i can tell you the rest of the filmdocumentary but you must see this one with you're own eyes. Because then you can feel the vibe of this movie. This movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8.Greetings from gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.";

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary traces the origins and life of the Zephyr skateboard team using original film shot in the 1970s mostly by Craig Stecyk combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today.The first part of the film documents how the Dogtown section of Venice CA came to be starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a Venice Italylike European city. By the 1970's the one remaining local attraction the Pacific Ocean Park had been abandoned leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards. The poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf and they excelled despite or perhaps because of their surroundings. Because the waves dissipated in the afternoon they took up skateboarding to fill their time and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today. I found that the film covered much more about surfing than I expected which seemed like a bonus since I really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before I watched the film. The soundtrack not surprisingly was good as well. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience. The parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create which seemed somewhat forced and the team's somewhat overinflated sense of selfimportance although this is probably just leftover street attitude from where they grew up. This is not to say that they didn't have significant influence but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well. One note My wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as SpastiCam wiggling camera movements. This film is often guilty so if you are so afflicted be warned. I would recommend this film to anyone but especially to anyone with skateboarding andor surfing in their history.Seen on 5112002.".

Well I wouldn't put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. Of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. Peralta edited it together well with notyourusual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense but that has been done. Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. What Peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the ZBoys.

	schema:headline " Unsuccessful Attempt to Update Henry James' Classic Novella";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood is fond of updating classic tales Shakespeare is the author most often reconfigured at times with great success at times not. The intellectually stimulating works of Henry James have been brought to the screen and making visual the inherently cerebral stories come to life. Such sadly is not the case for IN A DARK PLACE a warping and distorted 'update' of one of the finest ghost stories ever written  James' 1898 TURN OF THE SCREW. Screenwriter Peter Waddington adapted the story to place in our faces fully realized interpretations of what James used as suggestion James realized that the reader's mind could infuse his story with personal demons that would replace the need for detailed description.Cases in point the Governess is here an art teacher given a name Anna Veigh the occult sexual overtones of the story are played out in full view leaving little to the frightening aspects of James' intentions the concentration of the story on the governess' mental fragility is forced into clichs and placed in the hands of an actress unable to be subtle the 'interiority' of the mansion is replaced by equal time outside on the snowy grounds opening up the story so they say etc.The story is well known having been adapted successfully before by television movies and opera Benjamin Britten's immensely well written opera TURN OF THE SCREW. Anna Veigh Leelee Sobieski is the art therapist turned governess who upon losing her job is hired to care for the children Flora Gabrielle Adam and Miles Christian Olson in a now deserted mansion whose only other occupant is the secretaryestate manager Ms. Grose Tara Fitzgerald. Soon enough Anna discovers that the previous governess Miss Jessel another art therapist who was three months pregnant was found dead in the lake and that the prior male butler Peter Quint hanged himself. Anna alone begins to see the ghosts of these newly departed servants and when she explores the reasons with Ms. Grose we discover the Ms. Grose was in love with Miss Jessel and hated Peter Quint. Anna is frequently visited by nightmares of her own sexual abuse as a young girl and transfers these fears onto Flora and Miles feeling that they were similarly abused  an explanation for their bizarre behavior patterns. Ms. Grose acts out her sexuality with Anna confusing Anna even more and stressing her vulnerable psyche into thinking she can exorcise the demons of the house. And the ending will surprise us all! Director Donato Rotunno needs to reread the James novella and rely on the audience's intelligence more than to alter the story to become faddist and frank instead of subtle and suspenseful. A major problem with the casting is the far too frequently physically exposed Leelee Sobieski it feels as though she is reading her rather pedestrian lines from a cue card off camera. It is a sad imitation of the governess. Tara Fitzgerald's Ms. Grose is not the obese matronly of the original but instead a very svelte and seductive woman she succeeds in creating a credible alternative figure very well. The setting and photography are fine but the musical score by Adam Pendse is a pedestrian mix of incongruous styles. In short if you are a fan of Henry James avoid this sloppy work. But then if Leelee Sobieski is a favorite then you see more of her as a grown woman than you probably will ever see again! Not Recommended. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "Hollywood is fond of updating classic tales Shakespeare is the author most often reconfigured at times with great success at times not. The intellectually stimulating works of Henry James have been brought to the screen and making visual the inherently cerebral stories come to life. Such sadly is not the case for IN A DARK PLACE a warping and distorted 'update' of one of the finest ghost stories ever written  James' 1898 TURN OF THE SCREW. Screenwriter Peter Waddington adapted the story to place in our faces fully realized interpretations of what James used as suggestion James realized that the reader's mind could infuse his story with personal demons that would replace the need for detailed description.Cases in point the Governess is here an art teacher given a name Anna Veigh the occult sexual overtones of the story are played out in full view leaving little to the frightening aspects of James' intentions the concentration of the story on the governess' mental fragility is forced into clichs and placed in the hands of an actress unable to be subtle the 'interiority' of the mansion is replaced by equal time outside on the snowy grounds opening up the story so they say etc.The story is well known having been adapted successfully before by television movies and opera Benjamin Britten's immensely well written opera TURN OF THE SCREW. Anna Veigh Leelee Sobieski is the art therapist turned governess who upon losing her job is hired to care for the children Flora Gabrielle Adam and Miles Christian Olson in a now deserted mansion whose only other occupant is the secretaryestate manager Ms. Grose Tara Fitzgerald. Soon enough Anna discovers that the previous governess Miss Jessel another art therapist who was three months pregnant was found dead in the lake and that the prior male butler Peter Quint hanged himself. Anna alone begins to see the ghosts of these newly departed servants and when she explores the reasons with Ms. Grose we discover the Ms. Grose was in love with Miss Jessel and hated Peter Quint. Anna is frequently visited by nightmares of her own sexual abuse as a young girl and transfers these fears onto Flora and Miles feeling that they were similarly abused  an explanation for their bizarre behavior patterns. Ms. Grose acts out her sexuality with Anna confusing Anna even more and stressing her vulnerable psyche into thinking she can exorcise the demons of the house. And the ending will surprise us all! Director Donato Rotunno needs to reread the James novella and rely on the audience's intelligence more than to alter the story to become faddist and frank instead of subtle and suspenseful. A major problem with the casting is the far too frequently physically exposed Leelee Sobieski it feels as though she is reading her rather pedestrian lines from a cue card off camera. It is a sad imitation of the governess. Tara Fitzgerald's Ms. Grose is not the obese matronly of the original but instead a very svelte and seductive woman she succeeds in creating a credible alternative figure very well. The setting and photography are fine but the musical score by Adam Pendse is a pedestrian mix of incongruous styles. In short if you are a fan of Henry James avoid this sloppy work. But then if Leelee Sobieski is a favorite then you see more of her as a grown woman than you probably will ever see again! Not Recommended. Grady Harp";

The watcher is also pelted with a hundred herrings and MacGuffins until the drama becomes indistinct.Also the role of Anna Veigh was miscast with Leelee Sobieski. The part called for someone really talented delicate and passionate. Her look was right exotic except for her height. It was weird to see her clopping around towering over everyone else. She just seemed blurry and clumsy like she was constantly confused about what was going on.Tara Fitzgerald however was perfek! She smoldered and sizzled her way through every frame. It really is a pity that the screen chemistry between Leelee and Tara was a wreck. That alone could've carried the script.The sexual tension between Tara  Leelee's character builds for what seems an excessive amount of time. We wait. We want it. Tara boots us back into line several times. Then when we've been teased long enoughthey kissand Leelee blows it by looking like she's either going to blow up a balloon or hurl. You could hear her going EEEEK! by her body movements. That moment stuck a dagger through the heart of the movie. It drifted slowly below the icy water after that.As for the children I normally dislike really young actors and actresses as they are usually wooden as an oak post or overact like Shatner or Montalban on crystal meth. Christian Olson stumbles a little but Gabrielle Adam is flawless. She has great screen presence and she should keep acting 'cause she's a natural.Moving on the scenery and colors are absolutely gorgeous contrasts of warm creams and browns of the manor contrasted with cold snowy fields forests and an icy lake.

It is shot with a slightly eerie mood to the point that the light is almost greenblue at times while the camera work is shaky with odd and unpleasant camera angles. It doesn't work.Ultimately I think audiences will be disappointed when they think they're seeing a horror movie or ghost story which is in fact an excruciatingly slow psychological thriller with two disappointments waitingfailed sensuality and an aggravatingly fuzzy ending.

It looked something similar to recent movies such as The Return and The Grudge which I thought both of those films were very satisfying even though this ended up being nothing like them really so I decided to give this movie a try.At first it looked really cool when I put it in that is. The first near hour or so were fine just fine nothing special but I was enjoying the build up and performances to an extent. Then it took a turn for the worst. Everything started going horribly wrong and as the film dragged on I became more depressed and more depressed with how the outcome of the film was turning out. The storyline just gets so ridiculously poor and overrated and everything they had built up with mildly entertaining values were thrown out the window near the end of the film. Why how Leelee I thought you were great! What made you take part in this movie when you saw how the character development is demolished in the last half hour or did you even notice? Sure there was some stuff I found in the movie that was entertaining I have already stated that but I felt as if my insides were going to explode from how horrible the last half hour of the film was and how horrifically boring and inane Sobieski and everyone elses' character became. If you love Leelee Sobieski enough avoid this movie because I really was expecting more from her and the movie itself seeing as how I enjoy her as an actress. I'm sure her heart will thank you if you don't watch this for now every time she hears about her role in this film as often as that probably isn't I bet she falls to the ground and bursts into tears. . .".

But I can assure you that this movie independent of the work on which it has been based is a pathetically directed and scripted one. The topic under consideration is a complicated one and requires the primary cast and crew to be matured and precise about psychological responses of people under varied circumstances. The movie is a horror movie and yet there are psychological elements involved in it. The biggest failure of the movie is that it fails to do a good job in both the elements.When I am seeing a horror movie I am ready to fore go some elements that make good cinema provided that I do really enjoy the goosebumps the movie has to throw at me. Do I really get scared when I see this movie? The answer is a plain and a simple no. Because the visual effects are simply too lame. One does not really need a great animation studio to get the effects right. It takes sheer brilliance on part of the director to get things done right. A simple evidence of this is that we have really scary movies when there was nothing called computer animation! And that brilliance is completely lacking on part of the crew of the movie and we do not get goosebumps at all except maybe on one or two occasions.The movie is to end without any proper conclusion. It is one of those kind of movies which tell you two parallel possibilities and then leave you to decide for yourself what you want to think about the conclusion of the movie. Such movies are not bad provided that both the parallels are strongly motivating. This movie does not really do a good job in this department and at the end all we are left with is an ending that just does not excite you enthrall you and to make matters worse it leaves you completely dejected and heartbroken for having wasted your time on it.The central character of the movie is a disturbed character. She has been sexually assaulted back in childhood and one of the explorations of the movie is how such a person can pass on the pain to others. But the overall lack of skill on the part of the actress the script and the failure of the director to hold it all together destroy this element of the movie and we find nothing convincing at the end of the movie. A movie can always end with a twist but it should be so strong that people are left with a feeling of Wow at the end of it. Nothing like that happens in this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "In A Dark Place is a somewhat slow and boring horror drama with a few good moments.SPOILERSFired from a teaching job Anna Veigh Leelee Sobieski is offered a babysitting gig and eventually takes the position. Brought by assistant Mrs. Grose Tara Fitzgerald to the house she meets her charges Miles Christian Olson and Flora Gabrielle Adam and is soon tending to their problems as a fulltime nanny. When she starts to suspect that something is amiss with them she decides to learn about the history of the position and realizes that there's a violent history involving the ghosts of previous residents of the house haunting the grounds and targeting the children. Taking matters into her own hands she tries to prevent the same thing which happened to them from repeating itself with the children.The Good News This one didn't have a whole lot to really get excited about. One of the most memorable aspects of the film is it's lesbian relationship even though there isn't much of that going on. The one sequence where one of them writes in agony in a flowery shirt is nice and the one sequence where they give in to the temptation and it goes for a mild sex scene is the real highlight offering up a lot of good points to really serve it well. Some of the haunting scenes are actually good mainly the ones coming at the end. The fact that they all occur in the frosty winterland is a little chilling giving it a nice atmosphere due to the stripped dead trees reaching out to their victims. It's quite impressive and eerie altogether. The other plus is that they're used in conjunction with the ghostly hauntings all of in the distance and making them seem even creepier. The last good point is the really nice chase at the end. The stalking in the house is pure gold lasting much longer than normal and going out to really get a lot going for it. Then it moves out into the wintery forest which is always great and it's combined into a spectacular conclusion. These here are all that really work for the film.The Bad News This was an alltogether huge missed opportunity for something decent. One of the biggest problems is that the supernatural hauntings are nowhere near centerstage in this making the drama the real focus of the action. There's very little if anything at all in the beginning which is all that great or even entertaining centering around the efforts to understand the children. That's not a wholly entertaining avenue to explore in this especially once it starts dominating and nothing at all really happens and when they do happen it's usually a quickcut sequence that isn't followed up on rendering it of no importance other than a cheapjump gag or is written off as hallucinations which is really a shame since the hideandseek game played is rather cheapened of a great genuine thrill by it's lame revelation. Other scenes are also hurt by this and it really hurts the film altogether. Another missed opportunity comes from the weakened lesbian angle. Not enough nudity is really shown outside of one sequence and with a coupler bathing scenes a makeout fondling and a couple dressing scenes all offering up nothing all coming off as teasing rather than anything else and coming up as plain irritating. The main missed opportunity with the ghostly haunting also manages to slow the film's momentum down really making the beginning quite boring especially with the fact that it's more or less an unnamed remake of a classic in the genre only with a few minor changes. It's quite easy to pick up on the references to the manner of job acquisition to the antics between the two to the school problems and much much more really taking a large piece with it. The last flaw is the film's rather misused house. This could've been a really creepy oldstyle house with modern twists that really could've been a creepy and unsettling place but is shot all the wrong way and really does the film a huge disservice. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict With a couple of good parts and some really big flaws this one is a really big disappointment when it could've been worthwhile. Really only give this a chance if you're a huge fan of the style or those who like the creative side while those who want some action in their films should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Language Violence Nudity and a mild sex scene".

Not enough nudity is really shown outside of one sequence and with a coupler bathing scenes a makeout fondling and a couple dressing scenes all offering up nothing all coming off as teasing rather than anything else and coming up as plain irritating. The main missed opportunity with the ghostly haunting also manages to slow the film's momentum down really making the beginning quite boring especially with the fact that it's more or less an unnamed remake of a classic in the genre only with a few minor changes. It's quite easy to pick up on the references to the manner of job acquisition to the antics between the two to the school problems and much much more really taking a large piece with it. The last flaw is the film's rather misused house. This could've been a really creepy oldstyle house with modern twists that really could've been a creepy and unsettling place but is shot all the wrong way and really does the film a huge disservice. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict With a couple of good parts and some really big flaws this one is a really big disappointment when it could've been worthwhile. Really only give this a chance if you're a huge fan of the style or those who like the creative side while those who want some action in their films should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Language Violence Nudity and a mild sex scene";

This is very good though.Leelee plays young Anna Veigh a nanny assigned to look after two young children a boy Miles and a girl Flora on a remote country estate. It soon becomes apparent that they were abused as was Anna herself Mrs. Grose the caretaker is distant and remote adding to Anna's misgivings.The film is stark and sensual. Leelee gives probably her best performance to date possibly because as Leelee herself tells us there is little of her in Anna. Tara Fitzgerald is also a fine actress and really seems to bring everyone's level up in whatever she appears. There is increasing dread to the proceedings that are more psychological than supernatural and the film never loses its edge or its air of creepy selfpleasure.There is a lesbian subtext that was missing in earlier versions and a good twist as to who the children are really afraid of. The film is moody and subversive but not so obtuse that the viewer is left in the dark too. Due to its subject and certain scenes this isn't really the most comfortable film but for those who care both Leelee and Tara give the devil his due with flashes of nudity. All in all I wasn't expecting much from this and so was pleasantly surprised and entertained.".

However this isn't directed with the skill of a Kubrick or a Bergman nor is this version written well for the screen so really the film just leaves you going What the ?. Not even really caring much what happened nor leaving you with interesting ideas of what may have happened. It's just crap really. The story here is an ugly toad covered in warts as for the princess. Enter Leelee Sobieski who is the one and only reason to watch this confused effort. If you are a lesbian or a male who likes Leelee then this will satisfy. Otherwise run from this dark place. To me Leelee was well worth the watch. In fact I couldn't stop watching her despite the ridiculousness of the story. Leelee's voluptuous body in itself is a feature presentation well worth the price of admission. Cleavage and curves galore this is the only film in existence that I can think of where a woman's body completely steals the film and alone makes it worth while. That is truly the way I felt though. The film's story is laughably stupid however Leelee's body is nothing short of a masterpiece. And so...the princess saves an ugly toad.710".

The writers could have knocked off a one or twosentence treatment Mad woman hires out as nanny and harasses her two young charges to death. James' story and Jack Clayton's adaptation of it in 1963 are full of ambiguity. This version isn't.Leelee Sobieski is okay as are the other performers. Sobieksi has the advantage of not being a star in the Hollywood sense but an actress instead. Her figure is a little shapeless and her eyes with all that black liner too close together and in this wintry English setting her pallor against the snow gives her face the appearance of a charcoal sketch. She's the kind of woman a discerning man might find himself staring idly at while standing next to her in the supermarket checkout line and slowly realizing  Gee she ain't too homely. Her beauty is insinuating and she's quite good in the role. The problem isn't with her it's with the script.Tara Fitzgerald as Mrs. Grose has a tough job  projecting sensuality undercut by a touch of the sinister. The two kids are alright but they are after all kids.But never mind all that. The screenplay and direction bungle the task. Where to begin. The direction has a lot of arty touches none of them original. Three figures in black silhouette skip along the top of a snowbank against a washedout winter sky. Lots of crosscutting during critical scenes. Intrusive flashbacks to Sobieski's youth incomprehensible much of the time. Okay she's suddenly a little girl oscillating on a park swing and she looks back over her shoulder and smiles at the camera and  wham  we're back in the present. These arty effects  done with accomplished camera work though  deteriorate quickly into every clich from the horror movie script guide. Guttural animal sounds in the middle of the night coming from nowhere. An intense electrical storm in the midst of winter straight out of a B horror movie. Shock cuts accompanied by stings on the sound track. Before the movie is half over Sobieski is already creeping around holding a butcher knife. Child abuse is hinted at. Lesbianism is shown. Graphic but brief nudity. Too brief. A little gratuitous sex might have helped. The monster's POV shots where there be no monster.My attitude may be warped because Clayton's The Innocents was superb. It stuck pretty close to Henry James. James' Mrs. Grose was not the dominatrix she is here she was an unimaginative old housekeeper. There is absolutely nothing in this version to compare with the scene in the garden in Clayton's movie in which Deborah Kerr and the child watch a repugnant black beetle crawl out of the mouth of a marble cherub. Out of the mouths of babes! But not here. If Deborah Kerr as the governess may have been slightly delusional perhaps prompted by her attraction to her dismissive employer Leelee Sobieski is frankly loco. In the earlier movie Kerr first merely senses the two ghosts  Quint and Miss Jessel  and then glimpses them from afar. The closest Kerr comes is when she enters an elongated empty classroom and thinks she sees Miss Jessel weeping over the desk at the other end. Miss Jessel disappears as Kerr approaches but Kerr finds a fresh teardrop on the desk. The evil that the ghosts represent is never made clear. Here it's the sexual abuse of children. Ho hum.I don't know why they bother to remake films that were so good in their original form. I really don't. How about a remake of Citizen Kane with Tom Cruise? No? Gone With the Wind with Keanu Reeves and Brittany Spears? I've got it  On the Waterfront with Rob Lowe and Paris Hilton.".

	schema:reviewBody "MEET THE PARENTS  2000  out of fourBy Blake FrenchThe main character in Meet The Parents is a Chicagobased male nurse Greg Focker pronounced just how it is spelled who realizes how unlucky a person can be. He is about to propose to his schoolteacher girlfriend Pam Teri Polo when her sister Debbie Nicole Dehuff calls and explains that her new fianc Dr. Bob Banks Tom McCarthy received a blessing from her father before he asked the question. This information makes Greg reconsider his method of choice and instead jumps at the opportunity to meet Pam's overprotective parents when they fly to the east coast two weeks later to arrange Debbie's wedding. At the airport the attendants loose Greg's parcels. Thus he arrives without any luggage. Once at Pam's parent's house they exchange greetings and aquatint themselves with each other. Pam's parents Jack and Dina Byrnes Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner learn about Greg's unusual last name that he does not like cats and is a male nurse all facts that do not settle well with Pam's father. Greg does manage to gift Jack with a pleasant supply of rare flowers. However even though Pam explained to Greg  that her dad is in the hobby of rare flowers he does not seem too impressed.Even More complications ensue especially when Greg learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house as well as meeting Pam's brother Denny Jon Abrahams and Debbie's soon to be in laws Larry James Rebhorn and Linda Banks Phillis George and Pam's wealthy exfiance Kevin Rawley Owen Wilson. Soon Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase. The film introduces Greg and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is De Niro and Stiller who make the movie however. They form an very effective comedic chemistry even more amusing than the likable shtick between De Niro and Billy Crystal in Analyze This. The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack and place them in one hilarious situation after another. While outrageous and at times explosively funny director Jay Roach takes the plot seriously. His previous films including the Austin Powers films and Mystery Alaska have had trouble with taking anything seriously. But Meet The Parents has emotional connections develops solid empathy for Greg and we really believe he has something precious that can be lost Pam.The movie does not completely develop romantic chemistry between Ben Stiller and Teri Polo thus there were times when I simply did not believe the two were really in love. The relationship sometimes feels trite and contrived. There are also important plot nuggets left only partially examined Jack's pothead son who could have contributed a lot more to the drug related material is left as a plot device to provide another string of conflicts within Jack and Greg. I really enjoyed the whimsical performances and opportune casting. Ben Stiller reprises his There's Something About Mary role with cute charm and the obscured zany flippancy. Robert De Niro is perfect in a role he was born to play with serious attitude that results in the main portion of the film's funny moments. Blythe Danner is also charming in a kind of role that is becoming all too usual for her.Meet the Parents is one of the funniest movies of the year. It gives audiences with a solid story that does not interfere with the comic material but contributes to it. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. During a year in which effective comedies are an endangered species Meet The Parents is a landmark achievement in light entertainment.".

Taken aback Greg decides to wait until tomorrow whence they are going to meet Pam's parents and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake right? Wrong. Pam's mother Blythe Danner is very nice but herein lies the problem Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam's plantexpert father is not really a plantexpert as Greg learns after Jack doesn't seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to himone of the rarest plants in the world but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a human lie detector as Pam herself puts it. In fact Jack even gives Greg a lie detector test in one scene to see if he liked the dinner earlier in the evening. Yes Greg replies to see the needle jumping. Well it was a little rare for my tastes maybe. Greg desperately seeking approval and nervous as ever seems to unintentionally cause mayhem in his possible parentstobe's home. Nerves shot like a drug addict Greg is the definition of a nervous wreck and all his problems seem to escalate more and more until a funnyifsappy comedic showdown.You know how sometimes you are really nervous but try to hide the fact? You seem to keep your cool until you do something then all your nervousness explodes and you start knocking over things saying stupid thingssinglehandedly DOING stupid things that you just never do? And then you look around and everyone is looking at you like you are some sort of freak? Well that's how it is with Greg's character in Meet the Parentshe is so easy to identify with. Just like all of us we want to keep our cool and impress peoplebut once we lose it the coolness seems to slip farther and farther away from our grip until we are klutzes on feet. For Greg's character small things turn bigger and bigger and biggerfrom knocking over the remains of Jack's mother and having a cat go to the bathroom on the remains to setting the house on fire and busting the septic tank. Situations seem to escalate farther and farther out of control and they just keep getting worse and worse.In one scene Greg tries to impress everyone while playing volleyball in a pool. His team is losing because of him. Get up and hit the ball Jack says to him. So the next time the ball comes around to Greg he jumps up and smacks the ball with all his might sending it flying towards...Pam's sister whose wedding is the next day shattering her nose. Greg lands back in the pool and seems to be happy until he realizes he smacked his sisterinlawtobe in the nose. Then everyone looks at him like he's an insensitive idiot.Things like that have happened to me countless times and that is why I can so easily identify with Greg. People are yelling at Greg to do something and when he finally does it it backfires and everyone looks at him like he's stupid even though he did exactly what he was told.That's the kind of thing that makes this movie so greatnot only is it extremely funny but we can easily identify with the main character countless times throughout the film. That is perhaps the best thing about this comedy.".

And while I in no way condone Greg's vile rage directed at the airstewardess it is very funny.But 'Meet the Parents' has the emotional truths that turn it from being merely a funny film into a comedy classic.  Anyone who has ever been married or about to will recognise the horrible accuracy of this film.  My own fatherinlaw is remarkably like Jack Byrnes here not that he is an exCIA spycatcher at least I don't think so but in his ability to intimidate humiliate terrorise impose his power.My point is that Jack's profession is only a comic exaggeration of what all fathers or mothersinlaw are like figures terrified of losing their children defending them like animals in the wild convinced that a prospective soandso will never be good enough for our baby not even thinking that neither might they have been refusing to admit they are getting old that they are losing power and control.It's only logical that the monster inlaw from hell should be obsessive about power and control.  His domestic panopticon is a superb metaphor for extended family life the idea of being judged marked on 'success' or 'suitability' ratings your every personal financial health etc. problem a matter for family investigation.  Bitter moi?  Greg should be lucky Jack isn't married to Monica Geller's mom.But the film doesn't simplistically pit Capraesque good guy Greg against shady CIA man Jack.  If Jack is all about control then so is Greg.  The film has one of the best musical openings in recent memory 'if you're gentle and sweet you're an idiot...' but the opening montage is more sinister as a faceless cameraman takes home movies of a pretty blonde. Pam is the true victim of this film the prize in a macho battle of wits the female bystander in the great masculine generational conflict as Jack proves he's not past it and Greg proves he's not a loser.  Those voyeuristic home movies echo Jack's surveillance cameras and perform the same function to watch to control to limit just as Kevin remembers Pam by his photographs and his erotic memories.One is heartened by the ironies of the ending not just Jack breaking his word determined to keep up his power games as he watches his CCTV's filming the most private places where people are at their most vulnerable and exposed revealing truthfully that the inlaw struggle never endsThe film also has some cutting things to say about the lingering antisemitism in WASPish society nothing much has changed since 'Auntie Mame'.It is wonderful to see Robert de Niro finally getting a decent comedy.  He has always been hilarious in 'straight' roles 'Mean Streets' 'Taxi Driver' 'Raging Bull' etc. but his comic vehicles have spluttered to a halt.  He is genius here his menace his gestures facial contortions way of throwing out a line like he's garrotting it  bliss.  If 'Parents' finally lacks the pull of a film like 'There's Something About Mary' then it's probably the nature of the plot.  'Mary' had an active plot it was a quest necessitating narrative and character development and thus more audience commitment.  'Parents' is purely destructive as Jack tries to destroy a love that's already been built up.  Sadly this scenario is much truer.".

The name was unnecessarily vulgar bearing in mind that it's main task was to set up the confusion of identity scenario and hey I liked the dialogue in Goodfellas and Casino so its not a sensibility issue. The name was used at intervals throughout the film to get cheap laughs in a way that was more suited to the Carry on films. It wouldn't be worth mentioning except that so many scenes in the film seemed to rely on it for laughs even before his 1st name was revealed to be Gaylord.Although one or two of the setpieces were funny every single one of them was telegraphed way ahead.

And so on and so on  you get the picture?

Mixing slapstickfarce with a bit of sophistication is fine when done well The Producers for example but here the comedy never got sophisticated enough to provide a counterpoint to the adequate slapstick. The only low gag they missed was not having the Thai honeymoon destination being Phuket!This was a film that intermittently promised to develop into something good De Niro's poem to his dead mother for instance and the cast did their best with thin material.

	schema:headline " a truly marvelous comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Funny as well as touching Meet the Parents' blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.  Cowriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke along with director Jay Roach have managed to make a film that is often laughoutloud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.  The foundation for any great comedy must first and foremost be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  Meet the Parents' does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or as in poor Greg Focker's case those most dreaded figures of all  the prospective inlaws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted wellmeaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam the girl he loves.  First however he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father Jack Byrnes played to perfection by Robert De Niro who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.  The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true but twisted in sly subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy exCIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity which brilliantly enhances this weekend from hell' scenario.   For crazy and maddening as he can be at times we can't help loving this character.Finally unlike in many other romantic dramas and comedies the relationship between the young couple in this film is both believable and touching.  Greg and Pam are so likable  and the odds against them seem so staggering  that we find ourselves rooting them on from first moment to last.  Their moments together are genuinely touching at times particularly in the film's closing stretches.Kudos go out to everyone involved for making Meet the Parents' one of the slyest wittiest and flatout funniest movies to come our way in a long long time.".

	schema:headline " A comedy with Stiller at his most awkwardly best";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating710 Meet the Parents is a comedy and almost kind of romance movie that boats a stellar cast and some funny lines. The humour here is spread out well and the laughs don't just all come in one scene or the other it makes you laugh at the end and the beginning too. I think the majority of the laughs are more physical than what they say but what I will add is that when GregBen Stiller says certain lines they come off brilliantly. I felt it was just about good and here below is why.The cast here seem excellent and Ben Stiller as I mentioned is cast well in the lead role as Greg his physical humour matches up to his line delivery and both combine very well. Robert De Niro as the father in law Jack is great as well he somehow seems to mix serious but still feel funny and all credit to him on this one. Teri Polo as Pam Greg's finance is well cast and so even is Blythe Danner including people like Owen Wilson too to create a first rate bunch of characters. It's written well now what I will say is that the script doesn't quite produce as memorable scenes as some of the more physical jokes do but there still funny anyway. John Hamburg and Jim Herzfeld do a good job as I say writing this and both seem to combine past experiences well with Hamburg who worked with Stiller on Zoolander yet again bringing out the laughs and the type of humour we have come to expect.I think the director Jay Roach is probably the best thing in a way about this yes you may say how is it not Stiller but Roach is the master here when it comes to the most memorable parts and a lot of the laughs. Roach seems to be able to not only get good delivery but make things very awkward and part of you even feels awkward watching it at times. Now Meet the Parents isn't the funniest film you will ever see if it is then there is much else out you need to see but it does stand tall when it comes to comedy and laughs can be had a plenty everywhere. I think although it is a typical comedy type plot the jokes and the cast involved some memorable scenes create a movie that is new when it comes to jokes and even maybe creates a new type of RomCom.On the jokes side again pretty much any scene where it goes wrong for Greg is funny whether he is hurt hurts somebody or basically does something to destroy something It makes not only Stiller's reactions funnier but also how the cast react just hilarious on that side of things. I also think how De Niro goes from actually kind of nice to angry in a matter of seconds is perfect top class acting from the great.So overall I think this is a good movie just scraping into being good but still a good one. I think the reason it isn't great is that it isn't smart ENOUGH it is smart but there could have been some better jokes or maybe even this type of plot just only works to a certain point. Nevertheless I can't recommend this more whether you like Ben Stiller Robert De Niro or any of the cast involved your sure to have a great time and laugh a lot along the way.".

He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack Robert De Niro and her mother is Dina Blythe Danner. The more Greg tries to impress the parents especially Jack who is a former CIAagent the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions also with his words and stupid lies to look better.Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that especially in 'There's Something About Mary'. The more he gets in trouble the more painful it gets the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam's former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn't try very hard to be a strict person who doesn't give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. 'Meet the Parents' directed by Jay Roach who also directed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable.".

If I watch a comedy I want to laugh and with this one it's what you get. Some people might not like it but then to me they just don't have a sense of humor and that's just a pity for them. You have to like Ben Stiller though because it's basically him that is the great comedian of the movie. If you don't like him you probably not going to like the movie either. Like I don't like the movies with Adam Sandler. I think that guy is not funny and so his comedies are painful to watch for me. In Meet The Parents the whole story is basically about the relation between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro that plays his role brilliantly as well by the way. The other actors are good as well but it's not them that carry the movie. To me it's already a classic movie when I think about the best comedies I ever saw.".

As unbelievable as it sounds the protagonist in the movie has a last name that rhymes with a naughty word. His last name is Focker! Why is this piece of information a spoiler? Because joke after joke after joke after joke is made on this simple premise. In fact it's so hilarious that they felt the need to put it in the title of the next movie! In addition the scenarios in this movie were so far fetched that instead of being able to enjoy it I spent the entire time wondering why the writers were so lazy that instead of coming up with reasonable plot scenarios they just passed off ridiculous decisions in order to force supposedly humorous scenes. Case and point  Ben Stiller's character loses his luggage while on the way to meet his fiance's parents. The first morning he wakes up in his fiance's family's house he wants to change clothes but doesn't have any. His fiance suggests that he borrow some of her brother's clothes. So far this all seems reasonable. Stiller's character then asks her to go get some of these clothes. Instead she tells him it would make more sense that even though he has yet to meet her brother he should walk into his room unannounced and feel free to root through his bureau until he finds something he wants. Would any person in their right mind ever suggest such a thing? Needless to say her brother then catches this man he doesn't know going through his underwear drawer. That's it! That's the big joke! And that is supposed to be funny! I could go on with numerous examples just as ridiculous as this that litter this movie but I've wasted enough time. If I can convince just one person not to waste the 2 hours of his or her life on this abomination of a film I will consider this exercise worth while.1 out of 10".

The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker Ben Stiller. A fatherinlaw to be is not just an overly literal and abundantlyoverbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer microscope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him or about him. This reminded me of my past inlaws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy. Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower he jokes and sez Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy. And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiance's out there.This was a one of a kind funfilled slightly bend out of shape picture with an original feel that makes it not equal to all the other cinema fare out there that 'comes and goes' with little staying power.Jay Roach is a cool and talented director. Keep up the great work. Recommended  See it with a buddy.".

	schema:headline " Meet the Parents is a mustsee!";
	schema:reviewBody "Fresh from a lackluster summer full of sophomoric films I was quite happy to have found myself in the theatre watching a sneak preview of the UniversalDreamworks picture Meet the Parents.I remember the weekend that I first met my husband's parents. Joe and I were not even engaged yet. I spent the entire weekend stressed and worried that I'd offend them they're Jewish and it was Passover weekend or make an idiot of myself.I need not have worried. In the movie Meet the Parents Ben Stiller's character Greg Focker yes that is his last name breaks all previously held records for making an ass of one's self and sets new unattainable ones albeit through not much fault of his own.The premise of this movie is simple. Greg wants to marry his girlfriend Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. However he has yet to meet her family. Pam's sister Debbie is getting married and so Greg goes along wanting to ask the father's permission since that is what Jack Pam's father would expect.Greg even packs a gorgeous two Carat ring in his carryon. Unfortunately his bag is deemed too big and it must be checked. You know at this point that they WILL lose his bag. What you don't know is all the ensuing comedy that will stem from this one incident.The humor in this film reminds me of the TV show Seinfeld. It all connects. Jerry loses luggage. However in this luggage is something that Kramer put in there that will cause...yada yada yada....which has a domino effect and POW! The audience is loving it.As was the audience that saw this sneak preview. There were many times when the movie could not be heard because people were still laughing over the last hilarious scene. They didn't give you time to catch your breath. People were laughing like I haven't heard people laugh in a theatre in a long long time. Big gigantic full body laughs. I know because I was one of them.Greg and Pam sans Greg's luggage which was lost arrive and Meet the Parents. Robert De Niro plays Jack Byrnes Pam's ex CIA interrogator father who Greg thinks is a retired rare flower dealer. Pam's mother is played with the appropriate level of ditzy dryness by Blythe Danner.Pam hurriedly tells Greg to get rid of his cigarettes because her father thinks smoking is a sign of weakness. The cigarettes are thrown to the roof. Don't forget about those because later they'll be the falling domino for future scenes that you will LOVE. Our audience was losing it.The supporting characters here are well cast. Owen Wilson has a great turn as Pam's ex Kevin. Kevin is everything that Greg is not and Pam's dad doesn't hesitate to remind everyone of that fact nonstop. I haven't laughed this much in a too long of a time. I would recommend this film without hesitation. It's smart and funny and just plain FUN. And make sure you pay attention to the last scene. It had me giggling all the way home.".

Instead of the banker powerbroker we have Stiller easily ridden by the CIA guy incidentally a John Bircher to judge from his bedtime reading. His predecessor and still competitor is a Jesusfreak. He is bested by a cat. His name is derided. Shrewdness that mainstay is replaced by spinelessness and incompetence. His bumbling destroys an altar.But he still aces his grad school test and once away from the WASPs becomes aggressive so there is some hint that underneath is a regular' Jew.

The characters are so uneven and poorly written that you don't even really care what they say or do. Things get more and more absurd and less and less funny as the film goes on and on and on and on. Clueless Director Jay Roach clearly had a vision for this film but it's a shame his crew didn't share the same vision.  It's obvious that no one knew what the hell they were doing in this atrocity besides the director.

Most of it being accidents but looking like it's Greg's fault. Because of this Pam's the girlfriend Father is very untrusting and feels like Greg is hiding something. But maybe it's the Father himself hiding something from his family.Recommended for Ben Stiller fans and Robert De Niro fans.Overall I give this movie a 7 out of 10 which in my ratings book is Great.".

But maybe it's the Father himself hiding something from his family.Recommended for Ben Stiller fans and Robert De Niro fans.Overall I give this movie a 7 out of 10 which in my ratings book is Great.";

Pam's parents are also quite the treat the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is DeNiro and Stiller who make the movie however. The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack and place them in one hilarious situation after another. The more Stiller gets in trouble the more painful it gets the better Stiller gets the more the audience laugh. There is also a part from Owen Wilson. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together as their scenes always work. The way we see DeNiro slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is timely pacing among the directors choice decision.".

The angle then shifts to the homeless with no future or hope in sight. Between the two street urchins they are both castrated from society we fall into a trance created by the lingering shots that install the feelings of horror and despair. Only towards the end does our sympathy part from the street kids and move onto the subdued homeless people. Maybe the path of the street kids will one day become that of the homeless. Or maybe the director made a film to test the stamina of a festival audience. I can tell you that at least sixty percent walked out. Maybe I don't know. Anyway it was a bit long but I still can't get those depressing images out of my mind. Maybe that was the whole aim of it to give us suburbanites a complex of some sort?".
