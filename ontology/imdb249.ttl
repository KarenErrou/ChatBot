He is now on his honeymoon with new wife Polly Bergen and guess who shows up after being rescued off a deserted island? You got it.  Doris hilariously ruins the honeymoon this was when couples waited until the honeymoon to make love YEAH RIGHT!  Anyway Polly is quite frustrated not getting any action from James Garner.  Several scenes are classics. especially when Doris poses as a Swedish Masseur and practically beats Polly to a pulp.  The best scene of all is watching Doris drive a brand new 1963 Imperial Conv. into a car wash and then accidentally putting the top down.  Don Knotts makes a funny cameo as a randy shoe salesman and Edgar Buchanan Petticoat Junction is funny as a surly Court Judge.  Thelma Ritter is always funny and she is up to par here.  This movie was apparently reworked for Doris Day after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was essentially filming the same movie when she died.  Even the sets were basically the same.  I guess 20th Century Fox needed the money after the Liz Taylor fiasco Cleopatra almost put them in bankruptcy.  Overall a very cute sexy for the era funny movie.  They don't make cute movies like this anymore.  Too bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Move Over Darling with James Garner and Doris Day which is a remake of the RKO classic My Favorite Wife is probably better known for being the end result of the disaster known as Something's Gotta Give. That of course is Marilyn Monroe's legendary last film that she never finished.Looking over the cast of the unfinished Something's Gotta Give I have to say though I don't think it would have been Monroe's greatest film the rest of the cast was pretty good. When 20th Century Fox fired Marilyn Dean Martin also quit and the whole film was scrapped. At that point it was just decided to redo the whole thing with an entire new cast and apparently no one survived the change.I also imagine that a serious rewrite would have to be done in order that a role originally cast for Marilyn Monroe could fit Doris Day. Seeing Doris on the screen I can't imagine that Chuck Connors or in Marilyn's case Tom Tryon would have been unsuccessfully trying to catch her on a desert island for five years.The story as originally written by Sam and Bella Spewack has James Garner going to court to get his first wife missing for five years after a forced ocean landing declared legally dead. He wants to marry Polly Bergen. But wouldn't you know it a Navy submarine rescues Doris Day at just that time and when she hears about Garner's new bride it's Doris off to spoil that honeymoon.Polly Bergen was just great as the picture of sexual frustration on that honeymoon. Although I can certainly see Cyd Charisse in that same spot with Dean Martin. Edgar Buchanan is great as the crusty judge who declares Doris legally dead the first time and then has all the parties and then some in court to try and untangle things. That role was supposed to go to John McGiver and certainly those two would have been different types.It goes that way up and down the cast list Don Knotts substituting for Wally Cox as the timid shoe salesman Doris has impersonate Chuck Connors so Garner won't be jealous. And I can't see much difference with Phil Silvers as opposed to John Astin as the smarmy insurance man. One thing I did notice is that there was no equivalent parts in Something's Gotta Give for Fred Clark the hotel manager and Thelma Ritter as Garner's mother. My guess is that whoever was supposed to play those roles may never have got on camera because there was no way to shoot around them.I suppose the best thing to do is not speculate but enjoy the funny comedy that did come out of all the grief 20th Century Fox had with this film. Certainly only Doris Day could convince you that in five years she never succumbed to Chuck Connors.".

	schema:headline " Another Thelma Ritter gem";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the somewhat infamous film that has the distinction of being Marilyn Monroe's final film titled Something's Got to Give however she doesn't appear in any scene of it whatsoever.  That's because by the time this film ended up being made she was sadly already dead.  Nevertheless Doris Day James Garner Polly Bergen and Don Knotts step in to replace Marilyn Dean Martin Cyd Charisse and Wally Cox and the results are simply hysterical.  This is a classic early 1960's Kennedyera screwball comedy with jokes gags comic pratfalls and the like.  Who out there will ever be able to forget Doris Day as the scheming Swedish Nurse and Thelma Ritter as the up to no good meddling motherinlaw?  Move Over Darling is a film that I like to watch at least twice a year whenever I need a good laugh.My only wish is that Rock Hudson would have teamed up with Doris yet again to reprise their earlier success of Pillow Talk.  James Garner to me always seemed a bit wooden in the role of Nicholas Arden.  Both Polly Bergen and Thelma Ritter singlehandedly steal the show.One final note in the original Something's Got To Give film that Marilyn did there was a nude swimming pool scene.  I would have liked to have seen Doris try to pull that one off but alas was it too impure for her to even think of doing in the first place?My rating 3 starsFor an excellent analysis of Marilyn Monroe's final film with 20th Century Fox check out the book Marilyn the Last Take.  You won't be disappointed trust me.".

Nevertheless Doris Day James Garner Polly Bergen and Don Knotts step in to replace Marilyn Dean Martin Cyd Charisse and Wally Cox and the results are simply hysterical.  This is a classic early 1960's Kennedyera screwball comedy with jokes gags comic pratfalls and the like.  Who out there will ever be able to forget Doris Day as the scheming Swedish Nurse and Thelma Ritter as the up to no good meddling motherinlaw?  Move Over Darling is a film that I like to watch at least twice a year whenever I need a good laugh.My only wish is that Rock Hudson would have teamed up with Doris yet again to reprise their earlier success of Pillow Talk.  James Garner to me always seemed a bit wooden in the role of Nicholas Arden.  Both Polly Bergen and Thelma Ritter singlehandedly steal the show.One final note in the original Something's Got To Give film that Marilyn did there was a nude swimming pool scene.  I would have liked to have seen Doris try to pull that one off but alas was it too impure for her to even think of doing in the first place?My rating 3 starsFor an excellent analysis of Marilyn Monroe's final film with 20th Century Fox check out the book Marilyn the Last Take.  You won't be disappointed trust me.";

The zaniness of this very 60's remake is obvious from the getgo taking a good deal of the structure of the original yet giving it a modern feel thanks to the presence of some of the biggest stars of its time and casting many great actors in smaller parts.Take the opening courtroom sequence for instance with Petticoat Junction's Edgar Buchannan as the irascible judge who declares Ms. Day legally dead and then marries his widower to the neurotic Polly Bergen. As coincidence would have it Doris has just returned from being shipwrecked on a desert island shocking her motherinlaw Thelma Ritter who faints long enough to reveal her secret thrill that the new marriage isn't valid sending Doris on her way to where the unlucky newlyweds are honeymooning. This creates a lot of confusion for the hotel staff once Garner is forced to get his back from the dead wife a room of her own so he can intelligently think of how he's going to get himself out of this jam.Garner is a perfect replacement for Cary Grant equally as dashing and very much the pictureperfect husband. While Day is more famous for her pairings with Rock Hudson I think she had equally hot chemistry with Garner although they only did one other film together The Thrill of It All the same year as this and only did a total of three with the Rock. I would also rank this higher than many of her other sex comedies of the late 50's and 60's for being consistently funny and definitely much better written not rushed together just to get another film out to take advantage of her status as top female box office star even higher than Liz Audrey Sophia Marilyn originally assigned to do this film and Debbie.Such comical gems as Fred Clark Don Knotts John Astin and Max Showalter have nice parts here and Chuck Connors is at least from the face down nice to look at as the body builder Doris was stuck on an island with. There's plenty of slapstick to keep this moving at a steady pace and a hysterical chase sequence that has Doris covered in car wash soap suds. Even if her character is a bit abrasive Bergen adds a patheticness to her that you feel sorry for her even though it is obvious that she is fighting a losing battle. Ritter gets in a few of her typical deadpan laughs and the children played by Pami Lee and Leslie Farrell are adorable. While remakes of classic screwball comedies are often a mixed bag this one scores highly even though the plot had been done over and over again. 1940's Too Many Husbands a sexually reversed version was not nearly as good as the remake and only made more palatable with campy musical numbers as 1955's Three For the Show.".

	schema:headline " How might Marilyn have played the role?";
	schema:reviewBody "Move Over Darling a remake of the 1940 screwball comedy My Favorite Wife had a long and difficult journey to the screen. It began life as a vehicle for Marilyn Monroe entitled Something's Got to Give to be directed by George Cukor. Before that film was completed however Monroe was fired for continually turning up late on set or on some occasions not turning up at all. Lee Remick was provisionally cast as Monroe's replacement but her costar Dean Martin refused to work with any actress other than Monroe. Monroe was hired again but died soon afterwards before production could restart. The studio 20th Century Fox had sunk too much money into the project to abandon it altogether so went ahead with a new director Michael Gordon new stars Doris Day and James Garner and a new title. The original title probably seemed inappropriately ironic after Monroe's tragic death.The plot is very similar to that of My Favorite Wife although the story is updated from the forties to the sixties. Day's character makes a reference to having seen the earlier film as a child although makes no reference to the strange coincidence that she and her husband have the same names as the characters in that film. The scriptwriter was probably playing games with the normal movie convention whereby remakes take place in a parallel universe in which any previous versions of the same film were never made.Like My Favorite Wife Move Over Darling is loosely based upon Tennyson's Enoch Arden hence the main character's surname. Tennyson's poem was a tragedy but both films turn the story into a comedy. The film starts with Nick Arden about to get married for the second time. The problem is that he is legally still married to his first wife Ellen. It is presumed that she died in an air crash five years ago but her body has never been found. The problem seems to have been solved when Nick persuades a Judge to declare Ellen legally dead leaving him free to marry his new fiance Bianca. Ellen however is not dead at all and has spent the last five years marooned on a desert island. Rescued by the Navy she arrives back in America on the very day of Nick and Bianca's wedding. The film then explores the complications arising from this situation.One disadvantage of this plot line is that Nick ends up married to two different women at the same time through no fault either on his part or on theirs. Now no filmmaker in 1940 could get away with making a film openly condoning bigamy or a mnageatrois and public attitudes in this respect had not shifted very much by 1963 so one of the women had to lose out. And that woman had to be Bianca whatever the tangled legalities of the situation might be the court of American public opinion was always going to rule in favour of Ellen who as the mother of Nick's children was going to be seen to have a stronger claim. So how do you make an allendshappily comedy when one of your main characters is a woman who through no fault of her own loses the love of her life? The solution found in My Favorite Wife is to concentrate on Ellen as much as possible and relegate Bianca to the sidelines. Here the solution is to hint subtly that Bianca is not a very nice person a bit of a maneater who will doubtless get over her disappointment by throwing herself at the next best man to come along.Despite its difficult birth the movie turned out to be a boxoffice success justifying Fox's decision to continue with the project after Monroe's death. It is along with The Sound of Music one of the movies credited with keeping the studio afloat after the financial debacle of Cleopatra. I would certainly prefer it to My Favorite Wife which I have always regarded as more cornball than screwball. The earlier film had its humorous moments but these mostly concerned supporting characters such as the cantankerous old judge and the creepy hotel manager obsessed with his establishment's respectability. Here the main characters join in the fun the rivalry between Day's Ellen and Polly Bergen's Bianca has a lot more edge to it than that between the rather treacly Irene Dunne and the anonymous Gail Patrick. I particularly liked the scene where Ellen posing as a Swedish masseuse gives her rival an overvigorous massage which turns into a catfight.Doris Day's virginal reputation was starting to slip a bit by the early sixties in Lover Come Back from two years earlier she had played an unmarried mother. Even in her early forties however she still counted as one of America's sweethearts and a lot of the success of the film owes something to this aspect of her character. She was the sort of actress who could sing a song as she does in the title song to this movie containing the line Make love to me! and still come across as sweet and wholesome. It would be interesting to speculate how Marilyn would have played the role had Something's Got to Give been completed. 710".

The film then explores the complications arising from this situation.One disadvantage of this plot line is that Nick ends up married to two different women at the same time through no fault either on his part or on theirs. Now no filmmaker in 1940 could get away with making a film openly condoning bigamy or a mnageatrois and public attitudes in this respect had not shifted very much by 1963 so one of the women had to lose out. And that woman had to be Bianca whatever the tangled legalities of the situation might be the court of American public opinion was always going to rule in favour of Ellen who as the mother of Nick's children was going to be seen to have a stronger claim. So how do you make an allendshappily comedy when one of your main characters is a woman who through no fault of her own loses the love of her life? The solution found in My Favorite Wife is to concentrate on Ellen as much as possible and relegate Bianca to the sidelines. Here the solution is to hint subtly that Bianca is not a very nice person a bit of a maneater who will doubtless get over her disappointment by throwing herself at the next best man to come along.Despite its difficult birth the movie turned out to be a boxoffice success justifying Fox's decision to continue with the project after Monroe's death. It is along with The Sound of Music one of the movies credited with keeping the studio afloat after the financial debacle of Cleopatra. I would certainly prefer it to My Favorite Wife which I have always regarded as more cornball than screwball. The earlier film had its humorous moments but these mostly concerned supporting characters such as the cantankerous old judge and the creepy hotel manager obsessed with his establishment's respectability. Here the main characters join in the fun the rivalry between Day's Ellen and Polly Bergen's Bianca has a lot more edge to it than that between the rather treacly Irene Dunne and the anonymous Gail Patrick. I particularly liked the scene where Ellen posing as a Swedish masseuse gives her rival an overvigorous massage which turns into a catfight.Doris Day's virginal reputation was starting to slip a bit by the early sixties in Lover Come Back from two years earlier she had played an unmarried mother. Even in her early forties however she still counted as one of America's sweethearts and a lot of the success of the film owes something to this aspect of her character. She was the sort of actress who could sing a song as she does in the title song to this movie containing the line Make love to me! and still come across as sweet and wholesome. It would be interesting to speculate how Marilyn would have played the role had Something's Got to Give been completed. 710";

I managed to see The Americanization of Emily a couple of days ago with my mom after checking that from the library and when Netflix delivered this one yesterday Mom and me saw this just a couple of hours ago. Garner plays a man about to have his previous wifeDoris Daydeclared dead after five years of disappearing from a sea accident so he can then marry Polly Bergen. But Day turns up rescued by Navy officers as she surprises motherinlaw Thelma Ritter and her two girls who are no longer babies. I'll stop there and just say that there are plenty of amusing supporting turns by familiar character actors like Edgar Buchanan as a judge Fred Clark as a hotel manager Don Knotts as a show salesman John Astin as an insurance man and Chuck Connors as someone who ended up on that island with Day. Day herself is pretty hilarious when she disguises herself as a Swedish nurse when massaging Bergen and recounting the movie My Favorite Wife of which this was a remake. The chase at the end was a bit overthetop but what the hell! I also liked it when Garner pretended to be injured in some scenes. So on that note I thought Move Over Darling was a mostly fun movie to watch as did Mom. P.S. I know this was originally supposed to be a Marilyn Monroe vehicle called Something's Got to Give and having seen the scenes that were filmed for that one it's a shame it had to be scrapped because of her personal problems that resulted in her death.".

What overshadows the production is the contemplation of what might have been had the original remake been fully realized. Doris Day and James Garner are nonetheless delightful as are the supporting players Polly Bergen and Don Knotts. The new version takes some of the implied sexiness of the original and plays it out in typical 1960s Technicolor sex comedies of the time for which Doris Day seemed to churn out in her sleep.

After asking around Toto comes up with Pero. However Pero doublecrosses Cosimo and leaves him in jail and sets up the group to do the job without him.  After they enlist the help of expert safe cracker Jerzy the group start putting down the foundations for a job that has all the hallmarks of disaster.I went to see this with the usual blaze of hype that goes with any movie the usual OTT quotes from the hacks etc.  I didn't expect too much so it was a pleasant surprise.  The plot is quite enjoyable and is enlivened by a witty but not hilarious script.  The comedy of the actual job is great and delivered well.  However I will stress that anyone who goes along with the words of Jonathon Ross I haven't laughed so hard in years' will probably be disappointed as it isn't a laugh a second.The strength of the film is in the strong cast.  There is no real star although it will be sold on Clooney and everyone carries the story and the humour.  Macy is good Rockwell is funny as always Clooney has a good cameo Washington is solid enough but I prefer Esposito when she uses her normal voice.  Gabrielle Union has a very small part but manages to be very seductive in the first of her two scenes  she is clearly going to be bigger in the next few years or so.  For me the star of the film is Michael Jeter. It's such a shame that he died not even a month ago but this is a good film to follow his loss with.  He makes many of the laughs with his pathetic yet endearing old man.  In some scenes he makes laughs out of nothing and his performance is pitch perfect.On the whole I was tickled by this film and that was enough for me.  Many will be let down as they have been told it is a laugh riot.  If you go in just expecting a bit of fun with good actors then that is what you'll get. It's very slight but it is amusing enough to justify watching.".

I thought the whole cast was suitable and found the film pretty enjoyable all in all. The opening scene with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road looking whipped and haggard caught my attention immediately. It had a way of telling you don't go away this won't be boring and it really wasn't. It turned out to be an interesting lighthearted comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat to the very end but when the ending did arrive I felt a little bit cheated....just a little bit. The events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building but at a point that I can't define it sort of levels out making the ending a slight disappointment. I reckon I expected a bigger bang of a climax but it turned out sort of lowkey. If you watch the movie with that in mind and you can live without high dosages of George Clooney you should find this flick very entertaining and well worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original Big Deal on Madonna Street but it's probably a rare find in the United States.".

Soon bad boxer Pero Mahalovic Sam Rockwell founds out the details of this so called perfect job.First of all I think this movie was very funny and from my point of view I would recommend it to everyone. This movie is remake of Italian comedy I Soliti Ignoti. I didn't watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies. But Welcome to Collinwood is great comedy for itself about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house. Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast. Really excellent movie for these actors Sam Rockwell William H. Macy great Isaiah Washington Michael Jeter great Luis Guzmn Patricia Clarkson Jennifer Esposito and finally George Clooney gave their share in this project. Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy isn't fair. This is more then that. Because of one difference. All of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked what will they do with their money? It is mostly securing their future in very humble way. This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals. And not only them but also cop Babitch who is presented like corrupted one so here directors Russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same. Actually all in Collinwood are and not only in Collinwood cause all people chase money on legal or illegal way. I don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves. But this one is exception. You have to love them all. Riley with his little baby and wife in jail. Toto with his pants. Cosimo with his line Your mother's a whore! and all others. They are just like characters in my favorite comic Alan Ford. They all trying to make some money but simply they are out of luck.

But they all did one good deed they gave money to Riley so he can get his wife out of prison. They are all heroes in my eyes cause lots of honest people wouldn't do that.";

And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen. There were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious. The cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well. I really can't say anything bad about this movie! Expcept I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!".

While ultimately fairly forgettable it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easily do they wash off? The cast all fine actors in their own right put in a great job and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie both plotwise and humorwise but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.710On a side note the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.".

Each one of them has the same reason for it. Money. One character Toto leaves poorly in abandoned hangar other guy black man Leon has a sister who is soon to be married and he needs dough for the wedding. Riley is also very poor his wife is imprisoned and he leaves alone with his baby and so on... However whole point of the movie is that robbery they looking to execute is doomed since the beginning. Only characters aren't aware of this issue. Movie reminds a bit of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in terms of style and setting but far less violent. Violence happens very rarely or almost never and when it happens it's played for laughs and when you compare that with running time 86 minutes you get very lightweight very easy film. Those two things are only criticism I have. On brighter side actors did their work tremendously and Sam Rockwell leads. I haven't watched many of his movies but he is so damn good in this. Very good. Along with George Clooney who appears in episodic role 34 minutes as safe cracker veteran who teaches our guys how to crack the safe. Of course it would be unfair if I don't mention late Michael Jetter and Luis Guzman Patricia Clarkson and Isaiah Washington. Dialogue is well written and locations are realistic. Overall movie is very enjoyable for anyone who loves crimeblack comedy features except when it ends it'll leave you wondering why hadn't lasted a bit more.".

The story has a European feel to it which shouldn't be a surprise since it's a remake of 'I Soliti Ignoti' but the Americanization is quite well done because it looks American and the jokes work very well. While there is a moderate dose of slapstick the dialogues are quite cleverly written.The slightly washed out colours and less glamorous contributes to the atmosphere and gives it an old school. The sets look like those of old Western flicks except that the cowboys are long gone. It's apparent that the story doesn't take place in modern time and I'm glad that the writers chose not to modernize it too much. The tension is maintained very well as the idiots go about attempting to carry out their plan.However the ending slightly disappoints. Given the way the story was building up I expected to end with a bang. The actual ending is quite lowkey but not a bad one.All the actors do a wonderful job. Sam Rockwell William H. Macy the late Michael Jeter and Patricia Clarkson are outstanding. They are brilliantly supported by Luis Guzman Andy Davoli Jennifer Esposito and Gabrielle Union.Overall 'Welcome to Collinwood' is hilarious and I wouldn't mind revisiting sometime in the future.".

The case was built upon their association with each other and loose allegations that the three were part of a satanic cult thanks to their preferred dark clothing and various graffiti and doodles of skeletons that were part of the group dynamic.Although not as engrossing as 1996's Paradise Lost Purgatory again presents its case of innocence by interviewing or taping experts in their fields discuss the case and with a 2007 reexamining of the evidence by authoritative members of their fields DNA forensics etc. Scattered interviews from 1994 through 2010 help assert that justice may not have been done and that stubborn individuals who had involvement in the case provided the judicial roadblocks to impede any progress.Paradise Lost 3 spends a bit more time in an assumption of another potential murderer of the three boys and they are fueled by celebrities Johnny Depp Eddie Vedder and even a member of the Dixie Chicks in their attempts to have new evidence presented and justice served.Paradise Lost 3 wrapped filming in August 2011  three days later the Memphis 3 were released from prison on a lesser charge that does not clear their innocence. Berlinger and Sinofsky informed the sold out crowd at the Toronto International Film Festival that we will be the first and the last to see this theatrical version as a new ending has since transpired which drew a loud applause from the agreeing audience.One of the real tragedies of the now trilogy of Paradise Lost films is watching three teenage boys age while in prison. They have missed out on an entire life's worth of experiences one did get married while incarcerated to a female fan and we can only hope that a followup film 10 years from now shows us how the three were able to assimilate back into society and become everything that they should and could have been had they not been wrongly accused.www.killerreviews.com".

It premiered in the Real to Reel section at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival in 2011 and is an American production which the directors coproduced with producer and director Jonathan Silberberg.In 1993 17yearold Jessie Misskelley Jr 16yearold Jason Baldwin and 18yearold Damien Echols were arrested for the murder of three eightyearold boys named Michael Moore Steve Branch and Christopher Byers. The killings were initially perceived as some kind of satanic ritual and due to Damien Echols listening to the hard rock band Metallica dressing in black clothes and being interested in occultism many of the inhabitants in the populated city in Crittenden county regarded him as a devil worshiper and a ringleader which made him a probable suspect in their eyes. Almost two decades years later these three boys who became known as The West Memphis Three are revisited by the two brave filmmakers who after learning about their case eighteen years earlier decided to make a documentary that would shed light on the city of West Memphis it's inhabitants it's law enforcement and how the faith of three young boys who a witness claimed to have seen on that spring day in 1993 with the three victims was sealed by a society who whilst afflicted by a bestial crime blinded by vengeance and in need of a scapegoat started a witchhunt.Some justice might exist after all in this lost paradise which contains interviews with people from both sides and that thanks to all those who recognized the obvious miscarriage of justice that Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky managed to document went out of their way to support Misskelley Echols and Baldwin became activists in the name of justice and saved the lives of three young men who in the worst case scenario could have ended up as the three innocent young boys who were deprived of their lives in a very horrific way.This scrutinizing documentary which is as judicial as it is humane leads this shocking provocative and heartrending true story which gained worldwide recognition in the late 1990s closer to the truth and confirms the invaluable importance of critical journalism and documentary filmmaking. A commendable poignant and to a certain extent liberating nonfictional feature about solidarity survival and human greatness which shows how much people are willing to do and how far they are willing to go for the sake of someone else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never has a documentary possessed a title of incorruptible divine accuracy. We've reached a point in time where the West Memphis Three case was in limbo or purgatory if you will. There was nothing to really say and making another documentary would inevitably recap what we already know. The case wasn't moving very fast at all and the numerous appeals requested by the three were never met by Judge Burnett.The murders of three second graders Stevie Branch Michael Moore and Christopher Byers in May 1993 was horrific and shocked the entire quiet community of West Memphis Arkansas. It was proved that belief in Satanism was occurring and the town was hellbent and frustrated to find the heartless brutes responsible for such a heinous unforgivable crime. Jessie Misskelley Jr. was arrested and interrogated for over twelve hours with no parent or attorney present in the room. Possessing an IQ of only 72 made it very clear that the response we were going to get would be shaky and murky. Only the last fortyfive minutes or so were recorded on tape and went on long enough to show Misskelley had contradicted himself on when the murders took place.During the confession Misskelley claimed to be involved with Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin two other West Memphis teenagers. Baldwin Echols and Misskelley were all arrested tried and sentenced to life in prison and Echols was placed on death row. However years after their conviction new evidence came forth  bite marks on one of the victim's heads. The three took bite impressions none of them matching the bite marks on the boy's forehead.After being denied numerous appeals in the state of Tennessee the men finally applied for a hearing with the new evidence in the Arkansas Supreme Court. A new hearing would be set for December 2011. Though unexpectedly in August 2011 the prosecutors and the defense lawyers negotiated a plea that would let the men be released from prison if they pleaded guilty but could maintain their innocence. They accept and now are free on the streets after serving 18 years and 78 days.Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory spends about fortyfive minutes recapping the events that occurred in the first two documentaries then works around the details developed in present day. We get well conducted interviews with all three men again and we see how greatly their personalities and attitudes have changed towards the world around them. Jason Baldwin who didn't speak all that much in the first two films says some of the most compelling lines in Purgatory. One of them being Our trial was guilty until proved innocent. Just sends a shiver up your spine.I've been saying all along that the trial of the three boys seemed to act more on impulse and personality traits of the boys rather than hardcore indisputable evidence from the crime scene.In Paradise Lost 2 Revelations the film danced around the fact that Christopher Byers' stepfather John Mark Byers might've had something to do with the murders. He is eerie in appearance outspoken and very suspicious on camera. Not to mention he changes his story multiple times on his whereabouts and his false teeth during the time of the murders.To make a dirty sea even gloomier Purgatory offers another option that Terry Hobbs Stevie Branch's stepfather could've be involved in the murders. His hair was found on one of the shoestrings used to hogtie one of the boys up and his story like Byers' changes drastically throughout the film. It's shocking scary and sometimes seemingly incorruptible in presentation.The more I watched of each film the more I grew sympathetic and fond of the three accused. They seem like intelligent people stuck in a merciless and unfair situation. Echols my favorite of the three is intelligent yet eclectic  a good trait in many adolescents. Sadly it got him in a boatload of trouble. More trouble than one could possibly imagine.This marks the possible end to what could very well be some of the greatest deepest most personal and up close documentaries ever captured on film. Paradise Lost isn't only focusing on a largely unfair case but it is showing the dangers and horrors of a biased system during a serious trial. Not to mention when finally released they are still baring an essence of guilt. That is not right. Justice did not prevail for these poor kids. They're free sure but are they fully innocent? That's another question.Starring Damien Echols Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin. Directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is recommended.The third installment of this documentary continues to explore the everchanging case and testimony of three convicts who were convicted as teenagers in the brutal killing of three young boys in Arkansas. Due to the dedication and research of filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky  and recent DNA evidence  the case was overturned and the three man were set free after nearly twenty years of incarceration.Some background exposition Known as the Memphis Three Damien Echols Jessie Misskelly and Jason Baldwin were three wild teenagers back in 1994. The town and jury all but convicted them by their Goth appearance and love of heavy metal music. Questionable witnesses and a shaky confession obtained by police from one of accused sent them to prison.Berlinger and Sinosky persevered as did others who feel that the verdict was unjust. Thus their first documentary Paradise Lost The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills and Paradise Lost 2 Revelations kept the story and the hopes of the Memphis Three alive. This final chapter Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory brings this sad tale to a close.While the film uses newsreel footage of the crime and court testimony plus endless interviews with the accused killers and family members and townsfolk the documentary tries to remain objective but never really does achieve that status. The film presents allegations of jury misconduct and uncovered DNA samples that can link a family member to the crime but it never investigates those findings with much clarity.  The film also could have been more effective if it included more of the aftermath once Echols Misskelly and Baldwin were released observing their individual choices once freed. Still Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory does show the power of the documentary genre and the diligent efforts of the filmmakers to make a difference in the outcome of injustice. The tragic events that grew out of this heinous crime still linger with the families.  One of the parents of the murdered boys asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science to remove the documentary from consideration as they say the film glorifies their son's killers. The film remained in competition and is nominated for Best Documentary.  Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory will linger with you too. GRADE BNOTE Visit my movie blog for more reviews www.dearmoviegoer.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't comment on the guilt or innocence of Damien Echols Jesse Misskelley and Jason Baldwin. To my knowledge there wasn't any evidence that necessarily put them at the scene of the murders. This doesn't mean I believe they're guilty but either way anything is possible. My issue with this and the other two Paradise Lost documentaries is the use of the actual crime scene photos of the three innocent eight year old murdered boys Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore. Their little innocent bodies are exposed to all viewers as if the boys would be OK with having their mutilated and bound bodies shown for all to see. Not only is that disrespectful to the memory of the three murdered little boys but it is disrespectful to their parents and relatives including siblings. I wonder how the people involved with the making of this documentary would feel if one of their family members especially an innocent child was murdered and had their horrific and so depressing crime scene photos used in a documentary. It is heartless and only used for sensationalism. Viewers of this documentary do not benefit from seeing these three beautiful little boys Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore in these graphic crime scene photos. I don't understand how no one else has commented on this fact. How is the showing of the crime scene photos OK. Don't these little boys deserve respect? Their parents should not have to know that their little boys have been exposed so graphically. I would be devastated if one of these little boys was mine and I knew that the film makers had used my son's crime scene photos in the documentaries. Everyone keeps talking about the guilt or innocence of the three convicted teenagers. I understand that they may be innocent. But no one can really know what really happened that day and the determination of the guilt or innocence of the three can only be left to our judicial system. And none of that is relevant when reviewing this documentary. These reviews are not a place for viewers to state their opinions on the guilt or innocence of the convicted. These reviews are supposed to be about the documentary itself. And let's face it viewers are only getting the final edited cut of this documentary. The documentary is not a retrial. Was this an unbiased documentary? I'm not sure. It seems to want to show that the three teenagers were wrongly convicted without actually coming out and clearly stating that. What people are forgetting is that this story is only worthy of a documentary because three innocent little boys were brutally murdered but no one wants to focus on that. The film makers know that viewers want to see a follow up on what's going on with the three convicted murderers whether we believe their guilty or not. And they know that graphic crime scene photos of the three murdered little boys combined with the sensationalism of three teens now grown men possibly wrongfully convicted will get lots of viewers. And a possible nomination which it eventually did. I just don't get it. This is just a rehashing of old news pointing fingers at other possible suspects without showing any new real evidence and reusing Metallica music because cool music sells! My advice to someone who is considering watching this documentary is that they should go into it not expecting to get any truths because no one really knows the truth except Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore and the persons who murdered them to not make judgments either for or against innocence because this documentary is not a retrial and we are only seeing what the documentary makers want us to see and to know that they will see graphic crime scene photos of three beautiful young and innocent eight year old little boys Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore. Who's looking out for them?".

My advice to someone who is considering watching this documentary is that they should go into it not expecting to get any truths because no one really knows the truth except Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore and the persons who murdered them to not make judgments either for or against innocence because this documentary is not a retrial and we are only seeing what the documentary makers want us to see and to know that they will see graphic crime scene photos of three beautiful young and innocent eight year old little boys Chris Byers Stevie Branch and Michael Moore. Who's looking out for them?";

	schema:reviewBody "A powerful if frustrating conclusion to the Paradise Lost films which chronicle the extremely questionable conviction of 3 high school aged young men for the horrible murder of three little boys. Despite the fact that the case against the three was absurdly weak seeming to be based as much on the idea that they acted 'strange' or listened to heavy metal music as in any hard evidence the strongest 'evidence' being a recanted confession given by one of the young men with an IQ of 72 who was questioned without council for 12 hours and with no recording or transcripts of what went on in the first 11 hours. And even then the confession was full of factual mistakes. This third film picks up with the men having been in prison for 15 years and finally moving towards possible exoneration under pressure on the Arkansas justice system from across the country and even the world. Mostly the film focuses on the uncovering of yet another possible 'real' killer although the 2nd film also did so and pointed convincingly at the wrong man showing just how hard it is to ever fully know the truth. It also shows the lengths to which those involved in the first trial especially the judge put their own reputation and their inability to admit error or even questions above a search for true justice. The film has it's flaws it spends a lot of time recapping the story and never seems to acknowledge how confusing the issue of guilt is as the 2nd film showed in seeming to point at the wrong man for being 'weird' just as the trial did with the 3. Also the dramatic conclusion feels tacked on and incomplete  not the fault of the filmmakers as much as of timing. The film was essentially done when the directors had to race to Memphis to film a climax that ended up more like an epilogue than it should.But this is an important document of just how easily the legal system can fail when prejudice and selfinterest come into play  as they will continue to do as long as we are human and frail creatures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certainly an interesting documentary about the highprofile case of the West Memphis Three Baldwin Echols Misskelley convicted of killing three young boys in eastern Arkansas in 1993. The documentary takes the side of the defense in saying the three teenagers WM3 were railroaded through based on flimsy evidence. The verdict in 1994 was probably unjust given the general absence of forensic evidence at the time. More recently DNA evidence shows no DNA connection between the three teenagers and the three young victims. On the other hand the program excludes some of the prosecution's case which shows blatant bias on the part of the program's producers.In contrast bias appears much more pronounced in the legal system in 1993 and included police coercion sloppy police work and obvious jury misconduct among other problems. The small town of West Memphis was overwhelmed with emotional hysteria of family and neighbors all wanting revenge for the killings. The police were out to convict the easiest target and the prosecutor wanted a quick win and was facilitated by a judge who was anything but unbiased. No DNA testing was available back then.At one point in the program Misskelley says he was at a Dyess Arkansas wrestling match at the time of the murders. So how is it that the prosecutor was able to convince a jury that Misskelley was guilty? Instead of answering the alibi question the program proceeds down a different investigative avenue.That is one glaring problem in a program that overall does not flow well. It jerks back and forth between people and time periods. There are so many people involved in this case it's hard to keep track of names and faces. I also didn't like the inclusion of Hollywood celebrities who despite their lack of involvement in the original trials think they can determine the three guys' innocence via superficial arguments and secondary sources which reeks of celebrity arrogance.Despite the documentary's biased point of view in favor of the WM3 and despite how the program is put together it is worth watching. By inference it shows how the jury system is rigged against a defendant in a murder trial. In the future one would hope that juries will be outlawed and replaced by forensic evidence only correctly obtained and tested that proves innocence or guilt. Having hysterical people render life and death decisions based on the games lawyers play is truly frightening.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been 16 years and two sequels since I saw the first Paradise Lost documentary at the Film Forum in New York City. I'm glad the wrongfully accused are set free but I still feel the truth rots a in dark incarcerated place. I remember that the first documentary a compelling story of wrong compounded by wrong was also a frustratingly unthorough piece of journalism. The synopsis is that in 1993 three eight year old boys were murdered and thrown in a ditch in West Memphis Arkansas. Three teenage boys to be nicknamed the West Memphis 3 were convicted of the murders under highly questionable investigatory and judicial procedures. The first film fell well short for me in providing a sufficient account of the prosecution's so called case. A year after seeing the first PL the friend I went to see it with called me up and said I heard those documentary guys made it all up to make the teenagers look good. When you hear the whole story they are totally guilty. Really? What's your source? None really. Is there a whole story? I have always been convinced that the teenagers were railroaded. But after years of sequels cultlike public outrage websites Eddie Vedder and Johnny Depp I still have no idea what happened back in 1993. If the WM3 were not murdering cub scouts that night in 1993 where were they? None of these films have ever discussed an alibi. If a documentary is presenting itself as the balanced account of its subject matter and one side of the argument is being left out there must be a reason. I can't speculate the reason because facts in this case have always been overshadowed by emotions selfrighteousness on behalf of the WM3 supporters stubborn obfuscation by law enforcement and repeated attempts by the filmmakers to offer alternative accusations that frankly are as shoddy and irresponsible as the lousy case against the teenagers. There is another feature documentary West Of Memphis in circulation as well as many TV magazine pieces which may provide more information. I'd like to know if there is more to know about what happened the night those young boys were murdered and I'd like to know more about what the police actually had on the WM3. In Purgatory the defense has gone to all the trouble of pulling together world renown criminal profilers and DNA experts. Yet the new documentary doesn't reveal one thing we didn't already know. These films succeeded in calling attention to injustice perpetrated on the accused and the fact that the real killer will never be brought to justice. The Arkansas court system created an outcome in which the case will never be reopened. The whole story is fascinating and sad but these movies aren't very good either.".

	schema:reviewBody "The temporary grand finale to one of the cases of the last few decades. Recapping the story about the West Memphis Three Damien Wayne Echols Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin a trio of outcast youth convicted for the murder of three schoolkids in the woods near Memphis. Back in 1993 a wild witch or more truthfully satanist hunt was initiated pinning the whole gruesome murders onto darkclad heavyrock listening youth with a individualist spirit. Echols was deemed the ringleader Baldwin was made guilty by association while Misskelley was the victim of police coercion and forced testimony. Together all suspects were sentenced with Echols being gifted a death verdict.Throughout the years Paradise Lost has served as a saving grace for the three young boys most likely wrongly convicted of any crime  almost all family members of the victims agree to this point of view. Eleven years after the second part was filmed this could well be the last part in this conviction of a corrupt legal system who sentenced kids to hefty punishments based on prejudice and hearsay. To the most part Paradise Lost 3 serves well as a source of information regarding the whole sequence of events strongly insinuating the innocence of the accused. Largely relying on traditional storytelling methods the documentary basically hits home its message without really exerting too much emotional involvement  a stark contrast to the previous parts.The weakest link here seems however the need to focus on answering the question If the West Memphis Three were innocent than who committed these heinous acts? Much to the detriment to the overall trilogy. Many years ago part 2 strongly implicated John Mark Byers the father of one of the victims as the murderer most likely wrongfully so based on flimsy evidence and misconceptions. Despite not learning from that failure in connect the dots Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory goes even further in its damnation of Terry Hobbs stepfather of another boy as the most likely suspect.

	onyx:emotionText "The temporary grand finale to one of the cases of the last few decades. Recapping the story about the West Memphis Three Damien Wayne Echols Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin a trio of outcast youth convicted for the murder of three schoolkids in the woods near Memphis. Back in 1993 a wild witch or more truthfully satanist hunt was initiated pinning the whole gruesome murders onto darkclad heavyrock listening youth with a individualist spirit. Echols was deemed the ringleader Baldwin was made guilty by association while Misskelley was the victim of police coercion and forced testimony. Together all suspects were sentenced with Echols being gifted a death verdict.Throughout the years Paradise Lost has served as a saving grace for the three young boys most likely wrongly convicted of any crime  almost all family members of the victims agree to this point of view. Eleven years after the second part was filmed this could well be the last part in this conviction of a corrupt legal system who sentenced kids to hefty punishments based on prejudice and hearsay. To the most part Paradise Lost 3 serves well as a source of information regarding the whole sequence of events strongly insinuating the innocence of the accused. Largely relying on traditional storytelling methods the documentary basically hits home its message without really exerting too much emotional involvement  a stark contrast to the previous parts.The weakest link here seems however the need to focus on answering the question If the West Memphis Three were innocent than who committed these heinous acts? Much to the detriment to the overall trilogy. Many years ago part 2 strongly implicated John Mark Byers the father of one of the victims as the murderer most likely wrongfully so based on flimsy evidence and misconceptions. Despite not learning from that failure in connect the dots Paradise Lost 3 Purgatory goes even further in its damnation of Terry Hobbs stepfather of another boy as the most likely suspect. Even though the evidence is purely circumstantial several of the people involved in the movie pinpoint the man as the perpetrator dedicated a misguided prolonged segment to his person. Whether or not Hobbs is guilty remains a mystery best solved by forensic scientists and in court not by documentary filmmakers who have basically replicated the same sin committed by the courts that sentenced the teenage threesome implication based on prejudice and halftruths or unknowns.

Be thankful that we don't have the clowns in our courts that were involved in the court case that sent The West Memphis three to prison back in 1993 and who still have influence as to the outcome of the lives of these three innocent men. This is the third film of The Paradise Lost documentaries about three men sent to prison for the murder of three 8 year old boys back in 1993. It starts by covering some old ground that we have seen in the first two films then follows the fight to get the men  they were only teenagers when it happened freed and even has insight into who possibly could have been the real killer.I have found all three documentaries fascinating but his one has to be the best of the lot. It is still immensely harrowing because it shows very upsetting scenes of crime footage of the dead 8 year old boys  and i still question why we need to see those pictures  and because of new DNA techniques it comes some way to helping the three who incarcerated  but not in a way that is satisfactory.It shows up the deep flaws in the American justice system and how blinkered these ageing judges are that have the fate of so many people in their wrinkled little hands.You don't have to have seen the first two films because it quite self explanatory as to what has happened and i recommend that everyone gets to see this fascinated film.

	schema:reviewBody "By the end of this series of films by Joe Berlinger and sadly the late Bruce Sinofsky we have gone through a long journey full of missed or more accurately botched opportunities by the Arkansas legal system on multiple fronts to find the three men at the time teenagers innocent. And it's hard to argue that they were despite what comes out at the end but I'll come to that in a moment. There's still Metallica on the soundtrack though I wonder if 'Bittersweet Symphony' would have been too on the nose.Part three is mostly set ten to eleven years after the events of the second 'Paradise Lost' movie and a lot has changed in the years since the new millennium came around and things like new statutes in the state and new evidence peaks its head into existence and better legal defenses for the three as well. But there are many surprises the greatest and most unexpected one is a complete 180 from how one saw John Mark Byers. It may speak to the potential for the filmmakers being manipulative going from positing him as a villain to something of a redeemed person but it seems a little more complex than that. One may forget watching this film it isn't mentioned directly that at the end of part 2 Byers was off to prison. Maybe that changed him. Or just ten years and that monumental press conference with the host of legal experts  one from the FBI and one involved in the Ted Bundy case  can change a person's mind. But one of the things that's so absorbing this time around is how Byers previously a Character with a capital C one may or may not think watching part 2 he'd be capable of the crimes it's left up in the air almost by how forceful he was in it uses his knack for being outspoken for the side of the innocent which he believes now they are the dead wife is not mentioned but that's another story altogether.If there's one small criticism of the film is that there's a lot of footage from the past two films with the first one shown from the original negatives hence why they look so scratchy. But I think it's a necessary narrative angle since by this point there may be people coming to this documentary who may have not seen the other films in a while or presumably given the nature of channelflipping TV and ADD to bring things up and make it a complete narrative. I actually appreciated the use of footage here more than in part 2 and it helped to make a pointcounterpoint method for the first half of the film so much time has passed after all that the new experts and lawyers and people of that nature could comment on this or that that was presented before from the alleged occult symbols basically debunked here as BS or most of all the lack of DNA.There's so much that comes down in this film that if one comes away at the end and still thinks Echols Baldwin and Misskelley killed all three of the boys in 1993 then well at the least there's little room for any reasonable doubt in your mind based on ALL of the evidence and as the chapter heading goes here All is All. But perhaps the thing that will make me revisit this film over time is the fact that the potential  actual  killer comes up as a different father Terry Hobbs and while on the surface seeming to be less of a Force of Nature like Mark he's actually an even more fascinating person to just stare at. Which by the way you get a lot of time for via deposition videos the audience basically gets to see up front what this guy is all about as far as his actual character. I really loved how the filmmakers didn't have to dig too deep to find moments that revealed this person in a whole new light than one saw in part 1 indeed I want to revisit that first part almost immediately to see if any of the signs were there those little smirks the bullish expressions and if they were hard to miss.Ultimately the West Memphis 3 were freed but it was based in layman's terms on the justice system saying 'eh get the hell out of here.' The Alford Plea let the men out all now in their 30's but the catch is that they can say they're innocent but plead guilty. One of the things that makes the form of documentary filmmaking so unpredictable and so vital and in moments like these so highly charged that it would be difficult to possibly take as a drama are the turns a story could take. And yet in the Paradise Lost series all the way through the end of this saga there's this sense that the entire Justice system from the police to the prosecutors probably they come off not quite AS bad as everyone else but close enough to the jurors or that one juror for sure to the unmovable judge himself it's all set up to say 'we are right and you are wrong.' There are incredible and serious implications and questions that are raised due to what can be read very easily in this story and a lot of it has to do with class would these men have been put away if they came from families outside of trailer parks and lowincomes and status the 'blackSatanoccult BS. It's a sobering harrowing tragic story and it's all told by these directors with clarity and focus and urgency.".

Purgatory picks the case up ten years after the second entry Revelations to find the case in a neverending loop of denied appeals by original Judge David Burnett.

It reveals poor research by the original lawyers working for the defendants and general ineptitude by basically everyone involved back in 199394.Purgatory commits the same sin as Revelations as suspicion moves from a noticeably more subdued John Mark Byers  who is now a supporter of the West Memphis Three and penpal to Echols  to Terry Hobbs stepfather of Stevie Branch. Although accusations don't come from character alone but instead stem from a hair found within the knot of the shoelace with which the boys were hogtied with and some alarming inconsistencies in Hobbs' story. But ironically this is something for the court to pursue and not documentary filmmakers. The ending which sees the West Memphis Three released from prison but not with their innocence intact comes out of nowhere as filming had already wrapped when the court called the plea appeal. For a more satisfying closure to the story I would recommend West of Memphis 2012 which gives a more detailed account of their release and also a more focused and detailed investigation of Hobbs. Still it's a relief to finally watch these three walk free even though it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

This film picks up as the West Memphis Three try to get a retrial after new evidence shows that they didn't have anything to do with the crime. PARADISE LOST 3 is to me anyways the weakest of the three films but it's still an extremely good movie that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. I thought it was a mistake giving everyone such a long replay of the previous two events. I understand since this was released a decade after the previous film that some people might need to have their minds refreshed but I thought there was a little bit too much use of older footage. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the three were released out of no where and the filmmakers were somewhat rushed to get this film done and released. With that said there's no question that the entire case is something that was just so interesting due to all the possible wrong doings twists in the story and of course the fact that you had three people claiming to be innocent. A few things really struck me in this film including how they pretty much point the finger at one of the murdered children's stepfather. It seems this evidence has everyone convinced that he's guilty yet the second film also pointed a finger at someone who turned out to be innocent. Instead of all the backstory given to us again it would have been far more interesting to hear about the possible killer more and if it's not this guy and it's not the WM3 then someone is still out there free. I'm not sure if there will be a fourth film in the series or not but it's clear that the documentary series got their mission done by the three men being released but lets hope someone steps up to the plate to try and figure out who the killer really is.".

I understand since this was released a decade after the previous film that some people might need to have their minds refreshed but I thought there was a little bit too much use of older footage. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the three were released out of no where and the filmmakers were somewhat rushed to get this film done and released. With that said there's no question that the entire case is something that was just so interesting due to all the possible wrong doings twists in the story and of course the fact that you had three people claiming to be innocent. A few things really struck me in this film including how they pretty much point the finger at one of the murdered children's stepfather. It seems this evidence has everyone convinced that he's guilty yet the second film also pointed a finger at someone who turned out to be innocent. Instead of all the backstory given to us again it would have been far more interesting to hear about the possible killer more and if it's not this guy and it's not the WM3 then someone is still out there free. I'm not sure if there will be a fourth film in the series or not but it's clear that the documentary series got their mission done by the three men being released but lets hope someone steps up to the plate to try and figure out who the killer really is.";

There were some interesting facts about this suspect but the film includes calls to the police to look into this guy more.Even though it did start to drag a little the ending of this movie has a feel of watching history.

The children even when they are behaving like little monsters are gorgeous. The lead actress is gorgeous. There is so much obvious and intentional gorgeousness about this picture that we have to dig far down past the scene painting to find the story.Although subtitled Grazia's island Grazia is the lead role magnificently realised by Valeria Golino Respiro could have well been called Scenes from rural Sicilian life as the scenography cinematography and tableauxlike imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro's locale is Lampedusa a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta this place is about as remote as it gets  Tunis is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea the children play women pack fish old blackclad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky.The story is fairly typical the type that a few great and many many average Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations  life in the sun drenched rural ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since Cinema Paradiso?Grazia incidentally the name means grace  get it? is a loving rebellious humanist  she loves her children she loves music she loves swimming in her panties she loves the Vespapropelled wind in her hair and loathes the suffering of any living creature. She does not love to cook or put on rubber wellies and plastic smock to pack sardines. This highspirited recklessness is just a bit too much for this dusty place and she is duly deemed mad. Golino who acts in four languages and has had decent parts in Leaving Las Vegas Immortal Beloved and Frida is a joy to watch. There is not a moment forced or unnatural about her performance and this is saying a fair bit considering her several mad scenes. She conveys brilliantly the purgatory of a loving woman who wants more but knows neither what it is nor how to get it.After two incidents one just a bit lusty the other bordering on a bit off it is decided by the meddling crones and village busybodies to send Grazia off to a sanatorium in Milan which might as well be Mars. She will have no part of this and her 13yearold son hides her in a secluded cave. Her ensuing escape seclusion and discovery offer us some more gorgeous imagery and displays the motherly bonding quite well. Yes the imagery does go a bit down the obvious biblical redemptive female roads but it well handled. Water which has played quite a large role in the director's concept stars in a few more scenes. It also features in the film's ending which is spiritual gorgeous and inconclusive in the same breadth. Love and human devotion may win but this gal is not going to be packing sardines for much longer!The movie considering the almost rudimentary story line is incredibly rich. The smallest characters are well defined and there is wonderful juxtaposition between formal Italian and the coarse regional dialect. Much of the cast is so natural you could believe them to be locals.  The essence of life in such a village is well captured and the relationships within a family are well explored as well. And there is enough of the magical landscape of the place to make you want to board the next Alitalia jet. For a visit that is.".

The film is like other very good Italian films in that it features a simple story wonderful characters lots of 'couleur locale' and very good actors. And then add some very nice shots and a superb location.If I was reading this I would start to fear for a film that gets lost in its niceness and remains too light. But not Respiro or Lampedusa after the island it was filmed at. Already in the opening scenes it is made clear that there is a lot of violence and suspense in the air. Not that there is any blood to be seen in this film. There is a lot of fighting between groups of young boys and the adults defend their honor with physical violence but things never get really mean.Between the beauty of the island and the harshness of existence on it walks no floats one woman named Grazia. The camera loves her her sons love her and even the other islanders love her. But she too different too nonconforming to be tolerated in the long run.In an interesting twist it is not Grazia but her son Pasquale who is the story teller in this film. We see things through his eyes and it is only through him that we get to know his wonderful but mysterious mother. Like the rest of the village Pasquale is torn between convention and love for her. With him being a 13 or so year old in a very traditional family it is totally believable that we see Pasquale commanding his mother to not swim in the sea in one scene and adoringly follow her in the next.And this sums up the film for me A simple but beautiful story with an undercurrent of critique or bewilderment at the traditional family style and its low tolerance for being different a very positive outlook and a love for life which is shared by all and reflected in the end of the movie and beautiful and sometimes magical atmosphere which is the most difficult thing ever to create in a movie.Go see this movie!PS I you like this movie consider seeing Blier's Un deux trois soleil which is so obscure that I wanted to mention it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emanuele Crialese's Respiro is alive sensual and transcendent. Set in Lampedusa an island southwest of Sicily it is a film about mothers and sons accepting differences and the power of love to bring renewal and reconciliation. Gorgeously filmed by cinematographer Fabio Zamarion Respiro captivates us with its bright Mediterranean sunlight and the expressive faces of the people tanned and strikingly beautiful. Winner of the 2002 Cannes Critics Week award the film is based on a local legend about a mother whose behavior was found to be offensive by the community and whose subsequent disappearance was the catalyst that brought the people together. Crialese's film has the feeling of myth and legend but also the overtones of the great Italian realist dramas of the 50s and 60s. As gangs of unsupervised preteens carry out intermittent warfare among the desolate beaches and rocky landscapes everyday life centers on fishing. While the husbands do the fishing wives work in the fish processing plant and the boys help out their fathers and catch fish to use as trade for a chance to win an electric train set. Grazia Valeria Golino is the wife of macho but loving fisherman Pietro Vincenzo Amato and mother of three 13year old Pasquale Francesco Casisa younger brother Filippo Filippo Pucillo and older sister Marinella Veronica D'Agostino. Golina is radiant as the headstrong young mother and Casisa's performance as Pasquale completely captures the budding sexual awareness of a preteen. The film reflects the warmth of the Italian family and the closeness that Italian sons feel for their mothers but also depicts the oldfashioned attitudes of the tightknit community especially the subjugation of women.In a revealing scene Pasquale's brother the adorable but mouthy Filippo and his friends follow his older sister Marinella to a private meeting place where she is seeking privacy with a shy young policeman Pier Luigi Elio Germano. Affronted by their seeming public display of affection Filippo less than half their size confronts the two lovers and threatens to beat them up unless his sister goes home immediately. Unfortunately everything is not right on the island. Grazia's behavior is increasingly defined by erratic mood swings. She flings dishes across the room swims naked with her sons and releases a herd of dogs from captivity but it is not clear if she is ill or just rebellious and the film walks a tightrope between suggesting madness or the eccentricities of a free spirit. It is soon apparent that the community has their own thoughts about her actions and she is seen as a threat to the social order. When Grazia's antics threaten to reach the breaking point Pietro's family decides to send her to Milan to receive psychiatric treatment. Pasquale however always understanding and protective of his mother hides her in one of the many caves along the rocky shore bringing her food and reporting news of the search for her whereabouts. The ending can be interpreted in many different ways but I was touched by its haunting beauty. Is it to be taken literally a dream of Pasquale's perhaps or a fairy tale constructed from legend? I'm not sure but in any case Respiro's combination of magic realism natural beauty and humanistic message will have you pricing the tickets for a trip to Lampedusa.".

The ending can be interpreted in many different ways but I was touched by its haunting beauty. Is it to be taken literally a dream of Pasquale's perhaps or a fairy tale constructed from legend? I'm not sure but in any case Respiro's combination of magic realism natural beauty and humanistic message will have you pricing the tickets for a trip to Lampedusa.";

This is a very arid place with almost no vegetation at all. The heat obviously must be oppressive as the sun punishes this land and its people constantly to the point that children act as savages as proven by the opening scenes.Among these rascals are Pasquale and Filippo the sons of Grazia the housewife at the center of the story. She lives in her own world. She is a rebel and a free soul. Grazia's actions are seen as madness by her husband Pietro and his mother who lives next door. It is the classic family from forgotten towns such as this where everyone knows everyone's business. The only solution for Grazia's problems is to send her away to a Milan institution that perhaps will turn her into a vegetable. Her only sin is to be different therefore she is the town's eccentric. All her neighbors think she's a lunatic.By Grazia withdrawing from the world she appears to be a maladjusted person which she isn't. She just loves to be free swimming is her passion and her life running around the island in her scooter is another form of freedom from the realities of home. In trying to escape her lot in life Grazia discovers how much her son Pasquale loves her. The final scenes after the disappearance with the search party on the beach are typical of the same society that condemned Grazia but never took steps to show her any kindness. The miracle that occurs at the end is that perhaps Pietro realizes that in spite of his wife's apparent madness he has found how much he really needs her.This is a simple story told with a sure hand by the director who also wrote the screen play.Valeria Golino who has spent a few years in minor roles in Hollywood is very effective as Grazia. She shows a great range of emotions under the sure direction of Crialese. It is amazing no one has made anything worth of Ms. Golino's talent or that she has been forgotten by the Italian cinema or that no one has come to her with projects such as this film.As her husband Vincenzo Amato is very effective. Also Francesco Casisa as Pasquale makes a splendid appearance. This young man with the proper guidance has the potential of making a big splash in the Italian cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "RESPIRO is a lovely and intriguing film set on the lonely Mediterranean island of Lampedusa between Sicily and Tunisia. The main character is Grazia played by the marvelously beautiful Valeria Golino. She is a mother with a few problems connecting with reality a wayward independent spirit who attracts the ire of the islanders especially the women who view her almost as a witch and her husband Pietro Vincenzo Amato who is at his wit's end. It is a theme it shares in common with Tornatore's MALENA made in 2000. Grazia has three children a lovely daughter who is attracted to and attracted by a policeman from the mainland and two adoring sons whose affection is overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They spend much of their energies comforting their mom defending her against verbal attacks supplying her with food when she goes off into hiding from those who want to send her to Milan for treatment which in truth she probably could use. The rest of the time they are chasing birds hanging out on the main drag with the girls and other friends. Pantsing each other on the beach seems to have become one of the island's most common sporting activities among the young. What I like most about the movie besides the appealing scenery was the interrelations of the characters the humor petty gossips the impromptu emotional outbursts the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous the older Pasquale Francesco Casisa is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo Filippo Pucillo has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure as is his littlebrotherasbigbrother protectiveness of his sister from the policemanfriend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years.The mysterious end evocative ending in which Grazia believed drowned emerges from the water's depths on Saint Bartolo's Day is quite beautifully conceived. Fine too are the musical score by John Surman and the precise and suggestive direction by Emanuele Crialese. I enjoyed this film so much I went to see it several times.".

Grazia the catalyst character of the story a restless married woman of unusual habits is considered a nut an irresponsible person who can't participate fully in the life of society being forced into total imagination.

In this forgotten land where the younger brothers strive to safeguard the reputation of their mothers the alienated Grazia played by a touching and wonderful Valeria Golino generally considered to be either a very wretched woman or even worse a lunatic one is eager to undertake a journey towards the complete fulfillment of her hopes yearning for the sight of her deep blue sea complying with her inner desire for emancipation.

	schema:reviewBody "... I am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of Respiro. Among other things what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part. Respiro seems made with an all too contrived and selfaware intent to be artistic symbolic spiritual provocative metaphorical... mythical even. But luckily for all true artists out there a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist. Stunning natural locations yes these remote parts of Southern Italy look exotic even to most other Italians pretty actors and some amusing gutsy spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a substanceless movie beyond a pretty succession of images. Yet this insincere and vain and ultimately hollow movie aches to be art succeeding only to a very limited extent perhaps in some cases by accident. I'll admit that the conceptually pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it. However it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the Lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water connecting it to so much that's mythical mystical religious archetypical etc than with Crialese's talent.Valeria Golino is gratingly histrionic and affected in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background she sure has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering floaty floral dresses and attractive sunkissed beach hair could have graced the pages of any Vogue summer edition. The fact she was a nutcase could in a way have been nothing but a fashionable addition to her trendy demeanour and look  that's how skindeep her condition seemed to me. Golino's twodimensional stereotype of the innocent natural childwoman misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worse while leaving me unmoved and indifferent at best. I agree with the reviewer from London who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema  during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of Grazia's illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a free spirit. We don't know why she's given injections and is required to see a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main telltale signs of the movie's overall shallowness.Another fairly insulting aspect of Respiro is the quaintification of its location. I struggled to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of Italy by comparison seem a dozen times quainter and more conveniently primitive than it actually is. Again this smacks of shallowness and a complete lack of sincerity on Crialese's part. Some nonItalian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque backwardness the clich of the possessive macho Italian man as if it were commonplace so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s the question I'd like to ask David Ferguson the reviewer from Dallas Texas is as follows is YOUR country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? OK then why should mine be?. Unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view Italy in such an anachronistic way that aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of THIS Italian viewer. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexistbutlovinghusband routine. I especially loathed the scene in which Grazia joins her husband and male friend in some mantoman banter over a bottle of beer to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure. According to this movie it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations. Ah but our loveable freespirit is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive unwritten rules of Lampedusan patriarchy! Not only does this scene depict something so fake it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility. It also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say otherwise.For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian filmmaker one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of Italy's glorious cinematic past which alas isn't the shadow of its former self! look no further than Gianni Amelio  especially Lamerica Cos Ridevano and his latest La Stella Che Non C'. Unlike most contemporary Italian cinema sadly derivative and stagnant Amelio's is a fresh and independently creative voice. Despite my scathing review of Respiro I am now more than willing to believe that Crialese's latest Nuovomondo now showing in Italian cinemas will be a worthwhile one. I therefore look forwards to enjoying it though it won't be overly shocking to me if I don't considering my feelings for Respiro!.".

Some nonItalian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque backwardness the clich of the possessive macho Italian man as if it were commonplace so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s the question I'd like to ask David Ferguson the reviewer from Dallas Texas is as follows is YOUR country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? OK then why should mine be?. Unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view Italy in such an anachronistic way that aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of THIS Italian viewer. The subtly incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexistbutlovinghusband routine. I especially loathed the scene in which Grazia joins her husband and male friend in some mantoman banter over a bottle of beer to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure. According to this movie it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations. Ah but our loveable freespirit is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive unwritten rules of Lampedusan patriarchy! Not only does this scene depict something so fake it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility. It also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say otherwise.For a truly accomplished contemporary Italian filmmaker one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of Italy's glorious cinematic past which alas isn't the shadow of its former self! look no further than Gianni Amelio  especially Lamerica Cos Ridevano and his latest La Stella Che Non C'. Unlike most contemporary Italian cinema sadly derivative and stagnant Amelio's is a fresh and independently creative voice. Despite my scathing review of Respiro I am now more than willing to believe that Crialese's latest Nuovomondo now showing in Italian cinemas will be a worthwhile one. I therefore look forwards to enjoying it though it won't be overly shocking to me if I don't considering my feelings for Respiro!.";

This comeon suggests that the film is a delightful comedy when in fact it is nothing of the sort.Despite its occasional spellbinding glimpses of a paradiselike oceanbeach setting the film is quite dismal in tone.  Not only are the characters not likable they in fact occasionally demonstrate behavior one could easily term despicable.Grazia is sort of a wacked possibly bipolar individual who is uncomfortably tolerated by her family and the other townspeople.  Her actions are not clearly motivated in any story sense by any qualities of character we hope to see.  Rather they are more a random expression of a toopersonal insanity which does not lend itself either to character progression or to any kind of self or audience revelation.  Late in the film she even resorts for no justifiable reason to slapping her child on the face twice without apology which eradicates any hope of liking this person we may have held out for thus far.On the other hand Grazia's husband either accommodates her madness or ignores her.

Human insights into these minor characters which would redeem them are glaringly lacking despite the fact that much of the film is taken up with long drawnout irrelevant subplots about them.Oddly about the only potentially likable and impressionable character is a young police officer new to the town who recognizes Grazia's illness for what it is and respondsreacts appropriately.I found this film to be long boring and tedious consistently mistaking activity and documentary with action and meaning.  Its 95 minutes seemed almost twice that.The ending though evidently calculated to evoke much meaning and feeling and which potentially could have succeeded is instead empty of these things.

	schema:headline " An interesting and beautiful look at life in a small closeknit community but it does need a certain amount of patience";
	schema:reviewBody "In a small Italian fishing village the community is very close knit and gossip starts easily about anyone who upsets the status quo. So it is that the freespirited ways of Grazia make her stand out from the other women in the village who are married to the fishermen and keep their children. As she continues to set tongues wagging and frustrating her husband as a result Pietro starts to think that perhaps the time is right for her to see a specialist to treat her and if necessary section her. Getting wind of her fate Grazia heads off and is taken to a hiding place by her son Pasquale in the rocks above the beach.Those looking for a plot that is as strong as I have suggested would do well to just watch the final 30 minutes of this film because it is only then that this storyline is brought out. When it does eventually come it is interesting and it builds on the things that have been done in the first hour in regards subtexts and relationship dynamics but I have to mention the fact that for many viewers the first hour does have the potential to drag and seem irrelevant. To some extent I did fall into this camp because I thought that the subtexts had been well enough developed before the hour mark and that this aspect could have been worked into a story better. However it still manages to set up the downside of small village life  a world where women are seen as lesser even little brothers boss around older sisters men are the all and even minor things can spark off gossip and rumours it is a place that flies in stark contrast to the beautiful scenery and idyllic setting that the director shows us. This presentation does establish the final third well and although it does need some patience it does work very well.It may be used as a contrast with the people but the direction is very impressive in terms of use of scenery and the framing of shots it is very beautiful at times and it does help to highlight the disparity between the setting and the society. Golino is pretty good in the lead role  pretty and free enough to convince as a character but perhaps a bit too young looking to have had so many kids of such ages she does look a bit like a movie producer's idea of what an Italian mother of three looks like. Casisa is good but he seems to have brought out a strange semisexual chemistry with Golino if this was deliberate then it I'm not sure why maybe I was just seeing something that wasn't there. Amato is effective as the husband  he seems to be frustrated not by his wife but by what others see in his wife in this regard he fits the bill perfectly.Overall this is an enjoyable film but it is not perfect and viewers should be prepared for the fact that the plot comes out almost reluctantly in the final third of the movie. Up till this time we have a thematic exploration of village life that is interesting but does require a bit of forgiving patience because it could easily have been done in less time or interwoven with a tighter story.".

	onyx:emotionText "In a small Italian fishing village the community is very close knit and gossip starts easily about anyone who upsets the status quo. So it is that the freespirited ways of Grazia make her stand out from the other women in the village who are married to the fishermen and keep their children. As she continues to set tongues wagging and frustrating her husband as a result Pietro starts to think that perhaps the time is right for her to see a specialist to treat her and if necessary section her. Getting wind of her fate Grazia heads off and is taken to a hiding place by her son Pasquale in the rocks above the beach.Those looking for a plot that is as strong as I have suggested would do well to just watch the final 30 minutes of this film because it is only then that this storyline is brought out. When it does eventually come it is interesting and it builds on the things that have been done in the first hour in regards subtexts and relationship dynamics but I have to mention the fact that for many viewers the first hour does have the potential to drag and seem irrelevant. To some extent I did fall into this camp because I thought that the subtexts had been well enough developed before the hour mark and that this aspect could have been worked into a story better.

	schema:reviewBody "Grazia wonderfully acted by Valeria Golino and her fisherman husband Pietro Vincenzo Amato and three kids live in a Sicilian coastal village on the island Lampedusa. We see the family and coastal life through the eyes of the eldest son Pasquale Francesco Casisa. It is not an easy life the denizens of this island are not rich. Yet the townspeople manage and even seem happy. The kids have fights and squabbles as in every community all share the good and the bad times. However there hangs a dark cloud over the family Grazia occasionally acts erratically and impulsively. Sometimes lovingly and helpful at other times withdrawn and with unsettling antisocial behaviour. Is she just an individualistic freespirit or is some underlying mental issue affecting her behaviour? Her meddling relatives and other townsfolk think she should be sent for treatment in a psychiatric institution in Milan. Even her loving husband Pietro is eventually convinced that it will be better if she goes for treatment. Grazia doesn't understand their attitude why is she to be sent away from her home the family and island she knows and loves? Protective Pasquale does not agree that his mother should be sent away against her wish and decides to help her. She won't go to Milan if he can prevent it.The narrative seems deceptively simple but don't be fooled. A lot is suggested 'said' without words through behaviour body language facial expressions. The ambiguous ending one of the film's strong points provides lots of food for thought. This is certainly not one of those 'easy' films spoonfeeding the viewer.I found the characters of Grazia Pietro and Pasquale three dimensional but not without some equivocality about them adding a layer of complexity. The actors who performed their roles did an excellent job.The cinematography is outstanding juxtaposing the beauty of the island Lampedusa with the tough reality of people trying to make a living in this rocky and rather unforgiving landscape. The mysterious and evocative ending is stunning a graceful aquatic dance accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful baritone saxophone melody. 'Respiro' is a film that can be experienced on more than one level. It could just be an eyepleasing visit to an exotic locality where you view the locals from a distance. Alternatively as in my case it could be found to be filled with unsettling poignancy where the viewer gets dragged right into the film. And where you have to evaluate the conflict between the right to be just yourself with the 'interest' of the larger community as projected by meddling 'dogooders'. 'Respiro' is a wonderful film and highly recommended. 910.".

It has all the elements that a good Hindi movie must have.The settings of the hilly mountainous village the dusty n tough terrain the train sequence n the villain Gabbar played menacingly by Amjad Khan were all awesome. Such is the impact of the villains acting is that u always remember him by his character's name frm the movie. One of the movies you remember for life.Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment.

It has all the elements that a good Hindi movie must have.The settings of the hilly mountainous village the dusty n tough terrain the train sequence n the villain Gabbar played menacingly by Amjad Khan were all awesome. Such is the impact of the villains acting is that u always remember him by his character's name frm the movie. One of the movies you remember for life.Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment. It is a story of friendship courage and revenge based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai  The Magnificent Seven with shades of Once uopn a time in the west.A true cinematic masterpiece.";

The duo also gave us films like Don Shakti Shaan Zanjeer Seeta Aur Geeta and Deewar. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy and had music of legendary R.D. Burman. Sholay gave us a Character called Gabbar Singh played by Amjad Khan who made his debut with this film. The character of Gabbar Singh is so creative that many film makers have tried to imitate him for their films.Sholay did for Indian Cinema what Casablanca did for Hollywood. It became an instant classic and broke all the rules of film making and characterization while preserving the values of Indian cinema.Sholay just won the Filmfare Award 2005 for being the Best Film in the last 50 years of Indian Cinema. Sadly when Sholay was first released in 1975 it didn't win any major Filmfare awards. But when you think about all the great films that were released in that year its easy to see how it may have been over looked. 1975 may have been the best year for Hindi films with the likes of Deewar Chupke Chupke Hera Pheri Khel Khel Mein Julie Mausam Ponga Pandit Rafoo Chakkar Uljhan Dharmatma Do Jasoos Faraar Geet Gaata Chal Chhoti Si Baat Aandhi and Milli  all releasing along with Sholay.Sholay had the biggest star cast of its time with the likes of Dharmendra Hema Malini Amitabh Bachchan Jaya Bhaduri Sanjeev Kumar Sachin A.K.

The bandit escapes and massacres Thakur's family and severs both his arms. Thakur hires two men Veeru and Jay played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan to capture Gabbar.All the characters of this movie have left a mark on Indian cinema for a long time and will continue to remain so. Amitabh Bachchan Dharmendra Sanjeev Kumar Jaya Bachchan and Hema Malini are all brilliant in the movie. But one man steals the show as the villain who is cunning merciless and evil. Gabbar Singh's character was played by Amjad Khan and he is fantastic in the film. It is because of him that the movie became the greatest Indian film ever !! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "SOME SPOILERS Sholay directed by Ramesh Sippy in 1975 remains the most successful Hindi perhaps Indian film ever made. While a couple of films have made more money and recently Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge surpassed Sholay's unprecedented 5 year run at Minerva Theatre in Bombay Sholay leads by dint of the sheer impact it made on not just Indian cinema but popular culture in general. The film is a loose adaptation of the Magnificent Seven itself based on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and borrows freely from other movies  Hollywood or Indian. However its adaptation is uniquely Indian and it remains to my mind immeasurably superior to the movies it is based upon. The story is about two crooks Jai and Veeru in rural central India  a region ravaged by dacoits outlaws  who are hired by a village landlord Thakur to catch Gabbar Singh a notorious outlaw  alive. Jai is the quiet reflective crook while Veeru is loud boisterous impetuous and a lothario to boot. Veeru falls in love with Basanti  a garrulous taangewali horsecart driver while Jai silently wooes the Thakur's widowed daughterinlaw Radha. SPOILER ALERTSKIP THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIEIt appears that Gabbar had been arrested by the Thakur while the latter was a police inspector and had exacted revenge upon escaping jail by massacring the Thakur's family. The Thakur's attempt at evening scores was met by capture and by the chopping off of his arms in a chilling scene. Hence the need for mercenaries.SPOILER OVERGetting the bandit and the eventual shootout is the climax of the film but it is greater than the sum of its parts. Each character including minor ones like the jailer the braggart lumber merchant Surma Bhopali the Maulvi the family servant have been well fleshed out and have significant parts  at the very least they entertain. The script tends to meander but Sholay was not meant to be a simple revenge film  it conveyed a larger picture of villages the dacoit menace so real then and even now.The film was shot in South India at Ramnagram rather than at the place where it was set central India but the stark rugged scenery was worth it. As the first 70mm film in India and the first to use stereophonic sound Sholay secured a place in Indian film history.Its success derives from a good script which does not allow for a dull moment full marks to SalimJaved for doing this excellent direction and editing and excellent cinematography.While the film was fairly violent it was characteristic of its period. Its legacy however is the dialogues of the major characters which the producers were able to sell as a separate LP record in 1975  a first in Indian cinema. A generation later most Indians who know Hindi understand Kitne Aadmi the? Loha Lohe ko Kat taa hai Tera Kyaa Hoga Kaalia  so much so that these dialogues have entered the lexicon and are frequently used in commercials.RD Burman's music was a big plus with a fantastic score and even better background music. Indeed the background music from the faux Western theme music to music that announced major characters like Gabbar Singh is recognized even after three decades.Sholay made the career of Gabbar Singh as the first psychopath on the big screen  though some might argue that Danny Denzongpa had essayed that in Dhund in India though he could never get a comparable role later. Sanjeev Kumar's controlled rage as the Thakur was a close second performance. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were very good with both exhibiting comedy especially in the water tank scene though Hema Malini was a bit over the top. The supporting cast of Asrani jailor Surma Bhopali Lumber merchant and others were very good.A must see that seems to transcend time. I am obviously biased but years of screening this film for international as well as Indian audiences have convinced me of its worldwide appeal.".

The script tends to meander but Sholay was not meant to be a simple revenge film  it conveyed a larger picture of villages the dacoit menace so real then and even now.The film was shot in South India at Ramnagram rather than at the place where it was set central India but the stark rugged scenery was worth it. As the first 70mm film in India and the first to use stereophonic sound Sholay secured a place in Indian film history.Its success derives from a good script which does not allow for a dull moment full marks to SalimJaved for doing this excellent direction and editing and excellent cinematography.While the film was fairly violent it was characteristic of its period. Its legacy however is the dialogues of the major characters which the producers were able to sell as a separate LP record in 1975  a first in Indian cinema. A generation later most Indians who know Hindi understand Kitne Aadmi the? Loha Lohe ko Kat taa hai Tera Kyaa Hoga Kaalia  so much so that these dialogues have entered the lexicon and are frequently used in commercials.RD Burman's music was a big plus with a fantastic score and even better background music. Indeed the background music from the faux Western theme music to music that announced major characters like Gabbar Singh is recognized even after three decades.Sholay made the career of Gabbar Singh as the first psychopath on the big screen  though some might argue that Danny Denzongpa had essayed that in Dhund in India though he could never get a comparable role later. Sanjeev Kumar's controlled rage as the Thakur was a close second performance. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were very good with both exhibiting comedy especially in the water tank scene though Hema Malini was a bit over the top. The supporting cast of Asrani jailor Surma Bhopali Lumber merchant and others were very good.A must see that seems to transcend time. I am obviously biased but years of screening this film for international as well as Indian audiences have convinced me of its worldwide appeal.";

Indestructible monsters and cars bouncing around like pingpong balls leave me cold.The movie itself was simple straightforward and predictable but there was one thing it had that made me watch it again. That was the secondary female character played by Neha Dubey. Throughout the movie she seemed attractive enough but not especially so...and then she was called upon to dance in a musical number for the movie that was going to be made.

Some of the dancing scenes are intense powerful fun to look at and I was in particular struck by the choice of beautiful Indian wardrobe and the intensity of some of Mumbai's street scenes well captured by the cinematographer John Drake. Nice production value! Although I personally would have wished to see more of those Venice Beach scenes.Some of the performances are outstanding. Just to look at Kashmera Shah as Reena she who looks like as beauty from another planet. Her dancing and acting throughout the feature are just marvelous and provides the audience with a great inside look into the capability of some of Bollywood's top Alist actors. Other excellent performances such as the riksha driver and Alex' new best friend in India are played so well that you will just have to fall in love with them! Also a very notable screen and dance performance by Neha Dubey. I've heard some girls say that Jason Lewis looks even better in this cute flick than he did in Sex in the City...A mustsee not only for independent or Bollywood film fans  but for everyone!".

I was not a fan of Justin nor did I dislike him I was just neutral so I figured it would be interesting to see if I would enjoy the movie or not.Sadly I did not. Although it was interesting to see how Justin started out which was like a year ago??? the movie was SO incredibly boring. Half of the movie was Justin on stage singing his songs which all sound the same and the other half was him having a cold. So basically I learned that the hardest situation Justin has ever had to deal with was the cold he cold before performing.I ended up leaving the theater about five minutes early partially because I couldn't take listening to one of his songs and partially because I couldn't take the annoying fans in the theater screaming every time he was on the screen.So if you are already a fan of the Biebster feel free to watch this movie. If you are not a fan you aren't going to want to see it and will be mad for wasting ten bucks on a documentary that could have been aired on MTV.".

This review is coming from someone who did see the film aiming to give an honest judgement and to keep openminded. I love music and I love film but Justin Bieber Never Say Never came across to me as pointless and I just didn't enjoy the experience.I did not like how Never Say Never was shot. The photography was shoddy and sometimes went at odd angles and the lighting got so much I finished the film with a very bad headache which still hasn't gone away. I do agree about the 3D I not only found it unnecessary I also found it distracting. It also doesn't help that the 3D wasn't like the annoying narration actually that good in the first place in fact it was really quite bad.The music and Justin Bieber are also major problems. Not Justin Bieber as a person mind you when I saw him performing on television at Christmas he seemed quite downtoearth hardworking honest and not too full of himself. I just hate his music and I have never liked his singing either. His singing is for me rather forced and flat and his music especially Baby has me switching off the radio quicker than you can say Santa Claus is Comin' To Town. As for the music with exception of the lyrically powerful Born to be Somebody the songs suffer from dull melodic writing and uninspired lyrics that made me think hang on I've heard this before.I'm sorry to say Bieber didn't impress me very much either. As I've said I have never liked his singing or music. However he does have a commanding presence on stage. But... I don't think here he is in particularly good voice the singing is still flat and forced for my liking and his acting did nothing for me. I also hated the audience. During the concert scenes the screaming often got so loud that it was almost impossible to hear the vocals or lyrics and this audience if this was humanly possible is more annoying than any of the audiences for those trashy talk showsie.Jerry Springer Maury. Granted people love that and do it for the atmosphere what I'm saying is that it isn't for me. Also as part of my autism I do have problems with sudden loud noises so while I hated the audience when it came to seeing the film being in the audience I think would have upset me more.The story's structure and message didn't do much either. I didn't mind that the story was part biopic part concert feature but the biopic stuff does come across as superficial and contrived and I think some of it slows the film down quite considerably. The message is a follow your dreams message I have no problem with the message itself it's just that it is not a very fresh one and feels very overlydidactic in the way it is put across in this film. The dialogue at best is really bad some of it is cheesy and some of it is cloying while the direction is wretched. The acting is subpar Bieber's acting is worse than his singing and Jaden Smith while okay has a hardly credible persona. In fact the sole bright spot in the cast is actually Miley Cyrus which surprised me as I cannot stand her.In conclusion this film comes across as pointless and I just didn't enjoy it. Bieber fans will like it otherwise it isn't really worth it. 110 Bethany Cox".

Never could I have fathomed that a mockumentary about the music industry could ever surpass something like This Is Spinal Tap. But Never Say Never has done just that.Much applause Mr. Bieber.

Bieber's voice sounds like the annoying wail of bad Superbowl singer trying to hit another octave at the end of the Star Spangled Banner. And his lyrics...honestly I don't understand how he can be such a baby. For crying out loud he's sixteen freaking years old. He hasn't had a chance to find love or heartbreak not even close. The Taco Bell quad steak burrito has better songwriting better singing and better musicianship than anything little Biebs has ever done or I suspect ever will do. It's a shame that a talentless barely even adolescent kid like him become so famous and so idolized when actual musicians anything from Rush to the Beatles to Guns N' Roses in their day to Gustav Holst to J. S. Bach to Avenged Sevenfold are ignored by the brain dead masses.There is nothing I would like to say more than spoiler alert Justin Bieber dies but alas he lives on.SPOILER ALERT This movie will cause you to rue the day you were born and the audience may cause you to feel the rational need to commit seppuku. END SPOLERThis is not a disgruntled music fan spitefully arguing against a terrible movie this is a warning to the masses especially to the parents who may see the billboard and decide to see it to find out what all the hype is about. DON'T SEE IT. Plain and simple. You will regret it for the rest of your life. And if that is not reason enough he might actually be getting money from the movie sales assuming he's smart enough to realize he's entitled to it. Therefore if you the reader go to the movie then you are indirectly feeding the Bieber which will cause him to stay and annoy us longer.Please say never for the sake of all of our sanity say never. If the movie doesn't make enough money there might not be a sequel. At this point that is the best case scenario.Final notes If I could give a negative rating I would. 010I wish I had four hands so I could give it four thumbs down!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in Italian with Italian subtitles for the deaf long story and Gloria Guida and her female costars like Ilona Ciccalona Staller stripped off so regularly that I was having trouble concentrating on the subtitles so I probably missed a few plot points. The title roughly translates to The High School Student or The High School Coed but unlike in American films of its ilk no one in this film is remotely believable as a high school student. One of the boys for instance is played by one of those goofy rubberfaced Italian comedians who looks like he's about thirty five and acts like he's about eight although given Guida's impossibly short miniskirts and perpetually uncrossed legs it's possible he and the other guys flunked a few years unable to concentrate on their studies. There were a number of movies like this in the 1970's featuring pretty much the same cast but they all basically fall into two categoriesthe ones where Edwige Fenech or sometimes Carrol Baker plays a sexy female TEACHER who drives all the male students and faculty crazy and the ones where Gloria Guida or sometimes Lili Karati plays a sexy female STUDENT who drives all the male students and faculty crazy. In truth the two actresses were not that far apart in age but Fenech had the more busty maturelooking body and Guida the more convincing adolescent pout so they were typecast accordingly.The first part of the movie focuses on Guida's attempts to lose her virginity. Adolescent pout notwithstanding Guida is not remotely believable as a naive virgin so this part of the plot is pretty farfetched. The class lotharia gets Guida completely naked twice but is unable to seal the deal so she finally gives it up to one of her father's smooth business partners which triggers a whole domestic melodrama involving her neglectful businessman father and her lonely unfaithful mother. There are also allegedly hilarious subplots where the thirtyfiveyear student tries to pick up his female classmates by painting them in the nude and where Guida's friend Staller apparently becomes a prostitute for older men pretty appropriate for an actress who later worked in both hardcore porn and Italian politics. Meanwhile the new male teacher tries to recover from the trauma after he accidentally uses Guida's panties for a handkerchief you don't even want to know. . ..This movie is very stupid not particularly funny and at times downright annoying but it certainly delivers what it promises. So if you're still reading this I imagine you'll probably like it.".

It was made in the same year I was born and unfortunately left an impact crater on my mind about thirteen  years later. Funny thing is I never knew how deep this crater was until I saw it again forty years later with a few friends and a lot of beer.It is telling that I did NOT remember how bad the plot the comedy part the music and the acting was with the exception of Gloria Guida who's just playing herself but everything else. And it is some weird trash I mean an Italian sex comedy from the 70s  how much farer can you go? Watching this movie again was like watching something from another universe far far away. It was so intense so mind melting it caused such a massive flashback that I'm sitting here now an trying to write a review. For just this movie. But give me a minute to think about it Everything makes a lot of sense if you assume that Loredana a name I've never heard again btw is a young sexy and utterly sociopathic girl with no remorse and that the whole movie is following closely her point of view. Seriously. For sociopaths a lot of stuff we normal people do and say just looks pretty ridicules just like a very bad comedy. She's manipulating the guys around her from the very beginning and obviously having a lot of fun doing it. She's playing the nice naive girl but behind her beautiful blue eyes hides the dark coldness of a massive black hole her ego. Which is making her think that she's the lonely center of this whole bizarre thing called life. Everything she says and does serves her only goal to get satisfied in one or another way  the world has to kneel before her greatness. At the end one of her toys the American guy gets almost killed in some race with another toy and when she gets it told her only response is Is he dead? with a very slight very disturbing tone in her voice. At least in the German subbed version.And on top of this I strongly believe the writer and especially the director knew pretty well what they were doing. No I did not take drugs while watching it  well besides alcohol and uhm some vegetables. That doesn't count. If you never saw this master piece don't give it a try. No don't even think about it. I'm damned to have watched it with the innocent eyes of a thirteen year old boy and it did harm my life afterwards. I should have listened to my parents they were right Do not touch the TV in the late night.What glorious times. What a shame. What a shock.".

Guida's schoolgirl character Angela is torn between two loversone who tries to romance her in a straightforward manner and the other who pretends to be severely injured in a car accident they have while he is feeling her up. This harebrained scheme does somehow get her naked and in bed with him and it also provides some moments of frustrating coitus interruptus for the other guy when Angela starts thinking about the injured kid whenever he's about to score.Unlike with an American teen movie though most of the comedy in these is provided not by horny teens but by buffoonish adults including all three of the ubiquitous Italian stoogesLino Banfi Alvaro Vitali and Gianfranco D'Angelo. Banfi plays Angela's father although it would violate all the laws of genetics for a guy that looks like him to sire a girl that looks like her. He owns a sporting goods store and pretends to be his athletic younger brother with hair in order to romance a sexy customer the voluptuous Ria DeSimone. He also becomes the school track coach in his new identity. Vitali has apparently graduated from being a horny student and is now a horny music teacher. There is a funny scene where he nearly hyperventilates while watching a slutty female student fellate a recorder. The short squat Vitali also turns out to be a great sprinter and poses as a student to run on Banfi's track team. D'Angelo is a windbag professor and father of the malingererwho at gets cuckolded three times in a row by his male students who pretend to be him in order to take advantage of his kinky mistress who likes him to pretend to be a cat burglar.

Bridget Petronnio later to be much abused in Italian sleaze films like House by the Edge of the Park also has nude scenes and is good as a slutty brunette student.

When released in November 1934 this sentimental musicalcomedy was so successful that it was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture along with eleven yes 11! other movies that year but no win. The predictable plot begins in Hawaii in which Powell plays Army Private Richard Palmer Grant Dorcy better known as Canary who meets and falls in love with General John Brent Fitt's Henry O'Neill daughter Kit Ruby Keeler on a two day visit at the base. Kit happens to be engaged to Lt. Robert Biddle John Eldredge but she doesn't care. She gets Dick to take her out for a moonlight drive and they are later are caught embracing by Biddle. Fearing Dick would get court martialed Kit discourages and cures the lovesick private before she leaves Hawaii. Determined to forget Kit and become an officer and a gentleman Dick decides to leave Hawaii and enroll at West Point. After more than three years at the military academy and close to graduation Dick encounters Kit once more. Her father is stationed there as the new superintendent. Dick then tries to ignore Kit and give her a hard time but risks getting a dismissal from the academy when caught embracing Kit once more in her quarters by Biddle.Pat O'Brien costars as Scrapper Thornhill Dick's sergeant in the first half of the story set in Hawaii while Ross Alexander and John Arledge appear as the cadets in the second half set at West Point. Alexander the one with the physical appearance of dancer Ray Bolger supplies some fine comic touches here. Directed by twotime Academy Award winning director Frank Borzage FLIRTATION WALK focuses more on plot than musical interludes. Powell sings a little but tap dancer Keeler does not do any fancy footwork here. There are no real lavish production numbers to speak of with the exception of a Hawaiian luau some 20 minutes into of the story. The 15 minute segment of the Hundredth Night Show at West Point consists of songs by Allie Wrubel and Mort Dixon No Horse No Wife No Mustache the lively and amusing Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name and the title song. Aside from scenes filmed in Hawaii and West Point light comedy sentimental moments and good tunes Dick and Ruby are believable their roles while Pat O'Brien as a tough sergeant isn't afraid to shed a tear especially during Dick's West Point graduation. Quite different from the previous Powell and Keeler musicals from Broadway theater setting to military background which actually works to good advantage although there is too much time devoted to plebe year and Powell reciting the definition of Leather.FLIRTATION WALK was distributed on video cassette through MGM Home Video in 1992 and can be seen on the Turner Classic Movies cable channel. One final note Although it's been said that future film star Tyrone Power appears as one of the extra cadets he is so hard to find. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Even with Ruby Keeler's tinny voice and the fact she doesn't dance a step Flirtation Walk is an utterly charming musical from the Thirties with Dick Powell at the height of his lyric tenor period.West Point's image has done very well by Hollywood. The West Point Story and The Long Gray Line are the other two big films about the U.S. Military Academy on the Hudson. But this was the first film of a grand tradition.Dick Powell is an army private stationed out in Hawaii who's assigned by his sergeant Pat O'Brien to be a driver for Ruby Keeler daughter of General Henry O'Neill. She's got a boyfriend in her Dad's aide John Eldredge. But on a moonlight night in Hawaii the old boygirl thing happens.Powell receives a rude awakening the next day when he's made to realize the difference in class between officers and enlisted men. Something like the rude awakening John Agar got in Fort Apache when he was courting Shirley Temple even though he was an officer albeit a newly minted one from an enlisted man's family. So Powell decided he's going to become an officer and sets about applying for West Point.The next half of the film is set in West Point and in Powell's final year Henry O'Neill becomes the Academy Superintendent bring of course Keeler and Eldredge come with him. Here we have the same plot device that was later used in The West Point Story breaking precedent in having a woman in the Hundred Nights show for the graduating class. Who do you think the woman that the cadets want?Allie Wrubel and Mort Dixon wrote two nice numbers that are used in the musical show Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name and Flirtation Walk. Powell sings them well although he didn't need Ruby's thin voice doing the reprise. During the Hawaiian portion of the film Powell sang Aloha Oe. Why Ruby wasn't given any dance numbers is beyond me since that was her strength as a performer.I should also mention Ross Alexander who came to a tragic early end three years later as Powell's roommate at the Point. He was a funny guy and had a nice career going in playing best friends to the hero in film. A sad waste.I think you'll like the characters created and directed by Frank Borzage in this very charming film.".

	schema:headline " Great if you like this sort of thing...";
	schema:reviewBody "Dick Powell plays a rather fresh enlisted man who is constantly at odds with his sergeant Pat O'Brien. Powell's life takes an unexpected twist when he is asked to chaperon the General's daughter Ruby Keeler about Hawaii. In the process they naturally fall in lovewhich is a bit of a problem since Keeler already has a steady boyfriend. And this steady is an officer who would like nothing more than to bust Powell. However because of Keeler's behind the scenes maneuvering Powell is saved from court martial.Now Powell announces that he's tired of being bossed around by officers and wants to transfer to West Point! Talk about an interesting reason to go to the US Army's military academy! The rest of the film is like an entirely new filmwith O'Brien and Powell's friends shipping off to China while Powell is sent from Oahu to upstate New York. In the real world the chances for Cadet Powell to ever see Keeler O'Brien and the rest ever again would be slim...but of course this is NOT the real world! And speaking of unlike the real world like most Hollywood films of the 1930s about the military academies this one seems to NEVER have the students going to classes! An odd clich I know.Just before graduation Powell is put in charge of an annual song and dance and comedy show at the academy. The guys on the committee with him want to put the Superintendent's daughter Keeler in the showbut Powell is against it as he's still angry at her. He thinks she set him up to get into trouble back in Hawaiinot knowing that she really helped to bail him out behind the scenes. During the production they fall back in love as they both truly care about each otherbut they old back telling each other. However after the show her engagement to her old boyfriend is announced! Well finally Powell has had enough and bursts into her homeannouncing his love. But as it's after hours and he is caught he's in big trouble. Will he STILL graduate and will he get the girl? And what excuse can they provide for bringing O'Brien back from China to West Point by the end of the movie? This is a well made musical BUT it's hard to believe that it went on to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar! I see it as a silly and pleasant rompbut nothing more. I must admit though that I am not a huge fan of musicals though I am a huge classic Hollywood fan. It's nice but not enough to make this genre among my favorites! There was one cute dance sequence however that I did like. The dancing scene of the Hawaiians doing an almost Busby Berkeleystyle dance number is ridiculous it also is rather charming to watch. Plus you really need to see itit IS well done despite its shortcomings.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dick Powell plays a rather fresh enlisted man who is constantly at odds with his sergeant Pat O'Brien. Powell's life takes an unexpected twist when he is asked to chaperon the General's daughter Ruby Keeler about Hawaii. In the process they naturally fall in lovewhich is a bit of a problem since Keeler already has a steady boyfriend. And this steady is an officer who would like nothing more than to bust Powell. However because of Keeler's behind the scenes maneuvering Powell is saved from court martial.Now Powell announces that he's tired of being bossed around by officers and wants to transfer to West Point! Talk about an interesting reason to go to the US Army's military academy! The rest of the film is like an entirely new filmwith O'Brien and Powell's friends shipping off to China while Powell is sent from Oahu to upstate New York. In the real world the chances for Cadet Powell to ever see Keeler O'Brien and the rest ever again would be slim...but of course this is NOT the real world! And speaking of unlike the real world like most Hollywood films of the 1930s about the military academies this one seems to NEVER have the students going to classes! An odd clich I know.Just before graduation Powell is put in charge of an annual song and dance and comedy show at the academy. The guys on the committee with him want to put the Superintendent's daughter Keeler in the showbut Powell is against it as he's still angry at her. He thinks she set him up to get into trouble back in Hawaiinot knowing that she really helped to bail him out behind the scenes. During the production they fall back in love as they both truly care about each otherbut they old back telling each other. However after the show her engagement to her old boyfriend is announced! Well finally Powell has had enough and bursts into her homeannouncing his love. But as it's after hours and he is caught he's in big trouble. Will he STILL graduate and will he get the girl? And what excuse can they provide for bringing O'Brien back from China to West Point by the end of the movie? This is a well made musical BUT it's hard to believe that it went on to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar! I see it as a silly and pleasant rompbut nothing more. I must admit though that I am not a huge fan of musicals though I am a huge classic Hollywood fan. It's nice but not enough to make this genre among my favorites! There was one cute dance sequence however that I did like. The dancing scene of the Hawaiians doing an almost Busby Berkeleystyle dance number is ridiculous it also is rather charming to watch. Plus you really need to see itit IS well done despite its shortcomings.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Flirtation Walk' may not be a great film but it entertains and charms and it is difficult not to like. Flawed? Yes. Worth watching? Absolutely with the many good points nearly making up for the few points that don't come off quite so well.Coming off least is the story which even for a musicalcomedy is formulaic and extremely simplistic. Sadly Frank Borzage tends to make heavy weather of it meaning that 'Flirtation Walk' is not quite as lightonitsfeet as it could have been and the patriotism present in some of the film is a little too overt and heavyhanded.However 'Flirtation Walk' while not lavish still looks handsome and colourful as well as skilfully photographed. The songs are very tuneful and very easy on the ear the best of them being the witty and clever Mr and Mrs is the Name. The script is smart and amusing if a little too frothy in places.Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are immensely likable and their chemistry is incredibly charming and a large part of the film's appeal. Despite the story being less than perfect it has enough pep and zip to keep things moving at a bright and breezy pace and the penultimate scene is very moving. Pat O'Brien similarly brings sympathetic emotional impact.In summary the story is flawed but the charm and likability especially from the performances and chemistry of the two leads is immense. 710 Bethany Cox".

The music was dull and the story was flat.I actually watched this to see if I could do what no one else has been able to  find Tyrone Power who was a cadet in this film.The only reason he is listed on IMDb is that he became famous as he was not a featured cadet. He was an extra probably answering a call for young men to be extras at West Point. He cannot be spotted. By the way he and Linda Christian lived directly across the street from Dick Powell and June Allyson on Copa D'Oro in LA.Dick Powell had such a beautiful voice but it wasn't used a lot or to great advantage here.

This means that the film rates pretty high however. Powell could sing. Ruby could also better than I expected but of course no famous warbler like Powell. I wanted Ruby to dance when she as the general has all the men gathered around her desk. No dice. She does not. Oh well. Dick is pretty rude in much of this film. He needed his ears boxed by Scrapper. He keeps getting away with wrong things. He is Mr. Teflon. Lots of things bounce right off him. Wrongdoings just don't give him much comeuppance. Worse for me yet is when Powell went from musicals to dramas and gumshoe boring filmic outings. The Powell of 42nd Street fades from fun juvenile to wallflower aged oldster sexless senior citizen it seems like. I saw Ross Alexander in Midsummer Night's Dream. Was Powell also in that? Anyway in real life Alexander later calls an end to his own life. This is such a shame. Ross is a lot of fun in Flirtation Walk. This film was Great Depression era. Audiences needed cheering up. Besides all of the serious parts of this story the cadets are tasked with putting on an annual show. Did I hear Ruby talk about The New Deal?The characters were in military training for some future war 1941 and Pearl Harbor wouldn't be here for awhile. Powell early on is regular enlisted trying to move up through the ranks the old fashioned way. He then goes to West Point however and through hard work strives to become an officer and a gentleman. Scrapper has predicted Powell will eventually outrank him and this is what happens. The show I knew that the second I heard about the 100th Night Show I remembered the 1950 film outing called West Point Story starring James Cagney Doris Day Gordon MacRae Virginia Mayo Gene Nelson and Alan Hale Jr. Jimmy a volatile washedup Broadway director and dancer gets roped into traveling to West Point and training the students to do the annual 100th Night Show. Doris and MacRae sing about the Kissing Rock and Gene Nelson does some great tap dancing. Hale is dressed up like a huge woman and Jimmy does an awesome tap dance when Gene gets injured. Therefore part of 1950 West Point Story I feel is some sort of remake of 1934 Flirtation Walk 16 years earlier. One is prewar and one is postWorld War Two with a little of the Korean War Era thrown in. I am a degreed historian from the university studies including military history and history of war. I am also an actress dancer singer makeup artist fashion designer film critic and movie reviewer. I study the lives of actors and actresses. I have written almost 400 IMDb reviews since 2002.".

	schema:reviewBody "IT STARTED WITH EVE Universal 1941 directed by Henry Koster stars popular singer Deanna Durbin in one of her finest movie roles. Not quite a Biblical tale about Adam and Eve and the apple as the title might imply nor is there any character in the story named Eve but actually a comedy of errors in the screwball comedy tradition providing Durbin still in her late teenage years an opportunity in a more adult performance with fine support by the diverse Charles Laughton in a character role that's both funny and touching and Robert Cummings as a young man caught in the middle of a series of situations and having a difficult time coming up with a suitable explanations.The scenario revolves around Jonathan Reynolds Charles Laughton a middleaged millionaire on his death bed whose final request is to meet the young lady engaged to his son Johnny Robert Cummings. To make his father's last days on Earth a pleasant one Johnny rushes out into the rain to get his fianc only to learn from the desk clerk that she and her mother are not available. Not wanting to waste any more valuable time Johnny encounters a hat check girl Deanna Durbin and offers her 50 to return home with him and pose as his fiance for about an hour. Explaining the circumstances at hand she agrees. Masquerading as Gloria Pennington the girl Anne Terry meets the ailing Mr. Reynolds who takes an immediate liking to her. After their union the old man finds his son to be in good hands and can now die in peace. The following morning Jonathan miraculously recovers from his illness gets out of bed demanding a large breakfast from his servants and for Johnny to bring Gloria back to visit with him. Complications ensue when Johnny not only has to locate Anne who's about to take the next train back home to Shelbyville Ohio but to explain to the real Gloria Margaret Tallichet and her mother Catherine Doucet having returned from their trip the situation that has occurred. Things become even more complex when Johnny tries to prevent his father from learning Anne not to be his fiance and keeping Anne from attending his father's dinner function where she wants to audition for his theatrical agent friends in hope to land a singing career.A highly enjoyable comedy with an original premise done at a leisurely pace with a couple of classical songs thrown in for good measure making use of Deanna Durbin's singing talent including Peter Tchaikowsky's The Tchaikowsky Waltz and Antonin Dvorak's Going Home. Supporting players consist of Guy Kibbee as Bishop Maxwell Walter Catlett as Dr. Harvey the nervous family physician Dorothea Kent as Jackie Donovan Anne's roommate Clara Blandick as The Nurse and comedian Mantan Moreland adding humor as the harassed train station baggage man.Obviously a high point in Durbin's career that did very well at box office it's interesting to note that a fun movie such as this is not relatively better known. Durbin and Cummings do well in the roles that might have been tailermade for Irene Dunne and Cary Grant for example. However the characters of Anne Terry and Johnny Reynolds were obviously written for much younger performers as enacted by Durbin and Cummings.IT STARTED WITH EVE did play for a while on American Movie Classics 199293 about the same time it was distributed on video cassette by MCA Home Video. The Hans Kraly story was redone by Universal as I'D RATHER BE RICH 1964 featuring Sandra Dee Robert Goulet and Maurice Chevalier with a few alterations but like the original has been lost to cinema history known mostly by film scholars and historians. Even with the original currently available on DVD and latter cable broadcast on Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 30 3013 might offer IT STARTED WITH EVE some new life to a new generation of movie lovers looking for something amusing nostalgic as well as lighthearted entertainment by its three principal actors. 12.".

It may seem like a weird idea to pair such dissimilar talents as Durbin and Laughton but it does work.  As Laughton's son Robert Cummings gets mostly straight lines but he performs his role well and Walter Catlett also has some good moments as a rather highstrung doctor.The story starts out a little slowly but once it gets rolling it is interesting.  It also has some thoughtful moments as the characters try to figure out how to deal with all the dilemmas that start when Cummings's character has to improvise a way of comforting his seriously ill father. The actual plot developments are insubstantial in themselves but are generally used to good effect.  It could have been played as an allout screwball comedy but here the more balanced approach seems to work at least as well.The movie builds up steam as things develop and saves some of the best moments for the climactic sequence.  It's a successful combination that makes for enjoyable viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "1941 an old man once living the highlife is now dying. His son returns home for what may be his last visit to his dear old father. When father and son once again meet your eyes will likely start to swell as they talk softly and tenderly. Their nostalgic talk turns to the present with the father asking to meet his son's bridetobe. With the old man's dying request fresh in our memories the son rushes to the hotel to get his wife at the hotel. Unable to find his wife he talks the coatcheck girl at the hotel into accompanying him home as the woman his father had not yet met. The deception well intended and lighthearted becomes the story and evolves beautifully to the benefit of everyone  especially the viewer.What at first starts out to appear as a serious drama quickly becomes a great comedy. This is a believable human story with emotion music and love that can make nostalgia appear not so nostalgic while even causing one to hope for a remake of this movie. Every main character earns its own level of adoration so easily it takes no effort to relate.Charles Laughton plays a comical aging old fart who is brought back to life because of his admiration for the woman he believes to be his future daughterinlaw. Always known as a great actor he appeared to be having a lot of fun while giving us his all. He is easily the most comical character and just as easily the most loved.Robert Cummings was truly at his best as well. While I cannot say I know a lot about his movies I have seen some of his other movies and some reruns of his TV shows. I remember enjoying what he did. He effortlessly switches from the saddened son to the man in the middle frustrated with a plot gone wrong.Now for the reason I even looked at this movie  Deanna Durbin. She has one of the best voices ever! Yes singing styles have changed but her clarity and tone win her a place in my heart foreverdespite our age differences. Back to the movie her character was simply fun quirky adorable and desirable. While being used to make Cummings' character and his father happy she eventually becomes the one to save. While her situation with loneliness and doubt looms her music and charm so pleases the old man he has to do something to help her while not letting her know that he knows she is not really who she at first pretended to be. Her emotional moments are her best. Singing a song the old man requests her tears nearly tore me up and then in the next scene her fits of hysterical laughter just as easily rip at the soul.I do encourage anyone who likes 40's style movies to see this. I have seen a few of Durbin's movies but so far this was the best in style story and quality. This movie gets a 10 from me. Excuse me while I dry my tears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Would anyone not take a bet that a 20yearold young woman would be mincemeat if she tried to take a film away from the skilled and hammy hands of Charles Laughton especially when Laughton to modern eyes looks suspiciously like he's playing Tim Conway playing one of Conway's old tottering geezers? It Started With Eve an attractive romantic comedy stars Deanna Durbin Robert Cummings and Charles Laughton. It was a shame Laughton wasn't a few years younger. He and Durbin turn out to be quite a pair both of them adept at delivering smart lines doing subtle doubletakes or moving from subversive good cheer to tearjerker moments of sincerity. They dominate the film and they do it as equals. Robert Cummings was a skilled lightweight lead. Here. as in so many of his films he just doesn't have the leadingman gravitas to appear as anything but an earnest puppy. When he shares a scene with either Laughton or Durbin he makes a pleasant second banana. It Started With Eve begins with Jonathan Reynolds Laughton a rich old tycoon apparently on his death bed. When his son Jonathan Junior Cummings comes rushing in from a trip to Mexico old Jonathan asks to meet young Jonathan's new fianc who has come to New York with him accompanied by her mother. Young Jonathan tries to contact his fianc can't reach her and believing his father is now dying happens upon Anne Terry Durbin a hatcheck girl. He rushes Anne to the side of his father and introduces her as his fianc. But the next day his father recovers. Now young Jonathan has his fianc he can't let his father meet and his father wants to keep seeing Anne thinking she's the fianc. The movie's an houranda half of mistaken identity and screwball encounters. Love finally wins out but only after Laughton plays matchmaker and Durbin sings two or three songs. Along the way we have some clever lines The trouble with being sick is you have to associate with doctors! a good deal of skullduggery as Laughton contrives to smoke the cigars his doctor forbids him and a fast pace set by director Henry Koster. Laughton of course overacts but gets away with it. He also has a combup hair style that if he were a foot shorter would let him pass for a munchkin. He does a lot of stoopedover shuffling squinting from under his eye brows and little bits of business that we wind up hardly noticing when Durbin is around. She must have been quite a challenge for him. Durbin at 20 is no longer the child star. She's wellnigh gorgeous with a figure that could make staring illegal. She is natural and straight forward and completely selfassured. She's one of the few actresses who could get away with sniffing mightily or falling down next to a piano and make us smile just at her style. She was in a word or two sui generis. And for those who admire subversive scenestealers the movie has that master Walter Catlett playing Dr. Harvey. Catlett was in hundreds of films usually playing blowhards or flustered shysters. He's a bit subdued here but just the sound of his voice is enough to make me smile. The movie is a bit of froth expertly served. If it's a little dated well so am I.".

	schema:headline " lovely Deanna wonderful film";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's see  you're a classically trained singer with a gorgeous voice you're pretty a good actress highly paid...and all you want is to get out of show business.That's Deanna Durbin's story and thank goodness she didn't get her wish until she made films like It Started with Eve also starring Charles Laughton and Robert Cummings.Durbin plays Anne Terry a hat check girl trying to make it as a classical singer. One night she is drafted by Johnny Reynolds Jr. Cummings who believes his father Laughton is dying. His father has insisted on meeting his fiance but when Johnny returns to the hotel to find her she and her mother Margaret Tallichet and Catherine Doucet aren't in their room. Desperate he offers Anne money if she will pose as his fiance. Anne wants to return home to her family so the money will come in handy. She accompanies him to his father's deathbed.Well Jonathan Reynolds Sr. rallies! He's not going to die and his son may well  he now has two fiances. Jonathan Sr. plans a party for all his high falutin' friends including people like Leopold Stokowski to meet Anne and to have her sing for them.Johnny Jr. is in a pickle and tells Anne that he will say that they broke up and then introduce his father to his real fiance whom Reynolds Sr.'s doctor will bring to the house. But Anne wants to sing at the party so after he announces the big breakup Anne rushes in and begs forgiveness.Robert Cummings a huge star in television was usually second tier in films. He always excelled in comedy and he does a great job here. Laughton playing a man who's supposedly dying looks quite gaunt and is of course marvelous as a man who has a great relationship with Anne and grows fond of her.Deanna Durbin herself acts and sings like a dream and looks beautiful. Her warm personality shines through. She sings Clavelitos Goin' Home When I Sing and Ahi viene la conga impressively.It Started with Eve is a fastmoving fun highly entertaining film with moments of poignancy. This film marked the end of Deanna Durbin's work with producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster Pasternak went to MGM and Deanna went on suspension for turning down a script. In the end she was given approval of her directors stories and songs.Hard to believe this songbird now 90 retired at the age of 26 and never looked back. It's a tribute to her that 64 years postretirement Deanna Durbin still has plenty of fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let's see  you're a classically trained singer with a gorgeous voice you're pretty a good actress highly paid...and all you want is to get out of show business.That's Deanna Durbin's story and thank goodness she didn't get her wish until she made films like It Started with Eve also starring Charles Laughton and Robert Cummings.Durbin plays Anne Terry a hat check girl trying to make it as a classical singer. One night she is drafted by Johnny Reynolds Jr. Cummings who believes his father Laughton is dying. His father has insisted on meeting his fiance but when Johnny returns to the hotel to find her she and her mother Margaret Tallichet and Catherine Doucet aren't in their room. Desperate he offers Anne money if she will pose as his fiance. Anne wants to return home to her family so the money will come in handy. She accompanies him to his father's deathbed.Well Jonathan Reynolds Sr. rallies! He's not going to die and his son may well  he now has two fiances. Jonathan Sr. plans a party for all his high falutin' friends including people like Leopold Stokowski to meet Anne and to have her sing for them.Johnny Jr. is in a pickle and tells Anne that he will say that they broke up and then introduce his father to his real fiance whom Reynolds Sr.'s doctor will bring to the house. But Anne wants to sing at the party so after he announces the big breakup Anne rushes in and begs forgiveness.Robert Cummings a huge star in television was usually second tier in films. He always excelled in comedy and he does a great job here. Laughton playing a man who's supposedly dying looks quite gaunt and is of course marvelous as a man who has a great relationship with Anne and grows fond of her.Deanna Durbin herself acts and sings like a dream and looks beautiful. Her warm personality shines through. She sings Clavelitos Goin' Home When I Sing and Ahi viene la conga impressively.It Started with Eve is a fastmoving fun highly entertaining film with moments of poignancy. This film marked the end of Deanna Durbin's work with producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster Pasternak went to MGM and Deanna went on suspension for turning down a script. In the end she was given approval of her directors stories and songs.Hard to believe this songbird now 90 retired at the age of 26 and never looked back.

	schema:headline " A Nice Little Comedy for Laughton Durbin and Cummings";
	schema:reviewBody "Charles Laughton had a personality that was totally dominating as one can see in his greatest performances as Henry VIII Captain Bligh Quasimodo Sir Wilfred Robards Henry Horatio Hobson. But he knew for the most part when to control his more hammy moments. It is unfair to compare him with his sometime costar Robert Newton as Newton had an alcohol problem not shared by Laughton. But Newton's overblown drunken performances like his BLACKBEARD are never matched by Laughton the consummate professional. Laughton could do a role badly due to poor script or direction. Commander Sturm the jealous submarine commander married to Talullah Bankhead is one of his worse parts. But they are usually early roles. Once he was established he rarely made such missteps.IT STARTED WITH EVE is not one of Laughton's greatest film parts but it is a feel good comedy. He plays Jonathan Reynolds Sr. a multimillionaire who is on his death bed. He only wants to see his son Bob Cummings and his son's fianc once before he dies. But the fianc is not in New York City yet she will be the next day. So Cummings takes a hat check girl Deanna Durbin with him to introduce to his father as Gloria his fianc. Unfortunately Durbin's personality is very pleasing to the old man  and his spirits rising his health improves. This brings all sorts of complications up not even just for Cummings and Durbin.For examplea side issue in the first half hour of the film  two harpies from the national museum are there to make a death mask of Mr. Reynolds. They are sitting quietly waiting for the good news that Reynolds is dead and they can make their death mask. Every time it looks promising they perk up  only to be forced to wait longer. Then when Durbin plays the piano and sings for Laughton he gets out of bed to hear it. The two men realize that this is hopeless and pack up and leave.Cummings' character is faulted for not confronting his father with the truth and turning wimpish. It is not quite fair. The doctor Walter Catlett feels that Laughton's health has to rebuild itself for awhile before the truth can be revealed and he convinces Cummings not to tell Laughton that Durbin is not his future daughterinlaw.All three leads actually blend quite nicely Laughton's tendency to dominate reduced because he is recovering from his illness although his booming dominance reappears once when he gets impatient with Cummngs not supposedly forgetting a quarrel with Durbin and starts shouting Say you forgive her say you forgive her in his best Bligh tones. Durbin who was a good actress when the right part came her way easily ingratiates herself with Laughton by being his lookout when he smokes his forbidden cigars. Cummings trying to figure out how to break up with the false Gloria and to reintroduce the real Gloria actually is not so wimpish at just pathetically unable to carry out any of his schemes successfully. Add to the three Walter Catlett here playing a decent doctor who has gotten onto Laughton's nerves because of his forcing Laughton to lose weight and to stop smoking gives a fine performance as he is slowly driven to distraction by his patient's antics. Not a great film but a good example of a studio inspired comedy that is well worth watching.".

The scene when Deanna sang Going Home with Charles Laughton standing in the background was very moving.  I thought they were a great team together and it really seemed like they had a great affection for each other.  I was a bit annoyed with Robert Cumming's characterization being a wimp and having no backbone to stand up to his father but then that's where the story lies.  I thought Deanna's acting was very good and believable and her singing scenes though unnecessaryexcept for Going Home did not detract from the story.  This was quite an enjoyable light comedy and I would recommend it for anyone who likes movies of the 40's.  The performances of Charles Laughton and Deanna Durbin definitely make this picture a treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "A wealthy man Charles Laughton is dying and his last request is to meet his son's Robert Cummings fiance. Unable to comply with this wish Cummings asks hat check girl Deanna Durbin to accompany him and pose as his fiance for the last hours of his father's life.Doesn't sound very much like a good plot for a romantic comedy does it? Without giving too much away an unexpected turn of events leads to the necessity of continuing the charade and the two lead characters falling in love. It Started With Eve is a rare treat in that it mixes comedy romance and truly moving drama into a single film that is nothing but a joy to experience.So what is it exactly that makes this film so special? In my opinion one of the major flaws of most romantic comedies both then and now is the overreliance on stock characters. One goes into these types of films expecting the same sorts of people the boy and the girl who either hate or love each other from the outset and the interfering exgirlfriend or parent intent on keeping them apart. In this film these stereotypes are turned on their heads. The two leads neither hate nor love each other but are simply thrown together and their relationship develops from there. The typical unwilling parent is replaced by a father who admires Durbin's character so much that he works to bring her and his son together.The style in which this film is directed also sets it apart. While most movies of this type usually veer towards either broad farce or melodrama the feeling here is something in between which results in that the acting is more realistic and makes the film more believable. The stellar casting is only enhanced by the great performances and genuine chemistry between the three leads Cummings Durbin and Laughton. Laughton and Durbin especially seem to get along so well that in the scene where they burst out in uncontrollable laughter you can't help but join in with them.While this film is not as well known now as it was in its day it just had its premiere on TCM this December it is one that should be better known simply for the fact that it is truly a cinematic gem.".

Walter Catlett is hysterically funny as Laughton's doctor who gets progressively as ill as Laughton was while his patient recovers. A lively squabble between Durbin and Cummings leads to a hysterically funny chase sequence around a huge dining table with a living room chair an active prop. In smaller roles Guy Kibbee and Clara Blandick are memorable as a local preacher and Laughton's Miss Preen like nurse. In their few scenes together Laughton and Blandick best known as Auntie Em in The Wizard of Oz reminded me of Monty Woolley and Mary Wickes in the same year's The Man Who Came to Dinner.

He's frantic and desperate and in a mad dash to make his father happy in the seconds before he dies he whisks a random woman Deanna Durbin home with him and pretends she's his intended. Now all that setup is the sad part of the movie. Charles reassures everyone he's had a full and happy life but just as you're wiping up your tears he wakes up from his sleep and declares I'm hungry! Hooray! Now the fun can start. As you might guess Bob and Deanna keep pretending they're engaged to keep Charles happy even though Bob's real fianc Margaret Tallichet is waiting impatiently in the wings.Deanna of course get to show off her musical talents playing the piano and singing some very impressive songs. Since she was primarily a singer you might expect her to be a lousy actress but she's pretty good. It doesn't hurt that she's working off such a wonderful pro like Charles Laughton in most of her scenes. Bob Cummings is also very good in the movie.

He's so adorable in It Started with Eve. I'm partial to him anyway so you might think I'm a bit biased but I watched this movie with my momwho doesn't always think he's likableand she was just as charmed as I was. Once he's no longer at death's door Charles spends the rest of the movie up and about sneaking cigars against his doctor's orders requesting a nice warm steaky throwing parties and dancing the conga at a nightclub! He and Deanna have such a close chemistry in their scenes together I kept thinking the film was a romance between them instead of between Deanna and Bob.

	schema:headline " Fun comedy romance with a musical touch";
	schema:reviewBody "It Started with Eve is one of those Hollywood movies with not an inkling of a clue as to the title. Sometimes the studios would make films based on a script that would have a book verse or wellknown quotation in the title. Or something similar that gave a clue as to the title. Then with rewrites in the script or directing changes or cuts in the editing process the clue part was deleted from the finished product. Most of the time it didn't make much difference because what was described had little to do with what actually takes place in the film. This is all to say that the title of this film makes no sense and gives no hint as to what the movie is about. That aside the film is a very good one. It's a wonderful romantic comedy combo with a touch of music. The plot was so successful that Hollywood would copy it and revise it for later movies. The cast is an interesting pairing of actors one wouldn't normally think of associating together in film. But they work beautifully together here. I think the three leads have about equal time on screen. Deanna Durbin got top billing because she was the darling and top box office attraction for Universal at the time. She is sweet and funny as Anne Terry and gives us just a couple of samples of her beautiful signing voice. Robert Cummings is Johnny Reynolds who behaves frantically as he jumps from the kettle into the fire throughout the film. Cummings developed an indecisive stuttering persona that appears in much of his film and TV work. Charles Laughton is Jonathan Reynolds the dying patriarch who regains his health and spirits when Johnny introduces Anne to him as his fianc. Several others of the cast do very well. Water Catlett is exceptional as Doctor Harvey and Charles Coleman is a hoot as Roberts the butler. Much of the comedy evolves around Laughton's character and that of the doctor. So Jonathan clearly is the driving force literally in the script around whose plotting and conniving the subsequent scenes of the story play out. It is a very clever screenplay and just the type of work that Laughton loved to sink his teeth into. Durbin and Cummings are the romance waiting to happen and they add considerable humor in their efforts to deal with the changes as the plot unfolds. We wonder how long it will be until the inevitable happens. On the outskirts of this are a fianc and wannabe mother inlaw whom we know don't stand a chance after the opening scene. The musical score for this film is quite good and received an Oscar nomination. Laughton was just 42years old when he made this film playing here someone around 60. I thought it was interesting that he was supposed to have lost considerable weight. Indeed even with the much oversized clothing used for his part he doesn't have the heavier physical appearance of later films  or of some of his earlier films. He always was a rotund person but perhaps he had a period around this time in which he lost some weight. I noted a bit of interesting trivia under his IMDb biography. Laughton apparently was the first actor to play Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He starred in the stage play of Alibi in 1928. He also is said to have discovered actress Maureen O'Hara. Here are some sample comedy lines from the movie. Jonathan Johnny and the doctor are walking up the stairs together. Johnny How do you feel dad? Jonathan How do I know? Ask him.Doctor Harvey Jonathan I have a very pleasant surprise for you. Jonathan How long will you be gone?A waiter brings a huge fancy drink the kind tourists fawn over in Hawaii and other exotic places to the table in the nightclub. Anne What's that?

	onyx:emotionText "It Started with Eve is one of those Hollywood movies with not an inkling of a clue as to the title. Sometimes the studios would make films based on a script that would have a book verse or wellknown quotation in the title. Or something similar that gave a clue as to the title. Then with rewrites in the script or directing changes or cuts in the editing process the clue part was deleted from the finished product. Most of the time it didn't make much difference because what was described had little to do with what actually takes place in the film. This is all to say that the title of this film makes no sense and gives no hint as to what the movie is about. That aside the film is a very good one. It's a wonderful romantic comedy combo with a touch of music. The plot was so successful that Hollywood would copy it and revise it for later movies. The cast is an interesting pairing of actors one wouldn't normally think of associating together in film. But they work beautifully together here. I think the three leads have about equal time on screen. Deanna Durbin got top billing because she was the darling and top box office attraction for Universal at the time. She is sweet and funny as Anne Terry and gives us just a couple of samples of her beautiful signing voice. Robert Cummings is Johnny Reynolds who behaves frantically as he jumps from the kettle into the fire throughout the film. Cummings developed an indecisive stuttering persona that appears in much of his film and TV work. Charles Laughton is Jonathan Reynolds the dying patriarch who regains his health and spirits when Johnny introduces Anne to him as his fianc. Several others of the cast do very well. Water Catlett is exceptional as Doctor Harvey and Charles Coleman is a hoot as Roberts the butler. Much of the comedy evolves around Laughton's character and that of the doctor. So Jonathan clearly is the driving force literally in the script around whose plotting and conniving the subsequent scenes of the story play out. It is a very clever screenplay and just the type of work that Laughton loved to sink his teeth into. Durbin and Cummings are the romance waiting to happen and they add considerable humor in their efforts to deal with the changes as the plot unfolds. We wonder how long it will be until the inevitable happens. On the outskirts of this are a fianc and wannabe mother inlaw whom we know don't stand a chance after the opening scene. The musical score for this film is quite good and received an Oscar nomination. Laughton was just 42years old when he made this film playing here someone around 60. I thought it was interesting that he was supposed to have lost considerable weight. Indeed even with the much oversized clothing used for his part he doesn't have the heavier physical appearance of later films  or of some of his earlier films. He always was a rotund person but perhaps he had a period around this time in which he lost some weight. I noted a bit of interesting trivia under his IMDb biography.

	schema:headline " Yet another bland offering from Project Greenlight";
	schema:reviewBody "The Battle of Shaker Heights is the second offering released and made from the successful HBO reality series Project Green light which chronicles the search for a screenplay and director in which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will produce for one million dollars. Then we get to see the movie being made and inevitably watch the film. I didn't see the first season of Project Greenlight but I did watch the product of it Stolen Summer a mediocre bland and safe offering from Damon and Affleck who don't want to take a risk considering their history for risky and edgy indies like Mallrats Chasing Amy and Gerry. I decided to watch the second season of Project Greenlight and yet again it was the search for a screenplay to finance and a director.For the second season there was the same selfindulgent ranting from Affleck and Damon and some showing off of J.Lo from Affleck but nonetheless I watched amateur screenwriter Erica Beeney win and a two director team Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin get the chance to show off their chops. Suffice it to say the season was a rip as we watched these three amateurs slog through the production fight and fail in all the test screenings to audiences. So The Battle of Shaker Heights was made and released and yet again after watching I realized it's still more contrived fluffy and safe offerings into the film world.I can't understand why Affleck and Damon won't take more riskier projects on board and insist on financing these fluffy shallow films other than using this show for publicity. What's wrong with The Battle of Shaker Heights? Many things but mostly it's it's horrible script and dialogue. Some dialogue had me cringing some had me staring in confusion and some dialogue just left me alienated.We saw the series we saw the activity and we saw how many people actually had input on the making of this movie. It's clear by this movie all of its characters all of the muddled subplots taking place at once that there were simply too many cooks in the kitchen. We could see it in the series. We saw the directors Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin two very unprofessional directors attempting to take control of the film and rewrite the script we saw Erica Beeney trying to take control of her script we saw producers Matt Damon and Ben Affleck weighing in we saw Harvey Weinstein weighing in we saw producer Chris Moore coming in and trying to take control. There was just too many people for one movie and that's the problem. Did it occur to anyone to give them the money and let them make the film then give your input on the finishing article?Ultimately The Battle of Shaker Heights is not a movie it's a concept for a movie that never gets off the ground. I felt like I was watching an hour and a half trailer for a movie with a bunch of random scenes cut together without a real story I can't wait to find out what the real movie looks like. What Shaker Heights suffers from with the mediocre directing job is a very underdeveloped range of characters that we never get to know. We trudge through lines like Why are you dicking with me you little dick. You wanna play dick face? and the worst of the dialogue where the main character Kelly is attempting to talk with Tabby. She is painting and she says I'm playing with diffusion to which he replies Well make sure you do it under super vision. Ha ha. It's cheesy lines like that make this movie so ridiculous at times.Kelly played by the very talented Shia Lebeouf is a world war recreationist who takes pride in knowing about the wars fought and is a bit rebellious and one day he meets Bart the youngest in a rich family who befriends the troubled youth and the two become friends until Kelly meets Bart's older sister Tabby well played by Amy Smart who doesn't seem to acknowledge the boy but still befriends him slightly and goes about her business. Soon Kelly looks for any excuse to hand around Tabby knowing she's getting married which creates conflict. Very underdeveloped conflict.Throughout the entire film I was thinking how good this movie could have been had they added thirty more minutes to the running time which could have left the door open for more character development and more development with its number of subplots but once again its story never goes beyond its concept. Kelly is an odd character he's a war buff because hey he has a vehicle and wears the clothing and he works at a supermarket when there's nobody there and he has a friendcoworker named Sarah played by the adorable Shiri Appleby another grossly under developed character who has a combined total of five scenes in the film and is never focused on. We know the two are friends and we get the slight sense she's jealous at his fawning over another woman but there's barely any focus on her so who cares?So we see Tabby another underdeveloped character who's given the persona of an artistic individual who never develops beyond her character concept. She's a bit of a tease towards Kelly giving him little smiles and flirty come on's yet gets angered when he responds. She's then given the plot that she's getting married to a guy named Miner to when she's ever asked about the marriage she quickly responds I don't want to talk about it. Why? They never explain it. It was assumed by me that she was set up from another rich family and forced to marry him. But it's never explained in the sloppy script.So Kelly confronts her in a really bad scene when she's crying complaining her fiance kissed another woman which leads to a kiss between the two characters. If she hardly seems to care about her fiance why does she care that he cheated? It's plot holes like that that make the movie unbearable to watch at times. The character Miner Tabby's fiance doesn't seem to be a bad guy. He befriends Kelly talks to him like a friend yet we're supposed to view him as the bad guy.Screenwriter Beeney never gives us a reason to hate him so Kelly is the one that comes off as the jerk in his pursuit towards Tabby. Then it's never explained why Kelly falls in love with Tabby in the first place and we never really get to know Bart outside of his conceptual design as a neat dresser and proper yet friendly guy. So Kelly is given an obligatory subplot which handles the job of setting up his character but is really forced. His mom is a Bohemian artist who houses a group of artists who manufacture paintings in their home and sell them and Kelly's father works somewhere with drug addicts.Being an exaddict himself he tries to reach out to Kelly though Kelly refuses to talk to him. Once again Kelly's parents aren't given subplots nor are they developed and fleshed out so they're simply plot devices in the end. The plot tries to reel towards comedic tones but ultimately ends up as a depressing drama about a rather annoying guy. Writer Beeney sets up so many subplots at once but never fleshes them out and never develops them so everything feels forced awkward and rushed. Even as it transforms into a drama the drama is forced as well in some awkward and droning scenes including Kelly confronting Tabby on her wedding day a scene where Bart and Kelly inflict revenge on a school bully which attempts to be funny but just ends up becoming mean and the happy safe ending which is so trite obvious and tacked on it left me groaning in my seat.The Battle of Shaker Heights has a lot of potential to be a great coming of age teen drama but potential is all it has. The Battle of Shaker Heights and Stolen Summer is proof that a good concept doesn't always pan out in a successful franchise. While the Project Greenlight is entertaining and engrossing the finishing products are poor. How about throwing more money and time to these poor people? It's no wonder HBO dropped the series.Though this does garner great performances by Smart Elden Henson and especially Shia Lebeouf and the occasional entertaining moment this suffers from a terrible script with grossly underdeveloped subplots and characters cheesy dialogue and many plot holes.My advice stop Project Greenlight until Affleck and Damon are ready to take risks in their investments and until Miramax is willing to cough up more money and time for making these films. Then maybe we'll get a film worth talking about. and a half out of  stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Battle of Shaker Heights is the second offering released and made from the successful HBO reality series Project Green light which chronicles the search for a screenplay and director in which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will produce for one million dollars. Then we get to see the movie being made and inevitably watch the film. I didn't see the first season of Project Greenlight but I did watch the product of it Stolen Summer a mediocre bland and safe offering from Damon and Affleck who don't want to take a risk considering their history for risky and edgy indies like Mallrats Chasing Amy and Gerry. I decided to watch the second season of Project Greenlight and yet again it was the search for a screenplay to finance and a director.For the second season there was the same selfindulgent ranting from Affleck and Damon and some showing off of J.Lo from Affleck but nonetheless I watched amateur screenwriter Erica Beeney win and a two director team Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin get the chance to show off their chops. Suffice it to say the season was a rip as we watched these three amateurs slog through the production fight and fail in all the test screenings to audiences. So The Battle of Shaker Heights was made and released and yet again after watching I realized it's still more contrived fluffy and safe offerings into the film world.I can't understand why Affleck and Damon won't take more riskier projects on board and insist on financing these fluffy shallow films other than using this show for publicity. What's wrong with The Battle of Shaker Heights? Many things but mostly it's it's horrible script and dialogue. Some dialogue had me cringing some had me staring in confusion and some dialogue just left me alienated.We saw the series we saw the activity and we saw how many people actually had input on the making of this movie. It's clear by this movie all of its characters all of the muddled subplots taking place at once that there were simply too many cooks in the kitchen. We could see it in the series. We saw the directors Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin two very unprofessional directors attempting to take control of the film and rewrite the script we saw Erica Beeney trying to take control of her script we saw producers Matt Damon and Ben Affleck weighing in we saw Harvey Weinstein weighing in we saw producer Chris Moore coming in and trying to take control. There was just too many people for one movie and that's the problem. Did it occur to anyone to give them the money and let them make the film then give your input on the finishing article?Ultimately The Battle of Shaker Heights is not a movie it's a concept for a movie that never gets off the ground. I felt like I was watching an hour and a half trailer for a movie with a bunch of random scenes cut together without a real story I can't wait to find out what the real movie looks like. What Shaker Heights suffers from with the mediocre directing job is a very underdeveloped range of characters that we never get to know. We trudge through lines like Why are you dicking with me you little dick. You wanna play dick face? and the worst of the dialogue where the main character Kelly is attempting to talk with Tabby. She is painting and she says I'm playing with diffusion to which he replies Well make sure you do it under super vision. Ha ha. It's cheesy lines like that make this movie so ridiculous at times.Kelly played by the very talented Shia Lebeouf is a world war recreationist who takes pride in knowing about the wars fought and is a bit rebellious and one day he meets Bart the youngest in a rich family who befriends the troubled youth and the two become friends until Kelly meets Bart's older sister Tabby well played by Amy Smart who doesn't seem to acknowledge the boy but still befriends him slightly and goes about her business. Soon Kelly looks for any excuse to hand around Tabby knowing she's getting married which creates conflict. Very underdeveloped conflict.Throughout the entire film I was thinking how good this movie could have been had they added thirty more minutes to the running time which could have left the door open for more character development and more development with its number of subplots but once again its story never goes beyond its concept. Kelly is an odd character he's a war buff because hey he has a vehicle and wears the clothing and he works at a supermarket when there's nobody there and he has a friendcoworker named Sarah played by the adorable Shiri Appleby another grossly under developed character who has a combined total of five scenes in the film and is never focused on. We know the two are friends and we get the slight sense she's jealous at his fawning over another woman but there's barely any focus on her so who cares?So we see Tabby another underdeveloped character who's given the persona of an artistic individual who never develops beyond her character concept. She's a bit of a tease towards Kelly giving him little smiles and flirty come on's yet gets angered when he responds. She's then given the plot that she's getting married to a guy named Miner to when she's ever asked about the marriage she quickly responds I don't want to talk about it. Why? They never explain it. It was assumed by me that she was set up from another rich family and forced to marry him. But it's never explained in the sloppy script.So Kelly confronts her in a really bad scene when she's crying complaining her fiance kissed another woman which leads to a kiss between the two characters. If she hardly seems to care about her fiance why does she care that he cheated? It's plot holes like that that make the movie unbearable to watch at times.

The concerns of being too melodramaticwere obviously addressed and taken seriously given the fact that many scenes  including the brick wall scene with the father the group hug and Shia's crying in the hospital  were all mercifully absent from the version I saw last night at the Arclight where the filmmakers were in attendance to answer questions. Also contributing to the film's success were good camerawork excellent editing a brisk pace and a score that while instrumentally reminiscent of American Beauty in both its use of tablas and quiet piano notes during the romanticscenes helped tremendously in conveying teenage angst and confusion.Project Greenlight may seem a rare and wonderful treat for strugglingfilmmakers but it also must be an ungodly ordeal given not only the mediaattention but the difficulty of the assignment itself Pete Jones managed also remarkably to come through relatively unscathed last year though his film was not as good as this one.  So whatever you want to say about these guys and there seems to be quite abit of animosity and understandably jealousy the bottom line is they survived making a first feature without going insane and did it while a documentary crew followed their every move publicly recording their best and worst moments. To me that alone is a remarkable achievement and as a filmmaker myself I canguarantee that most moments on a low budget first feature are far less thangreat.  As I told them last night before the Q and A they should be extremely proud of what they accomplished no matter how the film came out.  The fact that it's a funny entertaining and  in my view welldirected  entry into the comingof age genre is merely icing on the cake and LA and New York Times critics canbe damned  because they've never made a film and never will.Kyle Efram and Erica I congratulate you and wish you the best of luck.".

For starters I am sick to think that this script was the best out of over 15000 scripts that were submitted in the Project Greenlight competition. Second the direction in the movie is far from anything gritty or original. A generic style of anything basic Shaker Heights is more of a student film with Hollywood production value than anything gritty or truly independent. Third the casting of this film was hit and miss. Half of the actors were excellent while the other half simply read their lines from the script and nothing else. A simple rule in movie making that this production failed to follow was the relationship of the leading role with the movie. Your leading man . woman must identify with some percentage of the audience. If nobody understand what the character is going through they don't care. Not only does the leading character fail to progress or change as a person by the end of the movie but the characters motivation is pointless and the audience loses interest with him before we reach the half way point. If this was a low budget and a true independent film I could see not being so negative. But I can't. If you spend over 1 million dollars and you have professional cast and crew members working for you it is your job to produce a good film. Shaker Heights is not a good film. My two cents.".

Reminds me a little of other movies in which people walked the edge Sterile Cuckoo for instance.The kid LaBoeuf is in high school and is something of an outsider.  He makes enemies and he makes a friend sort of.  He's ordinary looking but seems to know everything about everything  from flowers to art and military history.  He'd give all this up in one big jiffy if his friend's sister Amy Smart a blonde graduate student who is so stunningly gorgeous that she is to physical beauty what LaBoeuf is to intellectual prowess would only give him a tumble.  And she does.  A little anyway after an especially bad hair day when she needs a little cuddling and reassurance.  The problem of course is that this little kiss of sympathy means little to her but emotionally he's working at about at his grade level.In the end he more or less grows up and starts dating the plain but rather engaging girl of his own age who works at the same supermarket. There are some subplots thrown in.  LaBoeuf's father managed to lose all the kid's college money so the kid hates him.  Kathleen Quinlan is the mother and there are tearful scenes in which she tells LaBoeuf that he LaBoeuf hates the man she loves.  Much of this seems to belong to a different movie. And I'm not sure Dad deserves much in the way of admiration having deprived his own kid of an education at Dartmouth and doomed him to a community college.  For that matter I'm not sure that Tabby the blonde he falls for deserves his adoration.  In a frantic lastminute talk with her when she's about to be married he tells her that the groom is not good enough for her because he's just some kind of wouldbe industrialist while she is an artist.  I missed the first few minutes but her work as we see it later as she plays with diffusion  well there are more staggeringly gripping abstracts that have been done by elephants literally.  I kind of liked Tabby's boy friend though.  He's tall muscular and handsome and looks stupid.  When he and LaBoeuf first meet LaBoeuf comes up with some insane riff about how his job at the supermarket makes him a caterpillar industrialist.  The boy friend whistles and looks puzzled but then anyone would in the face of this uncrafted explication of what it means to be a pupa.  And when we meet the boy friend later for a minute or two he seems like a genuinely nice guy who admits to having rented his tuxedo and who is really in love with Tabby.  I had the feeling that he and Tabby  not just Amy Smart but ANYBODY named Tabby  would get along just fine. Even the divorce would be what is called amicable.Too many things are going on in the movie but LaBoeuf comes across as a kid who will eventually grow up and be a success in life once he is able to differentiate between makebelieve and realpolitik.  It could easily have been worse.".

All one has to do is look at CLERKS CHASING AMY the original HALLOWEEN and BETTER LUCK TOMORROW to see what can be done for a few hundred grand or less.  Instead SHAKER HEIGHTS looks like it was made by a group that concluded a million dollars was no money and they'd put on a good show more for the HBO audience than the theatre audience apparently.Once the project was picked this group had the luxury of making a feature film without using their own money going in debt to finish it up feverishly look for investors or the chore of finding a distributor that may explain the mediocre result.  This movie had NINE PRODUCERS TWO DIRECTORS and THE WRITER ON SET to answer questions.  Sadly it looks like little got done.The directors adding a custom Hot Lips license plate to the army Jeep served no grand purpose.  That use of thought and power could have been better served elsewhere.  As a whole the movie looked like it was hacked to pieces in the editing bay.  One minute the lead character Kelly played quite nicely by Shia LeBeouf gets to drive the Jeep... then he's huffing it on a bike... then he has the Jeep again... then is back huffing it on the bike.  It looks like info was missing as to why the character would alternate.As far as locations they didn't have many 3 houses a school a hospital some woods and a grocery store.  Funny thing was there were never many customers in the store.  Heck the Quick Stop in CLERKS had more customers a.k.a. production value.Even more strange the filmmakers appeared to recycle establishing shots.  I could swear I saw the same establishing shots of Kelly's house and the grocery store recycled as if they didn't shoot different angles... and used the same shot more than once.Then there is 'the kiss.'  We've waited most of the movie for Kelly's big kiss with 'Tabby' Amy Smart's character... and it's a Jr. High kiss.All in all THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS plays like a cheap TV movie that lacked a clear leader.In the future I hope Miramax and Project Greenlight takes a good look at their system.  Maybe a million dollars is too much... maybe nine producers are too many... maybe the crews are too big... maybe having too many trucks doesn't allow the filmmakers to be mobile and do better work.But one thing is certain With all the resources given the movies of Project Greenlight need to get better than the first two.".

I know they want to give aspiring directors their first break but somehow it doesn't work... mostly because they walk on to a the set and go Now what? because they've never ever worked on a movie set unlike most directors whove put in their share of time as a set grunt running coffee helping with equipment basically getting their feet wet. I think Battle... would have been great in the hands of a good director its too bad for the screenwriter I hope she gets more work based on the merits of the original screenplay and not ignored because of the movie. I think Amy Smart was wasted which is terrible she is so amazing the storyline had NO flow there was absolutely ZERO character development.

Either that or the other 9000plus entries were real turkeys! The story is totally unfocussed switching between stories of  highschool rivalries domestic discord and unrequited love with little or nothing to connect them. I read that Shia LaBeouf is considered to be a future star and he gets the lion's share of screen time as the lead character Kelly. Unfortunately Kelly  is a selfcentered and boorish young man who disses his parents his teachers and his adoring female friend with no regard for their feelings. We are supposed to like him though because he is the victim of a school bully. Getting our sympathy for such a character was always going to be hard  and LaBeouf fails to pull this off. Considering the quality of the supporting castand the involvement of Affleck and Damon I was expecting a much better movie than this.  The film is not actually bad and there are some good performances but the whole thing just doesn't hang together. The final twist that reveals why Kelly has resisted the romantic advances of Sarah Shiri Appleby comes completely out of the blue  a cardinal sin in all the writing classes I've attended. It sounds like a hastily thoughtup excuse for a happy ending. Ironically the final scene it sets up is actually the best part of the film with LaBeouf and Appleby clowning around sweetly like real young lovers. This review is based on the Region one DVD release. As the film runs for a bare 79 minutes I was expecting some interesting extras on the DVD but there are none apart from some previews. Poor show Miramax!".

This movie fails to meet even that low standard I've set. Hollywood crap would be better.Various reviews below pointed out the movie failed because of this or that. Whatever the reason it isn't even a halfdecent afterschool special.Flaw 0 The movie just drags. If this weren't a HBO's Project Green Ligh PGL production I would have changed the channel after 15 minutes 30 minutes max.Flaw 1 I guess the main point of using new directors is to get a fresh look and style that studio films lack. The standard studio look and style would have been a plus. The look couldn't be blander boring even. Flaw 2 The main character Kelly is an unlikable smartmouth  smarta.I think they were trying to portray Kelly as quickwitted tortured soul but failed miserably. Sometimes there's that kid in every high school who is going through some undeserved hardship and you sympathize with himher. But then there's that smartmouth ahole who deserve all the trouble heshe bring onto themselves. Kelly is that ahole. Why would I care for his troubles?Flaw 3 the climax of the film where he is kissed by an older woman and then eventually emotionally hurt by her is so short and thin I almost missed it.Flaw 4 there's nothing new. Style is... no style. The main character Kelly is in conflict with his parents. Kelly gets into trouble at school because he is an outsider. He loves a girlwoman who is out of his league. Kelly is tormented by a school bully. Kelly takes revenge on the bully via some smart unique and a clever way. Another girl has a crush on Kelly but he doesn't seem to notice her. Yada yada yada...Flaw 5 the story is told in such a way that I can't identify with anybody's pains. Not the main character Kelly the older woman who's marrying a man she doesn't love the mother who is troubled by the schism between the father and the son the father who might be dying the friend who's life is already planned out by his father more Yada yada yada...Flaw 6 The actor Shia Kelly over acts every scene. I read in other review how good his acting is in this film but I strongly disagree. His over acting isn't obvious as the cheesy double takes in a comedy but still bad. Compare his acting with the young actors in Stand by me and you'll agree that it is bad. If you look at other reviews below there is a large cluster of positive reviews early in the movie's release. I suspect these are people who1 are fans of PGL 2 are fellow filmmakers who sympathize with the difficulty of directing a film 3 were expecting a trainwreak like the first PGL's Stolen Summer but got something better 4 got caught up in the PGL's opening night fanfare. Almost all later reviews are very negative in contrast. Go do the math.Even if you get a chance to see this movie on cable TV for free... don't bother. It is a complete waste of your 1.5 hours.".

The film has an ironic wit and a casual style that is refreshing to watch.  In the first segment he just drives around Rome on his Vespa admiring housing projects spouting admiration for Jennifer Beale and searching for the spot where Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered.  In one hilarious scene he takes time out from his ride to berate a movie critic for giving a favorable review to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer.  In the second segment Moretti goes hopping around the Italian Islands spectacularly filmed and tries in vain to get some writing done.  On one island all of the families have just one child who willfully dominates the parents.  In the third segment Moretti recounts in almost documentary style the true story of his search for a cure for his baffling skin condition which causes unbearable itching.  His many visits to dermatologists and pharmacies are presented in excruciating detail but not without an air of wry detachment. Moretti's closing take is memorable.  If you watch this film on its own terms it's a wonderful viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it is cute and Woody Allenish but there is something more. It is a movie about an ordinary man who enjoys doing quiet things by himself such as riding around Rome on his Vespa and walking by himself he is not a hero he's anyone. The music is really good and I managed to find it all on Napster and other sources. Notice some themes such as the Soccerfootball nets goals and the scene where he watches the nun on tv that same scene is in Cinema Paradiso! I like World music so the scene of the band playing for the dancers is greatwho is that group...what is the song? I didn't like the interposed parts showing Henri the serial killer or the Italian movie and I thought the last story was a bit boring notice on the scene where he is looking for Passolini's murder spot how he just doubles back on himself.I could go on talking about this film and it comes in as one of my five best Cinema Paradiso Unbearable Lightness of Being Manhattan and The Year of Living Dangerously.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caro diario dear journal is a little undiscovered gem of a movie maybe a bit artsy but never pretentious or boring. The main character is Nanni Moretti the director played by himself. Using a very original narrative sometimes giving the impression you're watching a documentary only to be surprised when Nanni continues what the offvoice was saying to a guy in a convertible it is an observation of different and random aspects of today's Italian society. In the first part Nanni rides around Rome on his vespa alternating monologues commenting whatever's in sight with long cinematic scenes where the images and music ooze a mood that says  all the most memorable example of this being the visit to the beach where Passolini got murdered. In the second and most hilarious part he and a friend visit several Italian islands in search of peace and quiet. This part contains some Woody Allenesque observations on human nature tough comparing Moretti with Woody Allen would be underrating him as making an island impossible to live on because it only consists of couples with a single child and illustrating it in such a witty manner seems far out of Allen's reach. The third part is Moretti's quest for a cure for his skin disease taking him from doctor to homeopath to dermatologist and back. This seamed the lesser of the three parts yet still very entertaining and funny tough somehow an anticlimatic ending to a great movie. And a great movie it is certainly considering the director's favourite flic is 'Flashdance'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had to purchase this film after seeing it once late at night on a cable channel many years ago. Although the director can come off as an effete intellectual his focus is on the Italian culture as it has changed over the past 30 years. As a passive observer of Roman lifestyles this film is better appreciated when you have some first hand experience living in Rome  since the director's point of view seems to come directly from this city. In a certain way Caro Dario is the intellectual version or sequel to Fellini's Roma. Instead of satirizing low brow Roman lifestyles Caro Dario spoofs the pretentious intellectuals like his traveling comrade who finally breaks down and admits he is a soap opera addict and the couples who have read various philosophical and historical works to their only son every night to help him go to sleep. As the parents are rattling off the list of philosophers and historians ... we have read Hegel Wittgenstein Herodotus read and reread Cicero they hesitate for a moment not recalling one of the authors and the son chimes in Tacitus!. It was funny just appreciating the stark contrast of the family's existence and lifestyle as compared to the principles and content of what they had been reading to their son. I call it a relaxing comedy because it depends on vignettes for comedy and then intersperses great scenery and music in between. The comedic moments are just pointed enough to keep the film interesting e.g. the very precise translation of mezzo scemo by Jennifer Beals the island of misfit parents whose children reign and the inside view of Roman medical care. Now all that's needed is a prequel to Roman culture. We have seen the Rome of the 1930s through the 1970s in Fellini's Roma. Caro Dario takes us from the 1960s to the 1990s. Perhaps a good satire on the culture at the time Verdi through to World War I.".

The TV thing was a riot as was the Dr. prescription part. You will enjoy this film especially if you enjoy the Italian mind set. The hunt for peace and quiet is so close to everyday life that it fits like a glove. I was not aware of Nanni until I saw this title on the movie list on the Dish. I recorded it and played it back later. The cinematography is beautiful and the main character Nanni has an infectious voice and deadpan face. which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this zany Italian movie.  I like good clean humor based on bizarre situations and this movie hit the mark unlike any other film I've seen.  In Caro Diario Dear Diary Nani Moretti directs himself as the main character in three chapters. He is portrayed as a slightly eccentric man who rarely smiles but ends up pursuing somewhat odd pursuits.In the first chapter he rides his Vespa scooter in the suburbs of Rome. He likes to explore different neighborhoods and think about what kinds of people live in each.  When he finds homes of particular interest he makes up a story about his being a filmmaker and considering that apartment to be a set to make an excuse to see the inside.I like the second chapter the best where Nani goes to visit a friend in the Italian islands who is studying James Joyce's Ulysses for 30 years if memory serves me right.  He wants to share quiet time to work on his own project making a film based on collected clippings of strange realworld stories from the newspapers.In their quest to find the ideal island to work on I found the funniest part of the film where they are on an island where it seems everybody has a child.  When people call each other the children always pick up and inevitably the adults find themselves playing a game of what does the cow say?  moo!  what does the duck say?  quack! the children urging them on and not passing the phone on.  I laughed quite a bit when Nani finds three folks near each other all on public telephones trying in vain to talk to their adult friends he pauses then makes an animal noise as his contribution!The third chapter is slightly less interesting than the other two.  In this concluding portion Nani is faced with a terrible itch when he sleeps.  He consults doctor after doctor  skin doctors allergists acupuncturists ...  and gets different advise from each.  After collecting a large collection of creams pills and tinctures he ends up visiting a surgeon.It was a fun film that the whole family would enjoy with a bizarre wry humor. Though I didn't enjoy it as much as the film Amelie the quirkiness in Caro Diario reminds me a little bit of Amelie especially in the 1st chapter.  This film is in Italian with English subtitles.  I would gladly see it again  it was a lucky video find! 7 stars out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The uncertainty of any definition for Caro Diario is what makes it so special. A documentary? Film? An autobiography? A narcissistic record? Maybe a little bit of everything but at the same time denying it all.Speaking about Caro diario only loses for the pleasure of watching the film performed by the Italian Nanni Moretti in 1993. Morreti is already referenced a few years ago as a representative figure of the new phase of Italian cinema. I confess that I had only previously watched a Morreti film being presented to the director through his Italian classes and in which we watched Habemus Papam in 2011.Caro Dirio is a unique work that is done through three episodes with an autobiographical character and in dialogue with the documentary. Moretti could run the risk of doing something dangerously narcissistic but by having a look writing and personality so interesting Caro turns into a jocular free movie to mock its own author from His homeland his friends the public ... The mosaic of the world that circulates Moretti is so true that in several moments the reciprocity and familiarity of situations not only cross the protagonist of this story but also the one that watches. As for example we do not identify with the inability of physicians to listen to their patients but in contrast the doctors' ability to speak and recite medicines that do not help our illnesses especially in Responsibility for healing.References are not always pleasant as they generally tend to reduce the merit of people in the case of Moretti is sincere how much Woddy Allen inspired the director or is only personal connections of the public since in various moments of the film we have Memory and familiarity of typical approaches to Allen's autobiographical films such as his direct narrative his insertion as a man and character his sarcastic comments the division of chapters using nominative posters the ability to laugh at himself and endings that always follow The opposite of expected or desired.The use of a soundtrack that at different times is something that arises externally and that ends up influencing or creating moments of the music itself a dialogue between character and melody work excellently and much say of the relation and influence of Latin rhythms or Of old songs in Moretti's lineup. One of the most beautiful moments of the film is Moretti's homage to Italian filmmaker Paolo Pasolini a motorcycle scooter to the place where the director was murdered to the sound of Korn's concert Keith Jarrett.The wasp vehicle for only one person. The island a metaphor for the individual solitude. The doctor professional who takes care of the body of each individual Every very particular body of each person. The titles of each part in which the Daily Diaries divide are in some way a notion of the individual of the particular as a diary also does. Here however it is not an intimate narrative Moretti may be egocentric but this does not make him selfabsorbed. His idiosyncratic peculiar way is in fact a way that could be anyone's We notice it in Moretti simply because he exposes himself.Both the photography and the lighting are punctual not going beyond what is necessary so little innovation in the specific lighting is notorious the use of natural light which greatly collaborates in the creation of a documentary and biographical character very close to the street documentaries or programs The first chapter which uses an interesting camera work both for the movement and the break of open and closed plans this first part refers very much to the television programs which usually Present the neighborhoods of a large city through a personality.Caro diario is mainly a conversation between the director and the audience which creates an opportunity for intimacies that we can rarely experience either through documentaries or the various film genres. A film of sensitivity even when dead seams even when it is set inside out. A diary that we help to write and that certainly is a pleasure to accompany. Congratulations Moretti!".

Part three sees him suffering a disease and insomnia in real life as well going through various doctors who give him different opinions and diagnoses and finally Xrays show he has a lung problem with a treatable tumour and it concludes with him finding a medical encyclopedia and having a sarcastic toast.

As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children  but not separately the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience as he feared he might be from the trailer.  Caan is good but has to work with the scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.".

Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be reunited with his longlost father Caan in an inspired bit of casting a 'naughtylist' occupant who works as a children's book publisher in New York City just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG' with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau who has a cameo and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note Billingsley best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!".

	schema:reviewBody "It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So to fully enjoy this movie watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humornobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler Rob Schneider Will Farrell Jim Carrey Chris Farley Chevy Chase and David Spade but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks Will for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!".

	schema:headline " This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as The Santa Clause and Dare I say? Miracle on 34th Street. Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa Ed Asner was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf Bob Newhart. He is called Buddy Will Ferrell and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter James Caan who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily Mary Steenburgen and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie Zooey Deschanel and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like Made and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting Dinner For 5 on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says Hell once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!".

It was nice to see Will Ferrell in a role where his character didn't have these ridiculous scenes where he overplays to make it hilarious and just misses the spot. The funnier scenes were well played out by Will and fit the character of Buddy the Elf.Sounds like my impressions of the film doesn't coincide with my rating of it but it was a perfectly fine Christmassy flick that left me with a smile.

	schema:reviewBody "I do love Christmas movies always a sucker for them even if the style and story is not new or different. Elf does bring some new story to the typical Christmas movie but for the most part it's same old same old which for someone who loves the Christmas movie is great!! Unfortunately I am not a fan of Will Ferrell okay granted I thought Night At The Roxbury was pretty funny but everything else since then has been horrid. Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.Elf is the story of an orphan who accidentally makes his way into Santa's magical bag on Christmas Eve as a baby. When Santa discovers him he puts him in the care of the elves in particular Papa Elf. The elves raise him as one of their own despite his size difference and a few other more human traits he is raised to believe he is just another Elf. Buddy as he is known has now reached the age that Papa Elf believes he should know the truth especially considering that Buddy has a real father alive and well who didn't even know he existed. Buddy is excited about making his way to New York City to meet his real father. He travels from the safe land of The North Pole where he knows and understands everything into the brutal modern world of New York City. Buddy sticks out like a sore thumb and not just because of his green elf costume he insists on wearing but his politeness his fascination with the simple annoyances of life and his insistence that he is truly an elf from the North Pole. He finally tracks down his real father Walter a big time children's book publicist who spends more time working than with his wife and other son. Buddy tries to explain that he is Walter's son but Walter has him removed from the building. After being kicked out Buddy meets a friend in Jovie a rather down on her luck Gimble's worker who plays an Elf for the Christmas season. Although first rather nervous about Buddy she begins to warm up to his childlike innocence. Buddy continues to do all he can to get back to see his Dad and eventually with a blood test Walter discovers this rather imbalanced man is indeed his son. Walter's wife Emily insists that Buddy stay with him. Buddy does everything he can to spread Christmas cheer and turn everything more Christmasy wherever he goes. Unfortunately his ignorance to the real world infuriates Walter and he just wants Buddy to go away but both his wife and other son have become very attached to Buddy. Buddy tries his hand at working with Walter which causes disaster and eventually Buddy finds himself all alone until Santa has a bit of a disaster himself and crashes the sleigh into Central Park. The sleigh won't fly because their is no Christmas spirit left. Fortunately Buddy has touched enough people's lives for Jovie and Emily and Michael to bring Christmas spirit back for everyone including Walter who finally realizes what is important. Buddy will save Christmas for everyone!! Buddy is a great Christmas character. His naivety and ignorance is funny but touching and cute. Ferrell actually does manage to pull that off thank goodness. Although I don't know if they make Buddy pure enough that it actually comes across that he is touching these people's lives. The real laughs are with the physical comedy in the film mostly entirely done by Ferrell but it's very funny. James Caan is so out of place and yet so perfect for the role of Walter. He fits in but doesn't at all which is kind of strange. Bob Newhart as the narrator and Papa Elf is also a great little cameo. And the great Ed Asner as bit rough around the edges but very caring Santa is also great. Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie is a good choice. Although at first she doesn't seem like the right pick they actually have decent chemistry and she plays her role with a lot of depth for the short time she gets. Director Jon Favreau does a good job of creating something I actually compared to the amazing classic Miracle on 34th Street. Much of this film reminded me of a more updated modern version of that film which is a great honor. While I don't think Elf has the staying power it's still a cute little Christmas film with a tolerable Will Ferrell and a good family film. Pick it up this Christmas or even if you just feel like being in the Christmas Spirit. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I saw Elf when it was first released theatrically in 2003. I did not see it again until 2016. I forgot everything about this film. What I can't believe was that I forgot how wonderful this film was. It does everything you want in a Christmas movie. This film is full of Christmas Spirit that most films never seem to capture.

IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I saw Elf when it was first released theatrically in 2003. I did not see it again until 2016. I forgot everything about this film. What I can't believe was that I forgot how wonderful this film was. It does everything you want in a Christmas movie. This film is full of Christmas Spirit that most films never seem to capture.

	schema:reviewBody "Elf 2003 Dir Jon Favreau  Cast Will Ferrell James Caan Zooey Deschanel Mary Steenburgen Bob Newhart The story of little people doing big things or in this case big people doing even bigger things. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf which adds that fable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedy taking the elf theme to new heights. Score 9   10".

	schema:reviewBody "At first glance it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the directorstar of the snappy sardonic Swingers and soontobe director of Iron Man of all things. Yet curiously enough it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so wellsuited ha for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closetedselfloathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks check out the distinctly Rudolfesq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes some of the film's most delightful additions but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare Elf delivers a story of a fishoutofwater outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film but bouncing along like a pointy hatsporting George Bailey Buddy the Elfhuman? Elfman? Humelf...? remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty the you're not Santa! toy store brawl is already iconic but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story weaving in touching beats throughout as Buddy connects with his estranged naughty listed father and thug life brother and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker one of the film's few objectionable bits  while cute it's a bit underdeveloped not to mention eyebrow raiseworthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who for all intents and purposes has the mental facilities of a 12year old.... Pacingwise the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically with popping vibrant candy colours and softfocus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park beset by Nazgllike park rangers would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink and strained as it might feel he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks  who could begrudge to a finale that dives wholehog into sentiment  a Christmas spiritinducing singalong no less!  so confidently and unironically that unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings' it actually works really well. Hell  if James Caan's humbug can sing along you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kidfriendly slapstick and thankfully only one burp joke Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life mining it for the utmost of wideeyed truth and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast thankfully are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitchperfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elfson while a jarringly blonde Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure. Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The everadorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos  hey there Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter!  while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eyerolling Elf is a true delight and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup though. That's a step too far. 8.510".

On the other hand I felt it was a little too cloying and saccharine. There were some very entertaining moments and good scenes but it's obvious this movie was made for the whole family which is fine and in the end it didn't feel like a great movie. It felt like a good movie. You have to be ready to stomach the shmaltz mind you and there is a lot. I'm torn between rating it 6 or 7. Why? Because on one hand the shmaltzy elements alienated me a bit from the film but on the other hand the movie has heart and is essentially a feelgood Christmas movie with all the fixins. And I don't want to come across like a Scrooge. It was wellfilmed. Zooey looked beautiful. It was funny in a broad sort of way. James Caan isn't as badass or mean as you originally think and in the end he seems rather likable. My complaint is that the movie could have more edge. Maybe it's because I spent the last few days watching really good thrillers but I felt like this movie could have had a darker dark side. For me it would have enriched the experience. As it stands now it's sweet fun harmless and stands alone as a rather storybook Christmas fairytale that can appeal to a huge demographic. But heed this warning There are a large share of Christmas songs and several shmaltzy moments. Add this to your Christmas movie list. It's worth it. It ain't the best but it's a well put together little tale with enough funny moments to make the experience worthwhile. And a heckuva lot of Christmas spirit. Cheesy and cloying at times but still... it's there. Enjoy it.".

I was going to leave a comment without reading any others because I had an idea what I would read having heard lots of favorable opinions from others regarding this movie. Then I decided I really needed to read what others wrote and my suspicions were confirmed precisely Several people saying how great or cute this movie was and the occasional person telling it essentially how it really was. I'll add to that. Was this movie just silly which connotes an innocent lack of intelligent matter or was it stupid connoting something a bit deeper? Considering that movies at least the Hollywood variety are created to make money I'll put my money on the latter. Hollywood knows there are a lot of people out there who have nothing better to do with their money than to shell it out at the movie theater to watch something unoriginal uncreative and with roles that require no particular acting talent. These people also won't demand that within whatever flight of fancy a story may take the story follow rules it sets for itself. For instance Buddy is required to eat apparently since he consumes voluminous portions at the meals we see yet he travels quite some distance from the North Pole without eatingor sleeping which is obviously something else he's required to do. He also is stupidchildlike for no reason for which we're ever made aware. He's stupidchildlike because he's grown up as an elf? Why then are not the other elves like that? If he's stupid because he's grown up with elves why doesn't he start figuring things out once he's with humans?I guess the movie had quite a few funny scenes? I'm not sure which ones they were. The snowball fight wasn't bad. But the scene where he sings to his dad was not the scene where his created Christmas display in the department store got destroyed was not his belching was not his answering his dad's phone Buddy the Elfwhat's your favorite color? was not.It takes very little acting talent to act stupid through an entire movie as did Will Ferrell. I think most anyone could do it. James Caan's role was one he's played a hundred times and the same goes for Bob Newhart. Does no one ever get tired of that? A person searching for his father and trying to get him to change even if the person doing the searching was raised as an elf is not terribly original. To add further insult to our intelligence not only was the scene where the father changes for the better highly predictable it didn't even have a real buildup to get him to change! It was just Okay Mr. Caan your character has to have a change of heart now please show us a change of heart and that was it. To annoy us even further the girl of course decides she must sing out for everyone to hear. But none of this matters because dimwits are cute and endearing and sentimentality sells regardless of the lack of intelligence attached to it.Thank you all for supporting this movieyou ensure that other garbage like this will be made many more times in the future.".

To annoy us even further the girl of course decides she must sing out for everyone to hear. But none of this matters because dimwits are cute and endearing and sentimentality sells regardless of the lack of intelligence attached to it.Thank you all for supporting this movieyou ensure that other garbage like this will be made many more times in the future.";

When Buddy was doing his silly stuff the other characters just stood there as if they were waiting for him to finish his lines instead of reacting as you would expect New Yorkers to react to a wacko like that.James Caan was believable but no one else was.

There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example. Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to grossout humor but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell a former Saturday Night Live actor stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father James Caan lives in New York City he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fishoutofwater comedy. The writing is halfhearted so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which of course they do. And Ferrell along with his family and his girlfriend have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend a very cute Zooey Deschanel who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart Charles Durning and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes Amy Sedaris was also there somewhere but I must have missed her was she one of the elves?. 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Read together the biographies of Tennessee Williams and Vivien Leigh and you'll know why the depressing aspects of this movie are so realistic!! Vivien was at the time the movie was made going through her painful divorce from Laurence Olivier.  In the middle of making the film she had dinner with her beloved Olivier and Joan Plowright at which time he told her that he was marrying Joan.  Vivien had electroshock treatments right after wrapping this movie.  That desolate soulsearing sadness in her eyes isn't acting!Tennessee Williams features gigolos procurers and prostitutes in many of his plays and this was no exception although the 'action' is disguised by the highfaluting manners of the Countessa the madam who lives off the earnings of her 'boys'.  You wonder how much Tennessee may have fashioned the play on Miss Leigh's life as 'Mrs. Stone' is an actress past her prime whose husband has just absented himself from her life and his as well. Williams exquisitely portrays the way we use one another for our own advantage and Beatty with a crummy Italian accent does a great job of 'playing' the selfinvolved narcissistic money hungry Lothario.  Once he hooks her he delights in sadistically attacking her for her 'weakness' in loving him.  Ever been there?  At that time in his life Beatty was playing a similar but more innocent role with almost every woman in Hollywood.  He has matured well.The writing was excellent the scenery in Rome magnificent but you will be so depressed after seeing this excellent movie that I suggest you also check out 'Bulworth' as a double feature to follow with.  Beatty on two sides of his career is worth comparing drama and comedy villain and hero.  I believe you'll have to say that Warren Beatty is an actor as well as a movie star.Even though Vivien Leigh did not care for Beatty's arrogance while making this movie she was able to turn the horror of her personal life into something constructive as did Tennessee Williams for which we the public should always be grateful.  To make art from the ashes of a marriagedestroyed by death or divorce is something each of us would do well to learn.For those of you with indomitable spirits  another Tennessee Williams film to see for comparison purposes is Summer and Smoke.  The interplay between the romantic leads is more equal but both portray the sadness from Tennessee's sister Rose's life.  She was a beautiful Southern flower intimidated by her overbearing mother and alcoholic father who wound up having a lobotomy as did another sad victim child of our nation's leading family.  Tennessee paid homage to her tragic life in many of his plays and these are no exception.  Intelligent beautiful but completely impotent at withstanding the aggression of those around her Mrs. Stone is a prime example of a 'Rose by another name'.".

This is her penultimate film which was really made as a vehicle for her talents without much of an ensemble cast and she's in nearly every scene. But the great actress is certainly up to the task of making this material work although she is let down at times by contrivances of plot and other aspects of believability.Taken from famous playwright Tennessee William's novella the story concerns aging actress Karen Stone who yearns to retire with her rich husband who unfortunately expires while on their way to Rome for their extended getaway. Then the lonely widow starts dating a handsome young Italian guy who has an unusually close relationship with the sinister contessa who introduced them both.Vivien Leigh as Karen Stone drifts through the movie an ethereal presence that's nearly translucent extremely delicate and cautiously mannered. The machinations of the plot allow her many opportunities to overstate or exaggerate which is something Leigh never does. Many have said that this source material is kind of second rate Tennessee Williams but even if true Vivien Leigh's work here makes the very best of it in an engaging style.And the movie has the added benefit of young future superstar Warren Beatty making his second feature film. Needless to say he looks fantastic making it much more believable that Mrs. Stone would become so enamored with him. It's evident that Beatty clearly dove headfirst into an attempt to transform himself into an Italian gigolo. I find the Italian accent he attempted to be perhaps a little lacking at some points in the way of his hitting a few wrong pronunciations that sound artificial at very few and select times. Other than that minor detail Beatty fills the role more than adequately and his star power is in abundance.And no small mention must go to fabulous Lotte Lenya who scored an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress in this as this unctuous Eurotrash contessa who deals in romantic relationships usually for women of a certain class age and wealth. She's extremely creepy and look for a frightening scene set inside a cavernous discotheque where the camera follows Lenya slithering through the crowd making her way to the fragile Mrs Stone. Every scene with Lenya is a highlight in this movie and also see how her intense love for her pet cat is expressed in the way Lenya artfully handles the willing feline.The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone surely a mustsee for devotees of Williams Leigh Beatty or Lenya and anyone who enjoys colorful European settings vivid characters and glossy romantic drama. out of ".

	schema:headline " Perfect Casting";
	schema:reviewBody "The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone is based on a novella by Tennessee Williams and I'm sure it was Tennessee who saw to it that Vivien Leigh was cast in the title role. After all Vivien had won an Oscar for playing that other Tennessee Williams sex starved female Blanche Dubois.But Karen Stone is a woman very much like Vivien Leigh was in real life. Karen is an actress who's refused to grow old gracefully when we meet her she's just been trashed by the London critics for a very bad portrayal of Rosamund in As You Like It. She's 50 trying to play a young girl in her teens. Better she should have played Queen Gertrude in a revival of Hamlet.Anyway she and her husband decide to take a long holiday in Rome but as the plane is landing her husband has a heart attack and dies. He's left her well fixed and after a suitable period of mourning Mrs. Stone is ready for a little action in her life.This is Tennessee Williams so we're talking sex here. Vivien maybe too old to play Rosalind but she's not too old to enjoy what Rosalind enjoys. And Lotte Lenya who makes a living procuring young men for her clients is willing to supply. Warren Beatty is what Vivien thinks she wants. Warren is the only real weakness in The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone. He does pout an awful lot in the role and his accent is phony. But Vivien who was going through mid life crisis for decades before she died in 1967 was perfect casting. I'm not sure how much of it is acting and how much she's just playing herself. The woman had a lot of emotional and physical problems and as her husband Laurence Olivier frankly admitted she was a nymphomaniac in real life. Lotte Lenya got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress as the Countess. However this was the year of West Side Story and Rita Moreno beat her in that category.This was one of the frankest discussions about sex ever put on film up to that time. In fact though no gay sex is discussed right at the beginning you see a couple of men meeting for a tryst and you can spot a few obviously gay couples strolling throughout Rome. The Code was definitely coming down.One of the big pluses The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone has is that it was shot completely in The Eternal City. The movie industry loved Rome at that time with Roman Holiday Three Coins In The Fountain The Seven Hills Of Rome and now The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone all showing Rome to its best advantage. The other three films were a lot more upbeat than this one was.Stage director Jose Quintero did a great job with his cast in his one and only big screen production. The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone was done with Helen Mirren in Vivien Leigh's part several years ago. You might want to see both to compare.".

Quite frankly within five minutes I was sitting up in my chair and realizing that this guy was delivering a very assured and compelling performance.Lotte Lenya in rare screen role was amazingly modern  fresh in her delivery. She's one actress who's reputation holds up seen through 21st century eyes.I thought this interpretation of a Tennesse Williams' novella was extremely well done and refreshingly different from the typical studio fare of its day.I'd recommend this film to anyone who would take it seriously and give it half a chance.

	schema:reviewBody "Introduced to a handsome young man during a stay in Italy an insecure widowed US actress fights back her knowledge that the gentleman is just a gigolo in this Tennessee Williams adaptation starring Vivien Leigh in her penultimate big screen performance. Suffering from real life marital problems at the time Leigh provides a performance with an air of vulnerability that rings true but even better is Lotte Lenya of 'From Russia with Love' fame cast here as the conniving 'countess' who introduces Leigh to her young suitor. Rambling on about the virtues of love and companionship Lenya seems like a benevolent force at first but as the film progresses and we see just how hellbent she is on gaining financially from her matchmaking she eventually seems almost as sinister as her better known Bond villainess. Promising as all this might sound though the film is let down by never really igniting romantic sparks between Leigh and Warren Beatty as the young gigolo. Leigh never seems less than delusional to believe that he really loves her and Beatty only ever seems opportunistic. Beatty's awkward performance does not help matters though. He certainly looks the part but with a faltering Italian accent he never feels real whenever he opens his mouth. The main sell point of the film though is surely the dark and deliciously ambiguous ending. One exits the film really feeling like Leigh has suffered a personal blow and the uncertainty of her eventual fate is pitch perfect as she herself is unsure what the future holds for her by the end of the movie.".

Rambling on about the virtues of love and companionship Lenya seems like a benevolent force at first but as the film progresses and we see just how hellbent she is on gaining financially from her matchmaking she eventually seems almost as sinister as her better known Bond villainess. Promising as all this might sound though the film is let down by never really igniting romantic sparks between Leigh and Warren Beatty as the young gigolo. Leigh never seems less than delusional to believe that he really loves her and Beatty only ever seems opportunistic. Beatty's awkward performance does not help matters though. He certainly looks the part but with a faltering Italian accent he never feels real whenever he opens his mouth. The main sell point of the film though is surely the dark and deliciously ambiguous ending. One exits the film really feeling like Leigh has suffered a personal blow and the uncertainty of her eventual fate is pitch perfect as she herself is unsure what the future holds for her by the end of the movie.";

Leigh plays a celebrated but fading stage actress who after suffering a humiliating premiere flees to Rome to escape the world. Though her devoted husband isn't able to join her as planned she stays on secluded in her luxury apartment occasionally venturing out wearing dark glasses. Enter the trolllike but somehow captivating local procurer Lenya who introduces Leigh to her latest prize the handsome Beatty who is eager to make some money off of his own tender flesh. Though Leigh takes more than a little wearing down eventually she and Beatty become heavily acquainted with Leigh becoming more attached than she ought to. Beatty feels he no longer needs Lenya which leads to a scenario that spells despair for Leigh. Leigh who grappled with physical and mental ailments for a large part of her life was incredibly fragile during the filming of this movie having lost the love of her life Laurence Olivier to Joan Plowright. Looking every bit and then some of her age thanks in part to a relentless smoking habit she nonetheless projects loveliness and grace and sports some chic Balmain clothes. She is hampered particularly in the first half by wigs of illjudged color and style but overcomes this to deliver a captivating and sympathetic performance. Her voice is low and lacking the ability to intone with the same nuance and she can't seem to leave certain of her clothes alone in some scenes but the magic is still there. Beatty is really quite awful apart from the inherently challenging attempt of playing Italian. Though he definitely looks good he gives a selfconscious and at times overly emphatic performance that comes close to being laughable at times. Lenya is to die for. She handily steals the scenes she's in with her lascivious expressions and crafty ways. The cast includes Browne as Leigh's vaguely lesbian good friend and St. John as a hot young starlet whose career trajectory is the opposite of Leigh's. Filmed partly on location in Rome it's typically pretty obvious when the locales switch to British soundstages but generally the look is sumptuous whether in Leigh's elegantly appointed home or Lenya's garish one. Interestingly especially considering the time it was made the notion of homosexual prostitution is not ignored. While it isn't necessarily blatant keen viewers will see it presented matteroffactly even leeringly as one gigolo draws attention to a bauble he has acquired from a sugar daddy. It's been noted that author Williams use Leigh's character as an extension of his own feelings and fears and that comes through rather strongly despite the fact that he is not the one who wrote the screenplay. Languidly paced it's not a movie that will appeal to all tastes but fans of the author and of Miss Leigh will want to check it out certainly.".

The story is relevant even today although unfortunately nowadays these things happen with far less elegance and finesse. What holds it back from a higher rating is that the character development between Mrs. Stone and Paolo should have gotten more focus and development. No real explanation is given for how the relationship developed as quickly and strongly as it did. Of course that aspect plays into the cool nature of the film in general which many might find correct for this material but I would have liked a bit more development between the 2 principles. Perhaps neither was able to express much in the way of emotion and that is surely part of the point and the finale when Mrs. Stone throws the keys to the gigolo on the street because realizing that love is elusive physical needs can still be met and that provides a great ending to the film very unsentimental and leaves one with a shiver.I enjoyed the film and recommend it but don't expect anything warm and fuzzy here because that is not in the cards folks.".

	schema:reviewBody "In general it seems that most big name actresses are loathe to admit that time has caught up with them. Too often as they get older the become vain about their age and often portray women MUCH younger than they really are. However in the case of The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone Vivian Leigh does something rather braveshe plays a woman who is about 50 just like Leigh was at the time and who can no longer play these young woman parts. And I can really respect her for playing a character who hits close to home so to speak.When the film begins Karen Stone Leigh is starring in a play. The problem is that her character is just too young for this aging actress to play. Not surprisingly the audience members think the same and instead of continuing she decides to quit and take her husband to Italy. He's been ill and this is the perfect excuse to allow her to gracefully pull out of the play. However on the flight to Rome he has a heart attack and the credits begin. Soon you learn that he died on the flight and Karen is in this strange city...alone and grieving for her husband.Because Mrs. Stone is so vulnerable a horrid old lady has been grooming hergrooming her to be taken by a handsome young gigolo Paulo Warren Beatty. Slowly Paolo insinuates herself into Karen's life and after a while they become lovers. However some possible problems occurPaolo MAY be falling for her for real and Karen soon learns that Paolo has taken advantage of other women and is planning on doing this to her as well. Oddly however the relationship continueseven though his prey knows what she's getting into with him.As I watched this movie I kept wondering why they cast the characters like they did. Although Beatty did a good job as an Italian why not just get a handsome young Italian actor?! Also while Leigh was very good why have her play an American actresswhy not change the story to make her a Brit? I just cannot understand the producer's thinking in both these cases.So is the movie any good? Well yes. But you also have to have a very high tolerance for seeing a woman in pain and not mind how unrelentingly grim the story is. This isn't surprising since it's a story from Tennessee Williams.".

No he was not on a par with Ms. Leigh's talent still he pulled off the character well. The directing the photography and secondary characters are all excellent.

As a woman past her prime and feeling desperate for anyone Leigh is stunning. This may not have been a stretch for Leigh since she was at the time passed her prime and at least desperate for a decent movie role. Her Mrs. Stone is sad pathetic and lost. In other words Blanche DuBois without the garish makeup and southern twang. The film's title may or may not be ironic...is it Mrs. Stone's spring? It's doubtful given the film's downbeat ambiguous ending. Perhaps the Italian gigolo she gets involved with marks a new beginning for her? Jose Quintero's flat direction doesn't really dig too deep.As the gigolo Warren Beatty is awful. Affecting a very phony sounding Italian accent he's almost campy. Lotte Lenya as the contessa who pimps Beatty out is luckier...with her reptilian looks and creepy accent she's decadence incarnate. Jill St. John is in it too but doesn't contribute much beyond an unusually tall hairdo.".

Vivian Leigh is very good but Warren Beatty absolutely stinks in this. Two comments 1. Without a doubt Beatty's Italian accent is the WORST ever in any movie worse than Brad Pitt's German one 2.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film many years ago. I was impressed with it not so much for the direction or the material but because of the fine performances. The acting lifts it out of the domain of the women's film or cheap melodrama. Sure its a strange uneven little film but I think that's part of its charm. Leigh's performance was masterful sad subtle and wistful. Some of the negative comments here tell me this sort of thing is not for everyone's taste. So be itthe incessant gloom the odd arty touches the exotic Roman backdrops the lyrical depiction of a declining jet set society the emphasis on shadowy sombre atmosphere will not appeal to fans of lighter action oriented fare. I never forgot Leigh's performance was she really acting? nor the fantastic alluring decadence of the atmosphere swirling around her. The other performances were a mixed bag Lenya as the creepy pimpcountess is superb. She more than any other player embodies the selfish spirit of this dreary society of drifters beggars pimps and poseurs. Jill St. John is just soso as a tantalizing young starlet some really big sixties hair makes her character visually interesting though. Coral Browne as Karen's best friend is fine but Warren Beatty as the callow young gigolo doesn't quite fit in. He has the look and the superficial cockiness of a young Italian but his accent is so terribleits a major distraction in this undeniably flawed work. For the storyaging Hollywood actress Karen Stone has recently found herself widowed and out of work perhaps permanently. She jets to Rome to relax to find a new lifein other words a new man. She meets old friends then falls in with a suspicious looking crowd of young men and aging American heiresses with time and money to lavish on these young gigolos. Pimps and procurers circle around the scene like vultures waiting to offer anything for a price. Lotte Lenya is one of these pimps. She introduces Karen to Paolo a charming young stud Warren Beatty in his famously uneven performance. That relationship gradually spirals downwardPaolo doesn't enjoy being a kept man. Poor lonely Karen's life spins out of controlshe begins to drift aimlessly. Does the woman have a death wish? After an argument with Paolo she notices a stalker who has been trailing her for weeks. Impulsively she tosses him her room key and stealthily he climbs the stairs to her room. What happens next? No explanation is given at the end. Does the man kill her or does she just offer him a drink? At the end Karen has in her own words stopped the drift. I imagine the gloomier interpretation is closest to the truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone in Syracuse NY in 1981 because I was intrigued to see Jill St. John in an early role. She never looked lovelier especially with longer hair.But beyond that this is a film that reflected the beginning of the Sixties in so many levels. Vivian Leigh in her secondtolast role had just finished her 20year marriage to Laurence Olivier and was having her crises when she made this film. She gives a great performance. Warren Beatty I think manages just fine. His movie career was just starting and would flower as the decade wore on.And for Lotte Lenya her role her led to her turn in From Russia With Love two years later. Both she and Ms. St. John would become part of that Sixties phenomenon the 007 films.Given that this was the last film of Ernest Thesiger who died 14 January 1961 that alone means this was filmed in the final days of the Eisenhower administration. Given that we see Vivian Leigh's character rides in a 1961 Lincoln we clearly get the feel that we're at the real beginning of a memorable decade.No matter what one thinks of the overall movie it captures a moment when the world was changing. For Ms. Leigh it seemed to mark the beginning of an end that took place in 1967. For some of the other performers it was their beginning. And the overall gloomy mood of this film seems to hearken the unease of the Sixties. Worth a watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "Vivien Leigh was so brilliant portraying damagedgoods faded beauty Blanche DuBois in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire that it was perhaps inevitable for her to be asked to play another Williams character who's been beaten up by life 10 years later. Thus in 1961 Leighmore damaged herself now after a recent split with Laurence Olivier following a 20year marriageappeared in the screen adaptation of the Williams novella The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone. In it she plays Karen Stone a middleaged stage actress who has just suffered two major life traumas professional retirement and the death of her much older millionaire husband. She retreats to a villa above the Spanish Steps in the Eternal City to hide from the world and just drift and is soon romanced by a handsome young Italian man Paolo di Leo Warren Beatty. But what Karen only dimly realizes is that Paolo is nothing more than a liragrubbing gigolo working for an elderly pimpprocuress named Contessa TerribiliGonzales Austrian legend Lotte Lenya....Those viewers who come to Mrs. Stone expecting some kind of light romantic comedy a la the Katharine HepburnRossano Brazzi Venetian affair in 1955's Summertime will surely be surprised at how the film unreels. Despite the fact that it is a quiet picture with a sad theme song that plays in a subdued manner only occasionally it is nevertheless a dark and seedy one featuring some truly unsavory characters. The scene transitions are often accomplished in a manner that beggars my poor powers of description and director Jose Quintero gives a brooding unsettling mood to this his first picture a greatlooking one with sumptuous sets. Leigh of course is just marveloustouching and sympathetichere in her penultimate film but the real surprise is how convincing Beatty is at playing an Italian in his second screen appearance. Lenya is snakelike and sinister in her role plotting the destinies of her victims with a purring cat on her lap a la Ernst Stavro Blofeld two years later of course Lenya would play opposite Blofeld and that cat in From Russia With Love. And speaking of future Bond alumni Mrs. Stone also features fine supporting work from Jill St. John Diamonds Are Forever's Tiffany Case and Paul Stassino Thunderball's Maj. Derval. Coral Browne the future Mrs. Vincent Price is well cast as Karen's school friend Meg both actresses were born in 1913 and how great it is to see Ernest Thesiger Bride of Frankenstein's Dr. Praetorius again here in his final screen role! From its lengthy pretitle sequence to its eerie ambiguous ending The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone manages to impress. As regards that ending with the disillusioned Mrs. Stone tossing her house key down to the street ruffian who'd been stalking her throughout the film Jill St. John in one of the DVD interview extras suggests that the thug is merely looking for a soft berth whereas Williams AND Lenya biographer Donald Spoto discerns something a lot more homicidal. I tend to concur more with Spoto here but the matter is certainly open for debate. See the film for yourself and make up your own mind....".

There is so much more to this film than that.Yes its shocking yes its heartbreaking but by talking to the families and friends of the jumpers there is a tremendous insight into the true ramifications of suicide. Some familiesfriends come to terms with it some don't. Some realise that their friendrelation is now at peace while some are angry at the selfishness of it. I found a lot of the film life affirming it also features a survivor and someone who was rescued at the last moment. This really isn't a ghoulish film.It's an excellent documentary that makes no judgements. All it does is spotlight something in society that we don't like to talk about in an intelligent compassionate and unbiased way. There is so much more to this film than just the shock value hopefully people will see that.For what its worth I felt that by deciding to take their own lives in a public forum the jumpers had forgone the right to privacy in their final moments. I didn't feel like a voyeur. I recommend this film very highly.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting where people choose to target their criticism of this film. Whether the director was there with his camera or not the individuals would have done what they did. If setting up a camera to record the acts is morally questionable is talking about it? Reporting it? Discussing it? It's clear that many don't want to face this issue for a variety of reasons that are both universal and specific to the Bay Area. Suicide is a difficult subject and whatever your point of viewit's a sin or it's a releasethe interviews that the director exacts from survivors in every sense of the word in one case are the real soul of this movie.People don't want to talk about it and communities don't want to take responsibility for those faced with mental illness. In the Bay Area there has been a controversial proposal to fence the Bridge so that it won't be so easy for the suicidal. This film makes it clear there's nothing easy about jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.The film doesn't raise the barricade controversy and the fact that there are patrols on the Bridge to identify those at risk. I think that was a wise choice because what the movie ends up being about is the sad horrifying fact that those who leave their families or friends or their communities at large leave misery and apprehension and doubt. Perhaps that's the point. Unable to cope with their own internal conflicts they transfer it to others.I don't remember a work of art dealing with the subject in such a direct manner leaving out psychological justification and medical terminology so we could pretend ignorance. From Shakespeare to Thelma and Louise in our culture there's a false honor given to suicide. This movie makes it very clear that no honor or relief is ever the consequence of selfdestruction.The beauty of the area is so compelling here and the photography is just sensational. The opening sequence in particular intercutting windsurfers with views of the subject both the Bridge and a jumper.As well the range of people interviewed casual witnesses rescuers and the grim faces of family members and friends is quite astonishing. Just when my gut would relax and I gained some composure another sequence would start the dreadful realization that more agony was coming more lives brutalized.I found all aspects of this movie exceptional. Those interviewed I hope feel well treated by the film. I felt like there was great sensitivity and protection offered by the director. No one is blamed. There is no agenda for fences or better parenting or increased funding for mental health. The cinematography extraordinary. The soundtrack was perfect with the exception of the final song. It didn't have the weight of what preceded it. I'm not sure anything could have captured in summary what we had just seen.I did find it hard to watch. Whether I needed to see it is debatable. But I certainly won't fault the filmmakers for doing it. Will it draw more people to jump? That remains to be seen. Will it stop anyone from jumping? I don't think so.The film exposes the negligence we have towards those who want to die and how threatened we are by their state of mind. In one long anguished monologue a woman reveals what she wished she would have done the night a friend said goodbye. I hope her message doesn't get lost in the hoopla about footage of people jumping or how the camera came to be set up that year. In agony the woman states she will never ignore another person's need for help out of embarrassment for herself or embarrassment for the person making the threat. She will act to intervene the next time. And so will I.".

	schema:headline " Tastefully done mostly";
	schema:reviewBody "Several reviewers have criticized this film for its moralethical bankruptcy. They point out that if film crews were at the Golden Gate Bridge monitoring jumpers and filming them often from multiple cameras they could have done more to prevent the tragedies. If you take that approach to watching this film you will certainly be offended.But I don't believe it was the intent of the filmmakers to make any sort of moralethical statement. Rather they simply present us with an eye through which we see what happens in the world. It's no different from a National Geographic special which tracks a leopard stalking some unsuspecting gazelle and the bloody carnage that ensues. Should the camera crews be criticized for not warning the gazelle?OK enough of the ethical debate. Chances are if you're prepared to see live footage of people jumping off bridges you won't get too bent out of shape at the underlying morality or lack thereof. Let me just say that it was tastefully doneor as tastefully as you can do a subject like this.Interviews with wellspoken competent individuals added a refreshing scientific approach to this highly emotional subject. Yes family members and close friends are interviewed but unlike Fox News et al we don't get the hysterical weepy ad hominem clips. Instead we get very lucid and enlightening insights as spoken by the people who knew the victims well. Overall it presents a compelling point of view far more provoking than the usual suicide is evil and all suicidal people are losers mantra which we often hear. If you are a psychology student or if you are in some way familiar with severe depression this is a great film to watch. It documents the last hours of those who have truly gone to the extreme of mental anguish. This subject has been taboo for centuries and I'm not quite sure why. But I'm glad to see that films like this are bringing it into the open.MY ONLY CRITICISM While most jumping scenes were handled well there are a few which I found a bit tacky. This was due to the camera work being a bit too greedy. When the individual climbs onto the ledge suddenly we see the camera jockeying into position as if to get the best view of the fall. Sometimes the overzealous camera operator jumps the gun and pans down to the water far ahead of the body. This comes across as just a tad bit bloodthirsty. But hey I guess I'd get a little excited behind the lens too.But really that's a minor criticism. In contrast I have to praise the film for being professionally done even with a decent musical score not too sappy not too sterile. But really it's the objectivity and lack of obvious bias which makes it a great documentary something which Michael Moore could learn a lot from sorry someone had to say it. Also just because it's a documentary don't expect that it'll be linear and boring. The filmmakers were very adept at weaving suspense and an underlying drama which culminates with a truly stunning climax at the end. I must applaud this film on both an academic and an artistic level.".

	schema:reviewBody "Initially this documentary hit the headlines with complaints of the company that own the Golden Gate Bridge stating they were deceived that the director and his crew were filming Great American Landmarks and that they were merely filming stock footage for the project. I believe this is an acceptable lie being that if someone posed you a question asking if they could film your property because of the notoriety of the popularity of it as a suicide spot you would decline the offer! That aside this documentary does feature real deaths and in the press screening I attended in the UK they are uncensoredalbeit a large splash rather than blood splatter which is not brilliant viewing material for those of weak dispositions but does cause very interesting discussion points around the reason as to why those who choose to jump do so. We are subjected to watch a number of jumpers of various ages plunge the four seconds to their death by means of a handheld camera from a distance. As filmmakers a moral question is raised as to why they just filmed the jumpers and didn't prevent it from happening. My understanding of this is that the director did actually prevent the majority from jumping evident in the film but others were simply too quick to save. One of the witnesses interviewed from the reported 100 hours  of film stock actually comments as to why he photographed a woman about to jump before attempting to save her. He says that any nature film cameraman would carry on filming even if a tiger was running straight at them as a objectively this makes brilliant aesthetics for the finished product and b looking upon any act through a viewfinder makes any event slightly unreal and psychologically you are compelled not to anything until 'reality' slaps you in the face! Watching the documentary some of the suicides especially those shot static long distance look like they were captured 'by accident'.The witnesses interviewed in the film including some of the jumper's parents and close family are very brave to give their thoughts and opinions as to why they believe the jumpers committed the final act. As an audience we feel every emotion conveyed by their friends and family. The interviews and deaths are intertwined with montage of beautiful shots of the bridge showing it as a very romantic setting not too dissimilar to the Humber Bridge in Hessle near Hull Englandwhich is also notoriously known for it's high suicide rates but what the Humber estuary lacks is the sheer awe of the surrounding landscape and slightly better achievements of engineering. A gradual picture is built up of the bridge we see it objectively as a constant unchanging structure ruling the landscape it inhabits. We are shown the bridge by day and by night during busy summer periods during misty autumn and winter mornings as a tourist hotspot thousands of tourists walking across it people playfully mimicking jumping from the bridge or hanging from it to scare their friends visitors painting it as a working bridge workmen climbing it for maintenance and drivers going to and from work. The observation is clear and obvious again touched upon by the interviewees the jumpers like everyone else are wooed by the sheer beauty of the bridge.The only flaw in the film is that there is no expert witness i.e. a psychiatrist or doctor interviewed which would solidify the documentaries main objective at focusing on mental illness as the reason for getting to the point of giving up and as a by product tarnishing a beautiful setting.On a positive note the filmmakers do not romanticise the jumpers in any way we are merely observing how people fall all individual styles even if we are made to keep returning to one particular person Gene a little too often. Also one the key interviewees has the power to make you laugh and make you cry within an instant and it is this person who gives the strongest arguments towards the reasons for why the jumpers do it.As a whole the film does actually achieve what the director supposedly made the owners of the bridge initially believe he was making in the first placedocument an important historical American landmark as a living entity! The main focus however falls no pun intended onto the jumpers that dwell on the bridge. There is a fitting tribute to the jumpers at the end all being credited by individual name and when they jumped during 2004.This documentary is plainly and simply a year in the life of a bridge. It should be viewed by all as it is an interesting if only scratching the surface piece on the subject of mental illness. It is refreshing to view an unbiased documentary like this such as Grizzly Man in an increasingly politically motivated documentary age Inconvenient Truth etc. Maybe the reason why this is hitting the headlines is because the truth scares. If any change is to be made it is the safety barrier of the walkway although this is NOT suggested once in the film.".

Why this bridge draws lost souls is still a question to me but even more so is why we never know.

No one ever knows.This is REAL footage along with interviews and story so make sure you are well steeled before watching.".

This documentary deeply analyzes the dynamics that pushed 24 people to kill themselves in 2004 jumping from the icon Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The movie premiered today at the new Rome Film Festival and I must say I was amazed by the accurate and shocking job the director did putting a camera for one year long looking the bridge. He achieved a moving documentary that reflects the reality without being pathetic always balancing the story without being banal or simply an evil way of being voyeuristic. This movie aims to be almost anthropological in its precision and really leaves the audience asking questions they go out of the theatre thinking and this is a great achievement because the theme itself is more than a taboo. The interviews of friends and parents are beyond easy interpretations they show how sometimes life can affect human beings and change other people's life that not always is possible to find the responsibilities or to answer the questionwhy did he do that? Extremely interesting strong but really worth it.".

	schema:headline " one of the most harrowing and harrowingly intimate documentaries ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Eric Steel's littleseen documentary on suicide jumpers off of the Golden Gate Bridge is so compelling and somehow horrifically spellbinding in its connection to humanity and at the same time not exploitive of the lives lost. Steel is also not out to make some big answer to suicide which would be totally futile he also wisely doesn't include any real official types of interviewees like officers or psychologists. His method is very precise but extremely effective due to the focus there's interviews with the late subject's families and friends and the bridge itself as an entity unto itself. On the one hand there are many visually alluring shots of the golden gate bridge shot at different speeds sometimes regular sometimes at 16 or less FPS to give it that faster edge sometimes in a great fog or looking at the cars from below and in a constant long lens that peers onto everyone on the bridge just regular passerby or one contemplating the end of one's life like anything could happen next since it is in fact strikingly idyllic. I'm reminded of Herzog with much of Steels' visual prowess especially in the matter of it being something that is very absorbing in its scenic escapism but with that the connotation that there's a very great danger about it too. It's part of this that lures people in by the way with the leaps to their fates.Yet the stronger emotional impulses in the film remind me moreso of something out of a Bergman film where psychoanalysis can only go so far and the general connectedness between human beings is shown to be the most fragile thing in existence. We see the testimonies from those who were close friends parents siblings one who stopped a woman from jumping and even one who survived the long plunge to the river. They all are not similar which is a very important point that Steel has here it's not the simple concept that many people have about suicide which is that the person is a total outsider with no human contact and depressed beyond all reason. Actually the latter is a big part of it in many of the stories presented but it's never as cleancut as one would assume. There are people who are seemingly happy and then go further and further into feeling as if there is no end there are others who are needless to say clinically insane or some who as a given are looking for attention in a supremely dramatic way. And yet through all of the testimonies nothing feels forced in what they're saying and because of the natural explanations and stories told there's more insight than one might find in someone making grand statements. There's too much grief in these individuals for that and despite some declarations of religion having something to do with it what one woman says about her friend jumping about the romantic side of it is accurate it's romantic only for a moment until the jump comes which is no fun.Steel keeps coming back throughout the documentary to the story of Gene a blackclad longhaired rocker who wasn't perhaps the most hopeless case out of those presented elsewhere in the film at least at first. It's evocative of the nature of friendship and of trying to understand one another to see how Gene was seen at first as being sarcastic with his I'm gonna kill myself comments and only after things start going worse is there a sense of worry in retrospect as it is. It's also something of Steel's most controversial choice in the film controversial among those who criticized the film anyway to keep cutting back to Gene walking back and forth on the bridge like and unlike everyone else just going by during the day. So far the viewer has seen sudden plunges from people who only looked over the railing a few seconds before plummeting before someone could stop. Gene on the other hand lasts seemingly hours and Steel never intervenes or stops the filming. This might be perhaps as indicated by the interviews from his friends and his mother that he would have found a way to end his life anyway if not by the bridge. But the contemplation the staggering amount of information that we're told about Gene as the climax reaches to his plummet is what makes it such an impact because of what the bridge itself ends up representing.The Bridge is also something that ultimately could be of some very good use for people who come across it eventually on DVD or on TV. No one can ever completely understand why someone is totally on the path to the ultimate destruction in this case to nothingness via the landmark and romanticized backdrop from Vertigo and the film probably only scratches the surface as to why this or why that. But by putting real human beings up on the screen by having the audience see glimpses of the grief despair resentment and for some sense of peace about what has happened to those closest to them he makes it a testament to the lives that were lost and still are lost at such a place as the Golden Gate Bridge. It hopefully too may inspire a little extra watch by authorities on those closest to the railings peering down as if into some abstract abyss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Surely the point of any documentary of merit is to reveal the hidden or disguised truth behind it's subject. The question this film poses on false advertising is why so many suicides seek out The Golden Gate Bridge for their final demise. We certainly see the suicides. We live through the film with a succession of suicide jumpers filmed either full on or subverted from the grandeur of the bridge to what looks like a pin dropping with a quiet splash. A number of friends relatives participate in disclosing the sad usually mentally ill backgrounds of the dead. There is one young guy who is 24 featured. He survived the jump one of very very few ever to have done so. From the moment he left those famous red rails he wanted to survive he said. He managed to turn his body and enter feet first 250ft drop 5 secs 120mph he's underwater and he's thinking ' Am I still alive?' As he rose frantically to the surface and got his first breath of air he felt what he thought was a shark at his feet. 'I've survived the bridge and now I'm going to be eaten by a shark!'he remembers. There was a nervous laugh in the auditorium at that.' I later found out it was seal. It was swimming round me in small circles and only that was keeping me afloat. Noone till the day I die can tell me that was not God.' This kid is the sort of guy you just want to wrap your arms around and show him what the world has to offer. A good guy handsome smart and humorous. He is battling schizophrenia and said at the end of his interview worryingly I just want to be normal again. But I know I never will be.'There was the sad interview with the parents of a young man who never came back' sometimes I feel like doing it myself ' the father says.' I wasn't a bad mother maybe I wasn't as good as I could've been but I wasn't bad ' says the mother he loved in tears. From the start of the film to the close one guy called Gene is featured. Why? His story was hard to empathize with in that he was forever telling everyone he was going to end it. If you've ever been on the receiving end of that frankly as his friends say it gets boring after a while. But he made good footage from the opening shots tall slim clad in black leather long black hair with black sunglasses 35 yrs oldstanding looking out over the rails at the water making final phone calls pacing restively the camera actually following his feet as he walks his final steps through the rails. He looks like he craves the dramatic end then you remember he didn't know it was being filmed. Much less for his suicide to be filmed. He climbs on the rail. He sits with his back to the water. He always dragged things out we are told. The film ends with him standing bolt upright on the rail. Unlike the other jumpers who all faced out to the water he simply steps back and the camera tracks his upright unwavering fall into a watery grave all the time facing the bridge.There was silence in the dark auditorium at the end. I left looking at the intensity on some of the faces still sat in their seats and having known a few suicides myself I had a very uneasy feeling.It's kind of ruined the beauty of the bridge as I found it when I crossed it both ways by foot in '89. I kept thinking I walked right past the spot where this and that guy jumped and that over 300 men and women had jumped since. The director never broadcast his intent for fear that it would encourage jumpers and when they saw what they thought was a potential suicide they alerted the emergency services so lives were saved. But lots of people lean over the bridge sit on the rail laughing joking throwing their arms around each other it's impossible to tell what's going to happen in most cases something the film makes play on. It's not really a film I'd recommend to anyone to be honest even if the cinematography is excellent which it is. It even feels wrong saying that. Ultimatelyit doesn't answer the question it poses. It leaves bad images tarnishes good ones. The question this film poses is why suicides seek out national landmarks specifically The Golden Gate Bridge the most favoured suicide spot in the world to end their life. The families interviewed weren't told their loved ones had been captured jumping on film indeed neither were the authorities who were told it was a film on 'nature'. The lack of openness with the families smells all wrong. There is of course the final and ultimate slight which is to have filmed the suicides without their permission having set up their cameras with the expressed purpose of doing so. Like they cared having gone off a worldfamous landmark? Of course they wanted to be noticed doing it in such a public place? Maybe if the researchers had done their stuff a little more thoroughly they might have discovered why the suicides chose the bridge and what it was about. This film was a gifthorse to the filmmaker and has the deep potential to throw up disturbing images to the vulnerable.".

It's not really a film I'd recommend to anyone to be honest even if the cinematography is excellent which it is. It even feels wrong saying that. Ultimatelyit doesn't answer the question it poses. It leaves bad images tarnishes good ones. The question this film poses is why suicides seek out national landmarks specifically The Golden Gate Bridge the most favoured suicide spot in the world to end their life. The families interviewed weren't told their loved ones had been captured jumping on film indeed neither were the authorities who were told it was a film on 'nature'. The lack of openness with the families smells all wrong. There is of course the final and ultimate slight which is to have filmed the suicides without their permission having set up their cameras with the expressed purpose of doing so. Like they cared having gone off a worldfamous landmark? Of course they wanted to be noticed doing it in such a public place? Maybe if the researchers had done their stuff a little more thoroughly they might have discovered why the suicides chose the bridge and what it was about. This film was a gifthorse to the filmmaker and has the deep potential to throw up disturbing images to the vulnerable.";

	schema:headline " Interesting for many reasons but if the shocking footage was removed then there would be very little left of substance and structure";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2004 director Eric Steel set up cameras to cover the pedestrian side of the Golden Gate Bridge. During this year he capture many people walking along the bridge tourists people going to work people taking in the scenery and some people who had come to commit suicide by jumping from the bridge. His film explores the backgrounds and motivations to the people that we see jump to their deaths.There is a real question within this film and it is one that is only really touched on by one person not Steel himself I note and that is the distance provided by the camera as we observe but do not stop the deaths we see. The film doesn't let you build to facing this as the opening credits are a man hopping up onto the barrier and then jumping to his death it is here where you decide if you want to watch the rest because it is a strange experience where I at once felt dirty but also distant. I'm not suggesting Steel did nothing to prevent people he saw acting suspiciously from jumping but it is hard to have so much footage of the last guy with the long hair in particular and then follow him to the water and death.The act of looking at it through a camera is weirdly distancing and I felt wrong watching these things while sitting in my warm front room with a reasonably good life physical and mental health. This distance remained for me in the film itself as I was strangely emotionally distant from the jumpers and their families. The lack of message and structure doesn't help this and I suppose it is a danger of making the film the way he did because he was very much at the mercy of what happens as to how his film turned out. If we had had a year of spoilt rich kids then of course the musings would have been very different. This is also a strength though because the film does provide food for thought in the discussions with the families and friends I found myself thinking about the topic and this is really what you need to be doing because in terms of substance and message the film does rather sit back and let the viewers do what they want.This is a real shame because it means the most arresting images and footage are the jumpers themselves and it is hard to avoid watching but also not wanting to at the same time. I don't want to accuse of it of not backing up this footage with substance but I'm afraid that is where I am going with this. The documentary doesn't really explore the themes so much as the individuals and the film is rather repetitive. The lack of emotion drawn from me didn't help me get involved in the people and the things that made me engaged seemed to be mostly happening in my head rather than on the screen.Overall then this is certainly an interesting film but this interest comes mostly from the viewer rather than the film. The suicides are shocking but yet hypnotic and also morally challenging as you sit there as part of a paying audience watching people die from a distance of space and time. The film is nowhere near good or insightful enough to totally justify the use of this footage and while I think the footage is more than enough to grab viewers' attention it is not that great a documentary if you were to watch it with these scenes removed  and that for me says quite a lot about the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I feel having watched the film a real sense of sadness at the desperate plight of all the victims of suicide portrayed in this film. The film is very moving terribly sad and depicts brilliantly the isolation and loneliness of all the poor souls who felt compelled to take their lives by jumping from the bridge Also there is no doubt that parts of the film are very sensitively managed ie the frank and honest interviews with loved ones who lost a friend sibling the discussion with a survivor etc But the real problem I have with this film is accepting that the film makers could not have prevented many of the suicides that we see in the film. I understand that the film makers did successfully intervene and prevent the suicides of some people that year via contact with the patrol menwomen on the bridge but could they have done more? I really didn't believe I was watching real suicides when I was watching the film I kept telling myself they must be actors or staged scenarios but the very last scene where poor Gene takes his life is an image I think will always remain with me. It is so haunting to see him step back from the bridge while onlookers are caught in casual conversation.When the movie was over I was stunned and I waited for the actors credits to come up on screen when they didn't I realised the Jumps from the bridge must have been real suicides.I am somewhat disturbed that the film makers also chose to show multiple people taking their lives in the course of the film did we need to see this? Surely showing the image of a single person taking their life is shocking enough? I appreciate that the film makers wanted to approach the subject of suicide in an honest and frank manner and I can even understand even though I don't agree with it how showing a real life suicide might highlight the stark and brutal problem. But at what price? I believe that human life is sacred and I believe the interviews with the familyfriends alone in the aftermath of experiencing a suicide is enough in itself to inform us of the desperation and isolation of both those that took their own lives and those that were left behind. Why do we need to be shown the poor lost souls who in their weakest moment felt suicide was the only option? I feel it is undignified for those people to have their last desperate moments captured on film in a way where people can casually view their deaths. Will theses images really make an impact in the short or long terms or simply serve to desensitise us from what is a terrible tragedy? I just wonder if the film makers really wanted to stop the suicides of all the people in the film if they did could they not have set up direct radio contact with the patrol men monitoring the bridge? Surely after witnessing the first jump they might have considered the most effective way to intervene. Was it that without the images of suicide they felt their film lacked impact? I sincerely hope not because surely all the victims lives were worth much more than that!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think most people whether they want to admit it or not have a grim fascination with death. Part of that is because it's one thing we'll experience but never see our own death but it's also because it's become such a taboo in Western culture. The news is full of death and movies are too but when it comes to real life stories the final moment is nearly always denied us. And in the rare instance that we do see it it's usually in the abstract  a bomb blowing up a building crashing to the ground or a jet plane exploding. Even during 911 when news reports were full of images of planes going into the towers and the towers collapsing it wasn't often that we saw the jumpers. Death is more palatable when it's kept at arms length  when it's in our faces we become uncomfortable.The power of The Bridge is that it makes us look at these people. It makes us witness their final moments. We get to see what it's like when a human being takes its own life. Now whether this moment is sacred and whether it shouldn't be filmed is kind of a thorny issue. Yes people's final moments should be respected and yes it should be private but these are anything but private acts. These jumpers take their lives in full view of the public unconcerned with how their acts may affect the people who witness them. Therefore I feel less inclined to defend their right to privacy.And anyway I don't think anyone could watch this film and view it as exploitative. Yes it shows people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge the most popular suicide spot in the world and yes it doesn't shy away from showing someone's final moments but the film never views these people as curiosities. We're not asked to be titillated. Instead we get to hear their stories and through the voices of their friends and family we get to hear why they did what they did.The main thread of the film is a story concerning a guy named Gene. Intercut with the other stories we get to see him wander back on forth on the bridge and slowly we hear more about his life. Born to a single mother and heavily dependant on her she eventually dies of cancer apparently not putting up much of a fight. From the film you get the feeling that this relationship is the only thing that anchored Gene. When she's gone he's cut loose and finds himself adrift. In response he tries to find love in other places  mainly the internet. But eventually it becomes too much and he finds himself at the bridge. All through the film we see him wander back and forth. Who knows what he's thinking. But with long hair a leather jacket and a spring in his step he looks more like a rock star than a potential suicide victim. And who's to say that these final moments are his lowest. They could possibly be his best. Maybe he's being liberated from living a joyless life. And the way he leaps into the Bay by standing on the support stretching his arms out and falling backwards into the water suggests that this might be an act of ecstasy rather than despair. With this one act all of his problems are over.But it's quite remarkable what a draw the Golden Gate is. Watching the film you'd think everyone in San Francisco knows someone who leapt into the Bay. And indeed suicides happen there all the time. In the span of one year 24 people killed themselves. Why it's so popular isn't that difficult to understand. Beyond simple factors like the fact that the bridge is tall the currents are dangerous and that access is easy the bridge and the surrounding environment is also staggeringly beautiful. Therefore the bridge kind of serves as a bridge between life and death. One easy jump and you're taken into the next life if you believe that kind of thing. It looks so enticing.But to illustrate how commonplace suicides at the bridge are there are a couple of times when we see the bridge from afar and then suddenly see a small splash in the water. Someone else has ended their life. Yet the world around them keeps moving. In the grand scheme it doesn't matter much. However in the small scheme it matters a great deal. One of Gene's friends says that his death hurt him a great deal he feels betrayed. Another feels relieved. But then in another story we see a man prevent a woman from jumping. Now whether the woman will use this second chance to make something out of her life or whether her agony is just being prolonged is anyone's guess but it's nice to know that there are people out there that won't remain passive.However you could point to the filmmakers and ask why they did nothing to stop the jumpers. But then who's to know whether someone is admiring the view or if they're thinking of jumping? The film shows that in most cases the final moment is over in a flash. But regardless of whether the filmmakers did enough to stop these people The Bridge is an unflinching look at a difficult subject. It has no answers but it allows us to look at these victims as people. They're no longer faceless. And maybe that's enough for us to give a second thought to others.".

There are no revelations just of portraits of people who were loved who needed something else. The suicides are at first shocking but then just sort of become almost matter of fact. I don't mean that last statement to shock but its the territory you're in from the moment the film starts.I like the film but I don't love it. To be certain it makes you think. To be certain it makes you feel...even smile but in the end it didn't add up to very much for me.What the point of this? I don't know. Other than making a biweekly occurrence real I don't know why I was asked to watch the film. You're showing me this because? I don't think there is an answer. I know part of my problem with the film is that the intercutting of stories makes the film seem unfocused at times. More than once I was going okay which person are they talking about?. I also kept waiting for the black leather clad Gene to jump. We see him at the start but we don't see his finish until the end saved no doubt because its shocking and it just kind of draws out the moment past the breaking point it was here that I lost the notion that the film was going to tell me something I didn't already know. Its the films hesitation and stretching of the moment that keeps the film from becoming a great film. A better way of describing the film might be as an extended You Tube clip instead of a PBS documentary on the subject. Its also more than a bit mondo movie exploitive in it use of death footage Worth a look for those who can stand such a dark subject and for those who want to see a smile inducing survivor who's sudden change of heart is very real and honest its about half way in 7 out of 10".

Other than making a biweekly occurrence real I don't know why I was asked to watch the film. You're showing me this because? I don't think there is an answer. I know part of my problem with the film is that the intercutting of stories makes the film seem unfocused at times. More than once I was going okay which person are they talking about?. I also kept waiting for the black leather clad Gene to jump. We see him at the start but we don't see his finish until the end saved no doubt because its shocking and it just kind of draws out the moment past the breaking point it was here that I lost the notion that the film was going to tell me something I didn't already know. Its the films hesitation and stretching of the moment that keeps the film from becoming a great film. A better way of describing the film might be as an extended You Tube clip instead of a PBS documentary on the subject. Its also more than a bit mondo movie exploitive in it use of death footage Worth a look for those who can stand such a dark subject and for those who want to see a smile inducing survivor who's sudden change of heart is very real and honest its about half way in 7 out of 10";

	schema:headline " A movie that makes you think about the issues";
	schema:reviewBody "As someone who once received training from the Samaritans  a suicide prevention group  I was acutely interested to watch a documentary that filmed people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Shouldn't there have been some attempt at intervention? Presumably these were not people in the last stages of an unrelievable illness  the sort of folk who make headlines in 'righttodie' cases  they were people who were so depressed they just decide one day to throw themselves off the bridge.The bridge has a fair number of suicides every year and I immediately imagine students who have failed exams people whose spouses have run off or people struggling with mountains of debt.As you might expect none of the suicides which this film documents are elderly. All are physically fit. There are 24 in all  including one who survives very badly damaged as the result of the experience. Three of the bodies have never been recovered.Check out the scenery. A nice view to say the least. Even if it's not your last.But the film has quite a few surprises in store that defy expectations. And this is one film that I can honestly say I am pleased I saw it on DVD  the printed notes seem almost a straw to clutch.Firstly we have interviews with surviving relatives. The pressure on her had to be worse than the thought of doing it says the sister of one jumper. You can see where she's coming from. The bridge is a high one. Even if you're not afraid of heights. Jumping off into nothingness is hardly something you could do lightly. We start seeing the people who committed suicide as human beings not as 'crazies.' Their background. Their friends. One man who was in despair especially but not solely because of his joblessness committed suicide only for it to be revealed in the film that a managerial job offer had already been posted to him that day. What makes any of us go over that line? muses a family member.Personally I am a libertarian that supports the right to choose. If someone is terminally ill and there is no end to their suffering in sight why shouldn't they after due consideration choose to go sooner rather than later. After looking into it I have to extend that principle to include longterm unrelievable suffering of a physical or a mental kind. This places me philosophically somewhere near the government position in the Netherlands. And some of the cases of people jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge seemed potentially to be in that category  people who have struggled with mental illness for a long time and with every treatment offered unable to alleviate their distress. Yet there were not the safeguards  for what they are worth  that exist in the Netherlands. In the UK if you discuss suicidal feelings with a Samaritan they will not try to 'save' you. But they will try to give you a breathing space where you can reconsider  and many people do. A more extreme version where you could discuss the openended possibility with a nonjudgemental social worker doctor and even assistant rarely exists. In some countries not trying to stop someone committing suicide is in itself a crime. Only in the Netherlands Belgium Switzerland and Oregon can any reasoned discussion with the possibility of assistance take place.What the filmmakers do is explain how they set up a system. If someone acted in a definitely worrying manner they would make an emergency call to the services that are on constant alert. We see one case of a person being persuaded off the ledge by a passerby. But the Golden Gate is a long bridge. The filmmakers were not running up and down 24 hours 365 days they filmed for a whole year. There was not generally the actual possibility of intervening. The question that worried me more slightly was whether the act of filming was in itself an intrusion into someone's last moments.The other question  that I admit I avoid like the Dutch government  is what if someone is suicidal because they cannot get access to social services? I have met such people. Sometimes it is not that the provision isn't there but that the paperwork red tape or whatever persistently  over years  makes it inaccessible. For such people including some of the cases on this film even the Dutch have no surefire mechanism.But the Bridge doesn't moralise. It just documents.The film makes one final statistic. It is a chilling one especially if you have ever visited San Francisco. I remember the wonderful feeling of awe and exhilaration when I first glimpsed the city. Clasping the Pacific Ocean. Joined to the mainland by two of the most stunning bridges you can imagine. For me it is one of the most beautiful sights a combination of natural splendour and striking manmade accomplishment. No film can recreate that although The Bridge does hint at it. To encase the pedestrian walkway would seem a sin. It has been going on for a long time but the movie has reignited the debate about safety barriers.Because the statistic that sticks is that more people end their life at the Golden Gate Bridge than at any other place in the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "The premise of this movie is simple cameras recorded people walking on San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge for a whole year. Some of those people committed suicide by jumping off the bridge and their last moments were recorded on film. Relatives and friends of some of the jumpers were interviewed. One survivor also gives his testimony. That's The Bridge in a nutshell.Aside from the morbid fascination of watching people plummet to their deaths and the dramatic jump at the end this movie really doesn't add much to the discussion about suicide. The testimonials don't say anything that common sense wouldn't already let you know. There is no analysis whatsoever of the phenomenon and they tackle the names of the jumpers and a few rushed statistics at the end of the movie because the movie itself doesn't elucidate you about anything. It basically says that a these people had personal demons of their own and b they committed suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. I think I didn't need to watch this movie to be aware of this.If not for the lack of discussion of the subject and the MTVstyled ending this could've been a very interesting movie the premise sure is. I felt disappointed after watching it because it wasn't even that shocking considering that we all witnessed unfortunate people tumbling down on live television during the WTC attacks and it didn't seem to have a message that would reveal something new a new angle on the topic of suicide something that would make me think about it in a different light. If the point was to give faces to the anonymous people who died there it even did poorly in that respect I didn't feel like I knew that much about these people afterwards. The one thing that I did like is that for the most part the interviews were very dignified they didn't resort to turning it into a melodramatic sob fest. The suspense of the footage following different people walking back and forth and making you think will this person jump or move along? was also effective.About the controversy of the filming process I'd think that by now we would all be used to having other people's privacy exploited for profit and voyeuristic demands. It makes me wonder if the people who committed suicide would be bothered by it or if they'd approve of having their final message to the world made public for all to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I attended the Canadian premiere of The Bridge in the monthly installment of Doc Soup. I went into the theatre with no expectations no thoughts as to what I was about to witness. The only emotion in me was fear  fear of the graphic and actual images of a human taking hisher life and soul away from the world.This documentary wasn't just about the Golden Gate bridge. Nor did it glorify or dramatize suicide nor did it preach you to seek professional help which I found surprisingly. This is a documentary that allowed us in the world of the people who attempted and actually jumped off the bridge. It let us understand the heartwrenching emotions and events that lead to their devastating and tragic decision. The director didn't have to do anything melodramatic for entertainment purposes like you see on reality TV shows. It's about suicide  that's compelling and controversial as it is.The strength and courage of family members and friends were truly amazing. It was their turn to vent release their anger and guilt and let the audience into the deceased's lives. Sidenote There was a QA with director Eric Steele at the end of the premiere. He never approached them to appear on the film. When the coroner had the daunting task of contacting the family he informed them of the documentary and gave Eric's contact information if they were interested in speaking to him. Anyway their ability to speak about why their loved ones took their lives would hopefully prompt others to be more vigorous when someone they know is depressed and crying for help. Unfortunately there is only so much one can do and it's ultimately one person's decision and motivation to no longer live.There was one character Gene  the longhaired rocker dressed all in black  who stood out in my mind. Gene is pacing back and forth for a good portion of the film and you wonder what he'll do. Waiting and anticipating on his next action  not anticipating for him to jump but hoping he would walk towards the end of the bridge seek help and live happily ever after. Wishful thinking? I won't tell you what happens so you'll have to find out for yourself. Maybe happily ever after is death for some people  that's a whole other topic that I won't even touch.The only disappointing factor was the lack of message about seeking professional help if you're depressed and contemplating suicide. But overall this documentary shook me to my core. In this increasingly frightening world we live today there's no harm done by smiling more to your loved ones and strangers and asking the simple question Are you OK?. Don't take no for an answer even if you feel like it's an inconvenience to harass someone who's depressed. More harm is done by just standing there and being helpless. I rather be a Good Samaritan and help those in need than sit down and shut up going to bed at night knowing I did nothing.".

	schema:headline " Tasteless and Insensitive Tripe";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bridge is a 2006 documentary film by Eric Steel that purports to tell the stories of a handful of individuals who committed suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2004. The film was inspired by an article entitled 'Jumpers' which was written by Tad Friend and appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 2003. The documentary caused significant controversy when Eric Steel revealed that he had tricked the Golden Gate Bridge committee into allowing him to film the bridge for months during which he captured 23 of 24 known suicides which took place there. In his permit application to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Steel said he intended 'to capture the powerful spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge'.Do not be fooled by the vacuous comments that have opened this film. This film is not about 'suicide' nor is it about 'painting a threedimensional portrait of each jumpers last moments' don't make me laugh see Gus van Sant's Last Days for a more evocative depiction of this. It is rather another hollow 'documentary' that has caused significant controversy with its apparent profiting from suicide.Using stopmotion photography with multiple cameras pointed at a notorious suicide spot on the bridge an American Beauty soundscore and some disillusioned Goth rocker's swansong as a wraparound intended to increase suspense excuse the pun this vapid attempt at filmmaking has nothing whatsoever to do with 'objectivity' as one commenter stated nor with the grimy reality that lies at the core of these somewhat final actions.As to 'lucid and enlightening insights' delivered by 'wellspoken and competent individuals' according to reviews on IMDb what we have in effect are carefully prepared scripts that convey a lack of authenticity. One also gets the feeling that some of the interviewees relatives of the deceased are too distracted by the camera and the thought of being in a film to concern themselves too deeply with the rather sensitive point in question.

	onyx:emotionText "The Bridge is a 2006 documentary film by Eric Steel that purports to tell the stories of a handful of individuals who committed suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2004. The film was inspired by an article entitled 'Jumpers' which was written by Tad Friend and appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 2003. The documentary caused significant controversy when Eric Steel revealed that he had tricked the Golden Gate Bridge committee into allowing him to film the bridge for months during which he captured 23 of 24 known suicides which took place there. In his permit application to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Steel said he intended 'to capture the powerful spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge'.Do not be fooled by the vacuous comments that have opened this film. This film is not about 'suicide' nor is it about 'painting a threedimensional portrait of each jumpers last moments' don't make me laugh see Gus van Sant's Last Days for a more evocative depiction of this. It is rather another hollow 'documentary' that has caused significant controversy with its apparent profiting from suicide.Using stopmotion photography with multiple cameras pointed at a notorious suicide spot on the bridge an American Beauty soundscore and some disillusioned Goth rocker's swansong as a wraparound intended to increase suspense excuse the pun this vapid attempt at filmmaking has nothing whatsoever to do with 'objectivity' as one commenter stated nor with the grimy reality that lies at the core of these somewhat final actions.As to 'lucid and enlightening insights' delivered by 'wellspoken and competent individuals' according to reviews on IMDb what we have in effect are carefully prepared scripts that convey a lack of authenticity. One also gets the feeling that some of the interviewees relatives of the deceased are too distracted by the camera and the thought of being in a film to concern themselves too deeply with the rather sensitive point in question. The tragedy with this 'documentary' was not in 'not helping these people from jumping' as some people have argued but in profiting from it in such a shallow and insensitive manner. Admittedly the director thought it might prove an excellent springboard with the delicate subject matter into the world of film and as he was quoted saying a career in movies.'Documentaries' like this are unbalanced tainted forget the 'objectivity' of our lead commenter  suicide has nothing to do with being objective nor for that matter with stopmotion photography or kitschy slushy discopop and cosmeticized to such a degree look no further than the poster that it loses any real value of the barebone realities of suicide before the opening credits have even appeared.

	schema:headline " Eerie Look at Suicide Jumpers Remains Oddly Unaffecting and Repetitive";
	schema:reviewBody "Even at a fleet 94 minutes this infamous 2006 documentary feels overlong and rather padded despite the visceral shock of witnessing a man throwing himself off the Golden Gate Bridge. This wideangle longdistance shot opens Eric Steel's oddly uninvolving study of the twentyfour people who decided to use the fatalistic landmark to end their lives in 2004. Twentythree succeeded and Steel's multiple camera setup captured most of them. In his eerie film he focuses on a handful of the victims and lets the grieving families speak about them. Apparently they were unaware that the filmmaker had the footage in his possession a deliberate decision in that Steel did not want to encourage any further suicide attempts due to the film. At the same time there is something undeniably exploitative about his approach.Although the images on the bridge are startling with a sense of foreboding that I personally found unbearable the interviews with the friends and relatives are not all that engaging probably because their comments start to feel repetitive no matter whom the victim is. In attempting to capture the human spirit in crisis especially with the presence of Alex Heffes' Dear Frankie melancholic music to underscore the shots Steel maintains a perspective that feels too myopic since the testimonies in themselves cannot give the full story behind the motivations of the socalled jumpers. Consequently there is no palpable sense of intimacy with the victims. Moreover Steel consciously avoids contextual discussions with city officials or psychiatric professionals. They could have lent a broader perspective on the issue especially when it comes to the constant debate over installing suicide barriers.The one exception is Kevin Hines a young man with bipolar disorder who was the only survivor in 2004. Only he is able to describe what it was like to have jumped off the bridge. He survived because he decided to shift feetfirst when he regretted his decision in midjump. The most disheartening aspect of Hines' account is how he gave obvious signs of his hopelessness to indifferent passersby for forty minutes only to be accosted by a German tourist to take a picture. The 2007 DVD offers a makingof featurette which provides Steel's perspective on the film a valuable extra since he is absent in the documentary itself. He and his crew are interviewed to elaborate on their experiences in filming the suicide attempts. There is also a PSA featuring Hines for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.".

I give it crap because it's fairly bythebook but it's not awful. When I first saw this film I was a fan of Danson from Cheers and Goldberg from her onewoman show and guest spots on Star Trek The Next Generation. I remember being pleasantly surprised by both. Danson is an accomplished actor best in Pontiac Moon and stretches his comedic skills here. Goldberg on the other hand is best here in dramatic moments. She is warm and vibrant with splashes of real brilliance but it's not enough. It's not that she can't do the comedy at all she is an incredible comedian the script just doesn't give her enough to do besides be shrill and clumsy with a smattering of nice. Her few scenes with Danson are worth the time spent watching and make up for their tabloid headlines at the time. As for Smith's performance this early role wasn't much different than most. Every minute on screen he is a joy still in his Fresh Prince mode here he certainly doesn't disappoint. Nia Long is the real find here. If one person from this film should have been given a better shake than anyone it is her. She is vibrant funny and worthy of the people she shares the screen with. That says a lot.".

I particularly like Tilly's character a new age airhead and her new boyfriend played by Fred Mancuso who between them make stupidity lovable. Everyone gets a fair chance and they all make the best of it. Formulaic as it is Made in America is about racial identity which is a difficult subject to address in such a frivolous form as romantic comedy but it manages to more or less avoid cringes and concentrates on the laughs only giving as much time to story as is necessary to keep everything moving on. Against the odds and thanks to the superb cast this is a good natured film. It harks back to the optimism of the early nineties and seems strangely innocent eleven years on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made in America is a formulaic romantic comedy with a pretty noble premise.  That premise is obviously a setup for racial not racist gags but it never becomes a onejoke comedy.  Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg are great leads.  They light up the screen with their sometimes sexual tension.  Goldberg is one of my favorite actresses and she's wonderful in this role.  It's hilarious to watch her spontaneous outbursts.  Nobody does 'em like Whoopi.  There are no real surprises in the plot.  Danson is a conceited selfindulgent used car salesman.  He's married to a floozy wife Jennifer Tilly.  Whoopi is a single parent who owns an AfricanAmerican antique shop.  Her daughter finds out that her real father whose sperm was artificially inseminated turns out to be Danson that white used car salesman who does those crazy ads on TV.  It's pretty obvious what the punchlines will be and it's pretty obvious how this sometimes schmaltzy story will end up.  However it's lightweight entertainment that isn't meant to be thoroughly analyzed.  Just enjoy it for its many laughs and endearing performances. It's an innocuous feelgood comedy.  Even when it takes a dramatic turn at the third act I didn't feel the mood was ruined.  I guess it's because I felt a respect for all these likeable characters and was somewhat manipulated.  Just how I felt the humor in the first and second acts I felt the sadness in the third.  My score  7 out of 10".

However it's lightweight entertainment that isn't meant to be thoroughly analyzed.  Just enjoy it for its many laughs and endearing performances. It's an innocuous feelgood comedy.  Even when it takes a dramatic turn at the third act I didn't feel the mood was ruined.  I guess it's because I felt a respect for all these likeable characters and was somewhat manipulated.  Just how I felt the humor in the first and second acts I felt the sadness in the third.  My score  7 out of 10";

Long's mother Whoopi Goldberg is really upset with the data but actually begins to fall for Danson to Long's dismay as she wants Danson to be the father she has never had. The movie goes for comedy for the most part but then turns dramatically in the final act and this makes the film uneven in many important respects.

It stars Whoopi Goldberg Ted Danson Nia Long Will Smith and Jennifer Tilly.When doing a biology project at school Zora Long notices that her blood group is different from her mothers Sarah Goldberg. Having never known her father Zora learns that she was the product of artificial insemination. Quickly setting off to find out who her father is it comes as a big shock when it turns out he's tall white car salesman Hal Jackson Danson a surprise since Zora and Sarah are black! Not the most powerful of set ups it has to be said but in spite of the lowly rating afforded it by many critics and film lovers it's a sweet and honest affair. Film pins its hopes on the central comedy premise of a white man somehow fathering a black daughter from a black mother. From there it follows a familiar course from the shock and horror born out by the reveal to opposites at war and on to maybe opposites attracting? This of course only works if the viewer has a soft spot for Danson and Goldberg in the first place but with them giving it complete gusto and being a real off screen couple as well their play off of each other is very easy to warm too. Sure it's contrived and very treacle based once we land in the final quarter but the mixing of races aspect has been well handled by the makers and there's some decent comedy moments. It may not be laugh out loud funny unless you be the type of person who finds Danson astride a runaway elephant funny? But it has its moments and director Richard Benjamin is also enough of a pro to not let the pace sag. Good support comes from Long and Smith while Tilly is wonderfully memorable as the fitness freak bimbo girlfriend of Danson.Slight but never less than charming it's safely recommended to fans of the two principal stars. 610".

Whoopi chews the scenery all through it. But the lack of decentscript is 100 responsible. Avoid. 4 out of 10.".

How did he sink to trite and formulaic? This coulda been a really interesting movie as the premise is intriguing  an adult seeking her sperm donor father.BUT instead we have this simplistic plot with very few laughs.Only good point is a whiteblack romance without any eyebrow raising or racism made in 1993 and we still 2008 haven't had many of those in theatres. Whoopi chews the scenery all through it. But the lack of decentscript is 100 responsible. Avoid. 4 out of 10.";

I'm surprised Danson's not still trying to milk this movie by mentioning it in episodes of his blockbuster sitcom Becker. This movie should include Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenburg and should entitle Three men my mistake at the sperm bank and whoopee Goldberg. Despite her lack of eyebrows Goldberg's performance was more than remember able and will continue to inspire me in my own personal dreams of becoming Made in America. SincerelyJohn Fck".

From popular movies like Jumping Jack Flash Ghost and Sister Act to under rated little movies like Clara's Heart and Homer and Eddie. She was always a joy. Her teaming up Ted Danson gave me hope for some laughs as I loved him in Cheers and still watch re runs of it today. As for Will Smith although I knew his TV show The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air I did not watch it!! For his second movie he again took a supporting role and truthfully he is the best thing in it. I hated this movie in 1993 didn't even watch it all when I rented it and I would have turned it off after forty mins today if I didn't have a hunch about the ending which I told my girlfriend and I simply wanted to see if I was right. I was.I didn't like it as I don't find any form of racial prejudice funny and that is not just the big joke here. It's the whole concept of the movie. America obviously got the joke that I clearly don't as the movie was a sizeable hit grossing 44 million on a budget of 22 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 31st highest grossing movie of the year.".

There is one funny part in this film and that is when Will Smith tells Whoopi there is a white man at the door.  But we already saw that in the commercials so there is nothing really to look forward to.  This is really inexcusable garbage.  I don't even know what 34 of this film is about.  This is a film about a sperm bank mix up.  In it you have a stereotypical dumb blond an elephant chasing a bike a bear a monkey a monstrous sounding nurse and too many more ridiculous situations that don't add anything to the film.  Whoopi Goldberg started off doing silly but funny comedies now she either does bad films or films that are too self important.  She is still one hell of a funny lady but what she saw in this film besides a paycheck is an enigma wrapped inside of a riddle embedded in a mystery.  The only good thing to come out of this is Nia Long got introduced to Will Smith and she later appeared on his television show.  She is a great young actress and I am glad that she has broken into Hollywood.  But the rest of the film is just plain terrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found two early Lino Brocka films on Netflix Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang 1974 and Insiang 1976. Both belong to the short list of Brocka's finest works from the 1970's to the early 1980's.Insiang starring Hilda Koronel Mona Lisa and Ruel Vernal has the reputation of the first Filipino film to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival 1978. It is without reservation my favorite Brocka film. Shot in the slums of Tondo through neorealist lenses its domestic melodrama at the same time aspires to Greek tragedy. It is Brocka's tightest most well composed film the character's fates play out inevitably from the opening slaughterhouse scene to the catastrophic last act. As usual Brocka brings levity to the nastiness of poverty with cinema verit details as when Tonya very publicly throws out a clan of inlaws living in her shanty. She demands the clothes she had given the children to be handed back their mother outraged strips off the garments from the bewildered kids right there on the streets. This for me is the 'punctum' of the film as Barthes would say. There is another at the end when Insiang visits Tonya in prison she confesses to her mother that she deliberately provoked her jealousy in order to get back at Dado Insiang rushes to embrace her and there for a split second Tonya's expression yields to motherly tenderness before quickly turning once again into that of the jealous rival.Brocka's films are are always marked by strong acting not just from the stars but also from the rest of the cast there is a feeling of an ensemble effort which is not unexpected since Brocka brings with him the crew of the Philippine Educational Theater Association PETA Kalinangan Ensemble. I saw Insiang for the first time on the big screen when a print restored by the French government was played in a Makati theater. Mona Lisa silverhaired graced the screening.This review also appears in stickslip.wordpress.com as Two Early Brocka Films 'Insiang' and 'Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang'".

Vernal doing the lover bit because Lisa holds the household money has his eyes set on Insiang. He rapes her but Insiang turns things around getting Vernal to be her parasitic paramour.

Hilda Koronel who plays Insiang is enough like a Loren or a Lollobrigida to make you think of Fifties or Sixties Italian cinema and the visual style is conventionally of an early period but this brutal story lacks the humanity and warmth of the Italians. Tonia drives a family of inlaws out of her shack which is in with other families in this barrio there is no privacy and all is known because she can't feed them but her ulterior motive is to bring in Dado a handsome macho man and a gambling nogood probably young enough to be her son as her lover. Insiang has several young men interested in her but the one she chooses is too cowardly and lazy to run away with her as she would like. Soon Dado puts the make on Insiang. It turns out badly for just about everyone in this miserablist drama which has been compared to Fassbinder and Sirk. It's been commented that the story undercuts the two major values in Filipino film  motherhood and the sanctity of the family. Brocka certainly keeps things lively as do popular dramatic films from other Third World countries and telenovelas. Yes this holds the attention but unfortunately the print used for the NYFF 2006 showing was an uglylooking digital transfer that made all the boys look pimply and the shots look shoddy. Only Koronel's face shines through.".

Von Stroheim once again plays an overly obsessed man in a range of quiet meekness in one moment and tyrannical rage in another.  His character of a lonely frustrated man filled with nothing but hate at the loss of losing the girl he loved to another man is frightening and sympathetic at the same time.  This film is very creaky has little action and almost no musical background yet Von Stroheim's performance carries the film on his shoulders and delivers the goods.  Some great scenes in the film show Von Stroheim's range as an actor from his thumping of a pencil for an half hour and finally snapping it to his corpse beside manner where he tells his captured prey his wicked diabolical intentions.  Dr. Crespi somehow makes his hated enemy appear dead but in reality leaves him alive only to be buried alive.  The glee in Dr. Crespi's face glows and really turns what could have been a horrible film into a quite enjoyable one.  Add to the fun the presence of Dwight Fryewho has a scene digging up a grave and you have a wonderful horror picture from the heyday of horror.  Above all this film shows us just how good this man was at acting and it shows us the loss we have that he was not utilized more.".

Stroheim's best scene is where he gloats above his paralyzed victim but the scene is choppy and the edits are so jarring that it's simply a tribute to the actor that the scene works at all.The funeral scene however is very well done. The intercutting between the funeral and the restrained Frye attempting to kick his way to freedom is very good and continually reminds the viewer of the fate of the poor man in the coffin. The subjective camera angle as the dirt hits it was probably pretty strong stuff in 1935.If your a fan of horror movies especially 1930's films this one should be on your list to view.".

Indeed I had acquired it on account of the star presence of the great Erich von Stroheim tellingly his baptism of fire within the fantasy genre came soon after his distinguished but infuriating directorial career ground to a definite halt! but watching the opening credits was pleased to find Dwight Frye was in it too. For the record Stroheim's three other horror roles were in the superior THE LADY AND THE MONSTER 1944 and the upcoming THE MASK OF DIIJON 1946 and the Germanmade ALRAUNE 1952. Now back to the film proper which is undeniably interesting in its borrowings not merely Poe incidentally his middle name is lazily spelled Allen in the titles just as the star's own loses the 'h'! but in Frye's incompetent and graverobbing assistant FRANKENSTEIN 1931 and while the morgue scenes and modern setting are redolent of MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM 1933 the allimportant funeral scene  in which the occupant of the coffin is aware of what goes on but is unable to do anything about it  obviously owes a lot to Carl Theodor Dreyer's VAMPYR 1931. However I must say that I was disappointed by the slackness of the script Stroheim whose aristocratic mannerisms  especially his propensity for smoking and in imitable fashion drinking  are in full sway here not only puts to a deathresembling sleep his amorous rival and former protg in full view of the contended party but writes down the allimportant time of 'demise' in advance on the certificate so that when he signs it Frye proves an unwitting witness. But then he also inexplicably fails to get rid of him after amusingly spending much of their scenes together lambasting the junior doctor for something or otherthus effectively precipitating his own comeuppance  though not before being visited by the ghastly and which he initially takes to be ghostly! victim of his wiles. Being mostly set inside a hospital with medical staff in white walking about in appropriately antiseptic surroundings the detail sometimes gets lost in the fuzzy copy I watched! As for comic relief an obligatory balancing ingredient in most films of its ilk certainly at this point in time we get an excited Italian one Joe Verdi!? speaking in broken English  another clich  whose inordinatelydelayed expectancy of parenthood eventually rewards? him with quintuplets.".

Being mostly set inside a hospital with medical staff in white walking about in appropriately antiseptic surroundings the detail sometimes gets lost in the fuzzy copy I watched! As for comic relief an obligatory balancing ingredient in most films of its ilk certainly at this point in time we get an excited Italian one Joe Verdi!? speaking in broken English  another clich  whose inordinatelydelayed expectancy of parenthood eventually rewards? him with quintuplets.";

Today there are many names for the type of mental illness he has but really it all comes down to pure undeniable madness.

In love with Harriett Russell who chose to marry a close medical colleague of his John Bohn he goes completely bonkers when Russell begs him to operate on her husband. To say that the operation fails is an understatement it doesn't go awry it goes eerie. Von Stroheim's assistant Dwight Frye realizes something is wrong and makes the mistake of confronting him. The story is gripping but full of plot holes. But I just dare you to take your eyes off of von Stroheim. He goes between being calm cool and collected to totally hammy and in his big speech reminds me slightly of that British star of mayhem and murder Tod Slaughter.

Cabeza acting as the treasurer for Captain Narvaez's expedition is shipwrecked off the Florida coast and picked on by natives. The historical details of his journey and gruelling subsequent life under capture are skewed though the movie does not make attempts at historical realism it goes for the primitive and spiritual. Or this is how it would be if the soldiers on the raft got rid of Aguirre and drifted further downstream to wash up in Herzog's Cobra Verde and become slaves to a shaman and his armless midget helper.The world we're shown is at once horrible and wonderful and director Etchevveria photographs it as both. For big swathes of time the movie is without dialogue and we're crouching on the dirt as the natives perform elaborate rituals that mean nothing to us. The words are lost in the translation but the ceremonial aspect remains. Bodies covered in mud painted blue and ghastly white adorned with feathered headpieces witch doctors making voices and calling out to something Cabeza de Vaca both movie and protagonist observes it all with a halfmad stare and twitching hands.When the survivors of the expedition reach Spanish hands again one of them exalts the audience with tales of golden cities in the north and shaman potions that give the drinker the sexual prowess of 20 mules. Coronado traveled as far north to New Mexico to discover the 7 Cities of Gold probably on one such impossible tale recounted around the fire by drunken conquistadors desperate to believe. The will to empire is not only the pursuit of the mad and the hopeless the ambitious and the greedy but also in itself the result of myth and poetic fabrication a selffulfilling prophecy that becomes true by the simple fact it has been pursued. The biggest flaw in the movie is the protagonist. Every time Juan Diego opens his mouth or gesticulates the results are cringeworthy. Manic ferocity came natural to Kinski because he was manic Diego on the other hand chews scenery like he's playing this for the theater. When he's lost in his own thoughts and acts mad the results are significantly better.A filthy gaunt figure dressed in rags is climbing on ragged redrock terrain walls of rock rising on all sides he can barely traces his steps but there's nowhere to trace them to he's a strange man lost in a strange violent world that makes no sense  the movie is his anguished cry in the wilderness echoed all around him like the wilderness is crying back at him. The final image is an ecstatic metaphor like something Herzog would have improvised and it's a stunning way to close the film.".

	schema:headline " Interesting but not historical";
	schema:reviewBody "Cabeza de Vaca may be viewed as a surrealistic rumination on the nature of early contact between Europeans and North American Indians but it has very little to do with the actual narrative of events as presented to Charles V by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in his 1542 report.Viewers who may wonder about the rapid transition from Florida to the Southwest in the movie should realize that the opening scene depicting the separation of the rafts of Captain Narvaez and Cabeza de Vaca took place off the coast of Louisiana WEST of the Mississippi more than a year after their first landfall in Florida despite the meager information provided in the opening credits.  Cabeza de Vaca is also presented as Treasurer to the King of Spain when in fact he was merely treasurer of that particular expedition.And although the long sequence early in the movie showing Cabeza de Vaca's period of slavery to the Indian sorcerer and the armless dwarf is quite interesting to see there is no corresponding incident in the explorer's writings.  C de V did report on a brief period of enslavement but that is all.  No sorcerer no dwarf.Similarly the bond created between C de V and the young Indian who he cures by removing an arrowhead is not in the original narrative but rather a conflation of several different episodes from the journey.The key scenes of capture and nearmurder by the bluepainted Indians are wholly the creation of the screenwriter.The movie has an inconsistent approach to nudity.  Most of the Indian tribes encountered by C de V went entirely naked during the warm season but are almost always shown with at least some kind of loincloth.  However during the blue Indian sequence and later when the survivors are taken in by friendly Indians for a while full nudity is present among the females and even fullfrontal on the part of an Indian girl who offers herself to one of C de V's men.  Meant to be tittilating?  I don't know.  It wasn't.  In C de V's report he notes a number of times that he and his Spanish companions were for a long period naked as the day we were born but there is no male nudity whatsoever in the film.So what is accurate?  The suffering endured for sure and the apparent success of the Spaniards in curing Indians through the power of God.  The arrival in Mexico toward the end and the capture of the Indians there as slaves.  That's about it.Nevertheless the film holds the attention throughout and the final scene of Indians bearing the enormous silver cross through the desert is quite arresting.6 out of 10 for me.".

	schema:headline " Powerful meditation about Mexico's birth";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a really interesting 1991 Mexican drama concerning the eightyear long journey 1528  1536 of Alvar Nez Cabeza de Vaca who was shipwrecked in Florida and enslaved by Indians but who found a career as an itinerant Indian shaman and eventually after an endless journey through swamp and desert ultimately found his way back to Spanish civilization. Cabeza de Vaca's few traveling companions most notably the Moor Estebanico helped fuel rumors of the Seven Cities of Cbola which led directly to the 1540 Coronado expedition and the first Spanish encounters with the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca's story is one the greatest personal survival tales in world history and it made him one of the very very few people who could fully appreciate the tragedy of Spain's conquest of the peoples of the Americas. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles but there is actually little Spanish at all since Cabeza de Vaca is often alone or isolated with no one to speak to. He is just as lost as the audience in a world of Indian dialects.The director Nicols Echevarra greatly simplified even oversimplified Cabeza de Vaca's journey. The movie suggests the shipwreck was in Florida but that was actually the journey's first bloody stopping point. The final shipwreck occurred somewhere west of the Mississippi Delta and Cabeza de Vaca's enslavement likely occurred somewhere near Galveston Texas. Why leave that part out? Well it's complicated and ultimately for director Nicols Echevarra may have been unimportant. Echevarra had something else in mind. The important part was that Cabeza de Vaca was thrown into a hallucinatory world of abasement and privation. Cabeza de Vaca carried a Christian cross and his initial captors decided he should be sent to a shaman who also wore a cross and be put to work tending the needs of a spoiled armless gnome. What a horrible existence! The hallucinatory quality is reminiscent of the magical realism pioneered by author Gabriel Garca Mrquez and subsequently used by directors like Mel Gibson in Apocalypto. Cabeza de Vaca's real existence may have been as a turtleegg collector on the Texas beach but instead the movie shows him apprenticing the shaman craft with his captors. Cabeza de Vaca's visionladen emergence as a successful healer is the movie's best moment.The transition from swamp to desert is very abrupt indicating that Echevarra wasn't much bothered by notions of continuity. Indeed he had only two Mexican filming locations the desert in Coahuila and the swamp in Nayarit. As far as I could tell the Indians were less like the real Indians of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast and more like the Indians of Mexico. Then I remembered my history of Mexico Mexico by Michael D. Coe third edition p. 146 Into this uneasy political situation stepped the last barbaric tribe to arrive in the Valley of Mexico the Aztecs the 'people whose face nobody knows'. They said that they came from a place called 'Aztlan' in the west of Mexico believed by some authorities to be the state of Nayarit and had wandered about guided by the image of their tribal god Huitzilopochtli 'Hummingbirdonthe left' who was borne on the shoulders of four priests. .... We next see the Aztecs following a handtomouth existence in the marshes of the great lake or 'Lake of the Moon'. On they wandered loved by none until they reached some swampy unoccupied islands covered by rushes near the western shore it was claimed that there the tribal prophecy to build a city where an eagle was sitting on a cactus holding a snake in its mouth was fulfilled.The director suggests discreetly by his choice of filming location in the Nayarit swamps through simplification and also perhaps by conflation of the Texas Indians with Aztecs and by using a dash of magical realism that Cabeza de Vaca's real story is about the tragedy of Mexico's conquest by Spain. And Cabeza de Vaca's story is about that partly at any rate. The film is a meditation about Mexico's tortured birth as a Spanish colony. A powerful film and wellworth watching!".

It's not even supposed to be Florida.The makers of this film and the makers of this film's packaging have their facts wrong but their scenery right.  Cabeza de Vaca landed in Texas probably at the site of today's Galveston.  That explains the slowmoving brown water streams and the thick vegetation and mosquitoes.

The real Cabeza de Vaca left Florida on a flimsy raft  depicted in the film  hoping to make it to Cuba.  Instead he landed on the Texas gulf coast.  I don't know why the filmmakers labeled the landscape as Florida.This film is odd.  It is exceptionally slow paced.  There is little intelligible dialogue lots of grunts or dialogue in indigenous languages but no subtitles.  We are as lost as Cabeza de Vaca. This film is from his point of view and no explanation for his healing powers is offered.

I had learned that this was a true story but I didn't know anything about what it may be about or who the major players were. What I did discover was that this film was somewhat factually wrong. I hated to read that because this was a very powerful film. This was one of the only films that I have ever watched that used less known words and more violence to carry the message. Perhaps violence isn't the best word but this film was filled with violent images countered with images of faith and healing. Apparently when Vaca returned to Spain he wrote some letters to the King describing what he had seen during the eight years on the uncharted land. This was the basis for this film but according to most this film left out too much and took rights to other parts of Vaca's adventure. For example although the long sequence early in the movie showing Cabeza de Vaca's period of slavery to the Indian sorcerer and the armless dwarf is quite interesting to see there is no corresponding incident in the explorer's writings. Vaca did report on a brief period of enslavement but that is all. No sorcerer no dwarf ...damn.... This film is a transitional movie. At first we are to feel sorry for Vaca and what is happening to him. Watching the dwarf and sorcerer make fun of him and force him to do painful duties. We are made to feel sympathetic for this man that seemingly is loosing strength and mental power daily. Then we hit the big moment. When Vaca becomes the healer and befriends the Indian we feel less sympathetic and for me more confused. Did Vaca want to leave this place? Near the end the answer becomes even more shaded. I would think that someone that feels so strongly about a community that he has spent eight years of his life with would do more than just go back and hope that his new 'family' is not captured. Vaca in this film took the cheap route. The final scene is a very gripping moment in our history. Vaca is forced to help bring Christianity to this natives. To demolish their world and form of religion and bring in Western civilization. Vaca sees this and cries but then STILL does nothing. He apparently has the power to bring people to life but destroy a church is well out of his grasp. The last scene is of enslaved Indians carrying a Christian cross across the desert. This represent the beginning of the end of most of the Indian's beliefs that have been them for thousands of years. The beginning of the corruption and the force to bring certain beliefs to everyone. Very sad ending. Overall a decent film that still carries a strong message even today. While the cinematography seems choppy at times it is worth the wait to witness the human destruction near the end. I suggest this to anyone that needs a moment to see the path of 'our' people.Grade  out of ".

	schema:headline " To know what it means to have nothing you must have nothing.";
	schema:reviewBody "This dramatization of the true story of an odyssey that was as amazing in some respects as Homer's account of the voyage of Ulysses. The film puts the European invasion of the continent into more appropriate perspective revealing the veil of lies about slavery and genocide that are common in histories of events in this place during this time. Although this film is politically compromised it should be promoted to at least open the door on reality for those who don't know what this story is about.Unfortunately the result of this compromise is that most products of U.S. public education and other provincial audiences who generally don't know the story of Alvar Nuez Cabeza de Vaca and what he had to say will miss the significance his report to the Spanish monarchy but it may inspire those who do see the film to examine Nuez' account of his journey in relation to the vast ignorance greed and stupidity of the Spanish monarchy and the hierarchy of the Catholic church to whom he addressed his comments when he wrote what turns out to be the only accurate portrait of indigenous people of this continent in which he showed the conquered victims of the invasion.Missed in this film is the greatest irony of ironies that the church responded to Cabeza de Vaca's report to Isabella and Ferdinand  Co. by creditng the myth of the fountain of youth to reinterpret Cabeza de Vaca's statement about personal transformation and the humanity of the indigenous people. De Vaca's revelations exposed the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic pretense that Christian idealism and not individual and collective greed motivated the conquest the brutality the slavery the genocide. Ponce de Leon was sent out ostensibly to find the fountain of youth while in the process robbing enslaving and killing indigenous people. Cabeza de Vaca died in poverty and is unknown to most students of the period.A movie uses visual and aural spectacle music and narrative to hypnotize viewers to tell a story which means evoking experience and emotions associated with events places and people. With movies language custom commerce politics and the attention span of viewers limit possibilities. From the perspective of indigenous North American people this film is too compromised but it's a step in the right direction which explains comparisons to Dances With Wolves. After films are made we may examine the ways films fail and we see why and this is valuable. In this film the failure was not in execution but in the vision of the script.

	onyx:emotionText "This dramatization of the true story of an odyssey that was as amazing in some respects as Homer's account of the voyage of Ulysses. The film puts the European invasion of the continent into more appropriate perspective revealing the veil of lies about slavery and genocide that are common in histories of events in this place during this time. Although this film is politically compromised it should be promoted to at least open the door on reality for those who don't know what this story is about.Unfortunately the result of this compromise is that most products of U.S. public education and other provincial audiences who generally don't know the story of Alvar Nuez Cabeza de Vaca and what he had to say will miss the significance his report to the Spanish monarchy but it may inspire those who do see the film to examine Nuez' account of his journey in relation to the vast ignorance greed and stupidity of the Spanish monarchy and the hierarchy of the Catholic church to whom he addressed his comments when he wrote what turns out to be the only accurate portrait of indigenous people of this continent in which he showed the conquered victims of the invasion.Missed in this film is the greatest irony of ironies that the church responded to Cabeza de Vaca's report to Isabella and Ferdinand  Co. by creditng the myth of the fountain of youth to reinterpret Cabeza de Vaca's statement about personal transformation and the humanity of the indigenous people. De Vaca's revelations exposed the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic pretense that Christian idealism and not individual and collective greed motivated the conquest the brutality the slavery the genocide. Ponce de Leon was sent out ostensibly to find the fountain of youth while in the process robbing enslaving and killing indigenous people. Cabeza de Vaca died in poverty and is unknown to most students of the period.A movie uses visual and aural spectacle music and narrative to hypnotize viewers to tell a story which means evoking experience and emotions associated with events places and people. With movies language custom commerce politics and the attention span of viewers limit possibilities. From the perspective of indigenous North American people this film is too compromised but it's a step in the right direction which explains comparisons to Dances With Wolves. After films are made we may examine the ways films fail and we see why and this is valuable. In this film the failure was not in execution but in the vision of the script. It conveys something important but does it leave out the part that makes it really relevant to our lives and contemporary practices that mirror the attitude of Isabella and the Vatican in the 16th century? Perhaps it is better for a review to say nothing about this to avoid prejudicing viewers but the box office shows the opposite. It doesn't matter what we write in our reviews.

I personally would love to see the Americas North and South before the full arrival of Europeans. Not because Europeans were bad but simply to see something before it's changed dramatically. Unfortunately for many of the early explorers and visitors  English and Spanish  a trip to the New World didn't give a feeling of wonder but of life in hell.  I'm also aware of the fact that most extant written history of exploration of the New World was written by English authors so it's probably bad Spanish explorers good English explorers. But apparently not for this particular story.As for this film I can only recommend its first hour which is its best.The first hour of this film does an excellent job of showing the problems these early explorers faced and how something so promising could turn so bad. Once Alvar Nez Cabeza de Vaca a copy and paste on that name! leaves Florida it loses its sense of adventure and mystery well a good part of it and the film moves too quickly from Florida to the western shore of Mexico. So quickly you'd think Florida had mountains or terrain that looks like Colorado. The lead character also spends the rest of the time walking about like he fried his brain on drugs. For me I'm more interested in and want to see and know about the journey and the people on the way.I would love to talk to these early explorers or see what they saw and I admire them for their courage and sense of adventure and if they still exist somewhere how funny it all must seem to them now. Just wait 400 years and you've got an area with beaches people flock to and Disney World. Does one man's hell eventually becomes another man's vacation spot ?!?!This film's first hour does surpass all of Aguirre The Wrath of God 1972  but loses something when it turns into a Conquistador Apocalypse Now 1979.If anyone out there knows of any other good films about early exploration of the New World then email me.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German Prisoner Of War POW camp Stalag Luft III during the Second World War. This is the same POW camp that was the scene for the Great Escape which resulted in the murder of 50 recaptured officers by the Gestapo and later was made into a very successful movie of the same name. While the other POWs in Stalag Luft III are busy working on their three massive tunnels known as Tom Dick  Harry two enterprising British prisoners came up with the idea to build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the compound wire fence shortening the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to freedom. The idea to build their version of the Trojan Horse came to them while they were discussing 'classic' attempts for escape and observing some POWs playing leapfrog in the compound.Initially containing one and later with two POWs hidden inside the wooden horse could be carried out into the compound and placed in almost the same position near the fence on a daily basis. While volunteer POWS vaulted over the horse the escapees were busy inside the horse digging a tunnel from under the vaulting horse while positioned near the wire under the wire and into the woods. The story also details the dangers that two of the three escaping POWs faced while traveling through Germany and occupied Europe after they emerged from the tunnel. All three POWs who tried to escape actually hit home runs escaped successfully to their home base.. The Wooden Horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a POW breakout. The movie was shot on the actual locations along the route the two POWs traveled in their escape. Made with far less a budget than The Great Escape The Wooden Horse is more realistic if not more exciting than The Great Escape and never fails to keep you from the edge of your seat rooting for the POWs to make good their escape. The story line is crisp and the acting rings true and is taut enough to keep the tension up all the way through the movie. The Wooden Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees Eric Williams and is by far the best POW escape story ever made into a movie. Some of the actual POWs were used in the movie to reprise their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III. I give this movie a well deserved ten.".

Australian release through UniversalInternational 8 June 1951. 9225 feet. 102 minutes. SYNOPSIS A meticulously accurate transcription of a thrilling and highly ingenious escape from a German POW camp telling of the sweat and toil spent to enable three R.A.F. men to reach Britain in safety.NOTES Number four at the British boxoffice for 1950 following The Blue Lamp The Happiest Days of Your Life and Annie Get Your Gun. Number seven at the Australian boxoffice for 1951 following Samson and Delilah Show Boat Harvey The Happiest Days of Your Life A Place in the Sun and The Great Caruso. Number four in the Daily Mail's annual poll of 1379849 British picturegoers following Odette The Blue Lamp and Morning Departure. Winner of a Picturegoer Seal of Merit.COMMENT Comparisons with the later Stalag 17 and The Great Escape are now inevitable. This POW camp is very clean and tidy  with sheets on the beds yet  which gives it quite a different atmosphere to the grimy Hollywood Stalag 17. Nonetheless within its different confines The Wooden Horse is equally realistic. As might be expected with Eric Williams himself penning the screenplay this film emerges as a very faithful transcription of the novel. Even the opening narration by Leo Genn is lifted direct from the book. The events are true. They are here restaged with scrupulous accuracy which extends not only to the naturalistic acting and totally unobtrusive direction but to the meticulously realistic sets and costumes. There is of course no female interest. This is both a plus  in that it contributes to condensing the plot and making it more immediate  and a minus  in that it lessens the movie's overall appeal. Genn Steel Tomlinson and the others like Anthony Dawson Bill Travers and Peter Finch in a small role as a hospital patient play very smoothly but one can't help hankering for some real star power. Aside from the scenes in the tunnel where the cramped and confined nature of the excavation is very effectively conveyed I suppose by shooting through glass into a tank the direction as said remains uninteresting and routine. Like the acting it's smoothly capable but lacks vigor. It says much for the slackness of Lee's directorial rein that the film's most exciting and suspenseful episodes take place outside the POW camp where extensive location shooting in Denmark and Germany widen its impact. Here also the photographer really comes into his own his charismatic skill making seemingly light work of difficult location assignments such as the night scenes at the dock. My only disappointment with the location sequences is that the action outside the camp does not follow Tomlinson's adventures. A bit of crosscutting between the escapees would have brought more force to the climax. In fact The Wooden Horse is too soberly realistic in writing direction and playing for its own good. It's not exciting enough. But that's just my opinion. The movie achieved an enormous public and critical success.".

This POW camp is very clean and tidy  with sheets on the beds yet  which gives it quite a different atmosphere to the grimy Hollywood Stalag 17. Nonetheless within its different confines The Wooden Horse is equally realistic. As might be expected with Eric Williams himself penning the screenplay this film emerges as a very faithful transcription of the novel. Even the opening narration by Leo Genn is lifted direct from the book. The events are true. They are here restaged with scrupulous accuracy which extends not only to the naturalistic acting and totally unobtrusive direction but to the meticulously realistic sets and costumes. There is of course no female interest. This is both a plus  in that it contributes to condensing the plot and making it more immediate  and a minus  in that it lessens the movie's overall appeal. Genn Steel Tomlinson and the others like Anthony Dawson Bill Travers and Peter Finch in a small role as a hospital patient play very smoothly but one can't help hankering for some real star power. Aside from the scenes in the tunnel where the cramped and confined nature of the excavation is very effectively conveyed I suppose by shooting through glass into a tank the direction as said remains uninteresting and routine. Like the acting it's smoothly capable but lacks vigor. It says much for the slackness of Lee's directorial rein that the film's most exciting and suspenseful episodes take place outside the POW camp where extensive location shooting in Denmark and Germany widen its impact. Here also the photographer really comes into his own his charismatic skill making seemingly light work of difficult location assignments such as the night scenes at the dock. My only disappointment with the location sequences is that the action outside the camp does not follow Tomlinson's adventures. A bit of crosscutting between the escapees would have brought more force to the climax. In fact The Wooden Horse is too soberly realistic in writing direction and playing for its own good. It's not exciting enough. But that's just my opinion. The movie achieved an enormous public and critical success.";

	schema:reviewBody "Peter John and Phil played by Leo Genn Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson respectively are POWs with a plan to escape  make a vaulting horse that can carry a man inside and while the other chaps are busy jumping have that man work on a tunnel and when done cover up the hole and get carried back in the horseall right under the German's noses. This approach takes far less time but is much more dangerous as even a small cavein could instantly bring the 'goons' down on the heroes. After months of of digging vaulting and planning the three men escape. But now comes the really tricky part  getting out of Germany to a neutral country. Peter and John travel together with John doing all the talking because Peter can't speak German or French. Several times it looks like they've had it as German police inspect their hotel a French contact seems to rather do them more harm than good and a mysterious man follows them through the streets. So yes they may have escaped from the POW camp but can they escape from Germany? The story is told in true British fashion  nononsense crisp dialogue and cuttingedge tension throughout the film. Not one moment in this film can be described as boring and every scene flows. Some other reviewers have said that its 'shelflife has expired' but for anyone who appreciates a good story script and acting over senseless compilations of scenes scripts that are thrown together simply to make money and more explosions and car chases than actual dialogue and acting this movie is a gem. It really captures pardon the pun the spirit of a British POW  determined calm in every situation and bloody clever. Leo Genn as Peter delivers an impeccable sincere performance which he deserves much credit for. Genn was in my opinion one of Britian's best actors and his talents are more than evident here. His line delivery would make any speech teacher jealous and his movements and reactions are always followed through. He steals the show from the beginning and never lets go. An excellent performance from one of the greats. Anthony Steel as John also gives a good performance. Younger than Genn's Peter Steel is the one who comes up with the wooden horse idea and is constantly pushing to get out. He's the young bull who says 'lets dash down!' while Peter is the old bull who says 'lets stroll down'. He and Genn have great chemistry and their friendship seems quite genuine. Steel is believable eager and great to watch. David Tomlinson as Phil though not given much screen time still manages to put in a solid performance. He is funny and charming just like later on in 'Mary Poppins'. Not the brightest chap in the camp or the bravest but he shows his teethe when needed. A delight to watch and you can't help but love the guy. In summary this is a marvelous film of a true story. All involved clearly put their heart into this production. The acting is superb the script excellent and the art of suspense is mastered to a T. It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end and you'll also have a few good laughs in the process. They don't make them like this anymore which is a real shame. The Wooden Horse will be a favorite of mine for the rest of my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE WOODEN HORSE is part of a cycle of British films produced during the Fifties in which various struggles during the Second World War were replayed as a way of reminding audiences to feel proud of their country's achievements at a time when Britain's position in the world was becoming less and less influential. The British Empire was crumbling rationing was still in place and while Britain still had a seat at the United Nations table they had very little power to influence world affairs. In Jack Lee's film the ingenuity of British POWs is celebrated they not only have the ability to create something out of nothing but they always seem able to outwit their German captors whom they term Goons. The characters are penetratingly delineated with Leo Genn's phlegmatic Pete leading the group of three escapees contrasted with Anthony Steel's more emotional John Clinton. Nonetheless they make an effective pair especially when they have to negotiate some difficult situations in the German town of Lubeck. David Tomlinson normally associated with comic roles as in THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS has a rare chance to essay a straight role this he accomplishes with aplomb as a cheery officer with a unique capacity to make the best of difficult situations. What makes Lee's film most memorable is the fact that it was filmed on location using German and Danish civilians in supporting roles they speak both their native languages as well as English. This gives the film a sense of gritty realism as well as reminding us about just how dangerous the escape plan using the wooden horse actually was. Tonally speaking THE WOODEN HORSE is very matteroffact director Lee is at pains to show that the entire escape was not about heroes but was actually the British POW's bounden duty. This gives the film a documentary realism that ensures it stands up well today over sixty years since it was originally released.".

It's quite simple it's too long a dig from the prisoner barracks to outside the camp for a tunnel. So the horse is placed over a midway point and diggers are smuggled in and out. It also serves as a place where fresh air can come into the men working in the tunnel. It's quite an ingenious scheme and Leo Genn Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson are the three that escape. The rest of the film plays a lot like The Great Escape as the three escaped prisoners try to make it to the neutral country of Sweden.Though The Wooden Horse doesn't have the budget that The Great Escape did it tells its story in a fast moving and compact fashion with no frills. Location shooting in Denmark and Germany make it quite authentic. The British occupation zone was in the northern part of the new Federal Republic of Germany and many extras were hired among the locals.

On the whole it fits into the often splendid genre of postwar British films.The POWs are more bored than abused. The sleeping quarters each house about four men. They sleep on comfortable bunks and wear pajamas. There's even a piano somewhere playing Mozart. In the hospital there are Beethoven records. But driven by a desire to spend money find a girl and get a good meal they begin to build a tunnel out of the camp.The hut nearest the wire is too far away to use as a base so the men construct a wooden horse to use on the fields outside that is a vaulting platform with a padded top the sort of thing many of us had to cope with in high school gym class. Each day when the men are not busy peeling potatoes one of them will be hidden inside the hollow boxlike structure and work on the tunnel disguising the entrance with dirtcovered sandbags. During the practice runs most of the POWs leap the horse easily but one continues to lose his nerve at the last minute and smash belly first into the structure. He's demoted to cheerleader.The German guards are not the raving maniacs of the war years. Most are reasonable and as in real life a bit old for combat and worn out. This doesn't stop one of the Unteroffiziers from examining the vaulting horse in private and after looking around to make sure no one is watching he leaps across the top lengthwise outdoing all the Brits and grins with silent pride.The work proceeds and there are moments of tension as there must be in any movie about men crawling fifty feet through a tiny tunnel of dirt. No power on earth could get me to do it.As it turns out two men Leo Genn and Anthony Steele escape to the forest thence to Lbeck an ancient and distinctive northern city that gave us Gnther Grass and Thomas Mann. Some location shooting was obviously done around the city's landmarks. The pace picks up. Narrow escapes up alleys and over fences. Evil forces are closing in on them but they finally make their way to a Danish freighter where they are welcomed aboard. Danish freighters can be fun. I accompanied two linguists aboard a freighter this size in Nova Scotia. The object was to see how the pronunciation of a sentence in French would be altered by a Danish accent. Selon notre dernier rapport la besoin est trs bon. I don't know about the business but the festivities were gay and we staggered off loaded on Akvavit. I just threw that in for lagniappe. Copenhagen of course was occupied by the Germans in World War II and conditions remained dicey for the pair. The first violent scene takes place in the boatyard of a nearby fishing village when Genn kills a German guard an act that leaves him chagrined.The escape are close but Genn and Steele finally make it to Sweden which unlike neighboring Norway remained neutral for reasons having to do with the transport of raw materials. Safe at last in the arms of the British embassy.The opening scenes the tunnels and so forth have now become familiar fare in these escape movies but the twists and turns of their escape through Germany and Denmark are engaging enough. I admire the photography too and the treatment of the enemy who are rendered as human instead of as cartoon figures.".

This was the same POW camp where the Great Escape took place as well and which also got turned into a more famous film.The connection with the more grander film is important as you watch this film you see the prisoners trying to obtain permission from the escape committee with their plans which also occurs in The Great Escape as well.In this film two British prisoners of war decide not to have the usual tunnel escape but build a wooden vaulting horse which could be placed near the wire fence thus reducing the distance they would have to tunnel from this starting point to escape.The first half of the movie is more exciting as they carry out their daring plan with one or two prisoners hiding inside the vault and then digging the tunnel.The second half of the film is once they have escaped they try to get to the safety of Sweden. Here David Tomlinson who plays one of the escapees disappears from the film as we concentrate on Leo Gen and Anthony Steel. This part of the film feels dull long and oddly lacks tension especially compared to The Great Escape which made this part more thrilling.I always had childhood memories of The Wooden Horse and the escape part. Its nice to be reacquainted with the film again. There are some nice unstated performances an early appearance by future Oscar winner Peter Finch and parts for some British film stalwarts such as Bryan Forbes.Its just a shame that the latter part of the film lets it down.".

Before that however there had been a more smallscale escape of three men in tunnels built with the assistance of a vaulting horse. This wellmade movie tells the story of that overshadowed 1943 adventure which involved a small number of British and Commonwealth officers going to extraordinary lengths to deceive their guards and the three escapees making their way through Germany to freedom.Made just seven years after the event and only five years after the end of the war this British movie has an immediacy accuracy and realism that seem remarkable now. We now see the Nazis as murderous monsters but in this movie the officers sing Deutschland is kaput in the showers to taunt their guards. The culture of that period the camaraderie and the sense of quiet determination shine through in the film probably because many of the actors were of that generation and had served themselves. Almost all of them went on to have long acting careers.This was a stalwart generation that had committed to total war. Afterwards a flood of movies still continuing today has sought to process this cataclysm. This is an early example of that genre. The feeling is still not that we were heroes but that we survived and we did amazing things.

	schema:reviewBody "I was really excited when in late 2011 George Sluizer announced that he was going to try to finish 'Dark Blood' some years after Sluizer had an aneurysm and learned that his remaining time was limited. I've heard of the difficulties surrounding the film the legal complications and so on. So when it was announced that Mr Sluizer was going to raise money in order to be able to pay for the finishing of the film the postproduction sound editing editing musical score etc. through Crowdfunding I almost instantly donated some money through the CineCrowd website. In gratitude I received a very rare limited edition DVD and some positive lit negatives inside the DVDbox. I was a bit surprised by the high quality of the footage since it has not been used for 19 years or so. I know about the difficulties off set between River Phoenix and Judy Davis and between Davis and the director. But it definitely doesn't show in the actual film. The acting is quite natural and in my opinion the performances by River Judy and Jonathan Pryce are pretty good. As I said before the images are very clear and the added sound effects and musical score are also in place here. The music at some points reminded me a bit of Pieter Bourke ans Lisa Gerrard's score for 'The Insider'. I'm not going to spoil anything or tell how it ends but for me it was a rare chance to finally see this interesting project and also River Phoenix' last film.".

	schema:headline " Incomplete but the hints of greatness are there...";
	schema:reviewBody "George Sluizer's salvaged 1993 desert thriller Dark Blood is an uneasy but captivating watch. More than anything its a tantalising final glimpse into the talent of star River Phoenix surly one of the most promising actors the world has ever seen. Rivers tragic and sudden death in the winter of 93 halted production and left the film missing many of its most crucial and inmate scenes. To overcome this director Sluizer can be heard reading the script amongst a mixture of stills and short clips. This method whilst effective is quite jarring and ultimately strange mainly due to Sluizers heavily accented matter of fact voice which clash with the very intimate words and actions he is trying to get across. However we do get long periods where the film plays uninterrupted its in these moments we get a sense of what a great movie this may have been. At times a classic Hollywood thriller and others a disturbing art house flick.Pryce and Judy Davis are pretty much note perfect as the bickering Hollywood couple. Pryce plays his character so well I would not be surprised if the role was written with him in mind.Its no secret that Judy Davis was a very difficult actress to work with not only for the director but also the actors. River in particular was targeted with many friends reporting he would call them in tears due to her hostile treatment towards him. Such was his misery that he personally asked Sluizer to delay the most intimate scenes between them till the last days of shooting they were never completed. It is to both actors immense credit that this difficult working relationship never comes across on screen the scenes between them burn with desire and feeling.Its impossible to talk about this film without really talking about River even as you are watching the film the tragedy that was to come is always there playing on your mind. At only 23 River Phoenix was an Oscar nominated actor of incredible talent grace and beauty. With the character of Boy he was able to display a side of him we had never seen before. He is terrifying disturbing and dangerous but even in the throes of this madness that trademark sensitivity of Rivers shines through. He was a very special and incredibly gifted actor and this film like all his prior performances have done before it bear tribute to that.".

Shot about eighty percent of the way in 1993 but put in an abandonment because of the death of its lead actor River Phoenix at age twentythree Dark Blood managed to be edited reworked and released at several film festivals in 2012 marking an end in the saga to one of the curious wonders of cinema. In 1999 the film was almost burned by the insurance company who was sick of storing it in a vault without a plan for years on end and would've been gone for good had Sluizer not taken action and stolen the film back in a period of fortyeight hours.River Phoenix died as a result of mixed drugs entering his system at Johnny Depp's club The Viper Room in 1993 closing the book on a young ambitious life so early and abruptly after doing a handful of acclaimed picture. Watching Dark Blood in 2014 when Phoenix has sadly escaped the minds of many one could see that the talent he possessed and the emotions he managed to convey were natural and believable. It's too bad that even with Dark Blood managing to get some sort of release it will still be desperately short of attracting an audience it deserves.The film focuses on an older couple named Harry Jonathan Pryce and Buffy Judy Davis who are traveling through the desert on a second honeymoon hoping to pick up the pieces to their crumbling marriage. When their car breaks down in the middle of the desert they meet a young widower who calls himself Boy River Phoenix who lives on his own with his loyal mutt following his wife's death from radiation. The radiation was caused by nuclear tests conducted close in proximity to Boy's ramshackle home in the middle of the desert. Now the only thing he anticipates is the apocalypse and the occasional passersby.Initially Boy seems gentle and grateful for the company but Harry discovers long before Buffy does that he wants some sort of a romantic relationship with his wife. Boy longs for female companionship due to the loneliness and isolation that exists in the desert and throughout the film we see Boy's anger and hostility escalate which eventually leads to him kidnapping Harry and Buffy and keeping them in his confines.Being that only about fourfifths of the film is complete director George Sluizer tacks on narration during the scenes that were never completed some of which being very significant chunks of the film describing the scene and reciting the dialog. Even before the film is a minutelong narration about how after Phoenix died it left everyone shellshocked to the point where no one really wanted to complete the film without his participation. Sluizer states that upon become very ill he wanted to edit and compile the clips of the film into something before it was too late.Being that Sluizer managed to complete a project that many felt would never see the light of day and that he has done such a great job on many different aspects it seems harsh to critique it any way. Saying the film is fragmentary and sometimes a bit choppy is a pretty demeaning and stupid point of criticism seeing there was little Sluizer could do to prevent that in postproduction. Rather than nitpicking elements that probably unsatisfied Sluizer in addition let's focus on what the film really excels at which is giving its lead actor a sendoff and bearing some great scenes of tension and excitement.Consider the scene where Harry manages to momentarily break free from Boy's clutches or when both head for the hills in their pickup truck. Scenes like this are given unexpected leverage thanks not only do the performances but Sluizer's editing work which still works to give old footage fresh vibes of suspense. Had Sluizer not taken the film seriously in terms of continuity and story all seriousness and respect for the project would've dwindled to nothing but thanks to the competent work orchestrated Dark Blood manages to easily win more than just cinephiles over.Starring River Phoenix Jonathan Pryce and Judy Davis. Directed by George Sluizer.".

You can notice that Jonathan Pryce's hair is less gray than it really is today. Also you got in the movie the strong and mesmerizing presence of the late River Phoenix coming in a time capsule directly to the future to give us his mesmerizing swan song. Wow... freakin' wow!Great acting a script that shines and beautiful backgrounds are the main attractions here. The story is told in the form of a road movie and the characters all goes through changes in their lives. The most powerful thing in the movie is its heart and soul. This is the engine that moves the narrative. As for it's body it's unfortunately broken for the lack of a better comparison. As the director George Sluizer states before the movie starts this movie will always be like a three feet chair. It's slightly unbalanced it misses something but with care still stands on it's feet. With River Phoenix's death before the shooting process finishes the director summarizes the missing fragments of the movie to us in order to complete the narrative. It works fine that way. In spirit in heart and soul this movie deserves a straight 1010. With its broken unfinished body it takes a 810. If only they could finish it in time... but that from now on until the end of times will only belong to our imagination trying to figure out what it could have been. For what it is it perfectly stands on it's feet. Must watch! Once again thanks to the 37 Festival International de Cinema de So Paulo in my city by the SESC institution of culture and development I could enjoy another amazing flick!".

	schema:reviewBody "A tragic ending to a brilliant career That's the first thing you probably heard when you hear the name River Phoenix. Dark Blood is a film as most of you know and have heard by now the last film River Phoenix was filming at the time of his death.Dark Blood is a rare gem you will not see too many films made like this in this day and age. The great George Sluizer has done a fabulous job in finishing a film that to most people never looked like it was going to get finished Utah was a great place to shoot this film the scenery is one of a kind thanks very much to the wonderful Edward Lachman who has captured the essence of the Utah desert. It's a bit hard to give the film Dark Blood a specific genre because of the rewrites and the reediting of the story. It has slightly made it a different film because of those touch ups.If you did not know much about the circumstances behind Dark Blood and you saw the film for the first time you could very well think it was a complete picture. The only scenes missing are about half a dozen interior scenes after watching the film back and paying close attention to the directors narration of the missing scenes besides 1 or 2 of the interior scenes that are missing that really have some real importance to the film more so than the other interior scenes the film seems to flow by quite fine. All the major scenes looked to have being filmed here but like i mentioned maybe 1 or 2 of the interior scenes that play a real importance to the films story line are incomplete or missing. But the great George Sluizer really makes sure you have a very clear understanding of the films missing scenes which are might i add are scattered throughout the film.Is this River Phoenix's best role? probably not but it is definitely in River's top 5 films there are glimpses in this film of greatness and what could have being and what the film community is surely going to miss out on. River has such unique charisma and a lot of maturity for a young 23 year old in a role that could have being played different in so many ways. Jonathan Pryce Harry and Judy Davis Buffy both fantastic actors in their own right just show how good they are and both bring plenty of experience and great energy to their roles.I give the film Dark Blood 810. The film has a running time of 86 minutes. Which is pretty much the length of a normal movie these days. Also Karen Black plays a great little cameo at the start of the film which needs to be applauded also.On a final note if your a fan of River Phoenix or the director George Suizer or a fan of any of the cast and crew of the film Dark Blood i strongly recommend you look out for festival appearances that Dark Blood maybe showing at it has played at 3 major film festivals so far and with many more to come.Thankyou for Reading my Review i hoped you enjoyed it and i look forward to reading some feedback.THOMAS PURCELL".

	schema:reviewBody "Doesn't it get lonely? Harry asks Boy looking out over the wide barren desert. Everywhere is lonely. America is full of loud mouths always shouting and trying to get themselves heard Boy replies.I had mixed feelings after watching Dark Blood. Finally being able to see it after all these years it was almost as if if was just one of those films I never got around to seeing. I was only 13 at the time of River Phoenix's death which greatly affected me. I was always intrigued as to when or even if Phoenix's final film would ever see the light of day. The film was nearly finished shooting at the time of his death. So when I heard that director George Sluizer was going to finish the film I was excited but also a bit hesitant.The film opens with Boy River Phoenix and his dog howling at the moon. We are then introduced to Buffy and Harry Judy Davis and Jonathan Pryce a troubled married couple from Hollywood who are travelling through the Utah desert. Their car breaks down not once but twice. The second time it breaks down they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. When night comes after seeing a light in the distance Buffy goes looking for help and stumbles upon Boy's shack. We find out that he is living in an area that was once a nuclear testing site. Besides his shack he has also created a secret mystical cave full of survival items and the 'magical' Kachina dolls he makes.Buffy's attraction to Boy is obvious from the start. She is intrigued by and attracted to him meanwhile Harry is becoming more and more annoyed with the situation as time goes by. When the time comes for Buffy and Harry to leave Boy won't let them. I won't give anything else away but it is quietly captivating and tense.Of course the big question is what happens when you are missing pieces of the puzzle so to speak? The scenes that were never to be filmed are now just still shots except for maybe one or two with a voiceover narration by the director. It is done nicely but I feel it would've been more effective to have moving footage of the desert instead. With these few key scenes missing most notably between Buffy and Boy it does slightly take away from the overall feel of the film. Still what George Sluizer has done is impressive and ultimately special.The acting from the three leads is excellent. River Phoenix is superb. He plays Boy with a fine balance between complicated and strange. You don't know what he is going to do next. Judy Davis is terrific as the laid back and trusting Buffy. Jonathan Pryce is wonderful as the wary and uptight Harry. The chemistry between Davis and Pryce is lovely. The tension between Harry and Boy is fascinating as seen when Boy leaves Harry alone in the middle of a canyon.The cinematography by Edward Lachman is simply gorgeous. The desolate landscape is both stunning and eerie. A fitting backdrop for the heated relationships and circumstances. The hypnotic score by Florencia Di Concilio is beautiful.It won't be a film for everyone but if you're a fan of Sluizer's work or any of the cast then I hope you get the chance to see it. River Phoenix was in a class of his own. He had such a strong screen presence it was a pleasure to finally see his final film. I want to commend George Sluizer for finishing the film.".

America is full of loud mouths always shouting and trying to get themselves heard Boy replies.I had mixed feelings after watching Dark Blood. Finally being able to see it after all these years it was almost as if if was just one of those films I never got around to seeing. I was only 13 at the time of River Phoenix's death which greatly affected me. I was always intrigued as to when or even if Phoenix's final film would ever see the light of day. The film was nearly finished shooting at the time of his death. So when I heard that director George Sluizer was going to finish the film I was excited but also a bit hesitant.The film opens with Boy River Phoenix and his dog howling at the moon. We are then introduced to Buffy and Harry Judy Davis and Jonathan Pryce a troubled married couple from Hollywood who are travelling through the Utah desert. Their car breaks down not once but twice. The second time it breaks down they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. When night comes after seeing a light in the distance Buffy goes looking for help and stumbles upon Boy's shack.

All scenes that haven't been shot are read as a voiceover by director George Sluizer over paused images. While that creates a distinct kind of movie experience it doesn't seem to be something I'm very fond of. Of course Dark Blood is a film that's all about Phoenix. Just like James Dean in 1955 Phoenix generated a cult following because of his untimely death. Mostly remembered for his roles in Stand by Me Running on Empty Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and My Own Private Idaho Phoenix never really had the chance to become the actor he could've been. That doesn't mean everything he did was pure genius though... In Dark Blood I'm just not feeling the Phoenixvibe. Above all it's quite a dull movie. Only recommended for those who want to see Phoenix shine one last time.".

Only at most 13 days left for the last film takes but then River Phoenix died sadly due to a mix of drugs at an age of just 23. Then the legal tug of war started for almost 20 years. In the mean time the Dutch director George Sluizer became after those twenty years almost eighty years and now suffering from his illness.The legal war was about to end in an apocalypse of destruction. Where the insurance company ordered to destroy the raw film material that was laying for almost 20 years in a safe. All the creative work and acting would be gone forever but.. When the ill director heard on a Tuesday afternoon that they would destroy the material on the very next Friday he ordered to save and rescue the material for mankind. Knowing that all the legal path ways were gone he ordered with the sense of urgency a burglar to get the material from the save! And that was the start of the editing of this wonderful road movie that otherwise was burned and therefore stolen from mankind. Isn't this true story worth to make a movie about? That the 13 days of shooting where missing didn't affect the end result. As a matter of fact it adds value to this one of a kind movie. The end result  The Movie It was a real pleasure to see the calm but intense images. You could feel the heat in more then one way. The colors of the material the acting the desolate Monument Valley atmosphere the inescapable situation the desire of River Phoenix as Boy all contributed to the thrilling heat.The epilogue of the making My question to the director was if the legal dossier could be closed now. In other words Can we all enjoy now this movie? Unfortunately NO. Not at this moment because there is still an issue about who owns the rights on the negatives.. Can you imagine?I hope as soon as possible you all can enjoy this inescapable road movie.. in more then one way.Screen Maven ".

The story line or let say the idea of it is very slimier to the 1990 film Misery Starring both Kathy Bates  James Caan but unfortunately Dark Blood failed to reach half of Misery due to many reasons First and the main reason was the movie was never completed because the scenes are just 80 of the film which destroyed a lot of aspects although the Director read some notes that weren't shot in order to understand many things but this was not enough. the second reason was there was no chemistry between Phoenix and Davis especially from Miss Davis side not to mention that she doesn't have the qualities to attract a young man in other words she was miscast for this role. As for both River Phoenix and Jonathan Pryce they really delivered one of there most powerful roles till date. MR. Phoenix gave us a brilliant performance as a villain. and he really developed himself very hard to present this part. he didn't care about his looks at all he made himself really look like a half Indian half American and the death scene was very powerful i think if it was completed back then he arguably will be nominated at least to Golden Globe. At the end if you are one of River Phoenix Fans i highly recommend you to watch his last great performance but don't expect to watch a great movie. it's a fine one with a very good performances.".

Von Stroheim's Greed Welles' Magnificent Ambersons Huston's Red Badge of Courage and Peckinpah's Major Dundee spring immediately to mind. I'm not sure that George Sluizer belongs among that exalted company  though his original version of The Vanishing is definitely a masterpiece of some kind  but Dark Blood is similar to those other films in that its beauty and emotional power still shine through despite its being compromised by external factors. In this case instead of facing studio interference Dark Blood was struck by the death of one its three principles River Phoenix. According to Sluizer who attended its U.S. premiere at the Miami Film Festival all location shooting had been completed and roughly 7075 of the script had been filmed. Nevertheless as Sluizer puts it in his opening narration Dark Blood remains a threelegged chair able to stand upright on its own but obviously incomplete. I don't want to give too much of the plot away. As anyone who has experienced the original Vanishing knows the less you know about a Sluizer film going in the better off you are. However it is clear that Phoenix's sudden death left gaping holes in the narrative. Sluizer has attempted to fill these holes with voiceover narration and it works surprisingly well. As Sluizer put it in the QA following the screening however there is still a slight imbalance in the relationships among the three leads. In my opinion this imbalance is most notable in the relationship between Boy Phoenix and Buffy Judy Davis. Crucially Buffy and by extension the audience is meant to be simultaneously unsettled and attracted by Boy's strangeness. Unfortunately several key scenes between these two characters were left incomplete so Boy's vulnerability does not come through as clearly as it should. To my mind he doesn't always come across as sympathetically as he should.The three lead performances are all very strong and I found the ending particularly powerful. Sluizer wisely avoids making the ending either pat or pointlessly ironic it emerges logically from what comes before. Of course it's possible that some the ending's power comes by way of hindsight. Like the other compromised films I mentioned above Dark Blood is practically impossible to evaluate purely on its own terms. Viewers will probably always be aware of its complicated and tragic history. Still the film rests on the three main characters and their interactions with one another and at this level Dark Blood is always tense and human. That's why the ending pays off so much for me.So by all means seek this film out if you get the chance. Its recent completion by Sluizer was obviously a labor of love. Dark Blood probably won't replace The Vanishing in anyone's mind as the most important part of Sluizer's legacy but it's a worthy addition to his filmography  as well as to River Phoenix's. I just hope that whatever is preventing this film from being more widely released can be resolved. Dark Blood deserves to be seen.".

Phoenix did a great job playing Boy a young widower living in the desert on a nuclear testing site. The guy rescues a Hollywood couple whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Little did the couple knew that Boy wasn't as willing to help them as he sounded. The movie set was so beautiful and surreal it was the perfect background for the conflict between the characters. I also found that the desert scenes painted the inner landscape of Boy's whose traumas were still eating at him. His inner world was reflected in the outside environment he built for himself in his actions and his awkward thinking. I cried in the end because everything felt so real and believable. This movie can be watched by anyone who appreciates art and all the hard work that is put into bringing it on the screen.".

Phoenix did a great job playing Boy a young widower living in the desert on a nuclear testing site. The guy rescues a Hollywood couple whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Little did the couple knew that Boy wasn't as willing to help them as he sounded. The movie set was so beautiful and surreal it was the perfect background for the conflict between the characters. I also found that the desert scenes painted the inner landscape of Boy's whose traumas were still eating at him. His inner world was reflected in the outside environment he built for himself in his actions and his awkward thinking. I cried in the end because everything felt so real and believable. This movie can be watched by anyone who appreciates art and all the hard work that is put into bringing it on the screen.";

River's role as Boy is a conflicted one where the character is caught between the right and wrong aspects of actions taken when in a crisis situation. His role evolves throughout the film starting with a curious and concerned citizen turning into a one sided and obsessed futuristic reformed resident. There is a mystical element to this character in the fact that he does believe in the things unseen and has courage in the face of hardship. In his portrayal of the character he exudes a guided hand approach where he never ventures into instilling too much fear towards others but rather a controlled sense of command almost foolish in some ways yet wise in other ways.".

Like the infamous Congo it makes the grave mistake of killing off the multitalented Bruce Campbell in the first five minutes and also does the same thing to TiffaniAmber Thiessen despite the fact that all the ads for the movie had mislead one into believing that she has a sizable role in it. The fact that their death scene has absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline doesn't help much either but amazingly FDTD 2 eventually makes up for these miscalculations and becomes a surprisingly fun directtovideo quickie. Whatever flaws it possesses are redeemed by the enthusiasm of the cast and the filmmakers who probably realized that they were making an inconsequential film but seemed to have had a ball doing so nonetheless. It's directed by Scott Spiegel who cowrote Evil Dead 2 and has been a longtime associate of Sam Raimi's and he gets help on the script from Duane Whitaker who has a major role in the film and is probably best known for playing the bizarre pawn shop owner Maynard in Pulp Fiction. The two of them may not have the same polish as a Quentin TarantinoRobert Rodriguez combination but they both have an obvious love for the genre and at the occasional moment in the film some fresh new ideas to add to it.The original From Dusk Till Dawn was one of the most enjoyable genre efforts of the 90s which unfortunately received a lot of criticism from nonhorror fans who thought that Tarantino's screenplay started off as a potentially interesting drama that sold out midway through opting instead to become a overthetop gorefest in the second half. Of course most genre aficionados found those horror elements so entertaining that they didn't care at all about the detour in Tarantino's script. Of course FDTD 2 doesn't near measure up to its predecessor but if there's one thing that it does to improve upon it it's that it doesn't even try to pretend that it has the potential to be anything else and just presents itself as a good ol' horror outing mixed in with a fairly standard heist story. It also helps however that the characters are more sharply written and the dialogue is more witty than you'd expect for a flick of this kind. The fine Bmovie cast somehow makes you care in spite of yourself and by the time the movie reached its climactic bloodbath at the bank I was surprised by how much I was into the film. But when all is said and done what really matters is if the horror elements deliver and Spiegel does just that providing some very inventive death scenes and some showoff Raimiesque camera work including a neat pointofview shot of a key going into a keyhole. Sure the gore and the FX aren't exactly up to the Saving Private Ryan level of realism but it's not like they were that great in the original either. It's not the slickness of the production but the enthusiasm and spirit of it all that matters. And since From Dusk Till Dawn 2 has that kind of spirit and delivers what it promises it comes across as a directtovideo production that's prettydamnfun!".

It takes a basic ideas vampires robbing a bank and goes with it and runs.The problem is that that's really all there is and there's not much running track.  Like the original it tries to stay reality grounded as a caper flick but given this is a shorter movie this goes on way too long before you actually get to vampires.Once we get the first guy bit by a vampire it moves along to vampires rob a bank and vampires shoot it out with police.  But...that's really about it.  The writers seemed to have run out of ideas and so we just get interminable variations on these two basic ideas.  There is no real climax  the vampire bad guys are subsequently interchangeable and the only really competent one Jesus gets killed before the formerlydimwitted one.  The ending is just one big shootout prolonged by a convenient solar eclipse. Which is another pointless plot point  if you want vampires to be in the darkness just keep them in darkness and have the sun come up normally. Adding the solar eclipse does nothing here.  It's stuff like this which suggests the writers didn't know quite what they were doing.As for the Raimiesque POV shots a little goes a long way  something that Scott Spiegel should have learned from the master.  It's kinda fun the first twenty times but after that...Overall I'd recommend it if you can catch it on the cheap.  It's no classic but it's mildly amusing.".

Also there are a few moments that are funny and border upon being clever. The porno film massacre scene had me chuckling when the donut guy got blown away. I also liked the opening Bruce CambellHail to the King! and TiffanyAmber Thiessen elevator scene. The important thing with this movie is to forget about the first one. The first one was a kinetic over the top vamp slaughterfest that was fun but hardly horror.

It's basic movie trivia that you commit a crime and then you go to Mexico to escape the long arm of the law.The dialog makes clumsy attempts at being clever Tarantinoish if you will. Unfortunately it all just falls flat. Tarantino has an odd gift for allowing actors to fluently deliver the dialogue no matter how clich it might be. This lacks here. Instead just about every sentence spoken sounds contrived and forced.Action sequences are horrendous. Vampires and cops alike line up in order to die in a gruesome manner. We're talking really lining up. Not in the sense that everybody dies but in the sense that there seems to be a veritable queue. The camera focuses slightly offfocus on one killing then moves on the next.I think this movie is a bit of a hit and miss. I got the sense that they tried to create something and failed miserably. If you watch it try to think of it as a movie that doesn't try to be anything. That way you at least won't have any expectations of it.In the end however this movie is probably best remained unseen.".

The special effects are laughable and the acting is worse. Scott Spiegel has no idea of how to direct movies and his camera angles? What is up with that. All in all don't waste any money on this movie... It is TErrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on a 1 to 10 scale i would give it a 500. Don't watch this and don't be like me and but it.".

This sequel also tries to do the same thing. But it fails.The original had George Clooney Quentin Tarantino Danny Trejo Harvey Keitel Juliette Lewis and Salma Hayek.

I mean the blood is so bad in the film the could just as well used red paint.The direction is some of the worst Ive ever seen. The camera angels is so fed up. They have placed the camera inside the mouth off a vamp. The script is so bad that I laugh out loud.

The acting was bad and the action wasn't really that exciting. They also kept cutting to an edit of the boys watching a porno movie so it was like they were trying to have some sex in there the cheap way I guess.

The story of a young man and his mother who move to Connecticut and involve themselves in tobacco farming meeting a ruthless man and his family and a kind man and his spoiled daughter it was a feast of young actors and respected mature stars. There wasn't a teen girl of those days and I dare say a few boys whose hearts didn't beat faster at the sight of Troy Donahue. His acting was pouty and wooden but there were those slim handsome blond looks often wearing a red jacket that made teens break their clinches and sit up and pay attention. Whether he was romancing Connie Stevens the first of their three films together or Diane McBain she hooked up with Donahue on the tube or brunette Sharon Hugueny or whether he was emoting with Claudette Colbert who came out of retirement for Parrish and then promptly retired again or the esteemed Karl Malden and Dean Jagger Donahue always came out second best in the acting department. This was Donahue's second of four straight films with director Delmer Daves and the older man certainly learned how to showcase the young blond hunk. The film has a bright and shiny look plenty of melodrama and a gorgeous Max Steiner score. Get yourself some popcorn put your feet up on the table and sit back and enjoy Parrish.".

It's soapy melodramatic and overthetop which is certainly entertaining if you don't look for Art with a capital A. And there is a visual lushness in the cinematography not to mention the emphasis on physical lushness eg Troy Donahue and Diane McBain and some of the other characters all dressed to the nines in suits ties contrasting sharp vests crinolined party dresses preppy red vneck sweaters backdropped against a blue sky on an impossibly handsome blond Adonis. I can't even say anymore if Troy Donahue is a good actor. I just like watching and listening to him and I think he does have a certain conviction his earnestness  which lends authenticity to his performances. Others call him wooden. I think he's more than good and underrated. And my eyes can't get enough of his physical beauty. Then there's Diane McBain who I scantly know but is right up there with Donahue  breathtakingly beautiful. Claudette is okay but the part itself is anachronistic and annoying  a bit longsuffering and stoic as her parts often are  in a role that demands she ignore a cruel brutish crass man she marries. And rounding out the pluses I love Max Steiner's lush anachronistic score. The negatives do abound the script is a bit shrill and melodramatic which you expect of soap operas of that period. I can't decide if Karl Malden is dynamic or excessive though he's always effective. Connie Steven was never my perky cup of tea. Dean Jagger caught my attention as a gentle fatherfigure and touched me deeply. Ultimately my feelings are colored by the bias of nostalgia. I very young when it was released and have some residual nostalgia for what I remember and miss from that era. Someone twenty years old would find it mostly silly I think.".

Miss McBain's filmography is a sorry testament to how Hollywood could take an extraordinarily attractive young actress possessed of some genuine talent and misuse and disuse her until everyone within the industry eventually believed that she had nothing worthwhile to offer.The story was quite a mishmash and I remember being quite upset that the lovely Miss Colbert had come out of retirement to play a role that reinforced the old cliche that It's a man's world and you women better kowtow or else!  I wanted her to give that greedy old brute mercilessly enacted by Karl Malden and his bullying sons some kind of a comeuppance which certainly shouldn't have been beyond the screenwriters whose contrivances were about as convoluted as one could get away with before the revolutions in social mores just a few years away when this was filmed overwhelmed us.But it's a guilty pleasure nevertheless.

I'm guessing the blame lies with the director andor screenwriters who apparently didn't understand that most people  unless they're bipolar  have a rather even demeanor most of the time.Probably the best acting in the film is by veteran character actor Dean Jagger. His presence is a blessing in any movie and certainly in this film.The lead  Troy Donahue  whose talent was about as shallow as a summer stream  actually does fairly well here. Other than a handsome face and blonde hair there certainly wasn't much to the skinny almost puny though tall actor. While not a memorable performance by any stretch of the imagination were any of his roles? he plays the part satisfactorily.This was Claudette Colbert's final big screen appearance and she is always a welcome presence in virtually any film. What a shame she walked away from movies. What a wonderful wonderful actress.The plot here is quite good and production values were high and much of it filmed on location. It's a longerthanaverage movie but it still ended rather abruptly and predictably. Recommended with reservations.".

	onyx:emotionText "They do not do movies like Parrish anymore nowadays and even if they made a remake they could not locate the action on tobacco fields anymoretobacco has become uncool .Parrish like a summer place Peyton Place or imitation of life  the latter being the best of the genre surpassing the first version in several respects is this kind of giant melodrama for which 135 min are not enoughthere are so many characters it would take a miniseries to make them all really live anyway this kind of story lives on in miniseries such as Dallas Dynasty and others .When the movie ends it could actually go on and on and on for two more hours .Parrish is certainly enjoyable if you like this kind of long tale .They say Troy Donahue was a limited actor but he carries the weight of a two hours and a quarter movie on his shoulders for his time on screen is twice as long as veterans Claudette Colbert last role and Karl Malden who overacts all the way and his three count'em loves appear only now and then the first one Connie Stevens almost absent in the last hour.And he manages quite wellJames Dean he was not but he was more than a pretty face more expressive than in a summer place and he turns his scenes opposite Malden and son to his advantage .It's love at first sight all the way there's a kiss in Donahue's first scenes with the first two girls and Colbert and Malden fall for each other just after they met for the first time.The part of the mother and stepmother is underwritten and does not do Colbert justice .Sometimes it seems that Parrish is in fact in love with hershe's the only one he really fights for during the scene of the ballhe forces Malden's evil son to make an announcement to welcome his stepmotherhe tells him that when she offers to shake hands with him he MUST do itThe cinematography is splendid with a great use of wide screen particularly during the scene of the fire in the night.So you forget how stereotyped the characters are  the ruthless tycoonhis lazy offspringthe field hand pregnant by her secret datethe wise man who gives the young rebel pieces of advice and who considers him his son after Alison's money match.It's amazing that Delmer Daves who excelled at western and gave classics such as broken arrow and 310 To Yuma  gave up after the hanging tree 1959.From A summer place in which Donahue starred too to the battle of the Villa Florita melodrama rules.That said Parrish  has stood the test of time quite well and remains eminently watchable today.You simply haven't got the time to get bored!";

	schema:reviewBody "Parrish reflects a beautiful time in American history. The USA was not at war and the world was more civil more decent and simpler in tastes. This beautifully filmed movie reflects that era beautifully.Troy Donahue made a hit in Lana Turner's smash comeback Imitation of Life and then went on to nearby Warners. WB starred Donahue in A Summer Place with Sandra Dee which was a big big hit and then followed this film co starring a bevy of WB beauties Diane McBain Connie Stevens and Sharon Hugueny. While the part of Donahue's mother would seem to have been tailor made for the great Bette Davis who New England to her core Warners signed Claudette Colbert a wonderful actress and a major star. Bette lost her Oscar for Of Human Bondage to Colbert's It Happened One Night years later Colbert fell ill and left All About Eve and Bette Davis scored one of her greatest triumphs. Also starring is Karl Malden and if you look closely you find other WB contract stars in small roles. This movie is a romantic and wonderful film set in the Tobacco Fields of Connecticut and has stunning photography and a lush romantic score. Paige's Theme is wonderful music.Some may scoff at a Troy Donahue movie but not me. I liked Troy Donahue's movies. Great watching for a rainy Saturday afternoon.AHW".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an odd little movie that I quite enjoyedand it reminded me quite a bit of Giant. Instead of oil or ranching the theme here is tobacco. Also compared to this earlier film Parrish has been 'sexedup' a bitwith some sleazy subplots and liberal doses of cursingsomething that must have turned some heads back in 1961. Obviously the old Production Code of 1934 was starting to lose its power.Good looking Troy Donahue and his mother Claudette Colbert live in the home of a oncerich planter Dean Jagger as Colbert is sort of a maid though she never dresses as one or seems to do any work. Colbert was 58 when she made this movie and her then falling in love and marrying Jagger's rival Karl Maldenwhich is a tiny bit hard to believe as Malden was 49 though these actual ages were never mentioned in the film. Unfortunately while Colbert is in love with Malden he's a harddriven and unscrupulous man. At first Donahue goes to work for him but soon sees that the guy will do anything...absolutely anything to drive his competitors out of business. What is Troy to do? The film is very entertaining and actually well made and acted despite the amazingly soapy script. There's an alcoholic son another who is unscrupulous and has an illegitimate secret love child from the same woman who Donahue was sleeping with early in the film Connie Stevens. There also are several other women who want Donahueone of which is the most incredibly conniving lady who loves to sleep around on her husband. All this is quite compelling and beyond the sleaze the plot is pretty exciting and captivating.By the way look for an oddly redubbed scene with Malden talking on a twoway radioit's almost his voice but you can tell it isn't if you listen carefully. The director must have decided to somehow rewrite a scene and apparently thought they could substitute a soundalike to do the voiceover.".

Instead it centers on Troy's character Parrish McLean who of course attracts the opposite sex very easily. Viewers going into this knowing nothing expecting another film like A Summer Place with Troy and Sandra Dee will on the whole be disappointed. It does have Connie Stevens in the first 45 minutes literally throwing herself at him and I still can't decide if the unintentionallyfunny dialogue was so bad it was good or if it was so bad it was embarrassing. Delmer Daves who adapted A Summer Place wrote this as well and he holds nothing back. I knew Karl Malden who here is a tobacco tycoon and a rival to Dean Jagger was a great actor and that he had some lungs but Karl really outdid himself here. Nobody and nothing is subtle in this family saga working in the tobacco industry. And while its overthetop treatment may be good to a degree in order to deliver the entertainment it gets a bit too much and quite a few times I kept thinking 'Delmer you're killing me.' Parrish tries to learn the tobacco industry and while the topic may appeal to a certain few other viewers will be wondering when will this end. The dynamics of the characters and dramatics of the story moves the viewer along up to the first hour and a half but it tends to drag by the end. If you want another beach movie like A Summer Place this is far from it. But enjoy it for what it is if you can a soapopera tale with Troy romancing three girls while working in the tobacco fields.".

	schema:headline " Thanks to this film the Kendoll looks of Mr. Donahue will never perish.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to tell what led Colbert to make this one of her last projects her final big screen effort in fact after several years away from the screen. Her role is not exactly a meaty one and she is mostly peripheral to the travails of the title character. Donahue plays that young man a somewhat aimless youth who accompanies his mother Colbert to her new position as chaperone to the daughter of a successful tobacco planter Jagger. Once there Donahue is not welcomed for fear he will tempt the daughter McBain and so he goes off to work in the fields and live with some of the hands. One fringe benefit of this is getting to canoodle with Stevens who wavers between Donahue and a secret boyfriend she frequently runs off to see. Eventually Colbert gets mixed up with Jagger's enemy the allpowerful and domineering tobacco czar Malden. Once they marry Donahue tangles with Malden and his two rotten apple sons but does have an eye for Malden's young daughter Hugueny. This doesn't mean that Donahue doesn't find time to roll in the grass with the naughty socialclimbing McBain! Malden puts him through his paces in the tobacco industry as he juggles his women and they juggle their men! until finally Donahue calls it quits and runs off to join the U.S. Navy. Amazingly he is not beaten up for getting heartshaped pieces of cake in the mail and for having an 8x10 glossy of his MOTHER next to his cot! Eventually when the Navy has made more of a man out of him he comes back to square off with Malden who is hellbent on taking over all the neighboring farm land while Colbert tries to referee Malden's unwieldy family. Donahue is given the fullon star treatment here. He is photographed like an Adonis with his blue eyes blazing and his tan skin and golden locks emerging through the soft focus cinematography. He is pretty onenote and bland but is able to dredge up a few nice moments of indignation along the way. His clothing in the film is beautiful with baby blues and reds standing out against the lush scenery. Colbert is attractive and appealing yet and possibly because her closeups are never as close up as her younger costars she sometimes seems a guest star in her own film! She just isn't given anything substantial to do except advise and counsel the others. No backstory or motivation is ever provided for her. It's a very hollow role. If one pays attention the right side of her face does occasionally appear. Malden doesn't need to chew tobacco in the film he chews every inch of the scenery. They apparently needed to remove all the furniture from his massive office lest he reduce it to rubble with his unbelievably overthetop portrayal. Jagger on the other hand and to good effect downplays his acting and is quite solid. Stevens is pert and fresh and pretty and effective though she is always in danger of being overcome by her sizable hairdo's and her full skirts. McBain who is positively delectable here gets the same starmaking lighting and photography that Donahue warrants. She's delightfully saucy and rapturously beautiful. Hugueny who would later become one of Robert Evans' many wives is an unvarnished appealing presence. Several familiar character actors appear as field hands. Taylor is amusing when one can make out what on earth he's saying. Summers gets a nice little part as part of his family. Miles and Sherwood aren't given enough to say or do in order to show off their respective talents. Hilariously the hands sing ditties with such creative lyrics as plantin' tobacco plantin' tobacco and quittin' time quittin' time or something similar to that. Former Playboy playmate Edwards has a role as Malden's daughterinlaw that is the epitome of thankless. It's a long involved story with the lack of a real climax and a virtual nonending that leaves many character's fate in the air but it's a sumptuous luxuriouslypresented film that wallows in the attractiveness of its cast. It's got beautiful cars beautiful sets beautiful clothes and beautiful women so it's a film that's always easy on the eyes. It's also easy too easy! on the brain and has more than a few laughoutloud moments. Some of the chuckles come with the help of Max Steiner's hysterically overwrought music and note the faux A Summer Place rhythm as Donahue and Stevens explore his room for the first time.".

She just isn't given anything substantial to do except advise and counsel the others. No backstory or motivation is ever provided for her. It's a very hollow role. If one pays attention the right side of her face does occasionally appear. Malden doesn't need to chew tobacco in the film he chews every inch of the scenery. They apparently needed to remove all the furniture from his massive office lest he reduce it to rubble with his unbelievably overthetop portrayal. Jagger on the other hand and to good effect downplays his acting and is quite solid. Stevens is pert and fresh and pretty and effective though she is always in danger of being overcome by her sizable hairdo's and her full skirts. McBain who is positively delectable here gets the same starmaking lighting and photography that Donahue warrants. She's delightfully saucy and rapturously beautiful. Hugueny who would later become one of Robert Evans' many wives is an unvarnished appealing presence. Several familiar character actors appear as field hands. Taylor is amusing when one can make out what on earth he's saying. Summers gets a nice little part as part of his family. Miles and Sherwood aren't given enough to say or do in order to show off their respective talents. Hilariously the hands sing ditties with such creative lyrics as plantin' tobacco plantin' tobacco and quittin' time quittin' time or something similar to that. Former Playboy playmate Edwards has a role as Malden's daughterinlaw that is the epitome of thankless. It's a long involved story with the lack of a real climax and a virtual nonending that leaves many character's fate in the air but it's a sumptuous luxuriouslypresented film that wallows in the attractiveness of its cast. It's got beautiful cars beautiful sets beautiful clothes and beautiful women so it's a film that's always easy on the eyes. It's also easy too easy! on the brain and has more than a few laughoutloud moments. Some of the chuckles come with the help of Max Steiner's hysterically overwrought music and note the faux A Summer Place rhythm as Donahue and Stevens explore his room for the first time.";

Some of the dialogue is a bit melodramatic as is some of the acting. The script has Parrish sometimes referring to his mother as Honey and her referring to him as Darling. Judd Raike is a little too easy to dislike. Malden's angry take on his character is a bit overblown. Claudette Colbert gives a really fine performance though I did not entirely like her compromising character. Contrary to some viewers' negative impressions of Troy Donahue as an actor I think he gives a fine performance in the title role.This film reminds me a little of Giant except that the business here is tobacco not oil. And the setting is Connecticut not West Texas. The tone and spirit of the two film however are very similar. In Parrish the color cinematography is acceptable. Some romantic scenes are overly glossy which contributes to the visual impression of soap opera. Music similarly trends romantically dreamy.Generally speaking I find cinematic soap operas boring. In the case of Parrish the plot is so ever changing and the visuals so lush that the film continues to generate interest from beginning to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Delmer Daves' 1961 quasiepic Parrish was supposed to be the coming out party of sorts for its young cast. The movie was a bigbudget soap opera on a par with Peyton Place and it boasted many of the upandcoming stars of the day. Unfortunately although the film was mostly wellserved by its cast of wouldbe stars and starlets it fell somewhat flat with the public and critics were none too kind. Troy Donahue had the title role and he didn't exactly set the screen on fire with his wooden acting and expressionless face. His miscasting was only a minor problem compared to the movie's bloated length and endless storyline. That said the main plot is actually quite good. A young man Parrish decides to learn the tobacco business on a Connecticut farm under the guidance of a veteran farmer named Sala Post a fine Dean Jagger. While learning the job and earning his keep he's smitten by Post's vibrant and outofcontrol daughter Diane McBain at her best but that romance is upstaged by an affair he has with one of the hired hands Connie Stevens in tight bluejeans. Parrish's elegant mother Claudette Colbert in her final screen appearance arrives on the scene and announces to all that she's marrying Post's main competitor the ruthless Judd Raike a snarling and unsympathetic Karl Malden. What she sees in this maniacal tycoon other than his deep pockets is never explained to the viewing audience. Raike soon recruits Parrish away from Post to learn the tobacco business the hard way and proceeds to rake him over the coals at every opportunity. Also in the mix are Raike's rotten sons from a previous marriage who naturally take a permanent disliking to the new kid on the block. Parrish does find an ally in Raike's goodlooking younger daughter Paige Sharon Hugueny but even she can't dissuade him from quitting his job and joining the Navy. Luckily for Parrish the Navy makes a real man out of him in no time flat. After a four year hitch he returns to Connecticut to begin his career again and settle some old scores. It all sounds very dramatic but Donahue's the wrong fellow to be playing the lead. He would've been better cast as one of the Raikes. Troy Donahue Connie Stevens Diane McBain and most notably Sharon Hugueny all had limited success after this film. The late Ms. Hugueny faded into obscurity after a near fatal accident and a few bad marriages. That's a shame because she was quite beautiful in her day and had tremendous potential as an actress. Veteran Oscar winners from the past Malden Colbert and Jagger all handle their roles with professionalism in the film and are entirely watchable during their screen time. The cinematography is firstrate and probably the best thing about Parrish. Mildred Savage wrote the novel and director Daves handled the script. As for Troy Donahue he had a tough life as his star soon faded in the mid1960s. Long past his prime he was spotted in Godfather Part II with a small role as Connie Corleone's gigolo husbandtobe. His name in the film is Merle Johnson which happened to be his real name. He died in 2000 from a heart attack. But he'll always have Parrish.".

As soon as Mr. Donahue arrives young women become aroused by his handsomeness. Employer Dean Jagger as Sala Post tells Ms. Colbert her goodlooking son will not be welcome on the estate. A smart man the veteran tobacco farmer correctly realizes sultry daughter Diane McBain as Alison would be aroused by Donahue.Indeed as the film plays out Ms. McBain is revealed as quite a tramp. Colbert doesn't seem to have much of a positive influence on her young charge. Instead Colbert begins a romance with younger man Karl Malden as Judd Raike who is the biggest tobacco farmer in the area  nice catch for Colbert as he is worth over 20 million...Meanwhile Donahue shacks up with sexy field hand Connie Stevens as Lucy who could be pregnant with a child belonging to one of Mr. Malden's two sexually active sons. The daddy is supposed to be a secret but it's easy to figure out.

	onyx:emotionText "Handsome blond Troy Donahue as Parrish McLean accompanies mother Claudette Colbert as Ellen when she is employed to work on a Connecticut tobacco farm chaperoning a young dbutante. As soon as Mr. Donahue arrives young women become aroused by his handsomeness. Employer Dean Jagger as Sala Post tells Ms. Colbert her goodlooking son will not be welcome on the estate. A smart man the veteran tobacco farmer correctly realizes sultry daughter Diane McBain as Alison would be aroused by Donahue.Indeed as the film plays out Ms. McBain is revealed as quite a tramp. Colbert doesn't seem to have much of a positive influence on her young charge. Instead Colbert begins a romance with younger man Karl Malden as Judd Raike who is the biggest tobacco farmer in the area  nice catch for Colbert as he is worth over 20 million...Meanwhile Donahue shacks up with sexy field hand Connie Stevens as Lucy who could be pregnant with a child belonging to one of Mr. Malden's two sexually active sons. The daddy is supposed to be a secret but it's easy to figure out. Donahue and Ms. Stevens have the film's sexiest scene  he is shirtless due to a rash and she fills a pink frock in the right places.Next Donahue takes his turn with McBain who has also hooked up with a Malden son. These sons are but the way Hampton Fancher as Edgar and David Knapp as Wiley they are the least known of the main cast but essay two of the better characterizations.

	schema:reviewBody "Troy Donahue plays the title character Parrish who together with mother Claudette Colbert settles in the Connecticut Valley tobacco growing area and both change the lives of all around them. The story tries for an Edna Ferber like epic quality and misses. I think mainly because Troy Donahue is not a guy whom you would think of to star in epic films.Originally Colbert was hired on by gentleman tobacco planter Dean Jagger to put some finishing touches on his spoiled daughter Diane McBain. But she gets gradually drawn to Karl Malden who is like one of those old fashioned robber baron types in his dynamism and greed. He's got a couple of dimwit sons who like the privileges but can't handle the responsibility of being a tobacco king. Malden also has a daughter in Sharon Hugenny who's a good kid and must have got that from her mother.As for Donahue he's more or less involved with three women during the film McBain Hugenny and Connie Stevens who is from a white trash family of itinerant tobacco farm workers headed by Dub Taylor. Stevens gets pregnant during the course of the film and a lot of Donahue's problems are that people around think he did it.Malden has the most dynamic role in the film and he does make the most of it. He's a man obsessed with getting control of the whole Connecticut River Valley like some cattle baron in the plot of a few thousand westerns. At the same time he knows that the force of his own personality has made idiots of his two sons and he thinks time is running out.This was Claudette Colbert's last big screen appearance and she does have a good role to go out on. She did do stage work after this and one made for television film. As for Donahue he's miscast in a part that was made for the late James Dean. Paul Newman could have also done quite a bit more with the part than Donahue managed. The film also ends rather abruptly as I was expecting quite a bit more to come. Almost like Warner Brothers just decided to not spend any more money.Donahue McBain and Stevens were all starring in Warner Brothers television shows at the time Parrish was made. The popularity of television stardom gave Parrish a built in box office before a single ticket was sold. Parrish is not a bad film but with some better casting in the lead could have been much better.".
