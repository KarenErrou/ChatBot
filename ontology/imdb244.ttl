By this means he uncovers the human smuggling ring run by Palinov George Macready. He also meets concentrationcamp refugee Marianne Lorress Hedy Lamarr a Viennese working in a nightclub and one who has paid to be smuggled into the United States. When Karczag falls in love with her he becomes conflicted not wanting her to be among those he plans to have captured in his operation. So he tries to persuade her to stay in Cuba instead of being secretly flown to the United States. Will he succeed? What if his cover is blown?";

Why folks are chasing him isn't certain...and you learn more about this as the film progresses. It seems that this unknown dead man is an illegal alien...and clues on his body point to his having just been in Cuba. So Peter Hodiak goes down to this island nation to investigate...with the help of the local police. The trail then leads to a smooth but deadly jerk played very well by George Macready he played snakelike characters very well. So how is pretty Hedy involved? Watch the film.I think for Ms. Lamarr this film was a letdown and didn't do a lot for her career. Now it isn't because it's a bad film at all...it's very good. But she isn't given a lot to do but look pretty...even inexplicably during a trek through the Everglades near the end of the film...and her makeup and hair look superb!!! I live in Florida and even if this had been in the middle of winter she sure COULDN'T have looked that perfect! Well worth seeing...and an interesting and unusual plot.".

Many of those who would have gone into a studio's Bunit are doing so not all.With some notable exceptions like Double Indemnity the main characteristic of what we now call noir is low budgets.

One illegal gets killed in Miami and they decide to infiltrate the home base in Havana. Things don't too well and with a few missteps the crooks get away...but Immigration gives chase.Thats's pretty much it. You get a decent performance outta John Hodiak but Hedy Lamarr is just there for you to look at. Just as beautiful as any female to grace the screen. Nobody ever accused her of trying to win an Oscar and after watching this you can see why. They try to throw in a curve ball to make the film interesting in that Hedy Lamarr is stuck from one port to another and can't get citizenship anywhere cause she was a concentration camp survivor who was deported and can't get to stay anywhere. Even with that injected this thing is just dull and bland the whole way.A couple of fun parts to watch for. A scene early one where the undercover Immigration official goes into town after dark in a caf where a girl is dancing.Take a close look at the girl. She ain't Cuban. Just a small white girl painted on with a deep dark tan. Reminds me of those old westerns where the Indians were all white guys darkened up. I think the best part is the plane chase sequence. They wanna keep track of this guy flying so they keep the navy on him with a flier. My issue is if these smugglers were so wanted why didn't they dispatch more planes to follow? The plane deliberately crashes and they coulda had another plane follow the raft the go off on. What a laugh. The worst is the plane crash itself. No one in the plane had seats so they had to sit on their luggage. The planemodel plane crashes and hits a tree really hard and they all get out OK. Now I've never been in a plane crash but in this case physics would dictate most if not all those passengers woulda flown out the cockpit window with the speed the plane hit that tree.Save your time and watch the sun set in a lawn chair with a cold beer and be happy you avoided a 73 minute waste of time.".

First there is John Hodiak. The character he plays is clever and street smarttraits that Hodiak pulls off quite well. Secondly there are the Havana location shots that add an authenticity and the little bit of charm that the film possesses. Lastly the BW photography shows some originality and adds to the mood of the narrative. The music feels inappropriate at times but firstrate at other times.

The only thing that was memorable about this film was the location shooting in Havana. The highlight of the Cuban segment was the Mambo music and dancing as the lead walks into a seedy little nightclub. This 1950 film predates Mambo Mania in the US by a few years by 1955 Cuba and the music that came with it were all the rage stateside and featured in numerous TV shows and films. Lots of 'Casablancaesque' scenes of stranded refugees in this one but unlike that film you'll have already forgotten everybody's name by the time the credits roll.".

	schema:headline " Delightful film based on Linda Darnell's real experience";
	schema:reviewBody "This is such a charming film. It concerns young hopefuls who want to get into Hollywood. The lead is played by Linda Darnell and the script was written based upon what really happened to her only the year before. Both in real life and in this film's story Linda was discovered by a travelling Hollywood talent scout in reality she came from Dallas in the film from the fictitious small town of Rockville Arkansas. She then went to Hollywood took a screen test but was sent back home because she was discovered to be only 15 but returned anyway. In the film she is sent back home because she was 16 going on 17 precisely the age she really was when she made this film. I have already had occasion to praise Darnell's brilliant film debut when she was 15 going on 16 the previous year in HOTEL FOR WOMAN 1939 see my review. Darnell met with a terrible fate however. In 1965 aged 41 she was sitting and watching this very film on television when a fire broke out in the house and she died of burns. The young male lead in the film is John Payne aged 28. Payne was a very fine fellow as I discovered the only time I met him. He and my mother had known each other in Virginia though he was a few years older. She and I went to see him backstage at a play where we had a jolly chat. He came from a wealthy background and had the easy and confident manner of someone who had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. But he did not choke on the spoon and instead became an excellent movie actor. I have always thought that he should have been in better films but he was mostly a star of B pictures. By the time this film was made he had already appeared in ten films in only four years. In this one he sings as well as acts. He and Darnell are summoned to Hollywood for screen tests at the same time and meet on the train. The other lead actors in the film are Roland Young who plays the talent scout and Charlotte Greenwood who plays his colleague. They are both superb being the old pros that they were. I note that Darnell's biography on IMDb wrongly names her character in this film as Carolyn Ayres whereas the correct name is Carolyn Sayres. The film was directed by Walter Lang who is best known for WITH A SONG IN MY HEART 1952 about Jane Froman CALL ME MADAM 1953 THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS 1954 and THE KING AND I 1956 all of which were smash hits. The 1950s were truly the glory days of Walter Lang who retired in 1961 after having directed 66 films. Donald Meek plays a supporting role in this film and it is a serious part unlike his usual whimsical ones. The film is romantic and full of youthful zest and hope. It makes a great change from gloom and doom of which we have so much these days. One little touch amused me namely that in order to demonstrate his smalltown naivete upon arriving in Hollywood John Payne pronounces the name of Charles Laughton as 'Charles 'Laffton'. Perhaps that was an in joke since one thing Charles Laughton in person certainly was not was someone who could be described as a laugh a minute. He could be quite horrid. This film is very much a breath of fresh air though very much an early forties film with all the manners and mores of those days which seem so innocent today. How strange to think that only a year after this film was released the world would be plunged into war and joie de vivre would dry up. This film was thus one of the last gasps of cheerfulness in the cinema before life became grim.".

Directed with style by Walter Lang this comedy has a lot going for itself.Best thing in the movie is lovely Linda Darnell who plays a young woman with stars in her eyes. Hollywood in those years was a magnet that attracted young people that wanted a chance to be in pictures. This was Ms. Darnell's third film appearance and it was clear why she was one of the most gifted personalities of the time.The premise is simple and yet Star Dust proved to be a delightful time at the movies. The cast is marvelous. John Payne plays the male lead and shows great chemistry working with Ms. Darnell. Veterans Thomas Brooke and Charlotte Greenwood are at their best as some of the people that molded the young people that were entrusted to them or who discovered talent whenever they saw it. William Gargan and Donald Meek are on hand as well to make things better. George Montgomery appears briefly.We even get a glimpse of Grauman's Chinese Theater with its Mandarin attired ushers and the signature sidewalk! Don't miss it when it's shown again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Critics who write about Ernst Lubitsch's great romantic comedies often refer to the European flavor of his Hollywood work so it's especially intriguing to view this recently rediscovered silent comedy Lubitsch made in his native Germany in 1917. Ein Fideles Gefngnis The Merry Jail is an adaptation of the libretto from Johann Strauss' operetta Die Fledermaus and while it lacks the sophistication and nuance of the director's mature work it's an interesting film in its own right distinctly different from the Hollywood product of the time  or later for that matter. In some respects this movie looks primitive compared to concurrent American productions but in others such as the bluntly presented homosexuality of one character it goes beyond anything Hollywood filmmakers including Lubitsch himself were permitted to explore for many years to come.Even if you're unfamiliar with the Strauss operetta this adaptation may feel familiar for it uses a frequently recycled plot device this is the story of Alice a rich but neglected wife who disguises herself and follows her drunken playboy of a husband to a society gala where she leads him on. Ignorant of her true identity he flirts happily unaware that he's contemplating an extramarital affair with his own wife. And he certainly must be blotto as her disguise consists of little more than an evening gown and a Lone Rangerstyle mask. Meanwhile other frolics are under way there's a lighthearted flirtation between Alice and Egon Storch the odd little man who admires her there's outright carousing by Alice's maid and a sloshed aristocrat and there's even more boisterous behavior by a drunken jailer named Quabbe towards various men who capture his fancy. Quabbe is played by Emil Jannings whose makeup suggests Keystone comic Chester Conklin gone to seed. Even today viewers might be startled when he kisses one inmate on the lips strokes the arm of another and tells the warden that he really really likes him. This is a Merry Jail indeed! But wouldn't The Gay Jail have been a better translation for the title?This movie paints a colorful but rather disturbing picture of Germany during the Great War. Film textbooks pay lots of attention to the postwar Weimar era silent classics such as Caligari and Nosferatu and they are frequently screened and widely available but it isn't often one encounters a German production produced during the war. No direct reference is made to the conflict but during the masked ball it's noticeable that several of the dancing pairs are women suggesting a lack of available men. It's also noticeable that most of the males we see are extremely drunk suggesting an exhausted culture in search of alcoholic oblivion. Most of these characters are both privileged and idle protected from having to serve in the military by their social positions. I wonder if this movie was seen by German soldiers and how they felt about fighting for the sake of these frivolous people.The acting technique on display in Ein Fideles Gefngnis is one of the film's drawbacks. The actors mug overreact and occasionally turn to the camera to rattle off silent speeches a silly device one finds in such early comedy features as Mack Sennett's Tillie's Punctured Romance of 1914 but which most filmmakers outgrew by the late 'teens. An even bigger drawback is the leading man's sheer grossness. And I don't mean his appearance. Harry Liedtke the actor who plays Alex Von Reizenstein is not bad looking but his character is totally unappealing. Who could care about this guy or his marriage? He's a spoiled irresponsible hopelessly wasted cad who vomits in his hat bribes his wife to silence her complaints and flirts shamelessly while claiming to be a bachelor  although frankly he appears far too dissolute to actually consummate an affair. This guy isn't merely a naughty rogue he's a slob and his wife Alice the cheerful collector of bribes isn't much better. The most likable characters are Mizi the maid and funny little Egon Storch two people who are at least candid about their desires in contrast with Alex and Alice whose relationship seems to be built entirely on deceit. The supporting players give this comedy its best moments.At any rate despite its flaws this film provides a rare glimpse into a dying culture in its final days and a fascinating introduction to a great director at the dawn of his career.".

	schema:reviewBody "The mid1910s were a crucial time in the development of cinema. However due to the war that was going on German cinema was to some extent growing up in isolation and was learning to do things its own way. Besides in Germany they took their inspiration so much more from their own stage traditions as we see in this Ernst Lubitsch threereeler a good oldfashioned farce loosely adapted from Johann Strauss II operetta Die Fledermaus.Lubitsch however was anything but theatrical in his execution. The director seems fascinated by the possibilities that cinema offers in the field of depth with lots of long hallways and characters entering from the back of the set rather than emerging from the wings. And it is often this use of depth which facilitates the comedy such as Harry Liedtke's drunken lurch home or his sudden appearance below the desk as the camera pulls back. Lubitsch even extends this trajectory out through the fourth wall with Liedtke bemoaning his troubles directly to the audience. Characters addressing the audience was not really a done thing in American cinema. Nor was crossing the line of action which Lubitsch does on one occasion flipping the camera back and forth to see both sides of a car for a series of gags.Another big difference between this and Hollywood comedy of the time is that Lubitsch has no big comedy star. Whereas funny business in the states was being lead and driven by standalone comics like Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle for Das Fidele Gefangnis it's the ensemble that matters. The comedy acting here generally boils down to wildly running around and pulling silly faces from Harry Liedtke's putupon forlorn look to Emil Janning's crazy eyes and wriggly moustache. Not the most sophisticated stuff but it works in the context. None of these players could have carried off a show on their own but they don't really need to for this sort of comedy.Das Fidele Gefangnis is in fact such a jolly witty absurd creation that you wouldn't think there was a war on. When you see such bizarre humour as Agda Nielson having a cigar shoved in her mouth by a hurried guest or a cheating cardplayer's bottom thrust towards the camera with an Ace of Hearts stuck to it it's hard to think of the mass slaughter that was going on not so far away at the time. And then again perhaps it does make sense since Ernst Lubitsch's crazed brand of humour makes for wonderful escapism.".

	schema:headline " So This is Paris or Vienna or Berlin";
	schema:reviewBody "The Merry Jail is a primitive German farce from Ernst Lubitsch and a far cry from the director's sophisticated romantic comedies he later made in Hollywood or even his later German features. Interestingly however the director would return to the same and similar material when adapting some of his earliest more sophisticated pictures in America namely the very first such film The Marriage Circle 1924 its remake One Hour with You 1932 and in particular So This is Paris 1926. All base their humor around flirting with marital infidelity and in the case of The Merry Jail and So This is Paris at least around masquerade and mistaken identity which was also a common theme in the rest of Lubitsch's German oeuvre as well as part of some of the American pictures.While credited as as adaptation of the Johann Strauss operetta Die Fledermaus The Bat which refers to a costume worn in it and released in Germany during the Great War The Merry Jail which takes its title from the third act of the Strauss operetta may have its origins traced back to France one of the nations of course that Germany was at war with at that time. As Ben Brewster The Circle Lubitsch and the Theatrical Farce Tradition from Film History has detailed Die Fledermaus was a German adaptation reset in Vienna where it premiered of the French play La Rveillon the title referring to the Frenchstyle New Year's Eve party which was set and opened in Paris and which would later be credited as the source for Lubitsch and scriptwriter Hanns Krly's 1926 adaptation So This is Paris. While Brewster claims that So This is Paris more closely follows the plot of Die Fledermaus he suggests that it may've cited the Parisian play to either avoid rights issues or comparisons to The Merry Jail and 1917 surely wasn't an opportune time for a German film to credit the French even if Lubitsch were aware at the time of its Parisian origins. For the 1926 production however Paris was a convenient location to suggest sexual promiscuity even though the place has no real relevance to the film's narrative. One Hour with You would later exploit Paris for the same purpose whereas The Marriage Circle resorted to a title card in an attempt to justify its Viennese setting claiming it still the city of laughter and light romance. Yet regardless of the locale Lubitsch was bound to bring his own Berliner sensibilities to whatever production.Although The Marriage Circle and One Hour with You are based on another play which as Brewster points out was a comedydrama rather than a farce like La Rveillon and concerned with the fallen woman problem similar to Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan which Lubitsch also adapted in 1925 they share similarities with The Merry Jail and So This is Paris. All feature circular recouplings surrounding a central married couple who reunite and in general as in the somewhat similar endings of this film and The Marriage Circle avoid moralizing the subject. The Marriage Circle even features a scene where the wife mistakes the other man for her husband which is kind of a reversal of the masquerade of the wife in disguise to lure back her husband in this film and in So This is Paris. In any event dramatic irony based on characters' misconceptions is a device employed in all four films as well as in other Lubitsch works. Unlike So This is Paris The Marriage Circle and One Hour with You also feature a similar cab scene to the one here although in those films the characters share the ride whereas here the driver leaves during the two's prolonged dispute. Additionally the name Mizi the maid in this one is similar to the MizzieMitzi name of the other woman in the other two films. I don't think there is a character with such a name in So This is Paris though. The final acts of the 1926 semiremake however are quite similar to The Merry Jail as they also involve an arrest of the wrong man due to the man's attempts to woo the other man's wife while the husband goes to a ball and gets drunk instead. And again the wife discovers where her husband is and wears a mask tricking him into having an affair with his own wife. All of the films feature parties too.Lubitsch's sensibilities weren't as refined in 1917 as they later would be and that's especially evident in the broad gesticulation and general mugging of the actors here. There's also quite a bit of positioning for them to appear in a frontal position before the generallyimmobile camera. On the other hand they do look as though they were having a good time including futureOscarwinner Emil Jannings as a drunk prison guard with a fake mustache that makes him look like a Keystone Kop and who seems to rather enjoy kissing other men. The rest of the production is dated and theatrical including title cards declaring the threeact structure and even with the opening up of the play it still mostly takes place within three interiors although the extensive crosscutting helps to alleviate the staginess. A couple exceptions are the scene in the hat store where the wife sees the other man first through his reflection in a mirror and then through a window and the comical series of reverseangle shots for when they argue over the taxi ride. The latter effect would be too showy for Lubitsch's later style but the importance of looks as in the former example would become dominant especially in the director's best silent films such as The Marriage Circle Lady Windermere's Fan and So This is Paris.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Merry Jail is a primitive German farce from Ernst Lubitsch and a far cry from the director's sophisticated romantic comedies he later made in Hollywood or even his later German features. Interestingly however the director would return to the same and similar material when adapting some of his earliest more sophisticated pictures in America namely the very first such film The Marriage Circle 1924 its remake One Hour with You 1932 and in particular So This is Paris 1926. All base their humor around flirting with marital infidelity and in the case of The Merry Jail and So This is Paris at least around masquerade and mistaken identity which was also a common theme in the rest of Lubitsch's German oeuvre as well as part of some of the American pictures.While credited as as adaptation of the Johann Strauss operetta Die Fledermaus The Bat which refers to a costume worn in it and released in Germany during the Great War The Merry Jail which takes its title from the third act of the Strauss operetta may have its origins traced back to France one of the nations of course that Germany was at war with at that time. As Ben Brewster The Circle Lubitsch and the Theatrical Farce Tradition from Film History has detailed Die Fledermaus was a German adaptation reset in Vienna where it premiered of the French play La Rveillon the title referring to the Frenchstyle New Year's Eve party which was set and opened in Paris and which would later be credited as the source for Lubitsch and scriptwriter Hanns Krly's 1926 adaptation So This is Paris. While Brewster claims that So This is Paris more closely follows the plot of Die Fledermaus he suggests that it may've cited the Parisian play to either avoid rights issues or comparisons to The Merry Jail and 1917 surely wasn't an opportune time for a German film to credit the French even if Lubitsch were aware at the time of its Parisian origins. For the 1926 production however Paris was a convenient location to suggest sexual promiscuity even though the place has no real relevance to the film's narrative. One Hour with You would later exploit Paris for the same purpose whereas The Marriage Circle resorted to a title card in an attempt to justify its Viennese setting claiming it still the city of laughter and light romance. Yet regardless of the locale Lubitsch was bound to bring his own Berliner sensibilities to whatever production.Although The Marriage Circle and One Hour with You are based on another play which as Brewster points out was a comedydrama rather than a farce like La Rveillon and concerned with the fallen woman problem similar to Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan which Lubitsch also adapted in 1925 they share similarities with The Merry Jail and So This is Paris.

	schema:reviewBody "Das fidele Gefngnis or The Merry Jail is a German film from 1917 so this one will have its 100th anniversary next year already. And as it is so old already it should be self explanatory that this is a silent blackandwhite film. The writer and director here is Ernst Lubitsch who was in his mid20s only when he shot this one but was nonetheless already a fairly experienced filmmaker even if this was of course still long before his breakthrough in Hollywood and his switch to Englishlanguage movies. The original subtitles here are in German and the good thing is that they bring some decent humor to the story and certainly help in understanding the story better. The bad thing is that just like with so many other silent films the subtitles are just not frequent enough. We see moving mouths that indicate people talking all the time and still we have no clue what they are saying for the most part. Of course in many scenes it is not really too relevant but it still would have been nice. Other than that this film despite the experienced cast also suffers from overacting on some occasions another major problem in silent films in general. The title is a bit random as this movie is really all about a husband who struggles in being faithful to his wife. The ring references are the best indicator for that. But the wife knows how to deal with him. This is almost 100 comedy even the romance is not too frequent despite the beautiful final kiss. Unfortunately it is really difficult to believe the husband did not recognize his wife on so many occasions and the subplots with other characters add very little. As a whole I cannot say I enjoyed the watch too much and this film is really only for the biggest silent film fans. I give it a thumbsdown.".

The sets and acting are just fine though this REALLY confused me. After all this movie came out in 1917in the middle of WWI. Yet despite this the film makes no mention of the war and everyone seems happy and wellfedsomething that would NOT have mirrored Germany in 1917. About the only way you notice something is amiss is at the party. Some of the lady dancers are actually dancing with women dressed up as men! I assume this was due to a shortage of available ablebodied young men most had been killed in the war or were serving at the front. So this film is very interesting from a historical standpoint.Unfortunately while this is a decent film I must also admit that it isn't all that funny. It reminds me of a more sophisticated and cerebral version of a Sennett film. And while this isn't bad it definitely could have used an infusion of a few more gags to liven it up a bit. This film is probably best seen by huge cinephiles film lovers who want to see an early film by Ernst Lubitsch to see what he was before he hit Hollywood.".

With a cast of prominent German actors of the time notably Paul Dahlke and Paul Klinger and budding rock'n'roll star Peter Kraus in his first movie role the movie tells the story of the Tertia students 7th8th grade in a small town boarding school who continue a prehistoric feud with the boys from a neighbouring school. Woven into this narrative are questions of honesty courage loyalty friendship  and money issues which never lack in Kstner's books. The boys also write and perform a play about the lessons with their favourite teacher Johannes Bck called Justus the just one and moreover manage to bring him back together with a longlost childhood friend. I was astonished to see the very good acting of the child actors among them now famous German director Michael Verhoeven.

	schema:reviewBody "Das fliegende Klassenzimmer or Flying Classroom is a West German blackandwhite film from the years 1954 the year when Germany won the Soccer World Cup for the first time so this one already had its 60th anniversary a while ago. The title is still somewhat known today but this is really more due to the novel by Erich Kstner one of Germany's most successful authors ever being so famous. As he was still very much alive and well back then he was also the one who adapted his own novel for the screen here. The director of this 90minute film was Kurt Hoffmann a pretty successful filmmaker as well back then. But none of them could really manage to make it work unfortunately. I watched the recent adaptation starring Ulrich Noethen and I must say this old film is even more underwhelming than the new modern approach to Kstner's material. It is about two groups of children struggling with getting along. And in the face of all this there is also a handful adults teachers and parents with their own struggles. There are dramatic moments in here like a boy getting injured severely but it is still a family film and comedy during pretty much its entirety. But it is never funny unfortunately. The only parts I somewhat liked were the ones that gave us some nice holiday spirit and Christmas music. Other than these I found it an extremely forgettable film that dragged a whole lot on many occasions. 4 out of 10 is still pretty generous and I give this one a thumbsdown. Extremely underwhelming. watch something else instead.".

I could name many films from the early 80s of a similar ilk but this one stuck in my mind as a real favourite and it was only when I rewatched it recently that I understood why.Unlike other films in the genre Blue Thunder always strikes me as having been thought about and crafted in a very careful way. In fact I didn't remember there being as little action as there is. Instead we are given far more character development than we might be accustomed to thereby enhancing the final aerial drama because we do care about the people involved.Roy Scheiderwho I must confess is my favourite actor of his era gives a standout performance. His portrayal of Murphy with its wry humour  very human lapses shares more than a little with a certain Chief Brody but the use of an aging rebel with little cause as the main character in a technological thriller is still refreshing now.Malcolm McDowell gives the sort of OTT villainous performance that only he can why has noone ever cast him as a Bond villain? and special mention must go to Warren Oates as Scheider's longsuffering boss.The helicopter looks awesome with cool gadgets aplenty but it isn't the star here Scheider is. Move over Top Gun Airwolf Wings of the Apache et al this is the number 1 flyboy in town.".

Knowing what I do of technology I am not surprised that those capabilities existed back then. However I received a powerful demonstration of the stealth technology called whisper mode in the film a couple of years after seeing it. I live near a major U.S. Army firing range and our local airport hosts a considerable amount of military traffic. At this particular time I was renting a house about one kilometer from the airport. I went out for a walk late one Sunday night and shortly after leaving the house I heard a noise I could not identify. It was a loud hissing sound 'which seemed very close at hand but I could not locate the source until I looked up. Passing overhead at about 200 meters was a Chinook helicopter the type with two rotors and fuselage that looks kind of like a banana. Normally the rotor noise on these cargo helicopters will rattle windows but this baby was tiptoeing out of town very quietly. If I had been indoors I never would have heard it. This made me completely rethink the sequence where the helicopter was hovering right outside of a building and the people inside couldn't hear it! I took it for artistic license at the time but the demonstration I witnessed of whisper mode made it seem entirely feasible.This film appealed to me strongly for several reasons. I am a techno freak to begin with and I love anything that flies. Also the characters in the movie are amazingly human kooky especially the lead characters wife and easy to identify with. And the kind of shenanigans the Feds were trying to pull seem all too realistic to me in light of some of the things that they have been caught doing! And I loved the response of sending a couple of F15's armed with missiles after the renegade when he is stooging around in downtown Los Angeles. Missiles are not known for being highly selective when they are of the heat seeking type and urban areas are rich with thermal signatures which can confuse the tiny brain packed into an airtoair missile. The filmmakers actually downplayed the havoc that could result from launching such weapons in a downtown area.I found the film to be an enjoyable realistic thought provoking experience which I would recommend to most people. The hardware is not the star thanks to the excellent work of Roy Scheider and his supporting cast and the dialog is tight and realistic. When informed that one of the suspects in a liquor store robbery is wearing a Hawiian shirt and a cowboy hat Scheider's character says What ever happened to being inconspicuous?".

I've got the DVD and always enjoy watching this film I love Roy Scheider in most films he's in and he's excellent in this one. Also thought Daniel Stern was great as Murphy's observer. The series was quite cheezy but enjoyable in it's own way. Universal latched on to the super hitech helicopter theme as Airwolf followed soon afterwards. The helicopter in Airwolf was a Bell 222 whereas Blue Thunder was a converted Gazelle helicopter that was given a facelift to make it look bulky and menacing a little bit like an Apache. Back to the movie. The plot is quite thin and there are a couple of scenes that are a bit far fetched but if you're looking for a film with good helicopter chase sequences in it they don't come much better than this.

Looked like a Wang computer at work.I saw this movie for the first time at a drivein. Those were the days!! .. before DVD's and when VHS recorders were manually tuned. Guess you might say that this was the end of an era and the beginning of video.My girl and her two boys will remember this movie as long as they live. The movie that played right after this at the drivein was Xtro. Remember when you could have the entire family see two full length movies for under 10.00? Now popcorn alone costs 10.00 for one medium bucket. I have the original Blue Thunder VHS tape in my library played it last night. My favorite part of the movie is when a heat seekingmissile is launched into a BBQue chicken factory and chickens come raining down on the street and cars. The suspense that built up to this point made it funny however tragic for the factory workers.25 years prior to this movie there was Whirly Birds in black and white on TV. It is interesting to see the advance in aeronautical technology from the early Korean War birds to stealth flight in choppers. I seriously doubt that any helicopter today can achieve or survive inverted flight as was depicted in the final scenes of Blue Thunder. As unbelievable as it seemed it was exciting to watch. We still have increased concerns of the privacy of citizens and terrorist activity. In the days of Blue Thunder it was only fantasy to think of wire tapping without a warrant .... today?

Blue Thunder1983 is one of the five best films from a director in John Badham whose career has been full of ups and downs.  I feel his output from the early to mid 1980s are his most successful times as a filmmaker.  Roy Scheider is professional and tough in his role of the film's protagonist.Malcolm McDowell gives another demented performance as Scheider's former mentor and now chief nemisis.  When channeling the right key McDowell can be one convincing menacing villain.  Badham's late 1990s Hitchcockian type thriller Nick of Time1996 used many of the same ideas on action and suspense as his earlier film Blue Thunder1983.

When you such names as Roy Scheider Warren Oatesaka God Daniel Stern Candy Clarkwho I have never liked more than in this movie and Malcolm McDowell I'd be hard pressed to imagine how it could go wrong. Blue Thunder is a new form of police duty. Scheider plays a former helopilot during Nam who has the grueling task of warding off past demons which return to cause unneeded stress as he's in the air with copilot Stern hunting down street scum. Scheider is to pilot along with Stern the Blue Thunder much to the chagrin of McDowell who knows him from Nam. We later learn of a nasty little incident between the two which explains the obvious tension both share whenever they are near each other. McDowell is government now and contributes to a specific event regarding the shooting of a political figure out to help the lower rung of society by one of the very kinds of criminal low lives she was vocal in her community at protecting. How McDowell is involved and how Scheider is out to shake himand those others who are participants in this covert incidentis the meat of the film's storyline which accompanies the helicopter action that is the bread and butter of Blue Thunder. Candy Clark is Scheider's girlfriend who is dragged into the developing plot concerning a conversation on a recorded tape and how she will be needed to deliver it to a news organization in order to see those involved are brought to justice. Stern is the affable partner of Scheider who suffers a tragic fate in order to lend a hand in taking down those who are responsible for a murder cover up. Oates is Scheider's disgruntled boss who has trouble defending him during moments of reckless behaviorStern uses the photographic equipment to peep in on a naked woman doing aerobics! Scheider stealing the Blue Thunder in order to see that the tape is turned into the proper people. Oates even in such menial roles which service the plot as a barking police captain manages to steal all his scenes! Lord knows Oates' captain has plenty to complain about when his pilots cause such disturbances as using the helicopter for other means besides police work! Candy Clark's driving in this movie is of supreme comedy relief as she evades certain harm repeatedly particularly at the end when being chased by police out to arrest her. But I wanted action in the air and there are plenty of helicopter chases even if such instances are preposterous when pondering them realisticallywould even as good a pilot as Scheider really be able to outsmart heat seeking missiles fired at him from military jets?!. McDowell is as always perfectly loathsome as a hot shot helicopter pilot whose superiority complex and treatment of Scheider make him such a wonderfully hissable villain. Badham keeps this movie humming along despite a long running time staging some impressive action sequences along the way. Scheider always quite the charmer is appealing in the lead hero role. Regarded as unable to carry a movie I always thought Scheider did so effortlessly. Scheider and Oates you guys may be gone but will never be forgotten.".

Stern is the affable partner of Scheider who suffers a tragic fate in order to lend a hand in taking down those who are responsible for a murder cover up. Oates is Scheider's disgruntled boss who has trouble defending him during moments of reckless behaviorStern uses the photographic equipment to peep in on a naked woman doing aerobics! Scheider stealing the Blue Thunder in order to see that the tape is turned into the proper people. Oates even in such menial roles which service the plot as a barking police captain manages to steal all his scenes! Lord knows Oates' captain has plenty to complain about when his pilots cause such disturbances as using the helicopter for other means besides police work! Candy Clark's driving in this movie is of supreme comedy relief as she evades certain harm repeatedly particularly at the end when being chased by police out to arrest her. But I wanted action in the air and there are plenty of helicopter chases even if such instances are preposterous when pondering them realisticallywould even as good a pilot as Scheider really be able to outsmart heat seeking missiles fired at him from military jets?!. McDowell is as always perfectly loathsome as a hot shot helicopter pilot whose superiority complex and treatment of Scheider make him such a wonderfully hissable villain. Badham keeps this movie humming along despite a long running time staging some impressive action sequences along the way. Scheider always quite the charmer is appealing in the lead hero role. Regarded as unable to carry a movie I always thought Scheider did so effortlessly. Scheider and Oates you guys may be gone but will never be forgotten.";

More than compensating for this though is the great cast and impressive gadgetry. Ya gotta love Roy Scheider he made a great leading man and this is definitely one to look out for if you feel he didn't quite catch the wave he should've done after Jaws...It's a little bottomheavy with most of the action being shoehorned into the last segment but if you garnered some enjoyment from Badham's other crowdpleasing fare of the decade like War Games and Short Circuit then you should also be able to derive some form of pleasure from this.".

It was found out by the McNeely commission that these high in government officials are secretly planning to stir up trouble in the ghettos and barrios of the city of L.A. If successful it would be an excuse for a major takeover of the country in instigating violence and chaos and then repealing the rights of Americans in the name of national security sounds familiar?

	schema:reviewBody "This was a riveting film wellwritten with both a gritty realism and a flair for hightech imagination that was obviously rooted in familiarity for military aircraft. Its direction was tight its cinematography excellent and its acting topnotch. The plot was basic big bad military has nasty plans for unsuspecting civilian public and it's up to a somewhat messedup and semidisgraced Viet Nam veteran to save the day. Francis Murphy the reluctant hero of this film is a police helicopter pilot. As the movie opens Frank's breaking inand razzinghis new partner Richard Lymangood. Before long Frank and Lymangood alias JAFO are tapped to try out a brand new Army Apache helicopter bristling with new technology from hypersensitive surveillance equipment and a gun that responds interactively with the pilot's helmet to a whisper mode that allows the chopper to slip secretly through the sky. Unlike the sleek machine in the later TV series Airwolf the Blue Thunder in this movie is a beast its very design seeming to snarl menacingly as it glides through the air.Frank admires the technical aspects of the chopper but remains leery of its darker side. Ostensibly made up for the upcoming Olympics in Los Angeles Blue Thunder is a prototype for a weapon to be used against civilians both abroad and at home.

As for the evil Cochrane he was played to slimy perfection by Malcolm McDowell. Even the more minor characters were wellplayed and supported the story. This was a good action movie enjoyably blending suspense with some touches of light comedy with a gratifying finish. Recommended especially for fans of Roy Scheider and lovers of military aircraft.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was a riveting film wellwritten with both a gritty realism and a flair for hightech imagination that was obviously rooted in familiarity for military aircraft. Its direction was tight its cinematography excellent and its acting topnotch. The plot was basic big bad military has nasty plans for unsuspecting civilian public and it's up to a somewhat messedup and semidisgraced Viet Nam veteran to save the day. Francis Murphy the reluctant hero of this film is a police helicopter pilot. As the movie opens Frank's breaking inand razzinghis new partner Richard Lymangood. Before long Frank and Lymangood alias JAFO are tapped to try out a brand new Army Apache helicopter bristling with new technology from hypersensitive surveillance equipment and a gun that responds interactively with the pilot's helmet to a whisper mode that allows the chopper to slip secretly through the sky. Unlike the sleek machine in the later TV series Airwolf the Blue Thunder in this movie is a beast its very design seeming to snarl menacingly as it glides through the air.Frank admires the technical aspects of the chopper but remains leery of its darker side. Ostensibly made up for the upcoming Olympics in Los Angeles Blue Thunder is a prototype for a weapon to be used against civilians both abroad and at home.

So it's the closest to the book of course. There was just this part were they run over the ice and slip all the time. It's supposed to be dramatic but it's just stupid and disturbs...The second one took place in Bamberg in 73 and the idea of setting it into summertime was really good. They changed the snowball fight into a 'normal' fight which was really good made. But that Ulli jumped out of a window of the third floor I think it was the third... with an umbrella was unrealistic and overdramatic too... but I never new which one I like more...Then I heard that they wanna make a new one and I wondered how they wanna set it into this time. There are hardly any boys boarding schools in Germany anymore but the idea of putting the play into the Thomaner school was genius! By the way in this version it's winter again and the snowball fight is a snowball fight And that they reeranged the play into some kind of a rapmusical in the futurespace was good too! Because with it they could not only create the past difficulties of Justus Ulrich Noethen and Nichtraucher Sebastian Koch with the DDR but it also appealed more with the new generation.The acting was awesome but I have to say that Hauke Diekamp Jonathan Trotz was the most incredible. Not only his acting was very convincing but it was the first time he acted at all what is not to believe after watching this movie.All in all the newest fliegende Klassenzimmer is an awesome movie which everyone should watch once in his life not only Kstner fans!".

	schema:reviewBody "This kids movie from 2003 is based on an Erich Kstner novel and yet they had four writers adapting it for the screen. The outcome is quite a disappointment as this is a prime example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The cast is decent Noethen Koch Kling and a very young Frederick Lau he reunited with Ferkic for Die Welle are in here and so is a personal favorite Piet Klocke. His classroom scene with the boy in the garbage bin was probably the funny highlight of the movie. The movie won many awards but I cannot really see why. none of the kids were truly good actors and the story was weak too. i cannot say how much they changed from Kstner's original but the script is definitely not a strength of this film. By the way it runs for 110 minutes really long for a children's film. most of these do not even come close to the 100minute mark at least these from Germany. In a couple days I will watch the 1950s version so make sure to check out my review there and see if I deem it more worth watching than this one here. I am fairly certain it will not have these woeful rap music sequences on so many occasions. Probably not even on one. Apart from Lau one or two of the kids actors still have acting careers but most of them went back to normal lives quickly.The best thing about this film was maybe the soundtrack at least the main tune that also plays in the very end. However the kids rapping was just horrible and the other singing parts mostly choir were not too memorable either. The two groups of kids fighting was nothing special and I never felt particularly like cheering for one side. It's a bit of a shame Vilsmaier is not acting anymore either. She had decent talent and screen presence maybe the most from the younger actors here. Initially I thought Sebastian Koch was evil but I was wrong in the end. When he climbed up to the kids he seemed somewhat like a villain. Also I have to say I did not really think the title fits the film well. The Flying Classroom is mentioned so late into the movie that you keep asking yourself for over an hour why is this film named like that. I doubt it gets mentioned equally late in Kstner's novel. Anyway there are many great kids movies from Germany out tight now many of them based on literature. This one is not among them. Not recommended.".

The outcome is quite a disappointment as this is a prime example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The cast is decent Noethen Koch Kling and a very young Frederick Lau he reunited with Ferkic for Die Welle are in here and so is a personal favorite Piet Klocke. His classroom scene with the boy in the garbage bin was probably the funny highlight of the movie. The movie won many awards but I cannot really see why. none of the kids were truly good actors and the story was weak too. i cannot say how much they changed from Kstner's original but the script is definitely not a strength of this film. By the way it runs for 110 minutes really long for a children's film. most of these do not even come close to the 100minute mark at least these from Germany. In a couple days I will watch the 1950s version so make sure to check out my review there and see if I deem it more worth watching than this one here. I am fairly certain it will not have these woeful rap music sequences on so many occasions. Probably not even on one. Apart from Lau one or two of the kids actors still have acting careers but most of them went back to normal lives quickly.The best thing about this film was maybe the soundtrack at least the main tune that also plays in the very end. However the kids rapping was just horrible and the other singing parts mostly choir were not too memorable either. The two groups of kids fighting was nothing special and I never felt particularly like cheering for one side. It's a bit of a shame Vilsmaier is not acting anymore either. She had decent talent and screen presence maybe the most from the younger actors here. Initially I thought Sebastian Koch was evil but I was wrong in the end. When he climbed up to the kids he seemed somewhat like a villain. Also I have to say I did not really think the title fits the film well. The Flying Classroom is mentioned so late into the movie that you keep asking yourself for over an hour why is this film named like that. I doubt it gets mentioned equally late in Kstner's novel. Anyway there are many great kids movies from Germany out tight now many of them based on literature. This one is not among them. Not recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Franois Truffaut and Jacques Doillon who have often worked with children know well one thing making a movie about childhood or adolescence is a quite difficult thing. Here it is Claude Miller's turn to broach the delicate topic of adolescence. The less we can say is that he signed here a sensitive and bitter work that brings out enough strength and emotion to compare with the filmmakers' movies previously quoted.The first indisputable quality that we can put forward is the following one Claude Miller's film is very far from the clichs generally attributed to teenagers. Charlotte isn't a nymphet only a teenage girl who is not a happy person and who's searching for love and understanding. The director succeeds very well in making us share his heroine's profound discontentment and Charlotte Gainsbourg won a welldeserved Oscar for her remarkable performance.Apart from the relevant and convincing description of Charlotte Miller painted a series of characters who are never on the edge of caricature. Lulu is perhaps a naive little girl and the director somewhat made her look ugly by giving her glasses but he does everything to hide her dumb air. Then Charlotte's father is presented as a good man and faced with her daughter's insolence he can contain his anger. One last example Clara's manager is not obsessed with money. With Charlotte Gainsbourg it would be unfair to neglect the rest of the cast. Either the actors are young or old they all have a common point they are all excellent. This only confirm one gift that Claude Miller had already shown in his first movie the harrowing la meilleure faon de marcher 1976 an excellent direction of actors.Besides like in la meilleure faon de marcher 1976 l'effronte 1985 is a perfectly stable movie both funny touching and where Miller skilfully alternates moments of tension and calm and the rare moments of violence are only suggested like the scene when Charlotte hits Jean with his globe.Quite obviously what mainly interested the director in this film is Charlotte's relationship with the most important character of the film Clara Baumann. Their confrontations constitute the keymoments of the movie. Clara is a talented young pianist and Charlotte blindly idolizes her. She is ready to believe everything she says even when Clara confides to her that she would like to become her impresario on tour. It is interesting to note down that when she talks about Clara Claude Miller gently laughs at her naivety. More important through their relationship Miller compared their respective worlds. The music used the song Sar perch ti amo and Mozart reveal the incompatibility of these worlds and the beginning of the sketched friendship but is it really friendship? is eventually bound to fail. To tell this failure Miller proceeds by little touches the manager's telephone that doesn't answer Lulu who creates a scandal during the show. This failure clearly shows Charlotte's disillusion but it doesn't stop the movie to end on a positive tone when we see the heroine take care of Lulu she seems to have understood that her place is among her family.The movie also contains another strong point the relationship between Jean and Charlotte where Miller favors the progressive rise of tension. For this he uses the same method as Charlotte's failure with Clara he proceeds by little touches the movie they watch at the cinema is the Exorcist 1973 and the tension gradually grows and explodes when they are in Jean's hotel room.I must admit that I don't know enough Claude Miller's work. I only saw la meilleure faon de marcher 1976 la petite voleuse 1988 and this one l'effronte 1985 but these three films were sufficient to make me a very good impression of this filmmaker and I am long to discover his other opus.".

Common points  The main character is a teenage girl she's bored and a bit lonely it's the summer and she watches other people having fun. She hangs out with a little neighbor in the film or her cousin in the book both younger than her.  She has no mother. She is raised by her father and by a nannyhelper.  At one point she watches older teenagers having fun in a dancing club and feels a bit jealous though she won't admit it.  To feel grownup she uses perfume.  At one point she follows an older guy into a hotel and when she understands that he wants to sleep with her she hits him on the head with a glass globe in the film or a glass pitcher in the book escapesand then asks her dad If you hit someone on the head with something very heavy made of glass do you think it could kill him? At some another point she says the world is very sudden in the book and in French in the film she says le monde est brusque same meaning that was also the word used in the French translation of the novel. That's too much to be a coincidence isn't it?  And finally both characters feel that they are the member to no club and that they are different because they don't feel connected to anyone...".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS   SPOILERS Claude Miller's from the heart film L'Effrontee is a masterpiece of French film making.SPOILERS AHEAD!!This is the simple story of Charlotte played with effortless ease and considerable verve by Charlotte Gainsbourg a girl of thirteen or fourteen who is unhappy with her lot. The school holidays are approaching and she is not going away for a month  not until August. She has nothing to do. She hates her peer group so doesn't hang with them. She hates the fact that no one at home takes her seriously. Her only friend is Lulu Julie Glenn a younger girl with a weak disposition constantly taking medication to keep her out of hospital and constantly getting under Charlotte's feet.Charlotte becomes jealous of her brother who is going away on holiday and Lulu and the housemaid Leone Bernadette Lafont bear the brunt of this.There are however two new people in Charlotte's life.On one of the last days of school she sees a video of Clara Bauman Clothilde Baudon a child prodigy. On the video Clara is playing Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Charlotte finds out that she and Clara are the same age and that Clara is coming to town to play a concert.It is while watching the video that we see where Charlotte wants to be.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS   SPOILERS   SPOILERS Claude Miller's from the heart film L'Effrontee is a masterpiece of French film making.SPOILERS AHEAD!!This is the simple story of Charlotte played with effortless ease and considerable verve by Charlotte Gainsbourg a girl of thirteen or fourteen who is unhappy with her lot. The school holidays are approaching and she is not going away for a month  not until August. She has nothing to do. She hates her peer group so doesn't hang with them. She hates the fact that no one at home takes her seriously. Her only friend is Lulu Julie Glenn a younger girl with a weak disposition constantly taking medication to keep her out of hospital and constantly getting under Charlotte's feet.Charlotte becomes jealous of her brother who is going away on holiday and Lulu and the housemaid Leone Bernadette Lafont bear the brunt of this.There are however two new people in Charlotte's life.On one of the last days of school she sees a video of Clara Bauman Clothilde Baudon a child prodigy. On the video Clara is playing Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Charlotte finds out that she and Clara are the same age and that Clara is coming to town to play a concert.It is while watching the video that we see where Charlotte wants to be. We see her inherent understanding of the music and her love for it in the expression on her face. It is also possible that the love and desire reflected on her face is for the girl.As the holidays get under way we see Charlotte out walking with Lulu.

	schema:reviewBody "If there's something European filmmakers excel at it's making good honest movies about being young. In comparison American efforts in this genre are clumsy artificial sanitized heavyhanded overly safe and moralizingly preachy to a nauseating degree. In short American films about youth rush to hit the viewer over the head with a hollow message and throw authenticity frankness the life of the soul and the life of the body into the dumpster. It's as if the characters were intended merely as mouthpieces for ideas or agendas to placate various pressure groups.L'effrontee however portrays a vivid sense of place alive with real breathing people. Raoul Billery is excellent as the widower father a plain strong toolmaker but it is the remarkable Charlotte Gainsbourg who carries the film. She is fabulous as the 1314 year old girl starting her journey to womanhood without her mother. She articulates the awkwardness beauty and petulance of this age perfectly as well as the first selfconscious inklings of her own emerging sex appeal. The strength here is that nothing of real life is artificially filtered out The movie allows the girl to have the brain the body and the emotions to live fully and includes a poignant attraction to a beautiful piano prodigy and the dubious attentions of a significantly older socially inept? male. Charlotte Gainsbourg had me miffed at her character and cheering for her at the same time. My heart really went out to her. And man does she have a trying summer! The only negative in L'effrontee is an irritating song that keeps cropping up  sounds like a French attempt to imitate Abba.The filmmakers did an excellent job of capturing the look and feel of a sweltering summer. After watching this film I'd like to see more films made by Claude Miller. And judging from this superlative early performance I'm eager to see many other films starring Charlotte Gainsbourg.Once you see this movie you'll cringe when you try to go back to the shallow phoniness of John Hughes Molly Ringwald or Matthew Broderick. Miss Gainsbourg and L'effrontee are the real thing  the cream of the crop.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are movies such as this and many others that sometimes don't appeal to people do to the slowness of it all. Nonetheless I was surprised to see the low rating that it received. The Yellow Handkerchief tells the touching story of three broken individuals each with their own troubled past and lingering issues who share one thing in common the need to escape. The entire plot is centred around a long car journey in which Martine Kristen Stewart and Gordy Eddie Redmayneslowly unravvel the mystery of Brett Hanson Willian Hurt an unhappy man recently released from his sentence in prison. The movie is an Indie movie and it does appear to be rather slow. The script isn't as chatty or invasive as the blockbuster movies we're used to and there is a lot of scenery. But regardless the theme of the movie is easy for people to relate to. You don't have to be a convict or an abandoned child to understand it the entire story is about making mistakes. And eventually the message becomes clearer that the people who forgive you and offer you a second chance are those who love you the most. There are so many different ways to see this movie that I will point out that that's only my interpretation. I highly recommend this movie but only if you're in the mood for a more symbolic movie rather than fast paced action packed thrillers..".

	schema:headline " Three Strangers Take a Ride";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about three oddlymatched people on a journey. They are strangers to each other and they are quite strange. The film derives a lot of its early edge from the concern we have for the young girl who is in the company of two potentially dangerous and unstable men. Yellow Handkerchief opens in a cold prison where William Hurt's character says farewell to his fellow inmates. He is tough hardened and taciturn a man well past middle age. As with any convict you want to know what his crime was. He takes a bus to a small Louisiana town. There you get a visual suggestion that his crimes may have been sexual as the camera shows a gathering of young people outside a restaurant. He drinks his first beer at this diner as we eavesdrop on the teens' conversations. We wonder if he is there to find prey or these young people are there by happenstance.Hurt's flashbacks are many and frequent and they begin in this dining room as he contemplates his first taste of beer in the first afternoon of his freedom.A pretty 15yearold girl named Martine is receiving much attention from two boys her age. Martine is played by 18yearold Kirsten Stewart who in her short life has appeared in a dozen films and collected half a dozen acting awards. We overhear Martine talking with the more handsome boy. She had been with him the night before and we hear bits of conversation which sound like the boy may have taken advantage of her. Martine is on her cellphone with her father with whom we learn she has a stormy relationship. He is a thousand miles away on business and she lies to him about where she is.A goofylooking boy named Gordy seems to be in constant motion. Gordy is smitten by Martine's charms and he appears to have no chance with her. He says odd things and speaks inappropriately. He is in and out of the dining room as Hurt sips his beer enjoying freedom. The goofy kid wants to buy throwaway cameras with expired dates. He claims he is native American but he looks Anglo. He is a bit weird. Hurt would later explain Gordy's behavior to Martine He is young for his age. Gordy is played by Eddy Redmayne who looks much younger than his 26 years. A fine British actor who appeared in The Other Bolyn Girl Elizabeth The Golden Age and The Good Shepherd plays a misfit with serious emotional problems in this movie.The goofyboy the pretty girl and the excon leave this small Louisiana town in Gordy's old convertible. Their destination is uncertain except that they head south. It was bad judgment in the extreme for Martine to go away with the two men. A romantic girl she is strangely attracted to the excon who is three or four times her age. The journey proceeds in serendipitous and unpredictable ways. Along the way layers of our first impressions peel away as these three reveal much about themselves.Critics have said that American films are about objects like cars guns houses airplanes and ships while European films are about people and relationships. In this povertysaturated section of Louisiana the only thing to see is the human interaction. Tension pulls us into this film because what we know about these characters makes us apprehensive. We are further drawn in by curiosity we want to find out who these strangers are and why they are together at all. An odd coupling not one is much like the other. As the drama unfolds we learn more about each one and find reasons to like and admire them. This is the kind of film that actors crave they can strut their stuff and show their chops. William Hurtone of America's finest actors does not disappoint. The Oscarwinner's fellow travelers are excellent. Maria Bello has a supporting role which comes through Hurt's flashbacks. She plays another quirky hard woman with a soft core. This film is one of those fine dramas which was a risk for the producers. It was too good not to make but it is a film that could tank at the box office because it does not feature car chases and gratuitous explosions. This is drama for intelligent people which probably deserves Oscar nominations but it could pass under the radar of film audiences and critics. Each year Hollywood sends us some rare gems that we must look to find. Great films go unnoticed and are unfairly ignored. A short list would include Antwone Fisher My First Mister Life As A House What We Lost in the Fire and Finding Forester  all deserving Oscar consideration in several categories but lost in the shuffle at the end of the season. This might end up on the list of great films you never saw if you don't go see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm always a little apprehensive about excon redemption films. They are generally predictable and the emotional puppeteering is all too easy and familiar. And I must acknowledge that in The Yellow Handkerchief there is more than a little of all that. But I don't think that's at the core of the movie. Rather this is a story about three individuals all lost and lonely led by fate into a beatup convertible and finding themselves unexpectedly on a little road trip in postKatrina rural Louisiana.Awardwinning German producer Arthur Cohn put together this project and Indian director Udayan Prasad made some great casting calls. William Hurt is at the center as Brett a justreleased excon battling his demons which are gradually revealed throughout the movie and tenuously reentering the outside world. It's a role that comes naturally to Hurt more like his classics The Big Chill The Doctor and The Accidental Tourist than his arresting departure in The History of Violence. The inescapably sexy Maria Bello shows up mostly in flashbacks as the love of his preprison life. Eddy Redmayne Gordy and Kristen Stewart Matine steal the show as the youngsters who meet in a store and find themselves moments later asking Brett to make them an unlikely threesome.Prasad does a great job of sharing with the audience the unadorned emotions at play as these three feel each other out and gradually get comfortable together. There is natural tension as Brett is older obviously hardened and something of mystery and even more so when they find out he is an excon. But also anger fear and disgust before the softening. The strengths and weaknesses of each character are slowly exposed as their journey leads them in search of acceptance hope and love. And talented cinematographer Chris Berges brings an eerie sadness to the Louisiana bayou country not nearly recovered from the ravages of Katrina.The Yellow Handkerchief may move too slowly for broad public acceptance. But the story never lagged holding the audience throughout and rewarding them at the end. One might accuse the ending of being a little hackneyed and one would be right but that hardly dulls the shine of a movie that leaves you feeling positive and optimistic.Sundance Moment Prasad Cohn Hurt Bello Redmayne and Stewart were all at the premiere. Best line was from Cohn who said some people told him this was a little movie. There are no little movies or big movies he repeated twice. Sundance philosophy in a nutshell.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tale of two love storiesone which needs to be rekindledwhile the other is sorely in need of some love potion to ignite the sparks. This is also a story about three drifters who are alienated from their own social circles. They say you can learn a lot about someone from the first impressions that they make. This was especially evident for the trio of lead characters. For Brett his first scene showed him being released from Angola State Prison with sad droopy eyes and lonely where none of his family or friends are there to greet him unlike the other prisoners who have loved ones running into their arms upon their release from prison. For Gordy in his first scene he would get no respect from any of the patrons of the convenience store which he was hanging out at. And finally for 15yearold Martine we see her being dumped by her boyfriend a relationship which could be better described as a onenight stand as he explained to her that his drunkenness obscured his better judgment.So thus begins their journey to the Big Easy in Gordy's decades old blue Ford LTD convertible. While this turned out to be a road movie thankfully it was much more than that. While the landscape depicted by cinematographer Chris Menges was impressive and atmospheric this roadie was without question character driven. While William Hurt is usually overthetop in most of his previous roles he was as lowkey as you can get in this indie. To put it succinctly Hurt gloriously portrayed hurt in The Yellow Handkerchief. His soft spoken nature spoke more loudly than most of his previous highstrung roles.Those who have followed the work of Kristen Stewart's nonTwilight roles will perhaps agree that she is a brutally honest actress with angst oozing out of her pores as well as having intensity to spare. Kristen has also proved that she belongs on screen with middleaged Hollywood heavyweights such as Robert De Niro James Gandlofini and in this case William Hurt. Kristen's definitely a cutie and her Southern drawl made her that much more adorable. Yes Eddie Redmayne displayed virtually every annoying trait imaginable yet that is exactly what the script dictated. And of course Maria Bello was her usual beautiful and sensuous self.What I found especially intriguing about this film is that I wasn't really sure if Brett was running away from something running towards something running in circles or simply running in place like he was doing for the past 6 years for obvious reasons. It wasn't until Brett's flashbacks revealed the details concerning his manslaughter chargesproving that this was just an accident involving a good Samaritan who interceded while Brett and May argued outside a bar. It turned out in the heat of passion Brett shoved this man as he tried to get between he and his wife. As this man falls backward he falls and hits his head on a fire hydrant causing him to die on the spot. While Martine and Gordy joked about Brett being an axe murderer they were both certain he was innocent. In fact even after Brett revealed this incident they continued to look up to Brett as a father figure. Although Brett was the one who demanded the divorce we would also learn of his undying love for May as the journey reached fullcircle in the movie as well as in my mind. Tears began to well up in my eyes as Brett revealed to Martine and Gordy exactly what he wrote on the postcard which he sent to May. He spilled out his guts by writing that if May wants him back she would put up the yellow sail on her sailboat reminiscent of the song Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree. While at first he was hesitant to go to May's house Martine convinces him to go telling him it's not about being selfish but rather about being weak. Gordy interjected that it would be a waste of gasoline if they went all this way only to turn back now especially if you were to consider he was driving a gas guzzler coupled with the rising petroleum prices during postHurricane Katrina New Orleans. When the trio finally gets to the location of Brett's former place of residence they discover a new occupant now resides there. I could feel Brett's heart break as they drove off. But then like a bolt out of the blue Martine spots onehundred or so small yellow flags and handkerchiefs hanging on some clotheslines which were draped over a sailboat. Martine then tells Gordy to back up and drive towards that sailboat. Sure enough that's May's sailboat as she walks towards Brett. They are happy to see each other and embrace. Martine and Gordy are touched by this incident and cuddle up as well. Despite Gordy's lack of confidence and uneasiness around peopleespecially beautiful young women who like to do ballerina pirouettesMartine is drawn to his compassion towards animals. In one scene while driving his car Gordy hits a deer and after doing so jumps out of the car to offer assistance. In another scene he describes to Martine a story where he freed a 10 million purebred racehorse from a stable. Yes Gordy is scrawny naive and messed up. Yet the more Martine gets to know Gordy the more deeply she falls in love with him. I can't say enough about this heartfelt story of love loss and second chances. The fleshed out performances by the lead actors brought this story to life.".

	onyx:emotionText "A tale of two love storiesone which needs to be rekindledwhile the other is sorely in need of some love potion to ignite the sparks. This is also a story about three drifters who are alienated from their own social circles. They say you can learn a lot about someone from the first impressions that they make. This was especially evident for the trio of lead characters. For Brett his first scene showed him being released from Angola State Prison with sad droopy eyes and lonely where none of his family or friends are there to greet him unlike the other prisoners who have loved ones running into their arms upon their release from prison. For Gordy in his first scene he would get no respect from any of the patrons of the convenience store which he was hanging out at. And finally for 15yearold Martine we see her being dumped by her boyfriend a relationship which could be better described as a onenight stand as he explained to her that his drunkenness obscured his better judgment.So thus begins their journey to the Big Easy in Gordy's decades old blue Ford LTD convertible. While this turned out to be a road movie thankfully it was much more than that.

	schema:reviewBody "THE YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF is a very quiet small film that depends on dialogue rather than action. It began as a short story by Pete Hamill and was adapted for the screen by Erin Dignam. As directed with quiet intensity by Indian director Udayan Prasad the film is more an exploration of isolated individuals who for different reasons do not fit into society and how four of those individuals discover themselves through their interaction with each other. Brett Hanson William Hurt is discharged form prison where he has served six years for manslaughter he has a history of runins with the law and seems to face his release with a certain degree of fear of the outside world. He meets two youngsters  the lonely Martine Kristen Stewart who has only a father and an absent one at that and Gordy Eddie Redmayne a Native American asocial misfit itinerant  and because of a sever rain storm the three set out in Gordy's car to find shelter. They stay in motels and gradually each characters past unfolds the running development is Brett's history of coming close to a significant relationship with a fearful woman named May Maria Bello whose fear of relationships was temporarily resolved with her romance with Brett  all of this history is played through flashback scenes when Brett was working oil rigs in New Orleans. Martine and Gordy are fascinated and a bit fearful of Brett as an excon but they both connect with Brett's essentially good spirit and insist that he stay with them and allow the bonding youngsters t help him recover the one love he had. Two generations of lost people collide then bond and learn from each other. There is considerable emotional energy in this somewhat laconic film with as much being discovered by silences as with dialogue. William Hurt offers a profoundly understated performance Stewart and Redmayne provide the perfect nave foil for his reconnection with the world outside prison walls  both the physical prison he has just left and the mental prison in which he has been hiding all his life. Maria Bello is convincing as the strong woman who fears vulnerability while desperately in need of being loved. This is a film that may not have made it in theaters but is probably best viewed in the intimacy of the home via DVD. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "83 year old Arthur Cohn who is a five time Oscar winner with films dating back to 1961 was the producer of this film and guest at our screening. He noted that for many of his great movies including The Garden of the FinziContinis it was often difficult to get a distributor and the films did not achieve box office success until they won the Oscar. In the case of this current film he told us that be thought that the reason he had trouble getting a distribution finally picked up by Samuel Goldwyn Films was because this movie does not have sex or any significant violence which many people believe are necessary for a movie to achieve box office success. This film is a road movie which follows Brett played William Hurt as he is released from prison after serving 6 years and hitches a ride with a 15 year old girl played by Kristen Stewart of Vampire movie fame and slightly older teenage guy played by Eddie Redmayne. Both young people have their own histories of feeling unloved and would like to get away from their unhappy lives. Brett's history unfolds through a series of short flashbacks as they travel in the south towards New Orleans. He had a troubled youth and hadn't made much of his life. He thought perhaps things were changing around when he met May played by Maria Bello but his view of himself as a flawed person along with some particular circumstances caused him to destroy this relationship and end up in jail. As the three travelers who were seemingly going nowhere in their lives get to understand each other and grow there is a sense of redemption. You see these three misfits and unlikely companions travel in a battered old convertible through Louisiana on their way to New Orleans which is beautifully photographed by award winning Director of Photography Chris Menges. The energy and eternal hope that producer Cohn put into this project which comes to the to the screen three years after it was filmed makes us want to root for the this movie to be successful just as we find ourselves also rooting for the characters to make it in their lives.

Unbeknownst to either of them their journey through past and present will begin to weave a fabric that gives way to the realization that all are very similar in their need for love and belonging. As Martine Kristen Stewart Gordy Eddy Redmayne and Brett William Hurt set out on an unplanned road trip through Louisiana in order to scatter their individual demons along the way the unexpected happens. They get to know one another through reflection and observation and Brett's deep dark past life with May Maria Bello begins to surface and spill over into the present. As a result the scarred and rough layers of these three characters begin to peel away like sandstones washed in the ocean. What we are left with is three individuals who were worlds apart on the surface and through circumstance and chance realize that they are not really that different. So they band together in order to face their pasts head on and pick up the pieces of their broken lives. The Performances  Kristen Stewart plays Martine a whimsical teenager who clearly has both judgment and abandonment issues due to her less than present father. Kristen Oh that lovely face pulls you in from the first sighting! You immediately long to know Martine's story what brought her to this moment and she has not even said a word! It's all in her facial expressions and body language. Sure anyone could play a 15 yearold with issues but the difference is Kristen makes you believe in Martine. You or I could know this girl! We could be this girl. Kristen breathed life into an otherwise less than noteworthy character! The mark of a good actress! Somewhere I read that her accent was poor in the film! Well there are many accents that arise out of Louisiana and believe me every parish accent is different  honestly you can't even understand some because the accent is so strong so I thought she did a fair job with it. Eddy Redmayne Gordy is very convincing as an awkward young man whose mind has not caught up with his age. I read somewhere that his role is slightly reminiscent of Forest Gump and I would have to agree. His motto Live!William Hurt Brett well what can I say he delivers as usual. His humble demeanor and genuine care for these two young people satisfies the part of him that longs for what he has lost and at the same time provides both Martine and Gordy's character with a present parental figure that they both desperately cleve to. But there is a dark side to his character and William plays them both well.Maria Bello May is a mere memory throughout the film. But don't be fooled! Maria's performance keeps her at the forefront of your psyche.My only qualms with the movie are that I wish the writersdirectors would have taken the time to delve deeper into the characters of Martine and Gordy! I believe their characters deserved that courtesy! I will leave it at that to avoid spoiling the movie particulars any further. In addition I would have liked to see Brett's climatic reveal be a little less forced! It was shoved down our throats and left us hanging Gasp I needed more details! I'm a details girl JBottom line I loved this film! Every emotional cord that could have been struck was Happiness sadness anger triumph hope discovery and new beginnings! A must see!".

Low key sensitive and gentle the film watches as exconvict Bretty Hanson William Hurt embarks on an impromptu roadtrip with two troubled teens. The trio travel across postHurricane Katrina Louisiana hoping to locate Hanson's longlost love. If she wants to reconcile with him she'll tie yellow handkerchiefs on her moored boat as a signal. If not Hanson's to keep moving on.The film uses flashbacks to delve into Hanson's past life. Through these we learn why he was incarcerated and why he and his lover played by Maria Bello split. The couple's relationship is mirrored to that of the film's two teenagers Kristen Stewart and Eddie Redmayne both of whom are social outcasts alienated and looking for acceptance. The film's romance between Stewart and Redmayne is rushed and unconvincing. Prasad would have done better to keep things platonic.Bello and Hurt make up for this though with a couple strong performances. Hurt imbues his character with a quiet suffering a sense of perpetual tiredness whilst Bello's feisty fiery but deeply scarred. Elsewhere the film abounds with strong quiet moments. Consider how when released from his prison cell Hurt says goodbye to fellow inmates how he later savours his first beer in years and how a nearworldless scene introduces him to Kristen Stewart's young character. Only in Handkerchief's final act does director Udayan Prasad abandon nuance. The rest of the film plays like a well filmed short story.No surprise then that the film's story was based on a famous folktale. This tale was then turned into a short story by Pete Hamill and also a famous nowclassic song called Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree sung by Dawn and Tony Orlando.8.510  Worth two viewings.

	schema:reviewBody "Like staring at the ocean horizon from a desert island or being rocked to sleep in your mother's arms The Yellow Handkerchief is a warm enchanting and entrancing experience. With a story built on the calm and measured magnetism of William Hurt illuminated with youthful flashes of spirit by Kristen Stewart and Eddie Redmayne and sheltered under the beautiful pain of Maria Bello this film invites you in from the cold and lets you nestle in its relaxed tenderness. I'm not much for slow sentimental tales of lost love and teenage angst but this movie has made be reconsider that. If anyone ever tells me a motion picture is like The Yellow Handkerchief I'm definitely going to give it a look.Brett William Hurt is a grownass man who just got out of prison. There's no one to greet him in freedom so he starts walking south. At a diner he meets Martine Kristen Stewart and Gordy Eddie Redmayne. One is desperately looking in others for what she can't find in her own father and the other is an awkward bundle of nerves who thinks he's Jack Kerouac but is mostly just whack. Gordy does have a convertible and the three start off on a little trip across the river and through storm and scuffle and keep on driving until their stories spill out of them especially the woman that Brett's bound for even though he's not sure if she'll welcome him or if he deserves it.Hurt's character is as much at the heart of this film as any I've seen as the worldweary Brett's journey with these two emotionally exposed kids is interposed with his memories of May Maria Bello the damaged woman he fell in love with at the sight of her soulful face. The two tales wonderfully compliment each other as Brett is the one drawn irresistibly to May while it is Martine and Gordy who find themselves caught up in his gravitational pull. Hurt gives an awardworthy performance that is all the more notable for how he never overpowers his younger costars. Don't get me wrong. Stewart and Redmayne are marvelous in their own right but it would have been so easy for Hurt to dominate the screen instead of letting Brett be merely the center of it. No one would have objected yet that ultimately would have sucked the melodic ease out of the movie and robbed it of its human depth.Kristen Stewart also deserves a lot of praise because her role is written quite obviously. She's playing a wounded girl who's anguish is visible to anyone who looks at her something that's not all that easy to pull off without overshooting or underplaying the affect. Redmayne's part is more overtly colorful and obtuse but it comes off a little bit like shtick. Stewart feels like a living breathing confounding teenage girl.I also want to single out director Udayan Prasad for praise. His narrative and visual confidence is second only to Hurt's acting in making The Yellow Handkerchief work. This story is quiet and slow and the temptation to speed it up or do something on screen visually out of fear of losing the audience's attention had to be a difficult beast to battle. Prasad let's things unfold in their own due course and perfectly balances the trio in the convertible with the flashbacks to May. This is the sort of direction where you can't easily notice what's being done which I find much more appealing and proficient than films where the director is practically waving at you from the screen.The Yellow Handkerchief is a darling production which is an adjective I don't think I've never used before or even appreciated what it really meant before now. Why it was not a much bigger deal when it came out is a mystery to me. Maybe Stewart's inclusion will eventually attract some Twihard attention to this little gem. Something good ought to come out of those sparkly vampire flicks.".

All three are lost and looking for someone to care.Ever notice that many of the movies out today have the main character as coming out of prison? It does open up all kinds of possibilities. Well that is what we have here. I would say there could have been some uncomfortable moments with these three but not to worry. It's all good. And this is Brett's story and the kids get him to reveal it as they trek to New Orleans and what a story it is. All throughout I kept an eye and an ear to anything that would refer to a Yellow Handkerchief. I kept asking why in the world would someone title this as that and never mention or show anything close? Okay to be fair there was a clue May Bello did have a yellow sail on her boat. HA ! Hardly a handkerchief. I don't think I have ever seen a yellow sail on a boat. Until now. The acting by all three was exceptional. Hurt's understated role spoke volumes and carried the movie. Stewart surprised me and I believe she can run with the big dogs Yeah it's hard to let it go. Redmayne's character while as obnoxious and annoying as the script called for actually grew before our eyes. Redmayne showed he has range. And Bello was sexy beautiful and perfect as Brett's love interest. A very touching and honest love story. You might want to have a box of Kleenex within easy reach near the end of this movie. I'm just saying. But this is 2010 and the movie is listed as 2008. What happened? Why wasn't it out sooner? We'll never know.Violence Yes but mild. Sex No. Nudity No. There is a shower scene but nothing is shown. Language Yes one Fbomb was heard and you could almost miss it.".

It seems that he is just another man on the road with two kids but he later unravels to be someone else a husband and exprisoner. The actor contains is almost like your flower. It starts out as a plain seed and it blooms or something extraordinary. Although Maria Bello is not present for most of the film she is able to make her character a symbol an object that is bigger. My only complaints are the use of flashbacks and Kristen Stewart's performance. The flashbacks were amazing but they were sort of confusing by the way they are used. Stewart's character Martine brought light and innocence but the character instead was left dull. However she is able to make most of the darker moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Made after THE DAMNED but before 1900 this operaticstyle melodrama about the industrial revolution in Lodz ca. 1895 is far better than either. Like the other two films it takes an extreme situation in history and makes it more extreme piling on the excess. Two examples here a garden party that's like a Roman orgy with naked women tigers in cages etc. and a scene where a worker grapples with his boss and they fall into a giant machine which instantly spews out their bodies as huge chunks of raw meat. But whereas Visconti and particularly Bertolucci ultimately drown under their excesses Wajda maintains total control over his narrative. The characters and their singleminded mission hold the film tightly together and the visual excesses seem like an inevitable part of the narrative not sideshow setpieces. The film is incredibly visceral the thrill of making a killing on the financial market the inhuman noise of the factories the excitement of undercurrents of rumors among patrons at the opera. Most of all there's the brilliant use of relentless machinelike music throughout that keeps up the unremitting unflagging pace. The film has a power which stays with you long after you've left the theatre! And it's a virtuoso recreation of a time and place. It must have been extremely costly to make. The subject certainly seems safe for an East Europeanbloc filmmakerif ever capitalists were villains it must have been at that time and place. But in fact Wajda was making a politically dangerous statement. The final scene of workers being shot at the order of the owners was an explicit comment on workers being shot in communist Poland a few years before the film was made. This is a great film by one of the greatest filmmakers of the twentieth century!".

The drama wit and ferocity of the bulk of the film build so so effectively to its deafening crescendo the music the setting the actors and the camerawork complementing and intertwining with each other in a way quite possibly unmatched in anything else I've seen. And another great think about it is its shameless paradoxically both subtle and explicit POLITICAL content. This is Wajda's demonstration that however much he may be portrayed as a hero of Poland's rebellion against its socialist regime he is at the same time sympathetic to the cause which drove Marxism and hostile to the vulgarities of the interaction of man and money the dehumanising reifying assault with which rampant capitalism engages with the human psyche. If this is propaganda then it is a heartfelt stunningly effective damasking of the myth with which we all live today.By the way I've only seen the rereleased version shorter than the original. Should i also see the longer 1974 version? I think the freshness and crispness of the cinematography in the more recent version might have added to the film.".

	schema:headline " Fast Vivid History and Passion";
	schema:reviewBody "The Promised Land is a visual feast fastpaced and every bit as ruthless as the cutthroat characters it depicts. The topic  the Industrial Revolution and the characters  immoral greedy monsters  are ugly and mean but Wajda's filmmaking is so virtuosic you watch just for the sheer craft splendor and runaway train of a plot. I find it hard to sit through movies where there are no sympathetic main characters and no possibility of a happy ending but The Promised Land is addictively watchable. There's an orgy a tiger several mutilated bodies fires riots history and Wojciech Kilar's driving awardwinning score.Anyone interested in the Industrial Revolution should see this movie. Fans of Dickens' Oliver Twist and Gaskell's North and South really must see it. I wish I could require my students to watch it. Wajda was determined to get every detail correct. In the DVD's extra features an assistant director discusses a scene of indigent paupers receiving charity food. Wajda's team discovered that the indigent were fed from long metal tables with bowls built right into them. They rebuilt such a table just for this scene lasting a few minutes. They had special wooden spoons made and then weathered them by soaking them in oil. The paupers' rags were similarly weathered. There is a lengthy scene where Anna Anna Nehrebecka a country aristocrat travels to the city. The camera follows Anna and lays out Lodz before her in all its gritty noxious detail smoking chimneys workers' funerals fighting men the Jewish quarter. The scene looks like documentary footage of a late nineteenthcentury industrial city.The Promised Land also takes the viewer into the mansions of Lodz almost ridiculous in their sumptuousness plunked down in so much filth squalor and despair. Ornate winding staircases giltencrusted columns and ceiling murals lure on industrialists willing to wring every last penny from their desperate employees.The Promised Land depicts Lodz's emergence as a textile manufacturing hub. Three friends one a Polish aristocrat one a Jew and one a German strive to build their own factory. They have few resources and must do dirty things to make their dreams of unlimited wealth a reality. Blond Karol Daniel Olbrychski has the face of a cherub and the soul of a serial killer. His entire being is omnivorous greed. Moryc Wojciech Pszoniak cheats another Jew to get his stake. After doing so he practically collapses from the strain and then breaks the fourth wall winking at the audience. He's just an actor playing a part he reminds us as they all are playing any part they want to get their highest ideal cash.The film also depicts workers and their plight. A dewy young mill hand is lured into prostitution. Others are consumed by the machines they work. Scenes of mutilated flesh are quite graphic and yet not sensationalistic. This is the price poor people pay for bread the film shows us. The camera does not linger. It keeps moving. Just like Lodz just like men chasing cash just like history.There are a few characters who aren't utterly despicable. They appear make small squeaks of decency selfrespect and dignity and are crushed by the inevitable. There is a stunning scene that is quite different from anything else in the film. The film moves quickly and purposefully but in this scene men meet in a small room to play classical music. The scene is not at all essential to the plot. It moves with atypical languor. The scene seems to say Yes people in Lodz had souls. That reminder makes the surrounding greedinduced frenzy all the more disturbing.Some viewers protest The Promised Land as an antiSemitic film because of unpleasant Jewish characters. Indeed there are unpleasant Jewish characters in the film. Virtually every character in the film is unpleasant  even the pretty innocent child lured into prostitution. The film does not allow you to pity her but implies that she was complicit in her own downfall. Further every character is unpleasant in an ethnically gender and socioeconomicclasscoded way. That is the Polish peasants are unpleasant in a stereotypical way associated with peasants the one priest is unpleasant in a way associated with priests. The men are bad men the women are bad women. The priest is on screen for minutes only but he leers at a pretty factory hand. Anna has a big heart but she is ineffectual and not smart enough to see through Karol. Other women are whores or idiots. The Polish aristocrat aggressively sells out every high ideal his ancestors held dear. He desecrates an image of Poland's icon the Black Madonna of Czestochowa. The Germans are either sadistic and autocratic or lumpen and dull. The Polish peasant who manages to rise above his station is an insufferable loudmouthed boor. This film isn't antiSemitic it is brutally misanthropic. It depicts people at their worst.Again it is Wajda's virtuosic filmmaking that makes all this endurable. At a key moment a rock flies through a window. That rock means much  the inevitable march of history that has brought industrialists high and might also bring them very very low. Any other filmmaker would probably have handled the rock through a window as a crashing sound followed by a thud. Wajda films this scene with such skill and poetry that the rock becomes a character in the film. It demands and gets the viewer's full attention. Subsequent action is filmed from the rock's point of view. Poland is a small distant and much contested country. It's filmmaking like that that amply earned Wajda his honorary Academy Award.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Promised Land is a visual feast fastpaced and every bit as ruthless as the cutthroat characters it depicts. The topic  the Industrial Revolution and the characters  immoral greedy monsters  are ugly and mean but Wajda's filmmaking is so virtuosic you watch just for the sheer craft splendor and runaway train of a plot. I find it hard to sit through movies where there are no sympathetic main characters and no possibility of a happy ending but The Promised Land is addictively watchable. There's an orgy a tiger several mutilated bodies fires riots history and Wojciech Kilar's driving awardwinning score.Anyone interested in the Industrial Revolution should see this movie. Fans of Dickens' Oliver Twist and Gaskell's North and South really must see it. I wish I could require my students to watch it. Wajda was determined to get every detail correct. In the DVD's extra features an assistant director discusses a scene of indigent paupers receiving charity food. Wajda's team discovered that the indigent were fed from long metal tables with bowls built right into them. They rebuilt such a table just for this scene lasting a few minutes. They had special wooden spoons made and then weathered them by soaking them in oil. The paupers' rags were similarly weathered. There is a lengthy scene where Anna Anna Nehrebecka a country aristocrat travels to the city. The camera follows Anna and lays out Lodz before her in all its gritty noxious detail smoking chimneys workers' funerals fighting men the Jewish quarter. The scene looks like documentary footage of a late nineteenthcentury industrial city.The Promised Land also takes the viewer into the mansions of Lodz almost ridiculous in their sumptuousness plunked down in so much filth squalor and despair. Ornate winding staircases giltencrusted columns and ceiling murals lure on industrialists willing to wring every last penny from their desperate employees.The Promised Land depicts Lodz's emergence as a textile manufacturing hub. Three friends one a Polish aristocrat one a Jew and one a German strive to build their own factory. They have few resources and must do dirty things to make their dreams of unlimited wealth a reality. Blond Karol Daniel Olbrychski has the face of a cherub and the soul of a serial killer. His entire being is omnivorous greed. Moryc Wojciech Pszoniak cheats another Jew to get his stake. After doing so he practically collapses from the strain and then breaks the fourth wall winking at the audience. He's just an actor playing a part he reminds us as they all are playing any part they want to get their highest ideal cash.The film also depicts workers and their plight. A dewy young mill hand is lured into prostitution. Others are consumed by the machines they work. Scenes of mutilated flesh are quite graphic and yet not sensationalistic. This is the price poor people pay for bread the film shows us. The camera does not linger. It keeps moving. Just like Lodz just like men chasing cash just like history.There are a few characters who aren't utterly despicable. They appear make small squeaks of decency selfrespect and dignity and are crushed by the inevitable. There is a stunning scene that is quite different from anything else in the film. The film moves quickly and purposefully but in this scene men meet in a small room to play classical music. The scene is not at all essential to the plot. It moves with atypical languor. The scene seems to say Yes people in Lodz had souls. That reminder makes the surrounding greedinduced frenzy all the more disturbing.Some viewers protest The Promised Land as an antiSemitic film because of unpleasant Jewish characters.

Lodz at the time was a center of textile production nicknamed The Promised Land. Director Wajda wastes no time in hitting you over the head with the basic theme which is the total contrast between the industrial workers and the textile factory owners. The main images we get of the workers is their crowding to get into work at the factories ala scenes from Metropolis and working at their tedious work stations. The main focus of the film is on the factory owners and wannabes and in particular on three friends who are wanting to build a factoryone of the friends is German another is a Polish aristocrat and the third is a Jew of a nationality that I never determined.This is a complicated story of epic sweep featuring a large cast. Trying to keep track of all the characters was a challenge for me particularly without having any historical background to rely on. Some of the financial wheeling and dealing went over my head. As is the case whenever large amounts of money and power are at stake there was a lot of backstage jockeying going oncompanies trying to poach executives from each other secret coalitions factories burned to gain competitive advantage or for insurance monies coded messages decrypted and so forth. To complicate matters there were national and personal frictions with Germans insulting Poles Poles insulting Germans and Jews being unliked for their success. Additionally there were fissures within families where the pursuit of money caused people to behave in a manner in opposition to longstanding traditions of honor and integrity. At one point a father says to his son You have sold your soul for a golden calf. Some transactions were conducted using rubles while others used marks. Some of the characters speak German others Polish. I was often confused as to where a scene was taking place. Perhaps to elaborate on all of the complexities would require a ten hour movie.A case is made against unfettered capitalism a not altogether irrelevant contemporary topic for debate. In order to satisfy the Soviet censors to get this made perhaps Wajda exaggerated by making all of the upper class characters truly disagreeable and arrogant but given his later involvement with Solidarity in Poland his sympathies were clearly with the workers. I wish additional time had been given to examining the personal lives of some of the workers as presented they appeared mostly as grim oppressed cyphers.Of the seven of Wajda's films I have seen I found this one to be the most accomplished cinematically almost to the point where the filming trumps the story. The production values the acting and the musical score are all excellent. The scenes in the several years later segment are stunning in their use of camera angle editing artistic composition and emotional impact. The creation of a Lodz at the turn of the century is a worthy achievement on a par with the illusion of authenticity that you get when reading a Dickens novel.I am puzzled as to why this film has drawn such a small audience over the years.".

	schema:headline " A savage attack on corrupt Polish capitalism of the 1880s";
	schema:reviewBody "This epic film directed by the famous Polish director Andrzej Wajda is not nearly so widely known outside Poland as many of his other films which have a broader appeal and are less disturbing and savagely ironical. The film is based upon a novel by the classic Polish novelist Ladislaw Reymont who died 1925. The novel was published in 2 volumes in English in 1928 but is very difficult to find. Reymont is better known in English for his novel THE PEASANTS CHLOPI published in four volumes successively entitled Spring Summer Autumn and Winter. It is usually necessary when trying to acquire it to piece the volumes together separately from different booksellers as I had to do. This story is harrowing in the extreme and to a certain extent becomes a caricature of 'the evils of capitalists' primarily speculators. Of course we all know today how dangerous speculators are and every major bank seems to contains dozens of uncontrolled and uncontrollable 'rogue speculators' or 'casino gamblers' as they are often called nowadays who keep bringing about disastrous losses and crashes which effect the entire globe. But this film is a historical drama limited to what took place in the Polish city of Lodz during the 1880s. One presumes that it must have a basis in truth of some kind but being ignorant of the history of Lodz I must confess I do not know. The film contains a few 'in jokes'. For instance there is a scene where an uneducated Jewish moneylender is told that Victor Hugo has just died which happened in 1885. He says after looking blank at first 'oh yes he wrote that book OF FIRE AND SWORD some portions of which my daughter read out to me.' Polish viewers would laugh their heads off at this as the book referred to is one of the most famous works of Henryk Sienkiewicz and has nothing to do with Victor Hugo. Wajda's rage when making this film was evidently so intense that he could not resist planting such small ironies as those within the dialogue. The film portrays the most vicious corrupt callous and inhuman greed and arrogance imaginable. Mill owners are shown saying 'Let them die' when their workers are injured by the machines in their factories and refuse to pay their widows a penny in compensation. They go round the factories choosing the young worker girls they want for sex and forcing them into it with the threat of firing them and their whole families so that they will starve if the girls do not agree. Mangled bodies and body parts flying through the air from whirling machines are shown in the factories without sparing our sensitivities. We see people being beaten to death in the street and no one even notices we see several suicides by financial speculators and moneylenders who have been 'ruined'. Jews are portrayed very harshly as stock characters who are greedy vengeful and lascivious. With the exception of one very nice and honourable aristocratic girl named Anka who tries unsuccessfully to 'have concern for human suffering' by aiding a worker whose ribs have been crushed but is ordered not to do so just about every character in the story is revolting rotten to the core and despicable. This is not an edifying film and is very much a 'downer'. The title is clearly an extremely ironical one as 'the promised land' dreamed of by one minor character as a Lodz where everybody gets rich and is happy is in fact the most brutal nightmare and hell on earth. Wajda used his brilliant film making skills to create a highly watchable and rather mesmerising film but it turns one's stomach. Of course that is what he wanted to do. His message seems to have been 'Can you watch this without being disgusted and horrified?' The answer is no. This story was filmed as a silent film in 1927 but I do not know whether that survives. Reymont's THE PEASANTS has been filmed as a feature film three times in 1922 1935 and 1973 and as a television miniseries in 1972. The Poles love their classic writers and poets. Even in the midst of the dialogue of this film the name of the national poet Adam Mickiewicz bursts through in conversation. Especially at that time it would have been hard to find a Pole who could go an entire day without referring to Mickiewicz who was not only the national poet but a passionate supporter of Polish independence and freedom who spent much of his life living on the Rue de Seine see his plaque in Paris as a political exile. With the Poles their national literature is viewed as such an integral part of their national identity that it means more to them than probably any other European nation. To a large extent this can be seen to be due to the struggle which the Poles have had over the centuries in maintaining a national identity at all what with the Swedish German and Russian invasions not to mention their tiffs with the Lithuanians. In this film there are many sarcastic references to and portrayals of Germans resident in Lodz at the time and they come off worse than even the Jews as the worst villains and scoundrels. This film pulls no punches but lets rip in every direction like a mad dog that wants to bite everyone all at once.".

They connive they scheme and they show total disregard for their workers or anyone else.The plot of the movie follows them as they follow their dream.The film is well acted and of course well directed. However it's a grim film that probably portrays the situation very well. The problem is that the situation was ugly and it's hard to enjoy a movie about amoral people acting dishonorably.We saw this movie at Rochester's wonderful Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum. It will work well enough on the small screen. The Promised Land was shown as part of the excellent Rochester Polish Film Festival.".

What disturbed me most was the crude stereotyping of Jews. One reviewer here has argued that all of the characters appear as crude unsympathetic stereotypes  as if that were a defence of the film  and that it is therefore acceptable to stereotype Jews. I disagree. Even if the general tendency to crude theorydriven characterisation did not invalidate the whole thing which in my opinion it does there would still remain a difference in the way the crude stereotypes are constructed.The capitalists and peasants are stereotyped according to their social class offensive enough just as much to the grovelling screeching workers and peasants as to the yapping striding quailcrunching capitalists and aristocrats. On the other hand the Jewish characters are clearly stereotyped along racial lines. Look at the depiction of traditional Jewish culture. Three men in ritual costumes are praying. When they finish one of them I presume the Rabbi says he is paying one of them less than the other because he didn't pray with enough concentration. What could be a more crude vicious and insulting repetition of the clichd old stereotype of the twofaced moneyobsessed Jew? The scene could have been used to create a contrast between traditional Jews and those who become involved in capitalism but no it's all of them.The central Jewish character is as subtle as a blackandwhite minstrel. The effeminate facial expressions the inability to appreciate social situations except for their business opportunities the way he looks on impotently as the properly manly Germans and Poles get their ends away at an orgy there is little to the character but a collection of classic stereotypes. It's extremely tedious.I see little substantial difference between this frenetic overheated mess and the poisonous ranting of Karl Marx in 'On the Jewish Question'.".

That's because the film seems very very onedimensional in its characterizations and seems much more like a propaganda piece than a historical film. Now I am not saying there weren't some greedy and uncaring industrialists during the Industrial Revolution. However in this epic from Andrzej Wajda ALL capitalists are evil scum...ALL. In fact often there seems to be less attention to a plot and more of an emphasis on characterizing every rich person as lower than pond scum. You see the rich laugh at the hunger of the poor rape employees beat their employees poke wild animals in cages for laughs get upset when an employee gets torn to bits in the machinery because it messes up the fabric being produced and devote EVERY SECOND to acquiring more and more money. And when they aren't doing this they are killing themselves because they have LOST their money! And oddly all their women look like characters from a Fellini film. So all capitalist men are evil...through and through. And all their women are ugly pigs. Oh and did I mention that all the Jews I saw in the film were evil moneygrubbers?! While the Oscar folks apparently liked it I consider it a rather hateful film produced by a Sovietbacked government to promote their Marxist view of society. An odd curio but clearly NOT a film that is very good history or even well written from a nonhistorical standpoint. Highly overrated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like with SadkoThe Magic Voyage of Sinbad and Ilya MurometsThe Sword and the Dragon Sampo or The Day the Earth Froze for its American version is an Aleksandr Ptushko film spoilt by bad dubbing that wasn't even necessary in the first place. The American version is incoherent and unbearably goofy but the original SovietFinnish film is just lovely and it is this version that I'll be talking about now. Maybe the dialogue doesn't always flow and the middle's pacing is on the stoic side. However it is a beautifullooking film the costumes and sets are in equal measure beautiful and eerie the film is nicely shot with techniques that scream of Ptushkoand in a good way and the special effects are simple but aweinspriring and some are wonderfully weird. The music score positively sweeps with the fantasyadventure themes and folksonglike melodies wholly appropriate. The story is also simple but coherent and mostly attentiongrabbing giving us time to breathe and admire everything. While the tone is on the most part suitably eerie and profound there are also some nice oddball touches that don't feel out of placeif there was anything at all like that it certainly wasn't as bad as it was in its American version. The characters are very like the characters that you'll find in a fantasyfairytale and they are engaging. There seems to be a mixed reception on the Witch here depends on the version seen I think she is irritating in the dub but in Ptushko's original she is very sinister. The acting is solid and fitting for their characters. All in all a lovely film but sadly it has a really bad dub that because of MST3K more people will be familiar with. 810 Bethany Cox".

There are movies that MST3K covered because they were terrible and there were movies that they covered because they were...odd and silly at least to our sensibilities. SampoTDTEF falls into the latter school. My feeling is that you have to make allowances for something like this. It's based on a fairy tale for one thing and not one by any Western story teller I knew but some obscure Finnish guy. Well that at least guarantees that the story will be relatively fresh as opposed to using the Grimms or Hans Christian Anderson. It's obviously aimed at a juvenile audience and the story is from the 'magical logic' school of plotting where stuff happens just because it made some sort of deranged sense in the mind of a tot. You know witch kidnaps the hero's love interest so she can get a Sampo but the hero steals the Sampo back so the witch steals the SUN she already has the North Wind in a baggie in her cave so I guess this is on the same scale. So the village starts to freeze and the villagers attack the witch by playing autoharps en masse and the music causes her to turn to stone and...you can't help but fell that this Finnish story teller had hit the schnapps and Aquavit vodka pretty hard before he sat down with pen and paper. And the dubbing is terrible the heroes all talk in wooden monotones and the witch sounds like she suffers from throat nodule and hemorrhoids and everything including the music is muffled and muddy. Some of this may have been due to a bad print. I am pretty sure that some whatever nice poetic conceits and allusions the screenwriters attempted were lost in the translation because the dialog and speeches are mannered and clunky and dead in the water. The lines just lay there. This isn't helped by the fact that whoever these filmmakers were they weren't very concerned about their story being accessible to nonRussoFinnish audiences. On top of that the Earth version seems to missing some footage cut from it  that makes the plot look even more disjointed than it is in the original. But still...there is some charm and quality here that speaks to the viewer's sympathy and attention if you can get past all the problems mentioned above. Someone took a lot of care and thought with the costumes makeup and sets and there are really nice shots and camera angles that please the eye in almost every scene. The 'special effects' are pretty laughable to our sensibilities but they actually work in the context of the art direction. There's even a particularly memorable head shot of the Immortal Blacksmith glaring into the camera framed from behind by a raging fire which wouldn't be out of place in a much glossier more expensive movie.I can't rate this particular cinematic experience above a four because the dubbing made my ears bleed. But I am sure that the original version was probably a great treat for its intended audience many years ago and a continent away.".

	schema:headline " Likable film that's let down by weak plot and wooden characters";
	schema:reviewBody "A joint FinnishSoviet fantasy production aimed at a family audience The Sampo is a very loose retelling of some of the tales in the Finnish national epic Kalevala. The film's focus falls on the fortunes of the hunter Lemminkinen Andris Oshin and the blacksmith Ilmarinen Ivan Voronov as they battle the evil witch Louhi of the North Country Pohjola. The trouble starts when Louhi Anna Oroshko greedy for personal wealth decides she wants a sampo made. The only person in the world with the knowledge and skill to make a sampo a magical object that can dispense endless riches is Ilmarinen so Louhi contrives a scheme to force him to come to her. She kidnaps his beautiful young sister Annikki Eve Kivi and holds her prisoner the news soon reaches Ilmarinen. Lemminkinen has been wooing Annikki so he and Ilmarinen leave their community Kaleva and travel together to Pohjola to rescue Annikki. Louhi demands ransom in the form of the sampo and another arduous task from both men so they oblige and eventually Annikki is released to go back home with them.Sounds all very straightforward but some complications arise Lemminkinen decides Louhi can't be allowed to keep the sampo all to herself so he swims back to the witch's cave hideout while Ilmarinen and Annikki continue home. Lemminkine 's rash actions endanger himself and his entire community in Kaleva as Louhi swears vengeance on him and tries to destroy his people by stealing the sun. Vinminen Urho Somersalmi portrayed as the community's leader leads his people in a cooperative effort to fight Louhi and her army of sorcerers. Unfortunately for everyone the sampo itself ends up destroyed its parts scattered throughout the world and Lemminkainen is only able to retrieve a small part for Kaleva.Sampo is a series of little episodes in an overarching story about ambition and greed and the disasters they cause along with the value of cooperative effort in overcoming a great enemy. There is some redemption as well. At least the moral messages that appear compensate for the patchy goodversusevil plot which doesn't do justice to the epic's complexity and dark characters. Some original Kalevala stories are worked into the movie but in a way that drains them of their power and prevents them from enriching the plot and its characters to take one example the subplot in which Lemminkinen's mother Ada Voitsik rescues her son and brings him back to life is so whitewashed from its original that a lesson about effort and sacrifice is precluded and so the subplot becomes unnecessary. One story that unfortunately didn't find its way into the film is Louhi's allout showdown with Vinminen Lemminkinen and Ilmarinen in the boat carrying the sampo the scriptwriters substituted two weak episodes separating the fight and the sampo's destruction.The film's main asset is its special effects they look cheap and some are cheesy but they're right for the job and aren't excessive for their scenes. Now that would be cheesy! Ilmarinen's separate creations of a horse and boat from fire and metal are suitably aweinspiring and his sampo a slightly hokey creation of coloured crystal actually gains credibility as a wealth generator and then as a good luck charm once in pieces. Scenes in which Kaleva is cursed with everlasting blizzard and winter and in which some unfortunate people are covered over with snow are commendable. On the other hand some effects are quite comic and probably unnecessary the twirling bear shot merely looks weird and creepy and the scenes with a talking birch tree are laughable.Speaking of trees yours truly finds the main characters Ilmarinen and Lemminkinen as solid expressive and unyielding as wood they don't so much talk to each other and to others as declaim their sentences. Lemminkinen dares just about anything and everything to knock him over  his face is frozen into expressions of resolution of varying degrees  and even death doesn't wipe that mask off his visage. Annikki is just a McGuffin figure to get Lemminkinen and Ilmarinen up and running to Pohjola to meet the witch. The only worthy acting maybe overacting comes from Oroshko who clearly relishes playing Louhi. Believe it or not Oroshko is female in spite of her character's very mannish bearing and appearance overgrown eyebrows. Some of Louhi's sorcerers offer performances to match Oroshko in overdone drama especially when they think of the sampo and say in wonder . sampo!  and get that dazed faraway look in their eyes but the camera doesn't pay much attention to these individuals.The film looks very beautiful and colourful in a way that might remind viewers of a certain age of Walt Disney nature documentaries of the 1950s  60s wherever the opportunity beckons the camera lavishes its gaze on the silvery forests the lakes and rivers and general Finnish countryside scenery. The impression is of serenity and tranquillity in the dark and still birch trees. Opening scenes in the movie show rural people at work cutting down trees to clear the land for planting crops. Once the focus is on Lemminkainen and Ilmarinen journeying to Pohjala to save Annikki the film pays no more attention to portraying rural Finnish life other than showing how men and women dress and how the interiors of their houses might appear.

	onyx:emotionText "A joint FinnishSoviet fantasy production aimed at a family audience The Sampo is a very loose retelling of some of the tales in the Finnish national epic Kalevala. The film's focus falls on the fortunes of the hunter Lemminkinen Andris Oshin and the blacksmith Ilmarinen Ivan Voronov as they battle the evil witch Louhi of the North Country Pohjola. The trouble starts when Louhi Anna Oroshko greedy for personal wealth decides she wants a sampo made. The only person in the world with the knowledge and skill to make a sampo a magical object that can dispense endless riches is Ilmarinen so Louhi contrives a scheme to force him to come to her. She kidnaps his beautiful young sister Annikki Eve Kivi and holds her prisoner the news soon reaches Ilmarinen. Lemminkinen has been wooing Annikki so he and Ilmarinen leave their community Kaleva and travel together to Pohjola to rescue Annikki. Louhi demands ransom in the form of the sampo and another arduous task from both men so they oblige and eventually Annikki is released to go back home with them.Sounds all very straightforward but some complications arise Lemminkinen decides Louhi can't be allowed to keep the sampo all to herself so he swims back to the witch's cave hideout while Ilmarinen and Annikki continue home. Lemminkine 's rash actions endanger himself and his entire community in Kaleva as Louhi swears vengeance on him and tries to destroy his people by stealing the sun. Vinminen Urho Somersalmi portrayed as the community's leader leads his people in a cooperative effort to fight Louhi and her army of sorcerers. Unfortunately for everyone the sampo itself ends up destroyed its parts scattered throughout the world and Lemminkainen is only able to retrieve a small part for Kaleva.Sampo is a series of little episodes in an overarching story about ambition and greed and the disasters they cause along with the value of cooperative effort in overcoming a great enemy.

The costumes are really gaudy and look too ridiculous. It's a very slow moving film now that I think about it.

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this film as a MST3K episode and it was entitled The Day the Earth Froze. Its original title was Sampo and that title works better even though I have no clue as to what a Sampo is because this is the thing for which the movie revolves around. The whole freezing thing is but a mere plot point in the film. This film is another foreign film and thus a lot of things are going to be lost in the translation. I can only review it based on what I saw and what I saw for the most part was a rather strange film that really did not have the best of heroes within it.The story has an evil witch who really wants a Sampo. Apparently this is a giant rock that spews forth both gold and salt...yes salt. Who knew that salt was something that was valuable and scarce at any point in history. Well the witch kidnaps the sister of a blacksmith and the blacksmith and hero of the tale go to reclaim her on an island where the witch has an army of old men and she holds the winds of all direction captive or something. She does freeze part of the world at one point but as I stated it is not really the main focus of the story.This film made for a very funny episode of MST3K. It had to be as I laughed and enjoyed it despite the fact I was suffering from a very intense migraine at the time. The hero of this film made for a good punching bag as his only skill seemed riding on a log down a river. He even gets beat up by a cloak at one point in the film! The blacksmith too was good for a laugh as the guy could make the most insane stuff with his blacksmith skills such as a live horse! So while I was not impressed with the film as they just really did not do enough as far as travel or deadly schemes this movie was great for MST3K.The movie just did not work well. The film looked as if it was about to do something remotely interesting and then it would just stop. The sister is about to release the north wind but then it stopped. The hero had to plow a field of snakes and he wrestles one snake and then over. The final battle consisted of people playing their harps and the witch just kind of dying. Just a strange movie that could have benefited from being even more strange.".

I'm certain that part of the problem is that the American version is missing a third of the film but allowing for that its a horrible piece with all of Ptushko's worst mannerisms in full view.";

Plus the Czechs were probably the most actively discontent people of the soviet satellite states. When this film came out the Prague spring was about to happen the country was boiling with tension and will to change. Creative minds usually boil at higher temperatures under such contexts. So I assume that some metaphor of search of freedom might be made of this story. Flying away escaping land searching for places where one can try the unthinkable back home. Intellectuals not playing along the regimes on the other side of the curtain were having tough times. This would be a suitable metaphor in the line of what Svankmajer was doing.Also the choosing of Jules Verne so loved by this director is itself a comment on the kind of thing he was trying to pull off. The reason why we love Verne is the inventiveness of the science fictions he proposes. He didn't write scifi as Philip Dick where the scientific otherworldliness is the framework for the exposure of a cleverly conceived deep exploration of things close to us in our real world. Instead with Vernes it's really about the world in physical terms the verisimilitude of the scientific proposal to live in that world as it is defined by the writer. He gives us the seduction of hipperrealism the sensation that what we're reading might be possible indeed much of it is right now being done wrapped around the fascination of a fantasy parallel world. On top of everything experimenting is what drives this kind of creators. The trouble with this film is that the codes are outdated. I don't connect to the visual presentation of this film. This world sounds flat and not fascinating today. There is visual sensitivity here in how animation and real action are mixed how the yellow tone is used to unite the whole bits. A lot of effort was put into it and it may have worked in its day. But not now. It's a scream for freedom and we feel it even today As such it's good. As a film i really think that there are other adventures more worthy of being lived other journeys for useful to be taken.My opinion 15Cinanima 2011httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When Universal Pictures made those Arabian Nights films with Jon Hall Sabu and Maria Montez in the Forties a lot of expensive period sets were built on that lot. The rule is get use of them so even after Universal became UniversalInternational in the Fifties with a crop of new leading men like Jeff Chandler Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson they still kept cranking out those old tales set in the Caliphate of Old Bagdad.This film is a reworking of the Christian Sword and the Stone legend into the Arabian Nights. Haroun of Basra played by Rock Hudson comes upon his dying father in an ambushed caravan and he's given a mission to find the murderer who is also trying to stir up trouble between Basra and Bagdad. While on the mission he comes upon a magic sword in a marketplace and discovers he's invincible with it. He also comes upon the Caliph's daughter the blond Piper Laurie who likes to roam the streets of Bagdad incognito to sample public opinion and get a taste of adventure to the annoyance of her father Edgar Barrier.But there's treason afoot in the palace with Grand Vizier George MacReady and son Gene Evans who want the throne for themselves. Evans wants to marry for it which bothers his mistress Kathleen Hughes a lot.During the course of the film the magic sword is stolen from Hudson and later when Evans was trying to use it he rammed it into the palace wall and no one can get it from the stone foundation. I'll give you one guess who can.The Golden Blade is the average Universal Arabian Nights epic with a lot of gaudy color cinematography with a bigger budget you'd think it was a DeMille film. No better or worse than some of what Universal was putting out in those years. I'm sure Piper Laurie felt the same as Maureen O'Hara did in these kind of films Maureen in her memoirs realized how ridiculous a redhead was in the Middle East. George Macready was one of the best movie villains ever in just about any kind of genre be it western noir sand and sandal you name it. He does a wonderful job mouthing some lines that were quite frankly ridiculous with earnest conviction. By the way if you were to make a golden blade it would not be much use to you if it weren't enchanted. As any geologist will tell you gold is the softest and most malleable of metals remember in the days of gold coin people would bite into it to see if it was genuine and if the coin had teeth marks you knew it was good. The Golden Blade is entertaining enough and not to be taken too seriously.".

But that's just what Universal gives us in The Golden Blade. He's surely not on the scale of Errol Flynn Ty Power or Stu Granger but Hudson does a nice swashbuckling turn here. The Golden Blade is a lighthearted movie of fiction set in a mythical Baghdad. It has some skulduggery that is usual for these desert tales of the mid20th century. Hudson's physical trysts combine with the energy and rebelliousness of a princess Piper Laurie who is always sneaking off to see the world outside the palace. And to do good turns with the people that endear them to her. The plot isn't complicated and the script is just average. The color cinematography and costumes add to the enjoyment of the movie. It's not serious filmmaking but the cast seem as though they are enjoying their craft. Viewers should do likewise. Just sit back and enjoy the color action humor and romance of this light but entertaining film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a redheaded Caliph's daughter and pair him opposite a very American looking Arabian Knight and you have the type of sword and sandal adventure that had the kiddies flocking in on Saturday afternoon but left critics cold. Universal was the king of these types of films from the early 40's through the mid 1940's when the Italians took over leading Peter Graves to ask that question Billy do you like movies about gladiators? It isn't just the obvious Caucasian casting but the many clichs used over and over since the days of Sabu Jon Hall and Maria Montez. At least in those films you know that the creator's tongues were in their cheek. Here the writers were just looking for a fast buck and thanks to the quarters of the adolescent crowd many of these films scored big. There are too many of them so in film history now they all meld together in a stew of sameness.The saga is based upon the legend of the sword of Damascus which gives the man who is able to pull it out of a wall the power of many thrones much like the legend of King Arthur and the sword of Camelot. All is fine with that but with Rock Hudson as the hero and redheaded Piper Laurie as the feisty lady in distress you know that nobody gave much thought to reality in casting. At least with Montez Sabu and Hall they looked the parts and with Tony Curtis as The Prince Who Was a Thief you had a Hellzapoppin' like spoof of the genre that audiences still laugh both with and at today.Colorful photography barely hides the fact that the hanging props of the lavish sets are obviously cheaply made and look like things you'd see hanging in an elementary school classroom. They do not at all give the impression of the ancient middle east coming off as ostentatious and gosh rather than remotely sophisticated. The villains are onenote the sidekicks silly rather than comic and the dancing girls more off of Broadway than of Bagdad. The action sequences are exciting but some moments seem more like filler than like plot development. This is the type of film that a realist might buy popcorn to eat during the movie but may find themselves throwing at the screen as the film drags on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Boyer Olivia de Havilland and Paulette Goddard deserve high praise for their performances in this poignant and touching slice of Americana from Mitchell Leisen who later directed de Havilland in 'To Each His Own'. Basically the story of a European gigolo Boyer who wants to get into the United States without a long wait in Mexico. His girlfriend and exdancing partner Paulette Goddard convinces him to marry an unsuspecting American schoolteacher de Havillandin order to gain fast entry before ditching her. Colorful supporting characters come to lifemost notably Walter Abel as an immigration officer and Rosemary de Camp as a pregnant woman who wants her child born in the U.S. Boyer narrates the story to a film director Mitchell Leisen and we see the story unfold in flashback from his point of view. Excellent work by all concerned. My only complaint is the abrupt endingwhich I understand was a result of trouble with Boyer who wanted certain scenes rewrittena final scene between him and de Havilland would have been preferable to what seems like a letdown for the finale. As it is it looks like choppy editing before The End flashes on the screen. Still a romantic drama with an abundant amount of dry humor and some crackling dialogue by Paulette Goddard who sparkles in her role as the other woman. Her confrontation scene with the schoolteacher is one of the highlights of the film. De Havilland was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this but lost to her sister Joan Fontaine for 'Suspicion'.".

And Paulette Goddard too. Just watching these 3 actors in a movie is great fun. It's also an interesting and sympathetic view of a group of immigrants fleeing the war in Europe who had made it to Mexico with the hope of getting into the US. The film came out in 1941probably before the US had entered the war. Boyer is Romanian a dancer and gigolo who is broke and feeling hopeless by the time he meets Olivia a teacher who has brought her students on a field trip to Mexico for the 4th of July which seems like rather an odd choice when you think about it. And there is some really tiresome interactions between the teacher and her quite incorrigible studentsbut hang on it passes. Then we get to watch Boyer's insincere seduction of her and then her authentic seduction of him the discovery of his trick and potential paradise lost. The ending? Boy I'd love to know the story of that endingwas it the original as written? Please Paramount put it out on DVD with commentary. Somebody must know. Anyway despite its flaws the performances are wonderful and it's a viewing pleasure. Yes a 10 is a little high for a ratingin quality it's probably more like an 8 but in fun value I still give it 10 and maybe it will help get it DVDed.".

Today instead of going the legal route they would probably hire a coyote to take them to the other side of the border! The more things change the more they stay the same.This film is interesting because of the screen play by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett although the IMDB only lists the latter one as the writer. It is a mistake to bypass the great Billy Wilder when we see his imprint everywhere in the movie. The movie begins with a disheveled Charles Boyer going to the Paramount lot to talk to the director Mitchell Leisen. Boyer's character George Iscovescu has met the director in the Riviera and comes to beg for a loan of 500 a tidy sum in those days. From there the story unfolds.George quickly learns after arriving in the border town that because being Rumanian he must wait about 8 years to enter the United States because of immigration quotas. He quickly learns the only way to make it across the border is if he would marry an American woman and voila! Emmy Brown just happens to come to spend the 4th of July holiday with her students thus his chance to make it in a legal way.The cast of the film is excellent. Charles Boyer in spite of not being upfront with the naive Emmy doesn't make us hate him. He redeems himself at the end. Olivia de Havilland was perfect for the immature Emmy. She falls in love with a man that is trying to use her as his ticket to the promised land. Paulette Goddard as Anita was very good. Walter Abel is the despised Inspector Hammock the immigration officer everyone in town hates.Don't miss it either on tape or DVD format.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the alltime great tearjerkers this film satisfies on many levels it offers a truly involving and emotionally moving story an abundance of welldrawn and complex characters an unusual setting and three excellent stars Charles Boyer Olivia de Havilland and Paulette Goddard.  Boyer's character narrates much of the film describing how he woos and weds sweet schoolteacher de Havilland in order to gain American citizenship and this device allows us to listen in as his jaded mercenary persona mellows and purifies under the influence of his innocent bride.  Full of wry humor and a colorful supporting cast this film deserves to be better known.";

	schema:headline " The Immigration Problem in 1941  A Revelation";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder knew first hand what it was to be a refugee in the 1930s  he was one of the lucky ones. He came from Austria originally and fled in a timely manner before the Nazis' Anschluss in 1938. His family still suffered  many perished in the camps. But he was able due to his stage and film work in Europe to find employment in Hollywood. This enabled him to avoid the savage pitfalls of the American immigration quota system set up in the 1920s. You normally had to wait for an opening in the number of immigrants coming from each country to pass into the U.S.A. unless of course you were guaranteed a job or career in the U.S.A. That's why Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi had no problems showing up in the U.S. with their physics backgrounds and reputations. But how many people were like them or like the creative film personality Wilder? Taking Kitti Frings' original story of European refugees in Mexico Wilder and his partner Charles Brackett constructed the script for HOLD BACK THE DAWN. George Iscovescu Charles Boyeris a Rumanian gigolo who has ended up on the MexicanAmerican border. We see he has sneaked into the U.S. and is in Hollywood at Paramount Studios. He approaches a director a friend told him about Dwight Saxon Mitchel Leisin  the director of this film. The film we watch is the story that Iscovescu wants to interest Saxon in producing as a film.Iscovescu is a pretty rotten individual  he uses his good looks and charm on women and lives off them. Only one woman Anita Dixon  Paulette Goddard is aware of his heel's personality as she is an opportunist as well. She and George were an item together as dancing partners in Europe. Both are trying to get into America but the quota is keeping George out. This is a relief to Inspector Hammock Walter Abel who is an astute member of the immigration service and fully aware of how desireable both these people are as potential U.S. citizens. However in 1941 there was a way to get into the U.S. if you could not fit a quota or if you had no guaranteed job. The method which was legal until about five years ago was that you could marry an American citizen and become one. This method was misused so the immigration service made sure that the marriages were truly love matches and then decided they were not good enough anymore. But that was long after 1941.George looks for someone he can quickly marry gain citizenship through and then discard in a year or so. He finds an American school teacher named Emmy Brown Olivia De Haviland who is a little naive. He romances very quickly and within a few weeks George and Emmy are married. Hammock is observing all this and tries to warn Emmy but she won't hear anything about George. The problem though is that Emmy is so in love with George that despite his manoftheworld shell he starts responding to it. Anita keeps reminding him to go across the border and send for her but instead to her growing dismay she finds that George is spending all of his time getting to know Emmy better  and actually falling in love with her. Jealous and angry Anita decides to reveal George and her past to Emmy  and the crisis of the film comes out of this revelation.Frankly from my description one can say that HOLD BACK THE DAWN is superior soap opera. But in fact Wilder and Brackett took a serious look at the problem of immigration. Besides the antics of George and Anita and Emmy they look at Professor Van den Leuken Victor Francen in one of his nicer parts a minorFermi or Einstein waiting for a college position promised him to be cleared Bonbois Curt Bois a French hairdresser hoping for an opening in the quota  who happens thanks to Van den Leuken to discover he has a secret historical weapon that will open his way into America and  possibly the most touching figure in the film  Berta Kurz Rosemary De Camp a German probably German Jewish refugee with her husband who is pregnant and really determined that her child is going to be an American citizen come hell or high water. And she achieves her goal.The acting was of high order and really Olivia De Haviland's best part after GONE WITH THE WIND two years earlier. If Melanie Wilkes was a decent brave example of southern womanhood Emmy is a woman who gradually finds she is an adult woman with sexual feelings. As a result of her performance De Haviland got her first nomination for a best actress Oscar but ironically  and bitterly she would lose to her own sister Joan Fontaine for SUSPICION.Boyer played one of his darker figures like Pepi Le Moko who one could sympathize with after a fact  especially after he reveals he has a finer self than we thought. As for Goddard this film and the earlier THE WOMAN demonstrated that she was a highly capable actress  not just a good reactor to her first husband Charlie Chaplin in two movies.Wilder and Bracket had clashed with Leisin on other joint projects just as Preston Sturgis had. This would prove to be the last screenplay by them that he or any other director would direct. Well enough for Wilder perhaps and even his then partner Charles Brackett. But despite their complaints Leisin's work was quite above average in this movie.".

This is the movie that supposedly started De Havilland's lifelong feud with her sister Joan Fontaine who in 1941 ran against her and won for Best Actress in Hitchcock's Suspicion 1941 which had been proceeded the previous year for a Best Actress nomination in Hitchcock's Rebecca 1940 and followed by a nomination in 1944 for The Constant Nymph 1943. One might well imagine that the sisters were in constant competition during the 40s. Hold Back the Dawn 1941 is a nicely told romance about a young and vulnerable young school teacher Emmy Olivia de Havilland with a busload of kids traveling in a Mexican border town during an Independence Day side trip. However on the Mexican side of the border there are several European refugees desperately trying to enter the US no doubt because of the unrest in Europe at the time. While watching this movie released before the Pearl Harbour Attack on the US it is probably helpful to remember that Hollywood was not yet fully engaged with going to war even though Billy Wilder was one of the writers of the screen play for the movie. So European refugees waitedat the Hotel Espiranzato get their green cards for legally crossing the border into the US. Two of these waiters were a dance team an Austrian woman Anita Dixon Paulette Goddard and her former professional dance partner Romanian Georges Iscovescu Charles Boyer. Goddard meets Boyer in this border town to tell him how she was able to get her green card in record time by marrying an American and then divorcing him after successfully making it into America. Anita encourages George to do the same thing by taking advantage of the American school teacher's obvious attraction to him. He starts down this path but with unsuspected results.

There's a quota and depending on what country you're from the quota can mean a long wait.Hold Back the Dawn is told in flashback beginning with Boyer as Roumanian Georges Iscovescu approaching someone at Paramount trying to sell his story.

When schoolteacher Emmy Brown shows up with some students on a tour he sweeps her off her feet and marries her so he can have citizenship.

As the cold Georges Boyer is very convincing as a man who turns the charm on and off like a faucet but as he gets to know Emmy he starts to thaw. Goddard is vivacious and beautiful as Anita in love with Georges herself and not wanting anyone else in the way.In a supporting role Rosemary Camp is Bertha Kurz a pregnant woman determined that her child will be born in the United States. An underrated actress DeCamp was a TV mainstay through the '70s and did many appearances in the '80s as well. Accents were her specialty. She turns in a lovely performance here.

His view of DeHavilland as the leading lady waiting patiently for her man to accomplish his mission remained transfixed throughout her tenure at Warner Brothers.I'm sure that given what she accomplished in Gone With The Wind Warner got quite a sum from Paramount for her services for Hold Back The Dawn.

But depending on your point of view she's unlucky enough or lucky enough to meet Charles Boyer who is a Romanian refugee wanting really bad to get to this country.Boyer is a part time tango dancer and full time gigolo and his partner Paulette Goddard has already gotten US citizenship by marrying a jockey from Agua Caliente racetrack and later divorcing him.

He actually commits a sacrifice of sort in this relationship.Although DeHavilland got the Oscar nomination for me Boyer makes the film. The change that comes in his character come subtly and gradually and the tools to do it and the guidance come from script writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and director Mitchell Leisen. Boyer gives a very subtle performance that should have received more recognition.Not to say Olivia didn't deserve her recognition coming in the form of that Oscar nomination for Best Actress. In fact she was the betting favorite to win but her sister Joan Fontaine beat her out with her performance in Suspicion. As is part of movie legend these two sisters were quite competitive and this didn't help the relationship.In fact Hold Back The Dawn got six Oscar nominations including Best Picture but came up short for Paramount. Still it's an impressive piece of work even seventy years after it was first released.Also note the performances of Walter Abel as the immigration official and Rosemary DeCamp another refugee who finds her own method of entre into the good old USA.I hope it comes out on DVD at some point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall I feel pretty positive about this film although the first third or so of the film seemed a bit uneven  some good aspects some not so good. But the story is an interesting one  which I'm sure our Republican friends would hate...because it's about illegal immigration from Mexico...but with a twist...apparently the immigration problem with Mexico in the mid1900s was more of Europeans making their way to Mexico to cross the border into the United States. In this case Charles Boyer is a bit of a shady character from eastern Europe he is in Mexico and decides to marry an American woman only as a means to get into the United States. Along comes the somewhat prim teacher Olivia de Havilland who is taking some students on a field trip. Boyer seizes the opportunity and within hours they are married. Boyer's plan is to dump de Havilland after becoming an American citizen move east she is from Azusa and continue in his crooked ways with accomplice Paulette Goddard. Things take some unplanned turns and Boyer begins to feel guilty about his plan and eventually begins to fall in love with de Havilland no big surprise there. Goddard rats on Boyer to de Havilland but to an immigration official she stands up for him...and then leaves him. But on the way back to California she is in a serious auto accident and lays apparently dying in the hospital. He comes to her side...illegally and she pulls through and he gains his way into the country...with good intentions.I've grown to enjoy Charles Boyer more in recent years and while he was right for this part he seems too sedate here almost as if his heart wasn't quite in it.I recently watched another Olivia de Havilland film  The Heiress  and it occurred to me while watching it that Olivia de Havilland was the direct opposite of Bette Davis. Both were great actresses but most of the roles that one starred in could not have been played by the other. And this film is another good example of that. Able to display a sense of nativityinnocence but equally able to play the ability of be strong when required...and both in the same role. It's a very good performance.Paulette Goddard seems to get the short end of the stick here as the selfdescribed tramp in the film. It's not an impressive role for her.Walter Abel a very able character actor is good here as the American immigration inspector. Rosemary DeCamp an underrated actress has a small but good supporting role.Be patient. The film strengthens as it goes on and has some fine moments and touching scenes particularly on the part of Olivia de Havilland.".

I hate that term though because it condescendingly assumes that there's nothing in a movie like this for men to enjoy. On the contrary there's plenty to enjoy for everyone including a story that has taken on renewed urgency and relevancy considering the debate swirling around illegal immigration at this moment in our country.Charles Boyer plays a playboy fleeing wartorn Europe and stranded in Mexico awaiting an opportunity to get into America. Olivia de Havilland plays a plain Jane school teacher who falls for his false claims of love and accepts his proposal of marriage not realizing that he's only using her to get into the country. But of course there wouldn't be a movie if he didn't eventually fall in love with her for real and have compunction about his actions. It's interesting to see how immigration was handled in 1941 and how lax border security was. The film is also sympathetic to the plights of those trying to gain entry something many people now would benefit from being reminded of.Poor de Havilland was always getting cast as dowdy naive spinsters which is a shame given how luminous she can be as an actress. No matter. Let the Oscar nomination she received for this film be her consolation. The film was also nominated for Best Picture Best Screenplay penned by famous screenwriting team Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder Best Art Direction BW Best Cinematography BW and Best Dramatic Score a puzzling nomination since the film's only music is that heard during the opening and end credits.Grade B".

Also what sort of an insane school and school teacher would think of taking elementary schoolage kids to Mexico for a field trip?! The logistics of it are a problem...plus it IS another country!

He discovers he can get in almost immediately as the spouse of a US citizen and he finds one in sitting duck De Havilland who is conducting a class trip south of the border. There are several side stories attendant to this one but they fade into the background of this intensely dramatic love story of deceit and redemption. Boyer always came across to me just as he does here a conniver and a liar Gaslight All This And Heaven Too and he was pitch perfect in this one. Olivia De Havilland vulnerable and sensitive as always got an AA nom for her work here  the film earned 6 AA nominations in all.Immigration problems seem like something from the middle ages nowadays when there seems to be a turnstile at the border. This gives the picture a very dated feel. Some like myself may not care for the artificial ending but the two principals endow this movie with loads of heart and make it a winner. Too bad you can't see it unless you find a DVD pirate and buy a copy.".

	schema:headline " Amusing and a nice idea  somewhere inside Celtic Pride is a better film trying to get out";
	schema:reviewBody "It's game 6 of the NBA playoffs with the Celtics 32 up against the Utah Jazz and seemingly about to win the title on their home court in Boston. Lifelong fans Mike O'Hara and Jimmy Flaherty may have personal problems but these are put in perspective opposite the dream of catching the title. However Utah's best player Lewis Scott is carrying the team and responsible for most of their points.  When he destroys the Celtics in game 6 things look bleak.  Bumping into him in a bar later that night Mike and Jimmy plan to get him so drunk he'll still he weak in several days time when game 7 is played.  However when they wake up beside him the next morning they kidnap him and plan to hold him until after game 7 has passed.  However things are harder than they imagined.Being a basketball fan I'll give anything that involves the game a try whether it is more serious films like Blue Chips and He Got Game or comedies like this or Eddie.  This film had potential and opening with a funny sequence where Mike fails to pass on his passion to his students it looked like it was going to be good.  The plot is filled out by poking fun at the excessive sports fans and also taking a more serious look from the point of view of the players themselves as represented by Scott.  However where things fall down a little is in the delivery.Marketed as a wacky' comedy of sorts the film wants to be that hence the presence of Aykroyd and Stern but this means that the more interesting side of the film is ignored and allowed to fall into disrepair before finally collapsing in the final 7 months later' shot.  As a comedy it is entertaining without ever being very funny  I didn't laugh out loud very often but I found it passable and light hearted.  It never really gets any better than that sadly but I felt that this lack of consistent laughs could have been covered if the darker side of the fanplayer relationship had been brought out more.Unfortunately this side slides for the whole of the film until nothing of interest is really left.  There are imaginative touches that suggest a better film but overall the lack of an effective dramatic streak to the film no matter how secondary it would have been is a problem.  Without it the plot seems trivial and makes it harder to hold the audience's interest. This isn't helped by the fact that the film feels quite cheap and quickly put together.  This is shown throughout the film but is clearest in it's portrayal of the basketball action.  I wasn't expecting them to have the feel of a big stadium or have total realism but the games are such a joke in terms the play that it made me realise how little effort was put into some aspects of the film.The cast is OK but the names suggest that a more zany' comedy was expected to be the outcome of this film.  Aykroyd plays a lesser role but has some good dream sequences Stern is left to lead the film and he appears to lack the confidence to do it well.  Wayans is the real star here which is a worrying thing.  His character is the strongest and also has the most to say as he is not just a comedy figure in the way the other two are.  He leads well and is actually OK but his basketball scenes are poor.  For He Got Game Ray Allen coached Washington so he'd look the part it appears noone saw the need for that approach here.Overall this is a wacky comedy with few laughs.  Because it seems to favour the zany' knockabout side of it's nature it neglects the darker more interesting side and suffers as a result.  This film never made it to the cinema in the UK and barely made an impact on video  there are reasons for this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Farcical sports comedy about the outer limits of rabid sports fandom stars Daniel Stern as Mike a Boston Phys. Ed. teacher fiercely devoted to the Celtics basketball team. As our story begins the Celtics are facing off against the Utah Jazz for the championship before Boston Gardens is due to be demolished. One night Mike and his tagalong pal Jimmy Dan Aykroyd encounter Lewis Scott Damon Wayans the selfish egomaniacal star player for the Jazz in a bar and the three of them get just drunk enough that Mike and Jimmy are able to successfully kidnap Lewis. They figure they'll hold on to him long enough to ensure that the Celtics win but naturally things go completely awry.Written by Judd Apatow based on a story by him and Colin Quinn this does take some pretty hard and amusing digs at sports fans. Not that it's an especially witty screenplay though it's really the cast who give it 100 that make it work as well as it does. Wayans is a hoot as the sports superstar who isn't exactly lacking insight into his schmucky abductors. Stern and Aykroyd are well cast Stern is a comedic ball of fire as always. Gail O'Grady does alright with a clichd role as a fed up wife. Paul Guilfoyle is entertaining as a Boston cop. Christopher McDonald has some funny moments especially I hate my life. as the coach of the Jazz. Darrell Hammond has a small role while various real life basketball celebrities have cameo roles. The cameo by a certain football star at the end is hilarious.Speaking personally I didn't feel that the pacing was all that bad. At least this watchable if uninspired movie only runs about an hour and a half.Six out of 10.".

It stars Daniel Stern Dan Akroyd and Damon Wayons. Now Daniel Stern is an extraordinarily funny actor and a great one in retrospective. Dan Akroyd is also an awesome actor who actually signed my DVD of this film when he was on a world tour. The film is very funny and the comedic acting is legendary. I think anyone who's seen this film probably disagrees with the 5.1. I rate this film a 7.2 for its memorable style and character which is hard to find in movies these days. I definitely recommend having this film in your collection as you can watch it over and over again. Click if this review was useful to you if you go for the Milwalkie Bucks. If not that I go for the Green bay Packers in the N.F.L San Jose Sharks in the N.H.L and mildly follow the A.F.L my team there are the Fremantle Dockers... And so be sure to check out my upcoming reviews for anticipated films like The Amazing Spiderman 2 Godzilla X Men IV Dawn of the Planet of the Apes The Hobbit part 3 and more!".

To say this is a great comedy is a mouthful. A nice movie with some laughs sure but overall the movie falls short for anything timeless. Stern and Aykroyd are good actors but are not stars. They alone can not carry a film. While Wayans is one of the only funny things about the movie the story fails to have him as a major part to the story. Stern and Aykroyd are good supporting actors when they team up with other actor like Billy Crystal and Chevy Chase. Alone or even together they do not have the chemistry that makes comedy teams. A nice little movie that can be found in the bargain bin and the video store or on cable television at 2 o'clock in the morning.".

I remember a ritual I had while rooting for the New York baseball Giants as a kid and I'm convinced I helped them win the 1954 pennant and World series. So the opening basketball sequence had me rolling in the aisles.  But once they accidentally kidnap the best Utah Jazz player Damon Wayans in an effort to help the Celtics win the championship the comedy loses its steam. It somehow reminded me of the horrendous scandals involving skater Tanya Harding as well as that of Monica Seles who was actually stabbed by a fan wanting her to lose. Nothing was funny in the second half of the film. It took the wrong direction and hit a dead end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing that struck me about Celtic Pride is that it was too heavy too dark and too busy with other things rather than focusing on its current story. It was as if it was never content with where it was always wanting to move forward anticipating any possible flaw that may come along the way. It seemed scared to go for any big laughs afraid it might be shot down by picky filmgoers. In the process it did in fact hurt itself even more by anticipating this.Mike Daniel Stern and Jimmy Dan Aykroyd are bigtime Boston Celtics fans. They get mood swings when the Celtics are losing they get alltimehighs when they are winning. Mike's wife has even left him because he is so wrapped up around the sport. In the beginning of the movie the Celtics and the Utah Jazz are about to play the sixth game of the NBA championships. Mike and Jimmy eagerly anticipating and looking forward to the game get frontrow seats and watch in horror as the Jazz's newest player Lewis Scott Damon Wayans completely owns the court and practically beats the Celtics by himself. Mike and Jimmy woefully retreat to a local bar where they find that Lewis Scott is drinking. Posing as enthusiastic Utah fans Mike and Jimmy push Scott to drink more and more getting him extremely drunk. There's a funny scene during this when Mike and Jimmy meet Larry Byrd and have to pretend that they are Utah fans. The real big sports fans out there might get a kick out of that and even the whole movie but only the strong ones.After their latenight drinking binge Mike and Jimmy take Scott back to their home and eventually kidnap him holding him hostage in Jimmy's apartment.Damon Wayans star of Bulletproof and Major Payne is surprisingly the funniest guy in this movie. He reminds me of the black version of my uncle both in looks humor and facial expressions. He gets the good oneliners the good jokes. And it's funny to watch him be suspicious of everyone such as when Mike and Jimmy originally approach him. Watch his face. His eyebrow arches he talks sarcastically. I must say I was surprised.But Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern both men I generally like in comedies seem to just go with the flow not really helping out the movie a lot. They are supposed to be longtime buddies and sports fanatics but we don't feel any mutual sports bond between them or just a bonding of friendship. The actors themselves are fine but fail to deliver any sparks of chemistry.Celtic Pride is too heavy on itself. It's too serious too melodramatic too anticlimatic. It is as if director Tom De Cerchio is afraid to try anything risky for big laughs. Something like There's Something About Mary may not be the funniest movie ever I certainly didn't think so but the laughs were controversial and made the film more than worth seeing. Celtic Pride is just another average runo'themill comedy. Hohum laughter result from hohum gags. There's nothing very funny here. It's basically for the very big sports fanatics the kind of fanatics who would ritualistically kill off opposing team players just for their team to win. The premise of this movie is no doubt very funny in itself but one single premise cannot a good movie make.2.55 stars John Ulmer".

In the process it did in fact hurt itself even more by anticipating this.Mike Daniel Stern and Jimmy Dan Aykroyd are bigtime Boston Celtics fans. They get mood swings when the Celtics are losing they get alltimehighs when they are winning. Mike's wife has even left him because he is so wrapped up around the sport. In the beginning of the movie the Celtics and the Utah Jazz are about to play the sixth game of the NBA championships. Mike and Jimmy eagerly anticipating and looking forward to the game get frontrow seats and watch in horror as the Jazz's newest player Lewis Scott Damon Wayans completely owns the court and practically beats the Celtics by himself. Mike and Jimmy woefully retreat to a local bar where they find that Lewis Scott is drinking. Posing as enthusiastic Utah fans Mike and Jimmy push Scott to drink more and more getting him extremely drunk. There's a funny scene during this when Mike and Jimmy meet Larry Byrd and have to pretend that they are Utah fans. The real big sports fans out there might get a kick out of that and even the whole movie but only the strong ones.After their latenight drinking binge Mike and Jimmy take Scott back to their home and eventually kidnap him holding him hostage in Jimmy's apartment.Damon Wayans star of Bulletproof and Major Payne is surprisingly the funniest guy in this movie. He reminds me of the black version of my uncle both in looks humor and facial expressions. He gets the good oneliners the good jokes. And it's funny to watch him be suspicious of everyone such as when Mike and Jimmy originally approach him. Watch his face. His eyebrow arches he talks sarcastically. I must say I was surprised.But Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern both men I generally like in comedies seem to just go with the flow not really helping out the movie a lot. They are supposed to be longtime buddies and sports fanatics but we don't feel any mutual sports bond between them or just a bonding of friendship. The actors themselves are fine but fail to deliver any sparks of chemistry.Celtic Pride is too heavy on itself. It's too serious too melodramatic too anticlimatic. It is as if director Tom De Cerchio is afraid to try anything risky for big laughs. Something like There's Something About Mary may not be the funniest movie ever I certainly didn't think so but the laughs were controversial and made the film more than worth seeing. Celtic Pride is just another average runo'themill comedy. Hohum laughter result from hohum gags. There's nothing very funny here. It's basically for the very big sports fanatics the kind of fanatics who would ritualistically kill off opposing team players just for their team to win. The premise of this movie is no doubt very funny in itself but one single premise cannot a good movie make.2.55 stars John Ulmer";

	schema:reviewBody "Celtic Pride is essentially a one note comedy film yet the pairing of two likable comedy men an original plot and some heavy jokes make this film more than average. This is a different kind of sports comedy where the excitement isn't coming from the players but two rabid fans of the Boston Celtics.Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern play Mike and Jimmy two hardcore fans of the Boston Celtics. The Celts are in the finals with the Utah Jazz and their star player selfish ballhog Lewis Scott Wayans. After losing game six it's on to game seven where either the Celts or the Jazz will become the champions. So Mike and Jimmy go to a nightclub after the game and get drunk with Scott before they wake up in Mike's basement with him tied up and no recollection of the events that took place the night before.Mike and Jimmy find out from their copbuddy Guilfoyle that kidnapping is kidnapping no matter what time they let the victim go. So they think they should show something for it and hold Lewis till after game seven so the Celts have a good shot of winning. Their plan goes awry when the cad starts playing mindgames with the two in order to disassemble their longtime friendship.This is one of the comedies you have to search under the bed for. Even with Akroyd Stern and Wayans on the cover this film is usually lost in the dust compared to Akroyd's others like The Great Outdoors and Ghostbusters. This isn't better than those two works of comedic gold but they do present the same feelgood aspect and have a warm fuzzy classic feeling to them.The pairing of Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern wasn't unlikely at the time and they do a good job at being the two buddies. The funniest stuff is from Damon though as he continues to play games with Mike's head saying that you're his bitch and consistently taunts him. Thankfully the movie isn't just made up of these games because if it was I don't think we could call this a buddy comedy.Now that it's 2011 I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's name all over this film as producer story creator and writer. The current generation knows Apatow for making heartfelt with an essence of raunch and silly comedydrama premises. In the nineties he was more about the laughs than the drama. Celtic Pride can also serve as a time capsule of a different time in a filmmaker's life.Celtic Pride doesn't overshoot or overstay its welcome. It runs for a comfortable ninetyone minutes and it goes by quickly. A different side of sports comedies adding flavor and a good amount of heart Celtic Pride has green and white blood pumping thru its veins.Starring Dan Akroyd Daniel Stern and Damon Wayans.

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Falk leads a gang of smalltime thieves Peter Boyle Paul Sorvino Warren Oates Allan Garfield et al who pull off the biggest robbery of the century get caught and go to jail.The director William Friedkin and the screenwriter Walon Green do a fine and delicate job of balancing the three elements of the story  comedy drama and tension.Mostly it's comic and the laughs are due not so much to the imposition of obvious gags though there is some slapstick as to the ludicrous nature of the thieves themselves and the job they undertake not an armed robbery but a pasquinade. The amusing lines somehow ring true because the setting is workingclass Boston its brick tenements and skeletal wooden porches and staircases and its stone streets and old cars and dilapidated clothing and its spent values. Look at dis coat brags Falk as he hands his wife a garment of shabby fur bought with some stolen money. Dat's genuine muskrat. It says so right on da label. I don't want to tell you what it cost because it's a gift and dat ain't right but here's da receipt in case somebody asks you where you got it. The drama comes later after the robbery is successfully pulled off and Peter Boyle is holding the 1.5 million until the statue runs out.

Will they get the money? Will someone be killed in the getting of it? And there is additional tension when Warren Oates and his coconspirator Kevin O'Connor are arrested and given ten times the usual sentence for minor crimes the FBI hoping that the pressure and the beatings will cause them to squeal.That's a plot hole. The FBI is involved on a pretext and spends 25 million to solve a 1.5 million robbery because the director J.

Cut to Oates and O'Connor having a meal in a diner in Tonowanda Pennsylvania on their way to Pittsburgh. A couple of state troopers walk through the door and arrest them. Well  why? Oates is convicted of an infraction involving the carrying of firearms and gets a sentence of 20 years instead of the usual 18 months. The FBI is sitting in the audience smiling with satisfaction. And O'Connor is given several years for equally smalltime infractions and is beaten all to hell to get the story out of him. But how did the FBI  or anyone else  know that Oates and O'Connor were involved? And how did they know where to locate the pair during their peregrinations? But that aside it's an entertaining story. Friedkin doesn't make the same mistake as Arthur Penn did in Bonny and Clyde. Nobody is romanticized. One of the robbers has a loving family but that's about as far as it goes.

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Falk leads a gang of smalltime thieves Peter Boyle Paul Sorvino Warren Oates Allan Garfield et al who pull off the biggest robbery of the century get caught and go to jail.The director William Friedkin and the screenwriter Walon Green do a fine and delicate job of balancing the three elements of the story  comedy drama and tension.Mostly it's comic and the laughs are due not so much to the imposition of obvious gags though there is some slapstick as to the ludicrous nature of the thieves themselves and the job they undertake not an armed robbery but a pasquinade. The amusing lines somehow ring true because the setting is workingclass Boston its brick tenements and skeletal wooden porches and staircases and its stone streets and old cars and dilapidated clothing and its spent values. Look at dis coat brags Falk as he hands his wife a garment of shabby fur bought with some stolen money. Dat's genuine muskrat. It says so right on da label. I don't want to tell you what it cost because it's a gift and dat ain't right but here's da receipt in case somebody asks you where you got it. The drama comes later after the robbery is successfully pulled off and Peter Boyle is holding the 1.5 million until the statue runs out. Boyle has already disposed of an easily identified fifty grand by flushing it down the toilet enraging the others and now he refuses to divvy up the remainder.The tension is generated during the robbery itself. Will they get the money? Will someone be killed in the getting of it?

	schema:headline " To Brink's Tony";
	schema:reviewBody "Words almost fail me in talking about how much I love this film this very funny very stylish portrayal of what was considered the robbery of the last century.First of all it could never have been done earlier. J. Edgar Hoover was not a figure to be satirized before May of 1972 when he breathed his last. Sheldon Leonard who plays him here and has him get it all wrong about who pulled the Brink's Armored Car Robbery would not have taken the role neither would any other actor. No one wanted to be on that man's bad side. Hoover was not quite the figure you see Leonard play here though Leonard is fine in the part. Books and films subsequent to his death still really haven't got it quite right about him.For all of J. Edgar's fulminations about the great Communist conspiracy at work in the Brink's job the whole point of The Brink's Job is who actually did it. Six very ordinary street criminals none of them violent felons in any way and one fence who declared himself in on the job.The group is headed by Peter Falk who should have been Oscar nominated for his portrayal of Tony Pino the group's leader and planner. You see The Brink's Job Peter Falk will remain with you forever. A man without complications and hangups he's a thief because it's his profession. He does have pride in how good he is though.Some of Falk's best scenes are with his wife Gena Rowlands. She too is a woman who stands by her man. No doubt they came from the same hardscrabble background in Boston's Italian North End and she's completely supportive of him and his work. In particular I love the scene where she's bidding him off to work just like any other wife who's husband had a night job. Don't forget your screwdriver here's a sandwich in case you get hungry the scene is priceless.I also love the scene in the restaurant where he takes her after a nice score. Falk is at the height of his considerable talents as he tells Rowlands of his plans for the Brink's Armored Car Company.What everyone will love when they see this film is how comparatively easy it was for these knockabout guys from Boston to accomplish stealing over 4 million dollars. This score was so big it HAD to be the work of a master criminal mind. The thing is it was the mind was just not in a body where you would expect it to be found.The others in the mob are Paul Sorvino Kevin O'Connor Warren Oates Gerard Murphy and Peter Boyle who plays the fence. But my favorite in the mob and in the film is Allen Garfield who plays Falk's brotherinlaw and sidekick who Falk keeps around for laughs. They have an AbbottCostello like relationship with everything Garfield touches turning to waste product. My favorite scene in the whole film is when they decide to rob a gum factory payroll. Poor Garfield accidentally presses the wrong switch and he's awash in gumballs. Falk's and Sorvino's differing reactions are priceless.A lot of the film was shot in Boston which in many ways is a city that tries more than most to keep it's traditional look. I haven't been in that city in about five years but I daresay you could remake The Brink's Job today in the same area.But if you did it wouldn't be as good that isn't possible.".

Alan Garfield who was in Mother Jugs and Speed Slither Busting ... and Paul Sorvino who was in Where's Poppa The Gambler etc. And then Warren Oates as well!? The most recognizable character actor of the decade!! Warren Oates was the Steve Buscemi of the 70s. Cockfighter Race with the Devil Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia The Border Dillinger etc. etc. etc. The Brink's Job is funny and tight with a once in a life time cast for 70s movie buffs.";

I had never heard of the Great Brink's Robbery until watching this movie but William Friedkin managed to turn it into a fun story. Peter Falk Peter Boyle Warren Oates Gena Rowlands Paul Sorvino Sheldon Leonard and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. It was a pleasant surprise to see Malachy McCourt the brother of Angela's Ashes author Frank McCourt in a supporting role. It so happened that I had watched this just a few hours after watching the horrorfantasy flick Q which also featured him in a supporting role. It was a pure coincidence that I rented two movies that happened to star him.All in all a good movie. I suspect that they had fun filming it. Really different turn for Friedkin after The French Connection and The Exorcist.Put another way the movie stars Columbo Frankenstein's monster one of the Wild Bunch the woman under the influence Henry Kissinger and the producer of several TV shows and namesake of the main characters on The Big Bang Theory.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Brink's Job is a comedy caper film based on a real crime. The January 17 1950 Brink's robbery in Boston was called the Crime of the Century. This movie is a light treatment of the event and the characters who pulled it off. The movie implies that none of those involved in the incident squealed and it omits anything to do with killing. In reality the gang tried to kill Specs O'Keefe who was imprisoned for anther petty robbery after this one. O'Keefe was mentally unstable and the gang thought he might talk. But after their attempts to kill him failed he apparently talked to the FBI and named all involved. While the movie just shows seven people involved in the heist there actually were 11. Except for three who died all who were convicted and sent to prison were out within 14 years  by 1971. The 2.7 million heist included 1.2 million in cash and the rest in bonds and checks. Just 53000 was ever recovered to this day. The acting is good by the entire cast in this film. It was shot in Boston. The robbery was two years in the works  with careful casing of the Brink's place. Considering the first 40 years of the 20th century with so many bank robberies the very low level of actual security measures by Brink's in 1950 is astonishing. But as Peter Falk's Tony Pino says in the movie the Brink's people were so cheap they didn't want to spend money on real security. Instead they lied in their advertisements about the great security they provided. The movie notes how the gang members were idolized by some youth of the day. This romantic and lighthearted treatment of crime is fun but I wonder about it when it involves real crime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ostensibly about the competitiveness between gifted young pianists this picture is actually about ambition disappointment sacrifice love betrayal and a lot more. By the time this film was made Dreyfuss had already fallen into his period of selfadulation during which he exalted himself but sometimes sadly not his work. Amy Irving had not yet married and divorced Steven Spielberg a move that for many reasons probably ended her career in Hollywood. As leads they both came to their roles in perfect form and their intelligent and layered performances are the centerpiece of this astounding ensemble cast.The movie does a great job of convincing us that we are looking through the keyhole into the rarefied world of young pianists who look upon the likes Vladimir Ashkenazy as a peer while still finding themselves as adults. They angst over their futures which always seem just out of reach and then render performances of the classical repertoire that amaze and delight. All the while they trip through the comically serious pas de deux of youthful obsession.Lee Remick is stunning as the demanding teacher to Heidi Joan Schoonover Irving. I get the feeling that the original character was supposed to be a lesbian but Remick's instrument won't play that note. Instead she is a hardnosed totally serious singleminded taskmaster who demands and brings forth the best from her pupil. Dreyfuss is the driven and desperate young man who while gifted has never been able to break through as a serious musician and who hounded by financial responsibilities and tempted by a job that cannot possibly provide more than a paycheck runs the risk of being washed up at 25. They become romantically involved much to Remick's dismay only to find themselves competing head to head for the most coveted prize in their field. Can they work it out knowing that only one of them can win? Hey it's the 80's!There are basically two kinds of movies. Those in which things happen and those in which we get to know the characters. This is a shining example of the latter. I've loved this film since its original release but I still yearn for a DVD edition.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Competition is a very enjoyable movie and delves slightly into the stress of pianocompetition. There are more shenanigans goingon that are not apparent in this type of competition not only for the many pianists' stresses but also on the part the judges play in choosing the finalist. Those competitions deal with humans and ANYTHING can influence the judges' decisions. The best pianist does not always win. This movie shows some of the competitors' required pieces being performed it's more than the concertoplaying part of the contest. In many competitions the pianist is given an unfamiliar score for sightreading and affects the final judgment. The concertoplaying event is always the big one after making it to that event the stress is almost unbearable. You only get to play the concerto once anything can screw it up. When a major artist releases ANY recorded concerto the general public does not always realize the recording is not done in one sitting. Just like scenes in a movie many passages are recorded several times and the best chosen to splice them all seamlessly together. For the concertoplaying event you have one crack at it. Heck one could play flawlessly but a judge may just not like them at that particular performance. Very similar to skating in the Olympics deals are made too.....Many years ago I was a concertpianist talent. To me ALL of the six finalists' synchronized banging looked pretty good. It is my opinion some of the competitors who didn't make it to the big event WERE actually playing. AND I also think that Tatjana Vicki Kriegler was actually playing the short sequences of Braham's 1st Concerto. I'm very familiar with that concerto and it's a killer. What convinces me of this is the curve of her fingers of her left hand which is necessary to play those big chords. After all actorsactresses DO play piano !!! Her role didn't call for her to place anyway......I also agree that Heidi Amy Irving almost convinced me she was playing Prokofiev's 3  another ballbuster. Great coaching! That entire scene was brilliant with Erskine Sam Wanamaker looking over his shoulder at her realizing Dietrich's Richard Dreyfus performance was popular with the audience did you notice the orchestra stoodup? but Heidi made them all look like firstyear students. Po' ole DiSalvo Joseph Cali had to follow her ! Most comments thought Greta Vandernmann Lee Remick was abitchonwheels teacher. Brava Lee ! She was only certain her pupil was the best but her own career had taught her raw talent wasn't the only ingredient necessary to make a worldclass pianist. Just like footballcoaches pianoteachers can be brutally tyrannical  not nice at all. Does anyone remember the admonishment those who can't play teach? Lots of jealousy in there......It doesn't matter that the plot of this movie was predictable  Paul WAS a bit too assured and rude. The gottamakeastop scene told the whole story we are there to make music not sex. Noticeably it was Paul's last shot Heidi had nothing to lose and was confident of her talent. The chemistry between the two was there with brilliant acting  especially Ineverthoughtyoucouldplaybetterthanme scene. The entire cast was stellar as was the directing.Oh  for stetsons  there ARE DVDs available on eBay. Be careful what you buy ! And many DVDs of all of the concerti by many great artists are available. If you want to revel in this awesome music imagine how the entireties of these concerti will wow you  you heard only passages of each. For the Prokofiev piece just remember Heidi's hands.....The Competition has something for all kinds of moviewatchers. Good acting believable characters a little political intrigue a little backstage intrigue lovely cinematography and all that great music. What a winner  10 no doubt !".

	schema:reviewBody "Amy Irving Richard Dreyfuss Lee Remick and Sam Wanamaker star in The Competition a 1980 film written and directed by Joel Oliansky. The story concerns pianists gathering for the semifinals of a competition in San Francisco. Paul Dietrich Dreyfuss has one last shot at a career as a pianist given his age and the fact that his parents have been supporting him and his dad is in bad shape. Heidi Irving knew Paul from a summer program. She studies with a top teacher Greta Vandeman Remick and is there basically to see how far she can go. Despite Paul's attempts to put off the smitten Heidi he finally admits his feelings and the two fall in love. Greta isn't happy  she's afraid Heidi is going to lose her competitive edge and take a back seat so that Paul can win.This very good movie is just about overshadowed by the brilliant music and the magnificent fingerings and look of the actors as they're playing. They obviously had the benefit of great coaching.The film gives a realistic look at the tension of competitions and the various states of mind that people have going into them. For Paul it's his last shot the Joseph Cali character wants to use it as a steppingstone to Vegas and a Liberacetype act Heidi has nothing to lose. There is a lot of psychoanalysis throughout the film which some may find offputting. It does go on.Amy Irving is an excellent actress and she does a beautiful job here. Dreyfuss is also excellent coming off as desperate arrogant and sad. Lee Remick is the ultimate piano teacher who knows too well the pitfalls of being a woman particularly a woman in love.If you like classical piano don't miss The Competition.".

The film gives an insight as to what takes place in those competitions during which the participants must be aware of and protect themselves from the competitive edge of the other pianists. The acting by the entire cast and the directing is exceptional but what is more exceptional than that is the fingersynching of the actors while appearing to actually play the piano.  The late Lee Remick is outstanding as Amy Irving's teacher. A thoroughly enjoyable film with great acting script direction and music.  A tip of the hat should go to Jean Evensen Shaw and her assistant Dorothy Hull for tutoring the actors about where when and how to place their fingers on the keyboard.  But since nothing is ever perfect I can still imagine James Mason who wasn't in the movie rapping the knuckles of a few of the pianists because of poor hand position. Richard Dreyfuss was the worst. Amy Irving was perfect!  She had her hands always above the keys and did a stellar job of fingersynching the playing of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto 3 which is actually played by Daniel Pollack.  The 5 minutes and 25 seconds Amy Irving spent at the piano during the performance of that piece was one of the highlights of the film. I can't praise this film too highly.  However the end left something to be desired although not as much as one would think.  But I would be remiss in my praise if I didn't at least give the lion's share of the credit to Joel Oliansky for all the hard work he and his crew put into the making of this film and getting it to the public.".

	schema:headline " Great movie for pianists and musicians!";
	schema:reviewBody "Richard Dreyfuss Mr. Holland's Opus The Good Bye Girl   plays Paul Dietrich. a very problematic and sometimes annoying pianist. Paul is supported by his parents that puts pressure on him. He is also thirty years old and this is the cutting edge for this type of music competition.  This is his last competition. All he wants  to do is win no matter how  and is hurting himself because of it. Amy Irving Yentl  plays another pianist who is much more relaxed with herself and her music.  Her teacher Greta Vandemann played by  Lee Remick Anatomy of a Murder is possessive about Heidi. Greta Vandemann can trace her teachers all the way up to Beethoven  himself! Heidi does not have the pressures that Paul has she does not even care about winning. She stays in this beautiful house in San Francisco where she can practice on her nice piano and Paul stays in a cheap hotel. He is a walking volcano. He is petulant arrogant and annoying but at the same time can cry which shows that he is human vulnerable and also very afraid. He hides his feelings but it shows in his behavior. There are other musicians the black guy who likes practicing the piano naked the Italian who can play only one concerto but he is really looking for a way to become another  De Niro Pacino or Travolta. There is a very young Russian that adds a little suspense to the plot. They are all stereotypes. My favorite scenes are Paul teaching Heidi how to drive a car Heidi stopping playing in the middle of her performance because the middle register is uneven how beautifully she played Prokofiev s 3rd Concert Paul been astonished because he was unaware that she could really play Paul telling Greta that must to be a tremendous responsibility in having to know everything. Greta jumping for joy because she is always so proper. That shows another side to her. This is an enjoyable movie especially for pianists and musicians.".

	schema:headline " Hollywood goes classical";
	schema:reviewBody "I was about to start this review by pointing out that I think 'The Competition' is merely an example of 'typical Hollywood schmaltz but that would be unfair. For one thing it's not 'typical'. There I've got that out of the way.Directed by once only director Joel Oliansky. it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving as a pair of duelling pianists who are trying to win the piano competition of the title. Dreyfuss is a mercurial genius in two minds whether to persist with his career as other pianists are receiving the recognition he feels he deserves. For this reason he is losing his perseverance to carry on and feels that he should abandon his nomadic life of travelling around the country competing in these types of events and just 'get a life' like everyone else. Irving is the conscientious worker with a dedicated teacher with a little luck and perseverance she can be a winner and doesn't need the brashness of Dreyfuss to succeed. Irving and Dreyfuss are meant to be competing with each other but what do they do? Yep you guessed it. Questions arise as to who is the most dedicated which one of them deserves a career in classical music and how fate somehow has a role in all our lives  more than we are prepared to admit.The piano performances as captured on film are better than most. The two actors trained to mimic at least the appearance of playing at concert level. Their piano performances were actually recorded by two prodigies of that era Daniel Pollack and Chester B. Swiatkowski and then dubbed later on. Aside from this competent presentation of piano music penned by the great classical composers and performed with an accuracy that Hollywood is not renowned for 'The Competition' is unfortunately a little bit dull. Sam Wanamaker has a small but entertaining role as a temperamental conductor who takes no nonsense from his students in the competition. The respective parents of the protagonists for example are stock characters and are brought into the story for a bit of interest but their impact is minimal. There are a few interesting minor characters who round out the competitors but they have minimal screen time. One subplot involves an eastern bloc competitor defecting to the west but it really is of less interest than the main plot involving whether Irving and Dreyfuss can overcome their differences and have a romantic relationship away from their individual dedication to the piano.The principal thespians Amy Irving and Richard Dreyfuss have onscreen rapport and work well with each other. But somehow they spend too much time either in competition or going out on dates and wondering if this means whether they're having a relationship or not. Amy Irving was at one stage married to Stephen Spielberg. She was an extremely talented young actress but her career seemed not to go anywhere appearing to fall out of favour with the public. Richard Dreyfuss subsequently had a hiatus due to personal problems but had the talent to return and carry on his successful career. My perennial favourite Lee Remick has a featured role as Irving's wise and demanding piano teacher and she looks beautiful and is a major asset to the project. Classical music is rarely used as the backdrop for a story in a Hollywood film and I suppose we should at least be grateful to 'The Competition' for that but otherwise in most other respects it is the type of conventional entertainment we have come to expect from Hollywood 'The Competition' just scrapes by with a pass mark from me because of the music and if it tweaks your interest in the subject become a member of Naxos and you can get your classical music education from there.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been quite a few years since I've seen this movie so forget all the details but remember it more as an engrossing character study than a romance...and all with the added attraction of the classical piano context. The story is set at a prestigious piano competition in San Francisco. Paul is considered an older contestant at age 25. This is his last chance for a prestigious win that will spare him a teaching career and also please the father who is so proud of his son. Heidi is the lovely young newcomer virtuoso who poses his major competition. Winning is much more crucial here to Paul than to Heidi. Not unexpectedly romantic feelings develop between the two rivals who must both strive to be at their peak for the competition performances.The lead roles are well cast with Richard Dreyfuss portraying the talented but desperate musician Paul and Amy Irving his gifted  more relaxed competitor Heidi. I was impressed at the finger synching method used during the piano performances. Though not a musician myself it seemed convincing to me that these actors were actually playing the pieces. I've remembered all these years that it was a Prokofiev Concerto that Heidi played so brilliantly. Lee Remick is Heidi's teacher Gretchen a possessive and demanding taskmaster who naturally does not approve of the budding romance.The movie is not limited simply to rivals Paul and Heidi but an assortment of other admittedly rather stereotypical competitors are also featured. This is a drama depicting in general the tension rivalry ambition disappointment  triumph of high stakes competition whatever the field. Therefore the themes are something a lot of viewers even non musicians can relate to in one way or another. Of course there is a question of potential sacrifice here as these two competitors have fallen in love. Whatever the chemistry between Paul  Heidi the romance itself is quite forgettable. The fierce competition rivalry and the backdrop of classical piano are the memorable elements that distinguish this film from all the other love stories out there. This is a must see movie for pianists and indeed all classical music lovers.".

Both movies tell a little bit on how some people are so obsessed with practicing for a piano competition and teachers who are almost or not almost always strict in pianistic interpretation.But what makes The Competition even better than Madame Sousatka or Shine is how a romance can make or break piano competition training and how winning a competition can change your life for the better. The best character I liked was the one played by Amy Irving.During the final competition scene where competing piano concerto participants play with a full orchestra you hear snipets from some of the great piano concertos that are still played today. They were the Haydn D Major Concerto The G minor by SaintSaens the 3rd Concerto in C Major by Prokofiev and the Emperor Piano Concerto by Beethoven.".

Only she sought the piano for the love of the piano.In many ways Dreyfus' character evoked Jack Nicholson's Oedipean quest for paternal acceptance of worth in the classic Five Easy Pieces.Dreyfus was also able to play young since he was 33 when the film was released whereas Irving was actually 25 when the film was made.".

Only she sought the piano for the love of the piano.In many ways Dreyfus' character evoked Jack Nicholson's Oedipean quest for paternal acceptance of worth in the classic Five Easy Pieces.Dreyfus was also able to play young since he was 33 when the film was released whereas Irving was actually 25 when the film was made.";

Here Paul Dietrich Richard Dreyfuss must decide whether to get a real job or continue his attemptat his parents' expenseto become a great concert pianist. Though things don't look too promising at his age he decides to take one LAST attempt at his longplanned career as a concert pianist before throwing in the towel. This chance arises with an announced competition in San Francisco. When he arrives another pianist Hiedie Joan Schoonover Amy Irvin recognizes him from a previous competition at Tanglewood even though he pretends not to recognize her at first. Paul vows NOT to become romantically involved with her since he knows that personal involvement and competition do not mix!!! However an unforeseen delay in the finals coupled with devastating news from home draws Paul to Heidi in spite of his vow. Another element to the story is that Heidi's teacher Greta Vandermann Lee Remick wants to continue a teacherpupil linage which stems clear back to Beethoven. So this competition is also Greta's chance to continue this linage. The movie is also enhanced by Sam Wanamaker who makes a great temperamental conductor. For the record in the portrayed competition Paul performs Beethoven's Emperor Concerto and Heidi performs Prokofiev's 3rd Piano Concerto.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing about this film from 1980 is that it really is an odd duck. How many movies do you see where the outcome of the plot hinges on a piano concerto? It's hard to imagine a movie like this being made today except as an indie film  no car chases explosions fights and not even anyone you could legitimately call a villain. The world of classical music is front and center from beginning to end as seen through the progress of the six finalists in an ultraprestigious competition for young pianists held in San Francisco. The story concentrates on Paul Richard Dreyfuss and Heidi Amy Irving but we get intriguing looks at the other four finalists too through briefer vignettes. The time spent on those others probably does take away from a fuller development of the growing relationship between the two main characters and it leaves a bit of a messy overall structure but I think it's worth it  everything adds usefully to the context so that we get a picture of how all their different personalities fit in and what their different goals are. We get to see the total exhilaration of nailing a performance as well as the crushing loss for the ones who didn't make it through. Not surprisingly Richard Dreyfuss plays Paul with wild ups and downs mixing male ego fragility and generosity unpredictably. Though Heidi's a bit younger she's steadier more selfconfident and the control voice in their relationship. They go through three or four cycles of Paul messing up and then finding ways to apologize which continues right up to the final scene. The first time around he meekly asks Heidi 'Can we talk?' and Heidi replies icily 'So far there's no evidence of that.' If he wants her he'll have to work a bit harder. The actors in the cast who are most successful at getting this unique world right may be the veterans Lee Remick playing a former concert pianist herself and now Heidi's stern worldlywise teacher and Sam Wanamaker the egotistical and somewhat overbearing conductor. They're great. The dialog is quirky at times leaving the impression that every second line is missing or that the actors were given first drafts of a script that never quite got polished. The flip side is that it's often unpredictable  they say or do things you weren't expecting to happen. The biggest examples are the final performances themselves under incredible pressure knowing this might be his last chance Paul delivers the performance of his life with the Beethoven Emperor Concerto. It's the culmination of his whole career and in a normal feelgood plot victory seems like it's lock. But the next night Heidi goes out and gives the performance of her life with the Prokofiev concerto  and it's better.There are lots of other little gems such as the scene where Paul and Heidi are walking on the San Francisco wharf arguing intensely but run randomly into three French sailors why sailors? why French?? who knows.. Paul angrily starts a disorganized scuffle with them but then Heidi shouts Paul! Open your hands! realizing that if he slugs one of them he'll damage his fingers. Then to defuse things she tells the sailors in mangled French that her 'fiance' is terminally ill. And near the end after the competition is all over and the celebrations have begun we see Remick quietly go off alone and leap for joy experiencing the unique type of victory that only a teacher can feel.Most of all there's the music. Lots of it Liszt SaintSaens Chopin Beethoven Brahms Prokofiev Mozart. Other reviewers have described how the actors trained hard to handsync with the music to make their playing look like the real thing as much as possible. Irving is the most successful at this. Her performance of the Prokofiev which really is ferociously difficult is amazing and for me this sequence is the high point of the film. It's worth saying too that all the characters from the conductor and teachers on through the competitors are shown as totally respecting the music itself and the process of performing even though personality clashes and maneuvering go on behind the scenes.There aren't many films this one can be compared with. There is Rhapsody from 1954 Counterpoint 1967 Shine 1996 A Late Quartet 2012 and of course Amadeus 1984. Some of these were betterdone and higherprofile movies but they all use classical music mainly as a setting for character interaction. The Competition focuses more purely on the music itself and the process of performance and that's its main strength.Thankfully you can get this on DVD now.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Competition is a wellcrafted movie that features some interesting ideas about forbidden romance but it is highly forgettable in the end. If anything the movie is a good showcase for Richard Dreyfuss five years removed from his breakthrough performance in Jaws. The film also features a good deal of music and the piano work is masterful and soothing to the ears. However this is really not about a piano competition or music. At its core we get a sweet and perhaps a bit superficial love story between two pianists. There is a huge international piano competition occurring in San Francisco where the world's best pianists gather to compete against each other. The first place prize is a 20000 cash reward and a twoyear concert contract. This is Paul's Richard Dreyfuss last chance to win the prize. However newcomer Heidi Amy Irving might be the slightly better pianist. The two rivals form an unlikely romance but is it likely to survive? The reason the movie rises above mediocrity is because of its performances. Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving have a great rapport with each other. They are charming and it is obvious their chemistry is strong. Lee Remick gives a strong supporting performance as Heidi's piano coach Greta. Greta has a belief that Paul is trying to psychologically undermine her student so he can take the grand prize. I also must give credit to the actors for making us believe they play their own pianos. According to the end credits there are actual pianists playing the music. I don't have a trained eye so I believed they were playing the music for real.The Competition is a warm genuinelysweet movie about an offbeat romance between two unlikely lovers. Is it a great movie? Not particularly but no one can complain about a little syrup in our movies can we? I would have liked more emphasis on the actual competition and there is a weird subplot regarding a Russian piano teacher defecting to the United States that doesn't quite fit in. But in the end this is a showcase for Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving to show off their talents and their chemistry. My Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Amy Irving and Richard Dreyfuss do the ageold movieclich shelovesme shelovesmenot shtick and this schizophrenic willIorwon'tI tugofwar relationshipclaptrap stuff predictably goes on for the entire two hours duration. Just as you think that they'd finally decided whether they'd be together forever and ever or not some MONUMENTAL event such as she plays the piano better than me once again occurs standing in the way of yet another perfect Hollywood foreverandever marriage ending.Actually not that perfect. The two weren't much of a match. I have no idea why they used to cast Dreyfuss of all people in romantic comedies and dramas of that period. In The Goodbye Girl 1977 he was cast opposite Marsha Mason who though not a ravishing beauty was far too attractive for the little speedtalking energizer bunny. Ditto Amy Irving. Even sillier it is SHE who is desperately clinging on to the relationship whereas he is being wishywashy about it dumping her every five minutes for reasons that border on the utterly ridiculous i.e. forced unconvincing plotdevices were being used to keep the romance on shaky ground. I very much doubt that the real Dreyfuss ever dumped a goodlooking girlfriend  ever. This didn't exactly serve to make the sentimental goingson any more realistic...Watching Dreyfuss mouth I love you was a definite low point. Another cringeworthy moment came in the aftermath of Amy's victory when she turned to Dreyfuss and gave him a fartoo emotional speech  uttered at something closely approaching the speed of light. Even Dreyfuss was shamed not by the fact that she plays the piano better then him but the fact that she can also talk quicker! A weird directorial touch was Lee Remick being shown jumping from joy  in slow motion! What was that about?...But to be fair TC is not a bad movie. The main reason for this is that weepy handkerchieftype Hallmarkproduction boredhousewife sentimentality was largely avoided. This is by no means a rerun of The Love Story. Other positive aspects are the occasionally good score a nice twist having the dull Mozart replaced by the far superior Prokofiev the attractive female cast and a closer if not exactly very close look at the world of classical music and all the exaggerated pomp that goes along with it.Seriously now Dreyfuss had only himself to blame for not winning the competition. If he had only tried a classical version of Slayer's Reign In Blood... Tis Slayer's 3rd Symphony.I am still hopeful that Amy Irving will get a statue built in her honour for taking Spielberg apart financially in that legendary divorce settlement.".

	onyx:emotionText "Amy Irving and Richard Dreyfuss do the ageold movieclich shelovesme shelovesmenot shtick and this schizophrenic willIorwon'tI tugofwar relationshipclaptrap stuff predictably goes on for the entire two hours duration. Just as you think that they'd finally decided whether they'd be together forever and ever or not some MONUMENTAL event such as she plays the piano better than me once again occurs standing in the way of yet another perfect Hollywood foreverandever marriage ending.Actually not that perfect. The two weren't much of a match. I have no idea why they used to cast Dreyfuss of all people in romantic comedies and dramas of that period. In The Goodbye Girl 1977 he was cast opposite Marsha Mason who though not a ravishing beauty was far too attractive for the little speedtalking energizer bunny. Ditto Amy Irving. Even sillier it is SHE who is desperately clinging on to the relationship whereas he is being wishywashy about it dumping her every five minutes for reasons that border on the utterly ridiculous i.e. forced unconvincing plotdevices were being used to keep the romance on shaky ground. I very much doubt that the real Dreyfuss ever dumped a goodlooking girlfriend  ever. This didn't exactly serve to make the sentimental goingson any more realistic...Watching Dreyfuss mouth I love you was a definite low point. Another cringeworthy moment came in the aftermath of Amy's victory when she turned to Dreyfuss and gave him a fartoo emotional speech  uttered at something closely approaching the speed of light. Even Dreyfuss was shamed not by the fact that she plays the piano better then him but the fact that she can also talk quicker! A weird directorial touch was Lee Remick being shown jumping from joy  in slow motion! What was that about?...But to be fair TC is not a bad movie. The main reason for this is that weepy handkerchieftype Hallmarkproduction boredhousewife sentimentality was largely avoided. This is by no means a rerun of The Love Story. Other positive aspects are the occasionally good score a nice twist having the dull Mozart replaced by the far superior Prokofiev the attractive female cast and a closer if not exactly very close look at the world of classical music and all the exaggerated pomp that goes along with it.Seriously now Dreyfuss had only himself to blame for not winning the competition. If he had only tried a classical version of Slayer's Reign In Blood... Tis Slayer's 3rd Symphony.I am still hopeful that Amy Irving will get a statue built in her honour for taking Spielberg apart financially in that legendary divorce settlement.";

Scenes of the camel having dinner with the couple and humming along as Zygmunt practices clarinet are standouts. It's rare to see someone star and direct simultaneously with such grace Jerzy Stuhr.  I also believe we can never have too many lessons about individuality social conformity tolerance and so on.  Having said that I must say that this was arguably the biggest misrepresentation of a film by its critics since Muriel's Wedding.  I remember that movie being touted as a comedy and I thought it was anything but.  I read reviews for The Big Animal with descriptions such as hilarious delightful family movie. Are they kidding?  Granted we see no violence as a matter of fact we don't know exactly what happens to the camel which is probably just as well.  There are sufficient indications that it's not good.  What I found as depressing as the camel's fate is the fact that an entire town  save one little girl  could so viciously turn against two of its longtime upstanding citizens over something so minor.  A camel wanders into their lives they love the camel they simply want to keep it and let it enjoy life without exploitation.  Apparently in this village that's too much to ask.Having read other imdb comments I'm intrigued by how differently I responded to some scenes.  Someone here wrote about not being able to stop laughing at a scene in which the townspeople gather outside the couple's house silent and grimfaced one holding a sign that says OUT.  I found this scene terribly upsetting.  The intolerance of the community is despicable.  Once they finally take matters into their own hands without taking responsibility all done in cowardice during the night they turn around and say boorish things to Zygmunt like It's for the best let's let bygones be bygones.  If I were faced with such cruelty from my socalled neighbors I would pack my bags and tell them all where to go.I understand that this story is a fable filled with symbolism and metaphor and as such is essentially over the top.  It's best not to consider it in terms of strict realism.  But I cried for ten minutes after this film ended for the couple's plight as well as the camel's.  Their reward for being kind decent people is to discover they don't have a single friend in their own community.  Though the final scene is gentle and beautiful it wasn't enough I left the theater filled with despair.  The Big Animal is a beautiful quality film full of important life lessons.  I just wish the lessons could've been learned by the people in the story who needed to learn them  and offered to us the audience with a degree of hope in the end.".

The other two were Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius and The Legend Of Bagger Vance.This is a true underdog story if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheardof feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book and I know that in reallife Francis Ouimet had a threestroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the film.Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans this is a fun movie. Kudso to actorturneddirector Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.Yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans.Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day maybe even more unbeatable. In the film Vardon is pictured as a warm nice guy a genuine human being. the other major competitor Ray Stephen Marcus is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film a fifthgrade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He Josh Flitter brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.If all of this  a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole  were not true you would think Oh man this is so hokey. Who could believe this? That's what makes this truelife story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005  Cinderella Man  here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.".

I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.";

	schema:headline " Great Disney Sports Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. What I loved best however is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a workingclass drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class his mother however recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.Finally the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending as in Miracle is not some Disney creation but one that only human history could have written.".

A Truly Moving Picture ...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop this basedonatruestory unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world Harry Vardon.And the story is inspirational. Against all odds Francis Ouimet played by Shia LaBeouf of Holes gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is illprepared and has a child for a caddy. The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in. But despite these handicaps Francis displays courage spirit heroism and humility at this world class event.And we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden clubs the layout of the short holes the manual scoreboard the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable.This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of Miracle and Remember the Titans.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut the Gothichorror Frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as The Greatest Game Ever Played. I'm no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with Miracle and Cinderella Man but some how this film was enthralling all the same.The film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's Carnivale and Rome but lumbers along slowly for its first bythenumbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes I loved the rainsoaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging periodpiece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.".

Classic story rings true because of Shia Labeouf's complex and adequate acting and stunningly realized by director Bill Paxton . Exceptional Shia Labeouf displaying a first rate performance reaching an important milestone and a terrific Stephen Dillane as his upright as well as serious contender . In the 1913 US Open 20yearold Francis Ouimet Shia Labeouf gets a chance as he played against his idol 1900 US Open champion  Englishman Harry Vardon Stephan Dillane . Amateur player Francis gets to achieve for big time  thanks to the coach  as he triumphs over by odds  but sheer determination helps them attain their dream . Ouimet dreams of playing final Open  as he gets the chance to participate in the International Golf Championship against his idol  no matter how farfetched the dream . Meanwhile  he falls in love for a rich young girl called Sarah Wallis Peyton List . But he has an intelligent skill to no match for the class boundaries  however  being pressurized by his father Elias Koteas . From the studio that brought you The rookie  Miracle and Remember the Titans is realized this agreeable tale based on the 1913 USA Open in which took part famous international champs  it contains a classic plot and deals about a slice of American history  and is plenty of good feeling  heartfelt interesting characters and formidable performances . However  sometimes is some sentimental and predictable but is still pretty amusing . Correctly based on real events as the actual Francis Ouimet and Eddie Lowery remained life long friends . When Ouimet died in 1967 Lowery was one of the pallbearers . Likable and enjoyable plot about a young golfer and his coach and caddie  both of them face the dual challenge to win a world championship and redeeming themselves . Splendid film from the filmmaker Bill Paxton and writerproducer Mark Frost of another David beats Goliath sports movie  similarly to Rudy with Sean Astin and Hoosiers with Gene Hackman  and it is even better than The legend of Bagger Vance with Will Smith and Matt Damon . Sentimental plot stretches Hollywood manipulation  but is still entertaining . Shia LaBeouf delivers an engaging acting as Francis Ouimet  he is backed by a good supporting cast such as Luke Askew as Alec Campbell  Stephen Marcus as Ted Ray  Peter Firth as Lord Northcliffe  Len Cariou as Stedman  Elias Koteas as his stiff father Arthur Ouimet and special mention to Stephan Dillane as Harry Vardon  protagonist's idol as well as contender . Spectacular and rousing musical score by Brian Tyler  fitting perfectly to action . Fine production design and good sets  filmmakers had trouble filling the fields with extras for the final game and needed to move people around when shooting different angles  extras were given 1910's hairstyles and their clothing was checked for anachronisms . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Shane Hurlbut  filmed at the Kanawaki Golf Club outside Montreal Quebec producers had the club house painted yellow for the film from its original white. Members so liked the change that they kept the color following filming. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Bill Paxton  he's a notorious producerdirector and especially actor  being this one his second film  the first one was a nice terror film titled Frailty with Matthew McConaughey . Rating  Better than average  worthwhile seeing .".

I used to snicker at the overdramatic title but through great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton better known for his acting in Twister and hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies we find out that this has much more meaning than a game.Though the movie is about golf it seems as though the sport is just the framework for what is really going on. What is really going on is a story of individuals being told they can't fulfill their dreams be it age or social status. A conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands. An English golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck.Shia LaBeouf Even Stevens plays Francis Ouimet a caddy with a Godgiven talent who was never permitted to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper class gentlemen it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by Elias Koteas Sugartime Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother Francis eventually comes face to face with his idol the golf legend Harry Vardon Stephen Dillane.More impressive than the game itself was the movie's cinematic achievement. This proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The entire movie could've been told without dialog. There are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures. In one particular scene Francis Ouimet swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intensely at Ouimet without a flinch. The ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment.A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and looks worth playing for and Josh Flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps Ouimet focused as the pressure bogs him down. Golf fan or not you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story.".

In one particular scene Francis Ouimet swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intensely at Ouimet without a flinch. The ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment.A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and looks worth playing for and Josh Flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps Ouimet focused as the pressure bogs him down. Golf fan or not you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest Game Ever Played loses points for having a terrible title. But it is an inspirational true story from Walt Disney studios and so every inch of melodrama is squeezed from it accompanied by appropriately swelling music. Which is not to say I didn't like the movie. I did enjoy it for what it was. As a person who golfs it was both interesting and frustrating to see how golf was played in the early part of the century but much more could have been done with the game of golf itself in the film. I think that nongolfers who don't know the game will find it hard to keep track of who is ahead in the matches which is a problem in the film's editing. Instead the story concentrates on two sub plots. The conflict between Shia LaBeouf and his father Elias Koteas. Shia is a natural golfer but his father is totally against it. The other sub plot is the desire to win back the US Open cup for England. This pits world famous champion Stephen Dillane against influential lords who are portrayed as gross oysterslurping upperclass snobs. There is also a small love story aside between Shia and Payton List. A standout in the film is little Josh Flitter who plays Shia's plucky caddy in a comic relief role which I found amusing but other may find annoying.As for the filmmaking the colors of the film are muted which gives it a nice look and since it's a period piece the costumes are interesting. Since golf itself is not very visually exciting the director chose to use Matrix style visuals such as having the camera fly behind the golf ball as it sails to the hole accompanied by a really huge swishing sound. There is one shot as if taken underneath glass looking up at a putt. If you can forgive the melodramatic musical swells you can find this film an enjoyable 2 hours and if you have any interest in golf it's one of the few movies about golf. If you are in the mood for an underdog film this one makes par.".

	schema:headline " Beautifully done!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest Game Ever Played is beautifully done. It is perfect in many if not all aspects. A real winner. It is not for everyone though. Most young people will probably be bored by it I mean golf isn't exactly the most exciting and action packed game ever invented. However for those with longer attention spans it is a very good movie that I really enjoyed.My hat goes off to Bill Paxton for a wonderful job directing. He manages to make the sport of golf actually interesting. To tell the truth I rolled my eyes when I saw this being billed as an epic. But it does fulfill the word although it doesn't even remotely compare to the likes of BenHur and Lawrence of Arabia.One of the biggest surprises about this movie is the performance given by Shia LaBeouf as Francis Ouimet. I was rather unsure about how good he would be especially after seeing him on the Disney Channel's TV show Even Stevens. But he was wonderful. LaBeouf's definite strength is in his facial expressions. He managed to show every emotion in just his face. If he continues to perform like this I can see a long and successful career carved out for him.Elias Koteas he plays Arthur Ouimet also gives a very strong performance. Just like with LaBeouf Koteas' strength is in facial expressions. It's a very strong and apparently heart felt performance.In my mind Stephen Dillane steals the show. His performance is captivating and seems to truly come from the heart. He perfectly captures the troubled character of Harry Vardon and I look forward to seeing more of him. Just with Koteas and LaBeouf Dillane is very good at showing emotion through his face. I truly admire and enjoyed his performance.What makes this movie so wonderful in my mind is the terrific chemistry the characters have. You don't know if you should be rooting for Vardon or Ouimet. THAT is the sign of a good movie.If you think you can handle it you can see this movie. But if you prefer the more action packed adventure flicks than don't bother seeing it because you won't be doing it justice.".

Don't let the Disney label lead you to think this is dumbeddown or only for kids  it has a lot to offer to all ages whether you like golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. And speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on TV this is no small feat.The first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through. Sure you root for Ouimet's character all along but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right. The background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses.The computer effects are flashy but they do help the story more often than not. The directing has all sorts of clever golf shots and the period costumes and sets are really top notch.There are a few small quibbles  many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn.Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is as usual callow and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane playing Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face but his intense often sad eyes and minor changes of expression say so much.Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery played by Josh Flitter steals the scenes he is in. After you see the film Google to find the actual photograph of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was.".

	schema:headline " Its just a great story... clich or not.";
	schema:reviewBody "Is this movie perfect? Certainly not. Is it clich? Yes. As you might read in other reviews or comments the story is typical of the average sports movie.The problem is... its true! So when you have a historically accurate more on that topic in a moment movie with a happy ending are you automatically doomed to mediocrity? I don't think so.As a huge fan of the book I was very concerned that the great story would be butchered in favor of a dumbeddown movie. And my first impression of the movie from the trailer was exactly that. They added a silly love interest to the movie that didn't exist historically. There was some unfortunate dialog that didn't quite fit with the feel of the story from a historical point of view. And Eddie didn't exactly look the way he does in some of the original photos.But with that said. It is still a good movie because it is an undeniably good story. Do the good guys win? Yes. But in real life they actually did win. So its hardly reasonable to expect them to change history in order to provide a different flavor of drama.As a golfer I liked this movie for several reasons. First it accurately represents a great story in my favorite sport. Second the story is set in a time that many golfers view with some degree of reverence. Hickory shafts brassies niblicks and golfers who still played in the rain. Finally I liked it because it is one of the few golf movies I have seen where the swings do not appear to be obviously faked. The actors swing as though they know how to play the game. And for me that goes a long way to enhancing the drama of the film.Now a note on historical accuracy. As with most movies that originated as a great book it falls short. That doesn't make it a bad movie it just means you have to know what to expect. Francis Harry Ted and Eddie all survived the translation from book to movie with little defacing. However many of the 'other' characters and stories that were important to the book didn't survive. This is to be expected or they would have had to make the movie 9 hours long.For those of you who know the story but haven't read the book. This is a nonfiction story of sorts. The only problem is that when Frost wrote the book he didn't always take the time to credit his source when he was attributing thoughts feelings or dialog to the characters. So it is occasionally difficult to tell the difference between dialog that is true to history and that which Mark Frost applied in the interests of dramatic license.As stated above the movie survives all of these problems in a way that I didn't expect. The movie stayed true to the large themes and main characters of the book. The movie survives the translation because it is true to the original theme. Perseverance.I am not a professional movie reviewer or writer for that matter so I won't bother getting in to my opinion about how the movie was made. I am sure someone else will comment on the relative cinematic value of the movie. Unfortunately many of the supposed movie experts are not going to know the story know the book or know the sport of golf. So it is unlikely that they will be able to accurately represent the way the movie will be perceived by golfers. Hopefully I have commented in a way that is useful to golfers.".

	schema:headline " Why alter history? It was a great story without revisionism";
	schema:reviewBody "Writing a movie script based on Mark Frost's excellent book was no doubt a daunting task doing a movie about any golf game has to be a challenge. And this rendition of the 1913 US Open was fair but perhaps failed most in not holding to the truth.First Francis Ouimet didn't beat Harry Vardon by one stroke  he beat him by five 72 to 77. Second Ted Ray didn't drop out of the final round as the movie depicted granted he did tell Vardon that he had basically given up because of his poor play but he was too much of a professional to walk off the course. He continued to play and carded a 78.Another distortion was having Ouimet drop out of golf completely for two years  didn't happen. And when he is asked two weeks before the Open to play this was a fabrication as well.Perhaps the greatest injustice not to the movie but to the game was to have someone utter the words that this was the greatest game ever played. Okay fine up to 1913 this was the greatest game but since then we've had 90 years of thousands of games so this is just a memory. NO THIS was the greatest game ever played asof 2005 not 1913. In the book we never read these words so why implant them? And talk about missing opportunities for a great laugh after the first day of competition when Ouimet looked like quite a competitor a club member suggested to Francis that he had proved his point and that he should drop out and let the pros take over. While Francis reacted in shock Eddie Lowery responded by asking the man if he was drunk. When I read the book I was sure we'd hear that line  but no the writers preferred to alter history rather than take advantage of a truthful and humorous episode.Would I recommend the movie? Perhaps as it is a fair rendition and gets the point across about this 20 year old overcoming all obstacles even his own to beat the greatest British golfer of all time. But I'd recommend the book even more.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not your usual scifi monster from the deep or outer space but a story based on comprehensible logic  the suggestion that the human mind and it's psychic and sixth sense qualities was the result of alien intervention with our ancestral primates millions of years ago. Andrew Keir plays a fine role as the tweedy dressed sometimes gruff gentleman professor Bernard Quatermass who teams up with  equally amiable James Donald as Dr.Mathew Roney and his attractive female assistant Barbara Shelley as Barbara Judd to solve the riddle of a strange craft and several ape like skeletons unearthed during the reconstruction of an underground London railway station. At first thought to be an unexploded second world war missile an Army demolition team is brought in to disarm it led by the bombastic single minded military thinking Colonel Breen played by Julian Glover who scoffs at the theories of the two scientists that this could be anything more than a German V weapon. The finding of large insect like creatures preserved within the hull of the craft and an analysis of their physical attributes leads Quatermass and Roney to conclude that they are Martians who along with their ape like passengers were killed as a result of a crash landing five million years beforehand. Quatermass also speculates that the apes had been previously taken from Earth to Mars and altered in order to give them Martian thinking characteristics which were then inherited by their human descendants. Breen dismisses the insect creatures as fakes and convinces his government superiors that the missile is safe against the advice of Quatermass Roney and Judd who have already discovered sinister awakenings within the craft after a workman dismantling his drill therein is seized upon by an invisible propelling force along with terrifying mental images. When the public and press are admitted to the site the craft comes to life generating a ghostly devil looking  apparition along with the now mind affected local population banding into groups and unleashing a killing spree on their own kind. Quatermass and Roney must now pool their scientific expertise to neutralize the menace and restore order. Nigel Kneale's compelling screenplay is sheer brilliance and gives this film a distinct and special uniqueness in the world of science fiction. A must see for the serious minded movie watcher.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant SciFi horror that will mesmerise and get you thinking!";
	schema:reviewBody "Quatermass and the Pit is one of the finest of Hammer's vast and largely very fine oeuvre. Strangely however when you hear people speak of Hammer horror this film rarely gets a mention and that's a great injustice as it easily ranks up there with the best of them. The plot follows a group of construction workers that discover a plot of skeletons while extending London's subway station. This immediately attracts the attention of local scientists Mathew Roney and Barbara Judd and later the man of the title Dr Quatermass who end up facing opposition from both the army and the press while trying to investigate the find. Where did the skeletons come from? How did they get there? And what's the meaning behind that bomb in the tunnel? All these questions and more are answered in Quatermass and the Pit.As you might expect the film is very camp. The effects are truly ridiculous and very easy to laugh at but they add to the fun and charm of the movie. The reason why Hammer Horror films succeed is that despite being unpleasant at times it's obvious that they were made with a lot of heart and the good nature that went into making them always shines through. Unlike many horror or SciFi films however this one actually bothers to pose some interesting questions and really gets you thinking. The normal idea behind alien based SciFi is completely turned on it's head and it makes for both an enjoyable and interesting not to mention original movie. It's quite ingenious in fact much more so than many recent 'thoughtprovoking' movies. There is also quite a lot of the trademark British humour in the film which is always nice to see. It's obvious that the film is meant to be tongue in cheek anyway but it's always nice to have a few moments of laughter in there. Quatermass and the Pit is directed by Hammer Horror supremo Roy Ward Baker. When people think of Hammer directors it's often Terrence Fisher that comes out on top but Baker is by far my favourite. He's delivered the lovely Asylum the ingenious Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde not to mention The Vampire Lovers and now this. And that's only the ones that I've seen!Overall this is an incredible movie. It's generous mix of horror SciFi and fantasy is truly refreshing and it makes for an interesting and enjoyable ride. I loved every minute of this film and it easily ranks as one of the best Hammer Horror's that I've seen. Make sure you don't skip this one.".

There were some gems in their output and this film is one of them. The science may be wayward but it unfolds plausibly from the initial discovery of the thing in the pit to mayhem and madness in the streets of London. The opening credits are sparse and it goes straight into the story and never lets up.It has a clear narrative and each new discovery pushes the envelope of fear and amazement further out. There is no romantic interest though I must declare the Miss Judd character is pretty darn attractive to hold up the driving plot. If there is a fault it is that the story can scarcely contain the wealth of material that Nigel Kneale puts in the script. Presumably there isn't a longer director's cut in some film archive!With limited resources at hand the director Roy Ward Baker directs some great scenes weird and strange and scary. He is served well by the acting of James Donald Andrew Keir and Barbara Shelley which is perfect for their roles. As the alien presence become stronger you believe it when it affects the characters. The scene at the pit where Miss Judd has her visions recorded is excellent. The special effects are varied but the green arthropods and the space ship look quite malevolent. The ending is great and somehow disquieting as the closing credits slowly roll.This is a good example of an interesting intelligent film costing less than the catering budget of the elephantine megabudget film we have these days but much more effective and memorable.".

This was the third Hammer film adaptation of Nigel Kneale's BBCTV Quatermass serial with previous entries being The Quatermass Experiment  Quatermass 2. This to me tho is undoubtedly the shining light of the bunch.

Building up perfectly courtesy of Roy Ward Baker's astutely paced direction Quatermass And The Pit is a film that just begs you to pay attention to every little detail each conversation is fully fleshing out this most intriguing story. Then there is the finale that pays off handsomely to hint at what is involved would result in a spoiler of sorts and really it would be stupid of me to prepare you for the film's closure.

They simply don't appreciate the movie's effects in their context. Further I would disagree that the story is ridiculous. The story unfolds as the characters and viewers discover the secret in Hobbs End. If you don't know what the movie is about you will enjoy this bit of discovery. Instead of so many contemporary films where the viewer is simply told what happens as if he or she is slackjawed imbecile in Five Million Years to Earth the viewer is part of the discovery process. Finally the sense of horror builds from a vague sense of unease to a real sense of loathing and fear. I've seen this movie at least a half dozen times and continue to enjoy it as much as the first time.".

Instead of so many contemporary films where the viewer is simply told what happens as if he or she is slackjawed imbecile in Five Million Years to Earth the viewer is part of the discovery process. Finally the sense of horror builds from a vague sense of unease to a real sense of loathing and fear. I've seen this movie at least a half dozen times and continue to enjoy it as much as the first time.";

	schema:headline " Brilliant scifihorror.";
	schema:reviewBody "In this remarkable scifi horror produced by Hammer Studios an extension of the famous London Underground is halted by the discovery of prehistoric humanoid remains. An excavation team is brought in headed by Dr. Matthew Roney James Donald but their work is also soon halted by the discovery of what at first appears to be an unexploded bomb. However the device shows no parallel with any other weaponry that the military are aware of and soon the bomb disposal unit calls in Colonel Breen Julian Glover an expert on weaponry. Breen is accompanied by Professor Quatermass Andrew Keir who upon examining and studying the strange object as well as local folklore becomes convinced that the bomb is far from what it seems.Quatermass and the Pit' remains one of the most intelligent and detailed films produced by the legendary Hammer Studios. While the story itself is somewhat fanciful it does manage to raise significant questions about the origins and actions of mankind all the while remaining a compelling scifihorror movie and never resorting to the dubious social commentary that one could anticipate from such a film. Instead Quatermass and the Pit' identifies itself within the scifihorror boundaries and the structure of the scientific aspects to the story is rooted firmly in mankind's desire to substantiate and attest to its own existence while offering a theatrical explanation for those supernatural occurrences that have besieged history yet remain startlingly inexplicable. However it would be somewhat ludicrous to suggest that Quatermass and the Pit' has accurately realised the truth behind humanity instead it has given itself a base and a reality. When considering the movie within the confines of itself and accepting the story as just a story Quatermass and the Pit' has successfully been able to attain its own veracity and this is the reason why the film is able to become great. Of course the scientific discussions would not have been as effective without incredibly strong performances from Andrew Keir James Donald and Barbara Shelley who display some superlative acting abilities and further the believability and pseudorealism of this extraordinary film.Nigel Kneale did a remarkable job of penning a story which fully explains itself while retaining a certain degree of uncomfortable peculiarity and unknown. This was fully capitalised on by director Roy Ward Baker who seemingly managed to represent the creepy and eerie aspects of the film so that they linger on in the minds of the viewer yet move the film along at a steady pace so that the film never appears to be dragging. Baker's direction while not appearing to be anything extraordinary for the genre is adept enough to build an atmosphere equivalent to the most terrifying of genre films as well as filming some exceptional scenes of panic masshysteria and a nearapocalyptic vision of London. The only real downfall for the film was the lacklustre and cheap looking special effects that the film partially relied on in places. Still one can forgive this even if they are fairly detrimental to the quality of the film in places. The production team had already managed to produce an exceptional film considering the lowbudget.So to summarise Quatermass and the Pit' is a thinking person's horror film. Perhaps the scientific proposition and ideas do get rather carried away sporadically but the sheer quality and integrity of the film upholds it further than the majority of scifi films from the era. Fans of intricate and thoughtprovoking horror films should be rather impressed with the way that Quatermass and the Pit' presents and portrays it's case and events and when one is able to engross themselves in this theatrical world then there is a definite essence of horror and fear when the seemingly impossible happens in a disturbing and shocking way. My rating for Quatermass and the Pit'  810.".

When considering the movie within the confines of itself and accepting the story as just a story Quatermass and the Pit' has successfully been able to attain its own veracity and this is the reason why the film is able to become great. Of course the scientific discussions would not have been as effective without incredibly strong performances from Andrew Keir James Donald and Barbara Shelley who display some superlative acting abilities and further the believability and pseudorealism of this extraordinary film.Nigel Kneale did a remarkable job of penning a story which fully explains itself while retaining a certain degree of uncomfortable peculiarity and unknown. This was fully capitalised on by director Roy Ward Baker who seemingly managed to represent the creepy and eerie aspects of the film so that they linger on in the minds of the viewer yet move the film along at a steady pace so that the film never appears to be dragging. Baker's direction while not appearing to be anything extraordinary for the genre is adept enough to build an atmosphere equivalent to the most terrifying of genre films as well as filming some exceptional scenes of panic masshysteria and a nearapocalyptic vision of London. The only real downfall for the film was the lacklustre and cheap looking special effects that the film partially relied on in places. Still one can forgive this even if they are fairly detrimental to the quality of the film in places. The production team had already managed to produce an exceptional film considering the lowbudget.So to summarise Quatermass and the Pit' is a thinking person's horror film. Perhaps the scientific proposition and ideas do get rather carried away sporadically but the sheer quality and integrity of the film upholds it further than the majority of scifi films from the era. Fans of intricate and thoughtprovoking horror films should be rather impressed with the way that Quatermass and the Pit' presents and portrays it's case and events and when one is able to engross themselves in this theatrical world then there is a definite essence of horror and fear when the seemingly impossible happens in a disturbing and shocking way. My rating for Quatermass and the Pit'  810.";

	schema:headline " The Best Of Hammer's Quatermass Films";
	schema:reviewBody "After a decade long absence from the silver screen Hammer released Quatermass And The Pit in 1967. Adapted by Nigel Kneale from his own TV serial that aired in 1958 and early 1959 on the BBC the film version would prove to be as much as fitting conclusion to the Hammer Quatermass films as it TV counterpart was for the BBC serials. For like the TV version it remains not only the best of best of the three initial Quatermass stories but also one of the most imaginative and brilliantly crafted pieces of science fiction to ever be put on a screen either big or small. The film features a fine cast of actors. Playing Professor Bernard Quatermass is Andrew Keir replacing Brian Donlevy from the first two Hammer Quatermass films and the fifth actor to play the role if you include the three BBC serials. Keir alongside actor Andr Morell as Quatermass in the TV version of Pit gives what might very well be the definitive Quatermass. From the moment Keir appears he takes on the role and makes it his own. He does this by being convincing as both scientist and as a man frightened by what he discovers in the pit and beyond. He is man who discovers a horrifying truth and struggles to convince his bureaucratic bosses of it before an even greater horror is unleashed yet retains a sense of authority at the same time not an easy thing to do but Keir pulls it off brilliantly. Even more important Keir's performance makes the whole film all the better for it. Joining Keir is a fine supporting cast. James Donald is Dr. Matthew Roney the anthropologist who is fascinated by his discoveries and willing to face the consequences of them no matter the cost. Julian Glover is Colonel Breen a military man forced upon Quatermass' British Rocket Group who takes Quatermass into the pit and as a man almost primitive in his thinking to the point of ignoring the facts becomes most responsible for the films ending. There's others as well ranging from Bryan Marshall as the leader of the bomb disposal squad to Barbara Shelley as Roney's assistant to Duncan Lamont who incidentally appeared in a pivotal role in the BBC version of first Quatermass serial The Quatermass Experiment as Sladden and Edwin Richfield as the Minister of Defense as well. The supporting cast in roles big and small give fine performances while anchoring the film firmly in reality. With with its fine cast it is as much the aspects of the serial behind the camera that make Quatermass And The Pit as imaginative and brilliantly crafted as it is. The sets stand out from the Underground subway here in the States station where the pit is located to Roney's lab and the halls of the Ministry of Defense. The score by composer Tristram Cary in both its orchestral and electronic pieces helps give the film a strong sense of both atmosphere and tension especially in the lead up to its finale. The special effects are well done as well ranging from the effective insect like Martians to the various effects seen in the finale. While some of the effects might not be up to the standards of present day CGI they remain effective nonetheless. Then there is the script of course. Though it took nearly a decade before it could be brought to the big screen writer Nigel Kneale superbly adapts his classic serial into a fine piece of science fiction film. The film released a year before Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke brought it to the mainstream in 2001 A Space Odessy asks the fascinating and to some terrifying question what if what makes us human isn't human at all? and terrifyingly answers it in a way that turns 2001's ideas standing on their heads. Kneale looks at human nature and in particular racism and the occult in a science fiction context and shows us the consequences of racism in a way that is too realistic to be ignored. Though free from the limitations of live TV and only about half the length of the TV version Kneale's script is full of fine dialogue and debates on everything from the nature of racism to the military takeover of otherwise peaceful scientific research. In particular there is one scene set at the Ministry where Quatermass is called to explain what has been found in the pit that stands out as amongst the best pieces of science fiction writing ever. If there is a fault with the script it is that it ends the film at a rather odd point when compared to the TV version and misses out on using a fine piece of Kneale's original script in the process. Overall though Kneale adapts his scripts superbly and gives this remake a life of its own.In short Quatermass And The Pit is not only the best of the Hammer Quatermass films but may well be the finest film Hammer ever produced. This is thanks to the films fine performances good effects fine music and a brilliant script. While perhaps too dialogue heavy for some Quatermass And The Pit is proof that you don't necessarily need a huge budget to create a fine science fiction film.Quatermass couldn't have ended at Hammer any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis in her career got 10 nominations and two Oscars for Best Actress. I was amazed to learn that The Corn Is Green was not one of the ten. This has to be one of her five best films. And the interesting thing about it is that her performance as Ms. Moffatt contains none of the Bette Davis shtick we associate with her.The Corn Is Green a play by Emlyn Williams ran for 477 performances on Broadway between 1940 to 1942 and then in 1943 the road company was called back to Broadway to give another 56 performances during that season. The role of Ms. Moffatt the school teacher originated with Ethel Barrymore and three members of the Broadway cast repeated their roles for the screen Mildred Dunnock Rosalind Ivan and Rhys Williams.Because Ethel Barrymore would have been 61 at the time she debuted with The Corn is Green on Broadway and Davis only 37 of necessity the interpretations would have been different. Davis has been left some property in a Welsh village and she's unlike any woman who's ever come there. She has an MA from Oxford the fact she can read and write strikes some as amazing. She resolves to teach the young folks in the village to do the same a plan with which a lot of the villagers are opposed.Most notably opposed is Nigel Bruce who plays the local titled gentry in the place and who prides the fact that the folks there call him 'squire' in many different tones of voice. He's a living embodiment of the Colonel Blimp character from Great Britain. He also is an owner of the local mine and he's quite frank in that if you start teaching people how to read and write who knows what kind of unrest it could lead to. He was my favorite character in the film. One scene in it is priceless how Bette Davis who first tells him what an oaf he is later decides to use a little flattery to get what she wants from him.What she wants is his patronage for a certain young miner who shows great promise and a literary bent. That would be John Dall who if he can tear himself away from his drinking buddies at the tavern and the attentions of town tart Joan Lorring has a chance to go to Oxford he's that intelligent.Education was the theme here and a theme in that other Welsh classic How Green Was My Valley where the hopes and dreams of the Morgan family are wrapped up in Roddy McDowall going to school and getting an education to escape a life in the coal mines. But I found better comparisons with The Corn Is Green to a couple of modern classics Good Will Hunting and All The Right Moves. Robin Williams reacted the same way in Good Will Hunting when he saw janitor Matt Damon do those math equations. Also John Dall wants to use his writing talents to escape the mines the same way Tom Cruise wants to use a football scholarship to escape the coal mines in Pennsylvania. And Cruise gets a lot of the same opposition that Dall gets from those jealous he has an opportunity to leave the mines.Though Bette Davis was not nominated for anything The Corn Is Green got two nominations John Dall for Best Supporting Actor and Joan Lorring for Best Supporting Actress. They lost to James Dunn and Anne Revere respectively. Dall's career never got the momentum it should have from this film and from Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. He was very much in the celluloid closet and fear of exposure haunted him throughout a life that was given to a lot of substance abuse.As for Lorring you have not seen too many low class tramps on the screen to match her. Dall gets her pregnant and her condition leads to the climax of the film. Lorring also never quite fulfilled the promise she showed in The Corn Is Green.The themes of education and literacy are timeless you can see it in the more modern films I've compared The Corn Is Green too. It's a film not to be missed or acquired if possible. And for Bette Davis's devoted fans an absolute must. She would not get a part as good as Ms. Moffatt until she did All About Eve.".

It's too bad however that despite this strong debut Oscar nominated for Supporting Actor which was followed by ROPE and GUN CRAZY Dall practically had nothing to hold onto when it came to movies and disappeared for the majority of the Fifties returning only for SPARTACUS and a smattering of other films.It's too bad but one of the many stories of brief careers that make their mark in one or more movies. Speaking of which Joan Lorring was another actress who took her role and ran with it. For her acting she was awarded like Dall a Supporting Actress nomination but was little seen after 1948. If it weren't for this footnote in her career she'd be all but a forgotten supporting actress she manages to eclipse Davis in two scenes in the movie and her exit is also memorable.Davis probably didn't get a nomination because by now it seemed she could phone in her emotions and play this kind of role in her sleep. Even so it's a very good role very understated not very well remembered except by her hardcore fans and the last hit she would have because from 1946 on her movies would start losing money and be of varying quality that is until her great comeback as Margo Channing in ALL ABOUT EVE.".

Speaking of which Joan Lorring was another actress who took her role and ran with it. For her acting she was awarded like Dall a Supporting Actress nomination but was little seen after 1948. If it weren't for this footnote in her career she'd be all but a forgotten supporting actress she manages to eclipse Davis in two scenes in the movie and her exit is also memorable.Davis probably didn't get a nomination because by now it seemed she could phone in her emotions and play this kind of role in her sleep. Even so it's a very good role very understated not very well remembered except by her hardcore fans and the last hit she would have because from 1946 on her movies would start losing money and be of varying quality that is until her great comeback as Margo Channing in ALL ABOUT EVE.";

John Dall is excellent in what was his first major role as is Joan Lorring as Bessie the girl who takes his mind off his studies.

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilerificPLOTSUBJECT MATTER Firstly I'd like to comment on an issue in the film that some reviewers found objectionable  that of the suppression of the Welsh language and culture for British ideals and the English language.  I think the film needs to be looked at as is  a commentary a reaction to this.  Knowing but a little about the Welsh way of life in those times I cannot say for certain but I think most people especially the lower classes depicted in the film had very little opportunity or means to fight the acquisition of the British culture language and influence.  This does NOT make the argument correct. It is merely a sad fact.  The film's inhabitants represent a microcosm of this sector and the audience is meant to see how they were forced into assimilating into a new way of life regardless of whether or not they wanted to.  This is what the film depicts and it should be judged accordingly.PERFORMANCES John Dall  Let me say that after watching this movie how surprised I am that John Dall Morgan Evans didn't become a major star.  He is wonderful and does a good job with the accent.  Dall is another actor who conveys so much with just his eyes or a turn of the head.  Watch his reactions to Bette Davis in their big confrontation scene  damn he's good.  Amazingly The Corn is Green was his first film.  I keep missing Gun Crazy whenever it's on but can't wait to catch it someday.  Dall was excellent in Rope as well. Too bad he only made a few films.  Here he is formidable as coal miner turned Oxfordbound student playing the unglamorous role with both subtlety and ease.Bette Davis  gives an outstanding performance here.  Once you get past the makeup she's supposed to be older than she was at the time the feisty Davis can be seen.  She plays the determined teacher with pure conviction. Another strongwilled role for her to sink her teeth into  Davis' forte.Joan Lorring   This was Lorring's first movie and her reprehensible character Bessie Watty what a name! is one you love to hate.  The venom in her eyes!  She makes the false Oh! I've hurt my knee!' and I'm in a coma!' lines unforgettable.  However I did feel a little sorry for Bessie because of her mother's comments about never liking her.  It's easy to see why she was so coldhearted.  Lorring is great in Three Strangers with Peter Lorre Geraldine Fitzgerald and Sidney Greenstreet too.  Check that one out.CHARACTER ANALYSIS Lilly Moffat Bette Davis is a flawed character indeed.  She is a takenoprisoners powerhouse.  When need arises she plays both the bull artist innocent helpless womanfolk to gain the squire's benefaction and cautious dangerous protector threatening Bessie's life to shield Morgan from what she perceives as harm.  She stands behind her convictions rightly or wrongly 100.  Miss Moffat's motives are often questionable.  In the film she explains them all away yet this viewer was left with quite some mixed feelings about her character.  This is a good thing mind you as the film as a whole certainly left a big impression on me due to several unresolved issues.  That's one sign of a good movie.Morgan Evans John Dall is also a flawed character.  Has he sold out given in given up or done the best thing?   The film seems to say his choice was correct he did not waste his potential yet it is up to the viewer to decide.  Dall plays the whole spectrum of the character's conflicts so believably that it is easy to sympathize with Morgan who is torn between two worlds and two completely different sets of ideals.Davis and Dall have great chemistry together and all of their scenes ignite a spark.  As Lilly and Morgan it is great to watch two stubborn rams lock horns then reach a difficult arrangement that perfectly suits no one.  An appropriately bittersweet ending to a visceral film.Irving Rapper's direction is superb.  The sweeping shots of the countryside and the miners going to and from work the claustrophobic atmosphere of the tiny school and the hostile environment of the local public house great fight scene! all lend the film a sense of realism.Nigel Bruce is very witty as the Squire the impertinence!' and Mildred Dunnock and Rhys Williams as the hapless Miss Ronberry and Mr. Jones are also very good.One final note  I love the song the coal miners and Bessie sing even though I do not understand the words.  A very nice song  I would love to get my hands on a copy.  Diolch and goodnight.".

Both Dall and Loring received Oscar nominations in the supporting categories but Davis was denied a best actress nomination here which is somewhat surprising.Mildred Dunnock and Rhys Williams costar as teachers in Ms. Moffat's school. Dunnock so young here but displays the same vulnerability as Elsie Thornton in 1957's Peyton Place.".

Lilly Moffat finds out how uneducated all the  people are in the town and decides to start a school for everyone even  the coal miners. However she discovers a young miner who has  exceptional intelligence and has the ability to write but his spelling  is very poor. This young miner is Morgan Evans John Dall who is  given the opportunity to prepare for Oxford University but with many  obstacles that enter into his life and distract him from a wonderful  future. Bessie Watty  Joan Lorring  is a wild young girl who flirts  with Morgan Evans and they spend a night together that later on causes  many problems for this determined young man to advance himself in  higher institutions of learning. This is a great dramatic film with  great acting by Nigel Bruce The Squire and a wonderful actress Betty  Davis. Enjoy a truly great Classic film from 1945.".

That Davis woman......The Corn is Green is a movie for all ages with fabulous viewing. BECAUSE it could happen although simple is what makes it so great. I would rate it as 50 if I could. The copy TCM presented was brilliant not faded and scratchy as some have stated here. Perhaps the longwaited DVD? It belongs in everyone's collection  I hope it will soon be in mine.".

Moffat through her pronounced influence over Morgan seems almost to have given him with one hand and to have taken away with the other. The result is that he becomes more of a scholar but less of a human being.Yes Miss Moffat is the staunch devoted teacher who has discovered Morgan as her diamond in the rough and it is without question that she has his best interests at heart in identifying his talents to him and guiding him in their development. But it is equally certain that there is a bit of selfishness involved here too on her part. She wants both him and herself to succeed academically  regardless of the cost. And that cost as it turns out is to have him abandon his own flesh and blood in pursuit of the higher goals she has set for him. She has in effect exerted a masterly form of mind control over Morgan which has effectively distorted his basic just instincts i.e. his access to paternal love. This development near the end of the film always leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth.".

Most English speakers have trouble with Welsh and so to have a crafty illiterate Bessie Watty sing a beautiful song in perfect Welsh to the apple of her lusty eyes is also so unbelievable. Can't believe that to advertise the school to a town of illiterate and predominately Welshspeaking townsfolk Miss Moffat decides to use posters!!! That would not work and again  the poster of course is in English. Add to that the English were distrusted and she would have needed to work hard very hard to gain acceptance.I can't believe there was anyone connected with the film who knew ANYTHING of Welsh country life and although many small independent 'schools' existed every mining town had a State School by 1895  they were not 'remote'.The standout character was John Dall and the only other believable characters were Rhys Williams Mr Jones Mildred Dunnock Miss Ronberry and Rosalind Ivan Mrs Watty. Bette Davis depicted a strong character but one without empathy love and conviction so necessary for her role as an educator. The imperious isolated and punishing character she portrayed would not have gone well with the villagers or the potential students. A mineowner 50 share squire would have been feared rather than loved and although I like the bumbling Nigel Bruce I thought him poorly cast.When one sees a 'true' mining town so excellently depicted in 'How Green Was My Valley' it is truly the apogee when compared this film  the nadir in so many respects.".

Miss Moffitt turns her own home into a school to teach just fundamentals to anyone who wishes. A young coal miner Morgan EvansJohn Dallcatches her eye showing promise.

Davis could play any part and didn't care how bad or frumpy she looked as long as she could sink her teeth into the part and make it a strong personality. That's just what she does here as the selfmade teacher Miss Moffat determined to educate the town's poor workers who sing on the way to and from work. She needs the help of Mr. Jone's Rhys Williams who had a role in How Green was my Valley. At 115 minutes they pack a lot into the story including several songs by the Saint Lukes Episcopal Chorus which had performed in about 20 films in the 1930s and 1940s. Cute bits by Thomas Louden as the old man doing his best to learn. Also Joan Lorring as Bessie Watty one of the antagonists.".

The singing vocals are so strong that they are distracting. A small group of young workweary miners should not sound like the men's chorus at the Met for example. Miss Moffatt might be seen by some as selfless in her dedication to higher principles. She denies herself of so much in her pursuit of education. But hers is a selfish campaign for transformationof a man a town perhaps a country. She trades something of lesser value for something of greater value so she does not sacrifice even in her final dramatic decision. And it is her pursuit of a greater purpose that gives her story nobility. And the pleasure she finds in her achievements can only be seen as justifiable and virtuous.".

	schema:headline " The craving for solitude and the unbearable loneliness that comes with it";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not unreasonable to say that Rohmer's films are without par. No director has ever come close to his exquisite and acute observations of the human psyche and so Rohmer's films are probably only comparable to each other. I find that the more films of his that I watch the more I am able to see each film clearer. It is no wonder that out of the directors that emerged from the French New Wave only Rohmer has been able to sustain critical acclaim for his films consistently.Many detractors find fault with his style  there is little or no music the plot is only a very very rough skeleton of what actually goes on in his films as it takes a backseat to exploring the psychology of his characters there are many moments of silence and those moments of dialog are mostly ramblings about philosophy love and life instead of plot advancement. Well I find it quite difficult to articulate the charm of his movies too since he isn't particularly flashy in his writing or his direction.His films are largely introspective drawing us in to view the character's psyche instead of the events that happen to him as such his films are always introverted and quiet where it seems nothing much happens. At first glance the lead characters of his films seem to be all from the same mold gloomy quiet people who are extremely prone to making fickle choices and outbursts of emotion. But the more Rohmer you see the more likely you'd be to distinguish a pattern among them and their distinctive traits in his characters.They are always caught in a 'limbo' for lack of a better word usually either caught between two choices that may tear their lives apart or make them better or caught between two emotions that are pulling them in totally different directions. They are often afraid to take the leap take the risk in deciding which point of action to make and thus the films largely comprise of them searching for themselves their identities their desires and their wishes. They are as equally clueless about themselves as we are about them initially and so it is folly to attempt to analyze them at the beginning. And as the film progresses they learn more about themselves and perhaps we might learn a little more about ourselves too after we have gone through the same emotions and internal struggles with them.That every lead has a distinctive trait is what separates his movies from each other. Each one of them is stuck and exemplifies the different nuances of our struggles and so they might all appear gloomy but they vary in their intents and sentiments. In The Green Ray in particular the lead character is torn between the craving for solitude and the unbearable loneliness that comes with it. To say I relate to it probably cheapens the film to a certain extent but it is the best I can say with Rohmer's films. They portray a small corner in our lives that we have been before that it is impossible to say any less. The fact that he is able to take each corner of our lives and its accompanying mood and blow it up on the big screen into a fulllength feature film that is neither didactic nor ever fully reassuring shows the mastery of his craft. Like us he is unsure and searching and he portrays that in his films beautifully.All of his oeuvre is definitely worth watching save for the godawful La Collectioneuse one can only assume that he was going through a shitty state of mind when he was making that pretentious junk and the best thing about Rohmer is the more films you see of him the more you see in his films. The reason why I singled out The Green Ray or Summer on the US DVD is because of its brilliant lead actress Marie Riviere which is not only immediately likable but also painfully personal. Her journey is one that I can slip on comfortably anytime with an ending that is equally sublime as it is magical. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is intending to pick this up but let's just say that it is probably one of the greatest moments of cinema that I have witnessed in my short life. To be able to capture it with such beauty and in such a context not only offers a respite from the turmoil that we the lead character and I have gone through but also a hope of selfdiscovery and awareness makes this gem a great slice of cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is not unreasonable to say that Rohmer's films are without par. No director has ever come close to his exquisite and acute observations of the human psyche and so Rohmer's films are probably only comparable to each other. I find that the more films of his that I watch the more I am able to see each film clearer. It is no wonder that out of the directors that emerged from the French New Wave only Rohmer has been able to sustain critical acclaim for his films consistently.Many detractors find fault with his style  there is little or no music the plot is only a very very rough skeleton of what actually goes on in his films as it takes a backseat to exploring the psychology of his characters there are many moments of silence and those moments of dialog are mostly ramblings about philosophy love and life instead of plot advancement. Well I find it quite difficult to articulate the charm of his movies too since he isn't particularly flashy in his writing or his direction.His films are largely introspective drawing us in to view the character's psyche instead of the events that happen to him as such his films are always introverted and quiet where it seems nothing much happens. At first glance the lead characters of his films seem to be all from the same mold gloomy quiet people who are extremely prone to making fickle choices and outbursts of emotion. But the more Rohmer you see the more likely you'd be to distinguish a pattern among them and their distinctive traits in his characters.They are always caught in a 'limbo' for lack of a better word usually either caught between two choices that may tear their lives apart or make them better or caught between two emotions that are pulling them in totally different directions. They are often afraid to take the leap take the risk in deciding which point of action to make and thus the films largely comprise of them searching for themselves their identities their desires and their wishes. They are as equally clueless about themselves as we are about them initially and so it is folly to attempt to analyze them at the beginning. And as the film progresses they learn more about themselves and perhaps we might learn a little more about ourselves too after we have gone through the same emotions and internal struggles with them.That every lead has a distinctive trait is what separates his movies from each other. Each one of them is stuck and exemplifies the different nuances of our struggles and so they might all appear gloomy but they vary in their intents and sentiments. In The Green Ray in particular the lead character is torn between the craving for solitude and the unbearable loneliness that comes with it. To say I relate to it probably cheapens the film to a certain extent but it is the best I can say with Rohmer's films. They portray a small corner in our lives that we have been before that it is impossible to say any less. The fact that he is able to take each corner of our lives and its accompanying mood and blow it up on the big screen into a fulllength feature film that is neither didactic nor ever fully reassuring shows the mastery of his craft. Like us he is unsure and searching and he portrays that in his films beautifully.All of his oeuvre is definitely worth watching save for the godawful La Collectioneuse one can only assume that he was going through a shitty state of mind when he was making that pretentious junk and the best thing about Rohmer is the more films you see of him the more you see in his films.

	schema:reviewBody "We have been conditioned as a culture to believe that happiness lies in an ideal future state. For example we think it will all turn out when we finish school when we get a job when we get married when we have children then when we get divorced or when we retire. It is always something or someplace more better or different but the more things change the more they seem to remain the same. In Summer aka The Green Ray one of Eric Rohmer's most insightful and charming films Delphine Marie Riviere is a young intelligent and goodlooking Parisian secretary who has spent her life looking for Mr Right. Like many who spend their life searching she is a perfectionist who keeps people away by maintaining impossible standards then feels inadequate and unloved when things do not work out. She is interesting rather than interested.When vacation time comes her girlfriend goes to Greece with a boyfriend and she is left alone and feeling rejected. Turning down an offer to visit Ireland with her sister's family she decides to take a trip to Cherbourg with a friend and her boyfriend and does her best to fit in but it only leads to more frustration. After her friends prepare an elaborate dinner she tells them that she doesn't meat seafood or eggs and prefers vegetables like lettuce because they make her feel light. She won't go sailing because it makes her seasick and she refuses a gift of apple blossoms because she thinks it's wrong to tear such large branches from trees. Rohmer impeccably captures Delphine's intense loneliness a feeling of isolation that is even more pronounced when the people around you are doing what they think will make you happy. Near tears she returns to Paris after only a few days in Cherbourg then visits the Alps thinking she will go mountain climbing but she stays only one day.When Delphine borrows a friend's apartment in Biarritz however she does settle down long enough to unpack. In Biarritz the story is pretty much the same however. Delphine says that she wants to meet people but when the opportunity arises in the form of two young men and Lena Carita a young Swedish blond she runs the other way although from all indications leaving seems to be the most sensible option. Lena advises her to play cat and mouse with men. It's like a card game she says you can't reveal your hand right off. Delphine uses this piece of advice as another reason for beating herself up. My hand is empty she declares.Delphine doesn't seem to believe in much but like many lonely people she looks for signs that things are going to turn out all right. She is fascinated with playing cards and when she finds a green card lying in the street she knows that green is her color of destiny for this year. While strolling the beach at Biarritz she overhears a conversation about a Jules Verne novel about an atmospheric phenomenon known as the Green Ray and she is mesmerized. According to Verne just before the sun sets below the horizon if you can see a burst of green light it will help allow you gain an insight into your true self.A synopsis of the plot however tells us little about what actually goes on in this mostly improvised film. Like most Rohmer works what happens in the silences is more revealing than in the conversations. An entire world is written in the gestures the facial expressions and the nuances that reveal each character's personality. Summer is an intimate story of a woman's loneliness that rings true and brought back a flood of painful memories for me. Delphine for all her warts is very human. Somewhere up ahead always looks better than right here. When she can open herself up to the perfection of the moment however she becomes directly present to the world and can share its ineffable beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed Le Rayon Vert. It showed real people people that I felt I could relate to. This effect was achieved through improvisatory conversations and at points an almost documentarystyle filmmaking technique with the camera zooming in with mood changes or if something interesting is said though make no mistake the framing and composition are very carefully controlled.It's a character study of a lonely Parisienne secretary called Delphine she is meant to be going off on holiday with a friend but he cancels at short notice so she has a dreaded improvised holiday.What follows is an anatomy of loneliness a description of the reasons why Delphine is lonely. It's strange to me because the film seemed to be positing two types of understanding firstly there is fatalistic bordering on mystic Delphine is a Capricorn as the lady at the outdoor dinner says a goat climbing up a mountain alone. Her destiny seems to be written on cards she finds in the street she's perhaps portrayed as not being capable of being anything different than what she is a lonely introvert.But then on the other hand the film is supposedly instructive with a moral and we have people trying to tell Delphine how to engage with life for example a very outgoing Swedish tourist and perhaps Delphine is engaging at the end of the film or on the other hand she has merely been blown by the wind and allowed herself to be picked up a more promising candidate than previously she has met there are a number of failed attempts to pick her up during the movie.The movie is visually beautiful I just love seeing movies shot in 43 these days. If you're dealing with human beings my opinion is that you should be in 43 it's essentially portraiture. If you're shooting the Rio Grande or any other large spaces then go with widescreen. There's some lovely shots of Delphine in the verdancy of nature when Delphine and the little girl are eating wild blackcurrants I felt like a child again seeing this I could taste the blackcurrants also of a very strange narrow green avenue Delphine goes down in the countryside. Then there's the colours the red on the clothes that the characters are wearing Delphine wears red but is searching for green a contradiction and little splashes of green all over the place punctuating the compositions. On the topic of Delphine being a walking contradiction Delphine describes herself as not operating or not functional like a normal person and then says I never do anything special to find someone or something. I always describe myself a bit like that like a hungry dog that has lost the instinct to bite.She's much like myself in many ways when she's talking to the Swede they have a conversation about romantic encounters being a card game Delphine says she has no cards she just is exactly what you see absolutely no coquetry is involved. Well that's me as well. She's really gauche in conversations the vegetarianism discussion was a great example. I'm also an enthusiast concerning ideals and I love to talk about them given half a chance but for example discussing in the manner of a dog with a bone how meateating is unconscionable at a table of carnivores is not very tactful. I often behave like this.The scene with the blackcurrants is perhaps the most painful Delphine is staying in Cherbourg with the family of a friend as a little girl asks her innocent questions about her life and Delphine's unsocialised paranoia takes over and she wants to know who has put the girl up to asking.It's a superb movie and it makes me want to see more Rohmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Delphine is lovelorn. She wants a romantic relationship but finds it hard to socialise or adhere to the conventions of dating. During the summer she has nobody to vacation with but doesn't like travelling by herself. Is she destined to be alone ?This lovely thoughtprovoking little film which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1986 is typical of Rohmer's gentle but insightful drama. Delphine has an ageold problem she's mature enough to be looking for something more meaningful than sex and partying but young enough to be selfcentred and dismissive of social expectations. When her friends encourage her to loosen up and flirt they just don't get that she wouldn't want to be with anyone she might meet using that strategy. Her frustration is beautifully played by Riviere and is frequently uncomfortable to watch as she struggles to reconcile her longing with her prickliness and selfdoubt. The film is full of richly observed little vignettes like the dinnertable discussion of vegetarianism or the central metaphor of the green flash which is a real meteorological phenomena as well as an 1886 novel by Jules Verne and the locations in the Normandy port of Cherbourg and Basque seaside town of Biarritz are terrific. If you are unfamiliar with this gifted and prolific director's work he made about thirty movies over forty years this is a good introduction to his unpretentious but absorbing lowkey dramas as is his 1971 classic Le Genou De Claire. I don't think I've ever come across a filmmaker as honest as he is. This was the fifth in his series of six Comdies Et Proverbes works coming between Les Nuits De La Pleine Lune and L'Ami De Mon Amie. English title  The Green Ray.".

The film is a pleasant enough little mediation but both as a stand alone piece and when compared to The Good Marriage that's all it is the biting explosive nature of The Good Marriage's lead and the drama that surrounds her stepping out of a somewhat misandric comfort zone into one of longterm love affairs with all the danger that comes with her mental state was much more gripping and enthralling. It was braver starker and was really well directed. The lead here Marie Rivire's Delphine carries far less of a personality in this sense and with that the film carries less of an edge  less danger and hostility. Gone is the immediacy and yet retained is a sense of a woman on a voyage out to make her own discoveries about the opposite sex and the nature of love all under Rohmer's style of long takes and the etching out of as much realism and as much authentication from the scenes as possible.Was The Good Marriage's conclusion one of a decidedly bleak nature? It's lead did after all appear to happily discover exactly where she appeared to belong in life following something of a diversion or an experiment. The Green Ray's finale is more clearcut in that it involves a handsome looking man beside a beach as he observes a somewhat typical and rather Hollywoodised event thus rendering the conclusion more fabricated than we would have liked after so little was driven by instance and causality. Both films see their leads flit from one instance to another the key difference as to what makes one much more dramatic and involving than the other in that The Green Ray covered a woman attempting to find someone The Good Marriage was more preoccupied with a woman trying to understand someone. We begin with Delphine at work in a Paris based office the month July and the weather hot with her holiday a matter of days away. Tragedy strikes when the boyfriend calls her and cancels their relationship the holiday still on but a spare space now on show where just a minute ago her man was the occupant. Shell shocked and forlorn the film will go on to cover Delphine's wondering stumbling sprawling and meandering misadventures throughout a number of French locales after a number of suggestions from a number of people her trip seeing her jump from the large ports of Normany to the cold ski resorts of La Plagne to the baking July beaches of Biarritz.To be involved in the film you need to be on Delphine's side the reading of her situation as one of immense misfortune and the noting of her reaction she provides us with as acceptable instead of reading into it as unnecessary moping on a grandeur scale neigh on essential. The nature and strength of her relationship with her former partner not explored and consequently the full extent unknown the asking from Rohmer of us to weep for a young woman whom now cannot go off on a summer holiday with a boyfriend and get up to exactly what it is that transpires under those circumstances now in full force. As the film unfolds Delphine's attitudes will change her shifting away from desperation linked to her need to find a man so as to take him on holiday like all her friends are doing thus avoiding going against the status quo and into a more relaxed and more natural attitude interesting enough to become somewhat absorbed in. It is after all only when she begins to cease her earlier attitudes that the right man at the right time comes along.Her journeying to Normandy Cherbourg in particular with a friend and her large family sees an attempt at picking up a local seaman go horribly wrong when the authenticity of the man becomes questionable and the danger of just what kind of a person he is suddenly prominent. During her stretch in the Northern region of Normandy Rohmer will position Delphine in a composition which encompasses a beach in the background as people in groups have fun and enjoy themselves whilst on their holidays her respective position in the frame in relation to those people that place and the activities going on systematic of the situation in that she is not participating along with them despite she would probably doing so had she still been with someone. Instead more rural walks around fields and farmland by herself that encompass the passing by of a local church is the norm a day out shot far more intimately as the resonance of the situation and the nature of her holiday and what she does't want settles in.Delphine's journeying sees her shoot all around France the postcard style and the heavy use of respective pieces of iconography in each region reminiscent of more mainstream pieces although here clashing oddly but effectively with the cinema vrit style and aesthetics Rohmer is applying to his piece. As the film nears its end Delphine will meet a young Swedish girl whom is additionally travelling alone and enjoys talking and messing with local men that encounter her. Her introduction a confident topless swagger in the hot sun from seashore to a beachspace beside Delphine but her attitudes towards the opposite sex ones which effectively scare our lead even alienating her from these attitudes a final step in the transition which switches her from seeking out quick easy substitutions to her predicament and onto a certain train station rendezvous rounding off an enjoyable enough piece.".

With improvised dialogue the film has a more naturalistic feel than some of Rohmers other work he also shows more interest in nature than usual making this one of his more interesting films to look at. Delphine brilliantly played by Marie Riviere is lonely and seemingly pining for her exfianc and her attempts at a vacation form the body of the film. She travels to various places but not until the end does she find something like happiness. She can be very maddening  ignoring people presumably because they are not the right sort  just plain rude to my mind and lecturing a family on her vegetarianism as they tuck into lamb chops. She does though seem a very real person and many viewers will find themselves rooting for her anyway  she is like many people we know in being full of faults but you still like them anyway. The greatest weakness of the film is that for all her selfabsorption Rohmer does not really provide any evidence of selfinsight or change a serious fault in that drama is all about characters changing Delphine talks a lot about her problems but her explanations often struck me as trite. An oddity among his output this should be seen by any Rohmer fan I would not recommend it as an introduction though. The mark of 6 may seem low by inflated IMDb standards but it is relative to Rohmers other films.".

Delphine does not want to travel alone and has difficulties to have relationship with unknown people and she decides to travel to Cherbourg with a friend. A couple of days later she is bored and decides to return to Paris. Then she calls a friend in La Plagne but she returns on the same day to her place in Saint German. While walking on the streets of Paris she meets an old friend that offers her house in Biarritz. Once there a young stranger flirts with Delphine invites her to go to Bayonne and they spend the afternoon together and watch the sunset until its last green ray.I have had another huge disappointment with the director Eric Rohmer after watching Le Rayon Vert. I found this movie an overrated boring and dull tale of loneliness with an annoying lead character. It is very easy to understand the solitude of the unpleasant Delphine and I recommend to see this movie on DVD since the viewer will be able to use the rewind when he or she takes an involuntary nap or the fast forward button in case of unbearable boredom. In my case I was forced to rewind the movie three or four times. My vote is three.Title Brazil O Raio Verde The Green Ray".

	schema:reviewBody "Eric Rohmer built quite a reputation with his series of 6 films The Moral Tales in the 196070's. When the new decade came he decided to make a new series of films called Comedies  Proverbs. This series wasn't as consistent as The Moral Tales. The films of Comedies  Proverbs didn't have the same similarity in narrative and themes as The Moral Tales did. Le rayon vert is the fifth film in the series. Its most common translation is Summer but I prefer the other translation to be more accurate to the context The Green Ray.Le rayon vert seems to abandon the usual clean narrative of Rohmer. It seems like a cruddy documentary at some points which is of course intentional. The cinematography is beautiful  deep and Eric Rohmer's famous dialog is as sharp as it always is Intelligent funny and realistic. He's very talented in creating a realistic situation. He is the master of combining art with reality.Le rayon vert is about a woman named Delphine Marie Rivire who hasn't yet found her true love as she hasn't her true self. The film studies a very common subject for French people holidays. Delphine tries different kind of holidays at her childhood town Cherbourg on the beach and in the city. As she's trying to find a good place to rest she's finding herself.The character Delphine is very interesting and we get to know many things about her. For instance we found out at her childhood place that she is a vegetarian  first of all the scene is brilliant. Others don't quite seem to understand her diet  lifestyle. She doesn't want to eat meat because it reminds her of blood and heartbeats. She tries to stutter about the glory of salad the fresh friendship of it.The title The Green Ray comes directly from a book by Jules Verne with the same title. The green flash means the last fold ray of the sun from the horizon which makes one see into one's own and to others' souls. Into the hands of this romantic flash the main characters gives her faith and destiny.A very good film intelligent and funny just as the name of the series promises. Le rayon vert starts with a proverb by Rimbaud Ah! que les temps vienne Ou les coeurs s'eprennent. The Green Ray is full of symbolism just as the cards and the colors. It also shows some very beautiful shots from the French countryside.810 A guaranteed Rohmer piece!".

	schema:reviewBody "The green ray in the title of this French movie also called green flash refers to an optical phenomenon in which you can sometimes see under certain hard to attain conditions a green light coming from the horizon right after sunset or right before sunrise. The famous French novelist Jules Verne wrote about this natural occurrence in a book called The Green Ray which is briefly referred to in the movie.The film itself is about Delphine played by Marie Riviere who has been in several movies of director Eric Rohmer who works as a secretary in a Paris office. She is a slender tallish moderately attractive black haired woman in perhaps her late twenties and has a difficult personality. She has recently broken up with her boyfriend right before the summer holidays and the prospect of lonely vacations much saddens her though to some in the audience it might not make the most compelling of tragic situations. So the movie is about her talking with friends about her predicament until she decides to go alone meeting on the road a few people including a Swedish woman who she first meets topless at a beach and who is meant to represent sexually liberal attitudes. I'm not going to spoil it for you whether Delphine will find a romantic partner or not during her travels but the ray of the title does make an appearance.The movie is from 1986 and since it was shot on the street you can see people with what are now period clothes. If you were like me a child in the 1980s you will probably like this.Talky as expected from the director but the dialogues are not as pretentious as in other of his movies. Not the best of Rohmer but very watchable. One problem with the plot is that it is not terribly original since most of us have seen too many movies about single women around 30 years of age feeling lonely.".

From this we get a series of semihumorous scenes some verging on banality in which Delphine travels to various spots walks around or talks airily about things but cannot enjoy herself not only because she's physically alone even when with friends but also because as we soon learn she has broken up with a longtime boyfriend JeanPierre. What initially appears to be a depiction of loneliness born of isolation shades into a portrait lightly but beautifully handled under Rohmer's tough of a young woman's melancholy frustration and depression. Delphine breaks into tears several times and each episode raises the stakes showing how sad and ultimately angry she truly is not just because she has truly lost JeanPierre but because she is the kind of person who is not demonstrative not the life of the partylike the Swedish acquaintance she meets in Biarritz or her Parisian friendsnot inclined to play the games expected of single women. Instead Delphine is a shy soft spoken introvert who takes things and potential relationships as they come which might mean that she'll never again have a chance at love or that she won't be able to act in the expected ways if the opportunity were to present itself.Except that maybe she does or at the very least she does seize an opportunity that looks like desperation at first until the entire scene plays out. Though I clicked the spoiler button I will not give away the ending but it is a stunner so simple and incredibly moving. What is also a testament to Rohmer's genius is how he sets it all up with a very believable overheard improvised conversation earlier revolving around Jules Verne's story The Green Ray and the mythic element in it. This should be a film every film student studies to learn how to pull off the most powerful emotional payoff with what appears to be almost nothing. And Rohmer and Rivire earn it. Superb.".

However when the opportunity came up to see it at the cinema today I couldn't pass it up. This film and others by the same director have influenced other films which I like a lot e.g. Before Sunrise Before Sunset in that there is little action but lots of conversation some interesting some banal. I identified strongly with the quiet introvert lead character Delphine who was misunderstood by her friends and given all sorts of advice on finding a partner which wouldn't be suitable for her at all. The performance by Marie Riviere was wonderful and she contributed to the dialogue too she has a credit shared. Lots of times she had subtle facial expressions going on which spoke volumes and it made me wish I spoke French as when I kept looking to the subtitles I knew in the time I was reading them I was missing some of those. Even the silences or just bouts of tears spoke volumes. I won't reveal too much of the plot except to say it has a hopeful feeling towards the end and the whole thing appealed very much to the romantic in me.".

This film is so completely different than the ones mentioned above. I think Truffaut shows us his innerself by playing the role of Julien Davenne a journalist obsessed with the idea of building an altar for his dead. The audience gets a direct access to his feelings and thoughts about life and death. This film is a chance to understand Truffaut and his work better. He knew that the film would not be a boxoffice hit but that was not important to Truffaut. He liked the shortstories by Henry James and just did what he wanted to. In my opinion Truffaut did a beautiful job by making this film. I think this film demands very much from its viewers. The Green Room provokes a selfreflection in the viewer. The viewer has to deal with his own attitude towards life and death. So this is not an easy film to watch. But if you want a film that differs from all the hightech actionloaded movies of the present that simultaneously gives you a very personal access to the man who made it The Green Room is a good choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Room The 1978  out of 4 Truffaut plays a journalist still grieving the death of his wife nearly ten years after her passing. Her passing helped his obsession of death which ends up making him a friend in an equally strange woman Nathalie Baye who also has her own interesting thoughts on the subject. As his obsession grows deeper the man decides to buy a chapel and turn it into a sanctuary for his wife and other dead friends. This is an extremely bizarre film from Truffaut and while I'm still new to his work this here is certainly the least entertaining of his films that I've seen. I think the entire film is just one real big mess that never really makes sense of what it's trying to do. I couldn't help but feel a tad bit lost as the movie never really seems clear as to what it's trying to say about death as both characters are pulling in opposite directions. I found their relationship to be extremely forced and completely make belief as not for a single second did I feel either one could care for the other. Another minor issue was the performance by Baye which I thought was rather weak. The problem with this is that Truffaut was pretty good and the two just don't work very well together and in the end it hurts the film because not only does their relationship feel weak but it doesn't help that the actor is so many better than the partner. I'd be lying if I said I hated this movie because I really didn't. There just wasn't anything here that kept me overly entertained and in the end I was just too bored by the characters and screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a German blackandwhite movie which was made one year before World War II. French native speakers may want to take a look a the French version with different actors that came out at the very same time. It's basically one part of a twofilm series. The other is called Der Tiger von Eschnapur. Das indische Grabmal is actually a remake from 1921 and 20 years later they made another version. The film's director is Richard Eichberg. He directed almost 90 films since 1915 including some of the movies I just mentioned and this is almost his last effort even if he lived on for quite a while. He made one more 10 years later and he also wrote this movie here which was a bit unusual for him. Maybe that's why he had two cowriters. The most famous name here is probably Thea von Harbou. She came up with the scripts for M and Metropolis and Das indische Grabmal is also based on her work. Or maybe the biggest name is also Theo Lingen one of Germany's most known actors of the 20th century. This film is over 75 years old and runs for almost 90 minutes there is lots of intrigue and drama but also quite some music and dance and a despicable elephant fighting sequence. I liked lead actress Kitty Jantzen's performance and I am a bit surprised to see that she did not really act a lot back then. Maybe she was in here because she was the significant other to director Eichberg. Anyway all in all especially in terms of the story I hoped for more here. I cannot really recommend this film and I hope Der Tiger von Eschnapur will be better. I am gonna give this one watch soon as well so make sure to check out my review for that one too.".

French native speakers may want to take a look a the French version with different actors that came out at the very same time. It's basically one part of a twofilm series. The other is called Der Tiger von Eschnapur. Das indische Grabmal is actually a remake from 1921 and 20 years later they made another version. The film's director is Richard Eichberg. He directed almost 90 films since 1915 including some of the movies I just mentioned and this is almost his last effort even if he lived on for quite a while. He made one more 10 years later and he also wrote this movie here which was a bit unusual for him. Maybe that's why he had two cowriters. The most famous name here is probably Thea von Harbou. She came up with the scripts for M and Metropolis and Das indische Grabmal is also based on her work. Or maybe the biggest name is also Theo Lingen one of Germany's most known actors of the 20th century. This film is over 75 years old and runs for almost 90 minutes there is lots of intrigue and drama but also quite some music and dance and a despicable elephant fighting sequence. I liked lead actress Kitty Jantzen's performance and I am a bit surprised to see that she did not really act a lot back then. Maybe she was in here because she was the significant other to director Eichberg. Anyway all in all especially in terms of the story I hoped for more here. I cannot really recommend this film and I hope Der Tiger von Eschnapur will be better. I am gonna give this one watch soon as well so make sure to check out my review for that one too.";

I put the profoundly moving effect it had on me down to my tender 15 years. So after around 42 years I saw it again this week  I had reason to screen it for my Film Studies class... and it's still quite wonderful.At the centre is an earthy and moving story of the central character Jane's single pregnancy. But Jane is not a scatterbrained bimbo who stumbled into pregnancy she is a sophisticated 27yearold French woman whose virginity was becoming burdensome. But this is the late50s and social attitudes to single pregnancy are wholly different from those of today.The film details Jane's 'go it alone' strategy as she moves into a grotty boarding house occupied by a bunch of unremarkable misfits. Though this 'kitchen sink' drama seems for much of its length like an 'issue' film it is ultimately triumphantly not. There is a black trumpeter Brock Peters who doesn't experience racism and nearly destroys Jane's budding relationship through his judgemental moral attitudes. There is an ageing lesbian music hall artist Cicely Courtneige who isn't ostracised. There is a prostitute Patricia Phoenix who doesn't have a heart of gold or an exploitative pimp.In other words this is a moral tale that refuses to preach. And at the centre of this is the curious and heartwarming theme of all of the wellmeaning people well some of them are wellmeaning who Jane meets who want to help her abort her baby.Our interest is for much of the film centred on the relationship between Toby penniless writer and Jane a relationship that we will to succeed. But in the end it probably as the ending is to some extent inconclusive is not this relationship that we treasure from this film but the sense made oh so movingly in the final scene that Jane has through her hardship and the friendship of people whom she would previously have dismissed become a much fuller person living in this hovel than she could ever have become in the cosy bourgeois bosom of her parents.For this reason and others this is a truly subversive work. No wonder it left so great an impression on me at the tender age of fifteen living in my council flat with my very respectable parents in leafy Sevenoaks...".

The directing work by Forbes is simply beautiful with attention to shadows lighting and camera angles plus some effective closeups. The extent of the unpredictability is a little overthetop and it is not the most satisfying film out there especially at a rather generous twohour length. However for something different for a change this is top quality filmmaking helped out also by an Oscar nominated performance by Leslie Caron who is dazzlingly believable in the main role.".

The set decoration probably deserved an award for the way it evokes with poetry the incredibly realistic environment of a downandout London rooming house. As many commentators have noted this film avoids clichs and gives us realseeming characters played by gifted actors. There is not a single weak link in the cast with Tom Bell Avis Bunnage Brock Peters Cicely Courtneige among others providing so many memorable moments. At the heart of the film is Leslie Caron in an awardnominated performance that is not likely to be forgotten by anyone who sees it. This is a performance that elicits true feeling done with a kind of invisible artistry so it seems completely real. Bryan Forbes one of Britain's finest directors of the period paces the film well relying on Caron and others to fill what may have been longueurs with true meaning. The only criticism is the use of the Brahms First Piano Concerto in the soundtrack. The surging romanticism while appealing in itself doesn't fit very well with the mood of the film apart from a couple of quiet scenes. It's certainly not a big problem only it seems an odd musical choice. A deeply affecting unforgettable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This gritty little film is the victim of it's star's glitz. Leslie Caron has been identified with many classic films but they tend to be musicals An American in Paris Lili Gigi. Occasionally she is recalled for a dramatic performance  but it is usually Fanny which is pointed to because the cast there is full of named stars Boyer Chevalier and Buchholz. But her second Oscar nomination after one for Lili was for the role of Jane Fossett in The LShaped Room. While Fanny is set in a colorfully shot Marseilles and environs The LShaped Room is set in the mean streets and rooming houses of grimy London districts. It is shot too in black and white. This makes the sadness of the story all the more intense and helped make Caron's performance here possibly the best she ever gave in an English speaking film. As for the cast here only two Cecile Courtneidge as Mavis and Emlyn Williams as Dr. Weaver had reputations on par with Cevalier and Boyer in stage and screen work and a third Brock Peters as Johnny the Anglo  Caribbean who is the neighbor of Jane is better recalled for his smaller part of the defendant that Gregory Peck tries to save in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.The LShaped Room is about Jane a Frenchwoman who comes to England to get away from her puritanical and harsh parents in France in order to have a child she got from a one night stand with an actor she met on one occasion. She checks into a boarding house on the top floor  attic rooms run by Doris Avis Brunnage. Initially Jane plans to have the baby aborted  and she got the name and address of a Harley Street specialist Dr. Weaver. But the selfsatisfied Weaver is so sure of himself he knows all the answers from his patients and he knows how to steer the patient to the story facts he needs to know to protect himself from prosecution for giving abortions that he turns off Jane even before she realizes his price 100 guineas in 1962  about two thousand dollars today with inflation rates. Caron tells off the amazed Weaver Williams just can't believe this one is not behaving like the other unwed mothers and taking orders and tells him she is now convinced to have the child.The film follows Caron's interaction with the other people in the boarding house including Doris Mavis a one time West End headliner Sonia Patricia Phoenix and Jane II Verity Edmet  two prostitutes Toby Tom Bell  a struggling writer and Johnny. In the course of her pregnancy she gets to see the secrets in most of their lives in particular Mavis a decent woman who had a secret lover who died and Toby with whom Jane falls in love. But the pregnancy becomes a major factor in Jane's sexualemotional tie to Toby. Will it derail their love or not?Caron is intense in the film whether telling off Williams or trying to come to an understanding with Bell. Without overacting she does make one see a woman who has been deserted by everyone in a moment of need but determined not to destroy what can be the best thing in her life up until now. The film observes her decision and how it pans out and how the rest of the world accepts it or rejects it or just passes it by. The LShaped Room has never been a very popular film. My suspicion is that in a world where the issue of who has the right to have an abortion and the right of the woman to choose is so touchy to so many people the fact that the abortion method is thrown away just not really popular with many modern audiences. Like it's contemporary film LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER despite the well produced movie results the message against abortion even if thoroughly understandable is just not acceptable in many quarters as a solution to the problem. It so the movie audiences at revival houses are missing one fine film and a gradeA performance by Caron here.".

	schema:reviewBody "After spending the better part of the 1950's as MGM's resident French gamine Leslie Caron finally turned in her toe shoes and delivered a poignant performance in this 1962 British kitchen sink drama directed and written by Bryan Forbes The Stepford Wives. She plays Jane Fosset a 27yearold Frenchwoman who finds herself in a standard predicament  she thinks she may be pregnant after a brief loveless affair. After visiting with an insolent doctor who presumes the worst about her Jane decides to keep the baby and moves into the eponymous studio up in the attic of a rundown boarding house in the thenseedy Fulham area of London. Initially withdrawn from her fellow residents all social outsiders in their own way Jane finds herself bonding with everyone especially Toby the tortured writer who lives in the unit below. They naturally fall in love but once he finds out about her pregnancy he struggles with it and becomes overwhelmed by his own failures.Forbes keeps the story going at a pace that sometimes feel glacial as the film runs an overlong 126 minutes but Caron imbues so much compassion into her role that it makes it all worthwhile. The supporting cast is fine as well with Tom Bell quite good as Toby. Bearing a striking resemblance to Laurence Harvey Bell had his only leading man role in this film and later became a busy character actor facing off Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect. Fresh off his 180degree turn as the wrongfully accused rapist in To Kill a Mockingbird Brock Peters provides an ebullient presence as Johnny a West Indian jazz musician who lives next door to Jane. His character is rather intriguing because you can't quite tell whether Johnny's jealousy of Jane and Toby's burgeoning romance is spurred on by his attraction toward one or the other. Cicely Courtneidge makes an impression as a former vaudevillian who has become a lonely woman obsessed with her cat. Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor Op. 15 is used effectively as background music on the soundtrack. You should read Caron's fond recollection of the film's production in her affecting autobiography Thank Heaven.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some Spoilers Leaving her well to do family in France 27 yearold Jane Fosset Leslie Caron is trying to get away from her past.Having gotten involved with a young Englishman Terry played by Mark Edan while on a trip to Cornwall England Jean soon found that she was pregnant. Not knowing what to do Jean went to the downtrodden section of London's Notting Hill to find a place to stay as well as what to do with her giving or not giving birth to Terry's child. Should she go full term or have the child aborted. The problem with having an abortion back then in 1962 England is that abortions were illegal!Renting a topfloor apartment and this Notting Hill boarding house Jean soon became friendly with a number of her neighbors. One of them Toby Tom Bell a struggling 28 yearold writer took a liking to the sweet and insecure Jean as soon as he saw her giving her a hand with her luggage up the six flight of stairs. There's also former stage actress Mavis Cicely Courtneidge who lives on the ground floor with her pet black cat Benji. Marvis senses that Jean in how she carries herself is not exactly the kind of person who would live in a place like that the boarding house and wonders what was the reason for her moving there! Is Jane running away from something or someone?There's also Jane's next door neighbor Johnny Brock Peters a Black West Indian trumpet player. Johnny is about as kind and friendly as you or Jane would want for a neighbor making Jane feel at ease and wanted in the boarding house almost as soon as she moved in. It's later when Johnny first senses that Jane is pregnant and is at the same time romantically involved with his good friend Toby that he completely changes. Being either very religious minded or feeling that Jane is taking his friend or possible lover Toby away from him Johnny informs Toby that Jane is in Johnny's words a whore who's been having illicit affairs with other man and has also been put in the family way by one of them. All this stunned Toby who's suspicions about Jane he had earlier seen Jane and her exlover Terry together were confirmed by Johnny! There and then Toby feeling a deep sense of betrayal has nothing at all to do with a heartbroken Jane who's very much in love with him.Jane who against everyone's advice was willing to go full term with her pregnancy nowin the very depressed state that's she inwan't to terminate it. Swallowing a number of pills that Marvis gave her Jane soon goes into convulsions and ends up in a local hospital. To Jane's surprise and delight she finds out that her baby wasn't aborted which if it was would have very well lead to her to kill herself.While all these emotional events were being played out both Johnny and Toby begin to realized how both shabby and unfeeling they were to Jane. Johnny depressed over spreading the rumor that Jane was a whore pleaded for Jane's forgiveness which she gladly gave him but Toby just couldn't bring himself to love he still remained her good friend Jane anymore. The fact that Jane was carrying another man'sTerrychild was something that Toby couldn't come to grips with.SPOILER ALERT Extremely touching ending with Toby coming to visit Jane after she gave birth to a baby girl in the hospital with a manuscript of his after five tries soon to be published novel The LShaped Room. A novel inspired by his relationship with Jane as well as his fellow neighbors at his boarding house. After a heartfelt conversation with Jane Toby as he's leaving the maternity ward is approached by one of the nurses who asks him innocently when will you see her next time?. Thinking that's the nurse is talking about Jane Toby after asking who is pleasantly surprised to hear that the nurse was asking him about his daughter! She's very pretty the nurse tells him just like her mother Jane.".

Not knowing what to do Jean went to the downtrodden section of London's Notting Hill to find a place to stay as well as what to do with her giving or not giving birth to Terry's child. Should she go full term or have the child aborted. The problem with having an abortion back then in 1962 England is that abortions were illegal!Renting a topfloor apartment and this Notting Hill boarding house Jean soon became friendly with a number of her neighbors. One of them Toby Tom Bell a struggling 28 yearold writer took a liking to the sweet and insecure Jean as soon as he saw her giving her a hand with her luggage up the six flight of stairs. There's also former stage actress Mavis Cicely Courtneidge who lives on the ground floor with her pet black cat Benji. Marvis senses that Jean in how she carries herself is not exactly the kind of person who would live in a place like that the boarding house and wonders what was the reason for her moving there! Is Jane running away from something or someone?There's also Jane's next door neighbor Johnny Brock Peters a Black West Indian trumpet player. Johnny is about as kind and friendly as you or Jane would want for a neighbor making Jane feel at ease and wanted in the boarding house almost as soon as she moved in. It's later when Johnny first senses that Jane is pregnant and is at the same time romantically involved with his good friend Toby that he completely changes. Being either very religious minded or feeling that Jane is taking his friend or possible lover Toby away from him Johnny informs Toby that Jane is in Johnny's words a whore who's been having illicit affairs with other man and has also been put in the family way by one of them. All this stunned Toby who's suspicions about Jane he had earlier seen Jane and her exlover Terry together were confirmed by Johnny! There and then Toby feeling a deep sense of betrayal has nothing at all to do with a heartbroken Jane who's very much in love with him.Jane who against everyone's advice was willing to go full term with her pregnancy nowin the very depressed state that's she inwan't to terminate it. Swallowing a number of pills that Marvis gave her Jane soon goes into convulsions and ends up in a local hospital. To Jane's surprise and delight she finds out that her baby wasn't aborted which if it was would have very well lead to her to kill herself.While all these emotional events were being played out both Johnny and Toby begin to realized how both shabby and unfeeling they were to Jane. Johnny depressed over spreading the rumor that Jane was a whore pleaded for Jane's forgiveness which she gladly gave him but Toby just couldn't bring himself to love he still remained her good friend Jane anymore. The fact that Jane was carrying another man'sTerrychild was something that Toby couldn't come to grips with.SPOILER ALERT Extremely touching ending with Toby coming to visit Jane after she gave birth to a baby girl in the hospital with a manuscript of his after five tries soon to be published novel The LShaped Room. A novel inspired by his relationship with Jane as well as his fellow neighbors at his boarding house. After a heartfelt conversation with Jane Toby as he's leaving the maternity ward is approached by one of the nurses who asks him innocently when will you see her next time?. Thinking that's the nurse is talking about Jane Toby after asking who is pleasantly surprised to hear that the nurse was asking him about his daughter! She's very pretty the nurse tells him just like her mother Jane.";

This dramatic kitchensink realistic role was at the time1962 a total departure for Leslie Caronwho had achieved quite a reputation in musical Technicolor masterpieces like Gigi. She got an an Oscar nomination for this filmand proved she could be a compelling dramatic actress as well.If Richard Attenborough who coproduced the film had a hand in choosing Miss Caron he certainly scored a casting coup.I saw this movie in 1963 It was haunting and memorable then. It still is. I especially remember the exquisite Brahms score Piano Concerto 1 so sad and beautiful. The piano seemed to echo Jane's role sadly and bravely interacting with the untidy world around herincluding the troubled rooming house neighbors and represented by the orchestra.All performances were excellent. Tom Bell as Tobyresonates with special power as the conflicted lover and tortured writer.And the grand actress who played Mavis the lesbianCicely Courtneidgeimbues her role with poignant pathos. The director is relentless in keeping the story acting and cinematography true to life and to the tenets of kitchen sink realismlike refusing a Hollywoodtype hyped ending. In structure he's more traditional than some of his English counterparts.Alsothis director isless avant guard than his French nouvelle vague contemporaries like Truffaut and Goddard. For this well told tale.that may be an asset.The black and white cinematography is so right for the time and for the ambiance. This is the kind of movie that makes you wish for a black and white comeback so effective for a certain kind of Brahmsian sadness.Strange that a French icon like Leslie Caron was not selected by the French new wave directors to play in their filmsyet she went across the channel to give a luminous and mature performance amidst good English actors in an excellent film.

She's quite pretty.The months come and the months go and Caron's abdomen swells apace. Everyone she knows seems intent on persuading her to abort the pregnancy or to give it up for adoption without seeing it first. That last is grounded in experience. After birth there are a few hours that form a launch window during which if the mother sees the neonate some sort of reflex occurs and a bond between them is cemented.The performances are up to par even if some of the characters exhibit stereotyped traits.

It's a pretty shocking film for its time dealing frankly with topics like abortion and lesbianism unapologetically.

For Field's fans or for anyone who just wants to laugh and have a good time this film is a definite must see.'  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "In It's A Gift W.C. Fields delivers enjoyable silliness as only he could do it.  It's quite a showcase for his brand of humor and this movie has it all from sight gags to dry wit to hilarious predicaments to a putupon hero.  There have been few comedians like Fields who could get so much mileage out of simple ideas or who could make outrageous ideas work so well.The plot ostensibly concerns store owner Harold Bissonette Fields who dreams of owning an orange ranch in California but very little actually happens in terms of a story  the emphasis is on the trials of daily life that Harold must endure.  The movie is a series of comic set pieces in which Fields takes a simple situation and turns it into a stream of gags and laughs.  His ability to find endless sources of humor in the most mundane of settings is an impressive contrast with the labored and often inappropriate efforts of so many of today's comic actors.In this one Fields also manages to create a pleasant atmosphere that despite all the disorder in Harold's life makes you feel at home with the characters.  Many of the scenes also give one of the other cast members a chance for some good moments and Kathleen Howard helps out a lot too as Harold's nagging wife.  There's nothing to take seriously here but if you're in the mood not to take anything seriously this is a very enjoyable way to spend an hour or so.".

	schema:reviewBody "W.C. Fields was simply the most talented comedian who ever lived and It's a Gift 1934 is his most accessible feature. It's a loose remake of the 1926 silent It's the Old Army Game which stared Fields and Louise Brooks and which Fields wrote. Like most silent features the scene transitions are very abrupt with titles used in place scripted transitional elements. For It's a Gift Director Norman McLeod elected to stay true to the original and keep the flavor of its sudden transitions. Although the technique is jarring to modern viewers it works to the film's comic advantage by speeding up the pace of the film as it moves from set piece to set piece with virtually no filler. You get everything that would have had any entertainment value in a 90minute feature compressed into a 73minute picture. Imagine a fouract play with onesecond breaks between each act. Act I takes place in the in the apartment home of the Bissonette family consisting of put upon everyman husbandfather Harold Fields his shrewish wife Amelia Kathleen Howard overwrought teenage daughter Jean Jean Rouverol and roller skating 9year old son Norman Tom Bupp. The most famous bit is Fields trying to finish shaving after his daughter has eased him away from the bathroom mirror.Harold is the proprietor of a small grocery store and Act II takes place inside the store. The most famous bit concerns blind Mr. Muckle Charles Sellon whose flailing cane causes a staggering amount of damage.Act III finds Harold back home trying to set some sleep. The best bit involves a series of trivial interruptions as everyone from the milk man to an insurance salesman manage to disturb him the moment it appears he is finally going to get some rest.Act IV is the family's move to California by automobile to start a new life on an orange ranch Harold has purchased with his inheritance. It's pretty much constant laughs all the more remarkable because Fields stays in character for the entire duration. Harold Bissonette is his most sympathetic character just an average guy badgered and hounded to the point of exasperation. Unlike his other features there are no cheap laughs from drinking or from leering at young women. The comedy derives entirely from Fields and Howard who gets a laugh with every single line it a nightmare realistic enough to make you squirm. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I can't think of a single funny line from It's A Gift worth remembering. But what does stick with you are all the gestures and expressions with his body and face that Fields gives us to show the hellhole of his married state.Kathleen Howard in fact doesn't let the poor guy get a word in edgewise. What a motormouth that woman had constantly finding fault and running him down from the first to the last minute of the movie. Right at the beginning of the film the poor guy can't even have the bathroom to himself as kids and wife just barge in on him with their problems and complaints. In that scene where Fields is trying to shave to later on when he goes out on the porch hammock to get some peace and quiet it's nothing in what he says but in all the reaction shots where the comedy comes from. Even in the famous scene at the general store with the blind man Mr. Muckle. The comedy is all in Fields's reactions to Muckle running amuck. Trying not to say anything to observe political correctness. Remember Muckle is also identified as the house detective in the hotel across the street.Kathleen Howard serves as Fields's greatest foil no wonder he did three films with her. Note how Hyacinth like she is in insisting that her name Bissonette be pronounced Bissonay.Still Fields pursues the American dream and when Uncle Bean dies and wills him some California property he loads up the truck and moves to well not Beverly Hills but close enough so he can get an orange grove and grow them. It comes about in an interesting way that you have to see the film for.It's A Gift is one of the finest efforts of America's most beloved misanthropes.".

The film concerns poor Mr. Bissonettea much more likable and putupon character than usual for Fields. He's basically a good hardworking man who tries his best to care for his family though through most of the film he gets little thanks for his efforts. In the first portion of the film he's a grocery store owner who has to deal with a lot of difficult customers. My favorite of these is Mr. Muckle the blind and hard of hearing man. While this is far from politically correct the scene where Muckle destroys the store is hilarious and you have to see it to appreciate it. Apart from running the store we see Fields in a lot of mundane activities that should not be funny such as trying to get a good night's sleepbut with his wonderful delivery and sense of timing it can't help but make you laugh.In the last portion Fields takes his family to the promised landto California to the orange ranch he bought sight unseen. Despite years of very hard work to earn the money for the land of course there is a catch and his dream isn't quite all it's cracked up to be. However remember that this is a film cowritten by Fields and his drunk everyman character is going to somehow succeed just like he did in so many other filmsit's the HOW that you'll just have to see for yourself.The film has some wonderful supporting performances but for the most part this film is Fields. He singlehandedly keeps the film going and his timing and talents are immense. Give this one a chance and get ready to laugh.Also despite the same titles don't mix this one up with the great short from Snub Pollardalso a mustsee for old time comedy fans.".

He was there to make people laugh not think. But with IT'S A GIFT he presents a story which would've been worthy of Chaplin Keaton or any of the foreign masters like Jacques Tati. The story has Fields as a henpecked husband who wants nothing more than to buy an Orange Grove in California. The first half of the film details Fields attempts to run his local grocery store business and to try and maintain his sanity around his household from which he is far the master. Then he gets his wish when he is able to buy the orange ranch with some inheritance money. In true Fieldsian tradition there turns out to be some problems with the ranch but that doesn't stop him. The ending turns out to be Fields' most satisfying finale to any of his pictures. IT'S A GIFT which was ironically panned in its day! must surely rank as one of the top 5 comedies of any time of any country thus establishing W.C.

Fields we could've started with but we were just too damn lazy to add them to the list. So we first meet the plump rednosed curmudgeonly underdog at age 53 in his purported masterpiece 'It's a Gift.' As an actual movie the film is put together pretty poorly. Comic vignettes are strung together loosely transitions are almost nonexistent and the lack of music is far too noticeable. But the comic vignettes themselves containing some of Field's best gags are always hilarious. It's rare to see a comic actor in this period playing a family man. Of course it would be hard to imagine a guy of Field's age and complexion as a romantic lead like his other comic contemporaries. Field's bumbling grocer is tormented by his shrewish wife annoying kids and every person he meets in a series of gags that seem more based on the actual experiences of a veteran family man rather than spilling out of the gagwriters' factory. There are times where Fields' bad luck and getting blamed for every stupid thing that happens even stuff that's obviously not his fault strains belief even in the midst of a comedy. Anyway this is definitely a must see but I'm sure it would play far better if watched by a large company of viewers than by any individual.DOUG Welcome to the world of W.C. Fields where all the women are nagging shrews all the children are unwieldy brats and the hero is a clumsy boorish impatient and obstinate old man. Most of the comedians of the era have protagonists that are everymen andor cartoon characters getting into extraordinary situations through mostly no fault of their own and showing some pluckiness as they overcome adversity. Fields however seems to wind up in situations mostly his fault that he could get out of if he possessed even the slightest bit of finesse. Case in point the film's first sustained gag sequence in which Fields foolishly lets his daughter into the bathroom so she can do her hair while he's in the middle of shaving leaving him to struggle to find a steady reflection to finish his job instead of just you know ASKING HER to hang back for a couple of minutes. This continues throughout the movie which is little more than a collection of episodes showing Fields constantly besotted by forces determined to drive him mad. He tries in vain to escape his awful wife by sleeping on the porch amid a parade of noise he attempts to run his grocery store while handling a grouchy customer a neighbor's demon child a ballistic blind man and a halfwit assistant he should have fired long ago and he drives his rickety old car into a private estate for a picnic promising that the KEEP OUT sign is just to scare the hobos away. A unique brand of comedy to be sure one that I'm surprised got past the Hays Code in any measure so definitely recommended.Last film The Gay Divorce 1934. Next film Imitation of Life 1934.".

Fields' character here is not the snide con artist type that Fields is usually associated with but a meek even gentle man who is besieged by the world but who possesses a quiet determination and a dream. Fields sets the tone early with a hilarious scene in which he comes off as the sympathetic character in a runin with a blind man and continues in that vein until he sets off in pursuit of his dream. The movie is also a great period piece that really conveys the drudgery of many people's lives during the Great Depression and the powerful lure of the dream of finding a Better Place kind of a laughoutloud funny Grapes of Wrath. Appropriately for this beautifully crafted film the final scene is understated but deeply satisfying as is the entire movie.".

His nagging wife Amelia Kathleen Howard just can't wait to tick off all the ways Harold ticks her off in as loud a voice as possible. Harold puts up with this as he plots to buy his orange grove despite her persistent objections.What did I say last? she demands at the end of one tirade.Yes yes every word of it a distracted Harold meekly replies.If you are a diehard W. C. fan it's not hard to recommend It's A Gift. It's a series of quintessential setpieces of Fieldsian slow burns and doublespeak. There's not much to be said for the plot as you shouldn't have to pay more attention to it than Fields and his team of writers did. The point is to get Fields in various messes and this It's A Gift does with brisk efficiency.Plenty of famous bits make their way on screen. The infamous Carl LaFong is namedropped and namespelled for eternity and there's of course the biggest cinematic nod in the direction of the kumquat industry though unlike Mr. LaFong they get the name spelled wrong. Everyone remembers that scene where Harold tries to whack his son Well he's not going to tell me I don't love him! and when he comes up with a Churchillian reply when accused of being drunk.The question of enjoying It's A Gift boils down to how much you embrace aggravation comedy where the humor is built into annoying situations made more so through sheer repetition. I can only take so much of Harold dodging customers in his store or wrestling with a deck chair. A long sequence showcases Harold trying to sleep on a porch while a milkman a coconut a salesman and a squeaky clothesline all conspire against him. I can't help but chuckle a few times but am always happy when the scene ends.Harold is a fascinating character a beaten man who is the author of his own destruction. He bought an orange ranch even after knowing it was a lemon lets a blind man smash everything in his store and of course married Amelia. But he's still Fields and manages to work his way through his selfcreated turmoil to a surprisingly upbeat if leftfield conclusion.That's my favorite part of the film but you can't say enough for the able support of Kathleen Howard. Her Amelia is a wonderful shrew kind of likable in her querulous way. She nags Harold even in her sleep and her line readings are deliriously skewed in the way they seem to fall heavy on nearly every other syllable. Don't be kicking Norman's skates around! she huffs after Harold does a header slipping on one of his son's rollerskates as if Harold did it just to annoy her. Considering this is Fields maybe he did.Director Norman Z. McLeod isn't much talked about even among film students though he may be the only man who directed major vehicles for Fields the Marx Brothers Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. He knew how to work with comedy stars and here keeps Fields at the center of the action.Watching It's A Gift can be hard on the nerves but it's also a treat for the funny bone with a good heart discernible amid the mayhem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das jngste Gericht is an Austrian Germanlanguage film for the small screen from 2008 so this one will have its 10th anniversary next year. It is among the most known works by highly prolific Swiss director Urs Egger and the script is by Don Bohlinger who is probably mostly known for Das Experiment. This one we have here is basically two movies in one so you could almost call it a miniseries. It's 1.5 hours for each part and you can watch the entire thing in 3 hours if you want to. And I believe you should because it has Austrian actor Christoph Waltz in it shortly before his Hollywood breakthrough with Tarantino. And it has another of Austria's finest in Tobias Moretti who plays the main character and is joined by female lead Silke Bodenbender who is rocksolid too and gives a good performance too even if her material is not always great.There are many films out there that are on religiouslymotivated murders Se7en but this one here is among the very best I have seen. The script is really good at times and also pretty bold not scared of anything. There are minor flaws like why wouldn't they suspect Waltz' character's wife to be the killer as he just told her he'd cheated on her and leave her but it's fine as this was of course also explained by the number that it must be somebody else. And his death sure came at the right time with Bodenbender's character not too fond of the idea to stay with him after spending a night with his colleague right before that. This colleague is Moretti and he is really really good definitely elevates the material even if I have to wonder how he was allowed to keep investigating with how personal it became for him at the very end of the first 1.5 hours. This end was also when the film was at its best at a brilliant . But even if this level had not been achieved afterward again it was still a really solid watch from start to finish. The plot twists were entertaining and still felt authentic most of the time and the lead performance was nothing short of amazing. It's a film you don't want to miss out on especially if you love the genre and another great achievement is that it never drags despite the huge runtime. Go see it.".

It is also in color already of course and you may guess that it may have inspired other German films in the future such as Gotschalk's and Krger's Supernasen for example. I must say after having watched four Willi films I guess this one here ends up as my favorite and maybe the only one I would recommend. There were actually a couple jokes in here that I found pretty funny and I was surprised myself. Pther than that there is nothing new. It runs for roughly 90 minutes like the others.

	schema:reviewBody "A mere four months after the release of the first successful Willi Winzig film 'Was Ist Den Blo mit Willi Los? Heinz Erhardt returned to the silver screen as another Willi Hirsekorn to be precise. Erhardt introduces the film himself in an unnecessary prologue accompanied by some unconvincing attempts of him trying to 'push back' the opening credits. This Willi though basically the same character Erhardt usually plays is married has two children and a 'fourlegged boxer' as mentioned in the opening credits a dog of said breed called 'KarlHeinz'. Ruth Stephan who appeared as Willi's secretary less than half a year ago has been elevated to the part of his wife this time round and Hans Terofal appears as her dimwitted accident prone brother who for some reason also lives with them.The Hirsekorn family has never really gotten on with their next door neighbors the Buntje's Gnther Jerschke and Kte Jaenicke. Heimo and Mizzi for that are the Buntje's first names have a teenage daughter Petra Angelika Baumgart but disapprove of her mustachioed boyfriend Herbert Klaus Hagen Latwesen. When her parents decide to take a tour bus to Italy Petra and Herbert concoct a cunning plan to get him into her parents good graces. Apparently all he has to do is shave his upper lip and introduce himself as a nice clean cut boy. In another strange attempt at humor the title of this very movie is mentioned on the Hirsekorn's TV but Willi's wife Sieglinde turns it off in order to convince her hubby to go Italy as well she always wants to one up Mizzi. Willi mentions he visited Italy in '42 ooh er I thought making fun of the war was illegal in Germany but eventually he concedes and promises to drive the entire family dog brother in law et all to the very same hotel the bus is headed for Grand Hotel Remolo.Most of the car trip seems to have been filmed inside Willi's cramped little car. This means the characters in front were shot separately from the characters in back in order to accommodate the cameraman. Must have been quite a task for the continuityscript girl. Though this picture obviously had a slighter bigger budget than the previous Willi hence a story with more scope and more locations writerdirector Rolf Olsen is not afraid to include some of the most tiresome techniques ever seen in comedy sped up music accompanying a fast forwarded sequence as well as whistle and drumroll sound effects. Once we get to the seaside I'm not entirely convinced they set foot in Italy though there is some Italian to be heard there are more Benny Hill inspired gags and musical cues as well as some crudely animated wasps and 'sunburn' effects.As mentioned at the top of this comment years before every film was split into different chapters for it to be released on DVD this movie already has chapter titles in place as well as on screen Wochenendefriende Die Abfahrt Die Reise Der Ferienort Der Strandleben Die Ferienromanze and Der Abschied. This should come in handy for the kind of audience that loves to turn of their brain and have everything explained to them which according to the IMDb message boards is quite a big portion of the viewing public as well as for the inevitable DVD release though I suspect six or seven chapters might be a bit sparse.At first the quarreling neighbors continue at their usual pace at the beach in Italy but when the two men spot a buxom blonde they decide to team up and aim for some holiday romance as long as the wife's handily indisposed by the aforementioned sunburns don't catch on. Both Willi and Heimo fail to realize that blonde Clementine Almut Berg is only interested in their money. That silly brother in law of Willi has found a willing victim in the Hotel owner's daughter but finds himself continually thwarted by his own niece and nephew shame on them. When Erhardt starts to sing a silly song on the last night of the holiday you know the film is drawing to a close and every loose end will be resolved before the song is through. And so it is. At least until the next Willi.6 out of 10".

The story is taken from a German fairytale by Wilhelm Hauff. Like many German fairytales the setting is the Black Forest which is nevertheless an interesting fact keeping in mind that it was coldwar times and the Black Forest part of WestGermany. Apart from being a piece of very subtle socialist propaganda it is an impressive work of art. The movie plays with German archetypes in a masterly way the character of the Hollaender Michel is one thing that stays in mind the stateoftheart special effects are another one. EastGerman movie production came never again anywhere close to it. It is a very interesting experience to watch that movie again some 20 years later and notice the dreamlike narration in complete accord with the allusions to classstruggle and the last breaths of a unified German conscience at that time. Very nice and never really appreciated for its accomplishments... I give it 9 of 10 the last frame is too obvious...".

	schema:reviewBody "Das kalte Herz or The Cold Heart or Heart of Stone is an East German Germanlanguage film from 1950 so this one had its 65th anniversary last year. It is probably the most known work by writer and director Paul Verhoeven father of Michael and grandfather of Simon. Writer is not 100 correct in this case though as the one who wrote the original story was Wilhelm Hauff of course. Here in Germany Hauff is also still somewhat known even if obviously not as famous as the Brothers Grimm. His talent usually were a lot of darker than the Grimms'. And this 100minute film we have here is one example for that. I guess it is safe to say that many GDR films have been entirely forgotten by now but this one here is among the ones that are still a bit popular today. I cannot understand why though. Lead actor Lutz Moik offers very little and shows painful overacting on several occasions. Hanna Rucker is absolutely stunning but sadly her character was not written in a way where she really could have showed us her acting talent and range. Or she just doesn't have it. Bildt and Esser as supernatural creatures symbolizing good and evil do a decent job but it's not enough to make up for the flaws either. A while ago I watched a much more recent version of this story and I was not impressed either. Maybe this tale just isn't for me. It is about a young man who has to go to wealth and back and again the same route in order to find out what really matters. A truly cardiologic sensation happens to him on the way to enlightenment this one is described in the title. All in all I am a bit surprised this film is still famous and popular today. I did not have a good time watching. Thumbs down.".

It has a very enjoyable mix of some excellentlycast actors from the laidback Glenn Ford the frenetic Eddie Albert and the pompous Paul Ford to the host of beguiling Japanese actors. Casting Marlon Brando as Sakini requires a little suspension of belief but his contribution quickly adds to the seductive quality of the movie. It turns out to be a good sendup of the officious but largely benign senior military leadership of the era but largely revolves around Glenn Ford's character Capt. Fisby finding his mtier. Mainly it is a loving and alluring little fiction about two peoples getting to know and appreciate each other. It is a very nice little comedy to be enjoyed but it clearly is not meant to be a documentary representation of U.S. Military occupation forces and if it is viewed as such much of the magic of the movie will be lost. While it may contain a few minor instances of the attitudes of that day some of which are no longer politically correct there is no malice in the characterizations and the overall message is one of appreciation of both cultures. A very enjoyable way to escape the hassle and hustle of today.".

It is a very nice little comedy to be enjoyed but it clearly is not meant to be a documentary representation of U.S. Military occupation forces and if it is viewed as such much of the magic of the movie will be lost. While it may contain a few minor instances of the attitudes of that day some of which are no longer politically correct there is no malice in the characterizations and the overall message is one of appreciation of both cultures. A very enjoyable way to escape the hassle and hustle of today.";

	schema:headline " Broadway play makes a good film";
	schema:reviewBody "In watching Teahouse of the August Moon again recently I can see how it made such a smash on Broadway. Besides its very funny plot and script the setting seems ideal for a stage. Or did they move the stage setting to Japan or elsewhere for the movie? I ask that because after three viewings over the years the thought has stuck in my mind that it seemed like it was on stage. Perhaps the final scene when we see Sakini directing the locals to reassemble the teahouse drove that thought more than anything. I performed and worked in theater at the college level and it struck me as a beautiful job of a change of sets and scenery. The further we get away from the 20th century war years the less humorous some of the spoofs of military management seem to be. I may have found this film much funnier years ago but it seems to me now to be just OK or good. This is a comedy of situations not witty dialog. And its humor derives to a great extent from the variety of characters. But for one I could have rated it a notch or two higher. Glenn Ford just does not deliver the humor in his role as Capt. Fisby. He moves between a hapless seemingly lazy guy who has lots of bad luck to a frenetic nervous character who's worried about doing things right. Then he becomes a very laid back unexcitable character who doesn't seem like anything will ruffle him. It just doesn't seem to work. The right actor might be able to deliver that but it doesn't work for Ford. And that's too bad because as one of the two main leads his character is a great part of the film. I know Ford was capable of great acting but his interpretation for this role misses the mark. Now what earns the film seven stars from me are three performances and the local extras. Marlon Brando is excellent as Sakini Eddie Albert is fantastic as Capt. McLean and Paul Ford is superb as Col. Purdy. Purdy and McLean are the sources of most of the funny streaks of this film. We see a good contrast in how Albert transforms from the straightlaced psychologist to the giddy gardener. It works beautifully for him and he is superb in that role. Paul Ford is a wonderful character actor who plays bombastic buffoons with bravado. And Brando is excellent as the wonderful interpreter whom we know translates things to come out his way. His opening dialog is very good  in Oriental theatre style he is the narrator who gives the story's background and sets the stage so to speak. Films in which white actors play other races draw the ire of some people yet today. If they are derogatory of the race or character they surely should be criticized. But otherwise not. Because this is theater on stage or on film and that is part of what acting is all about. Making one's self into another character or person of whatever age race physical condition mental state or appearance  is a hallmark of acting. To aspiring thespians or established actors the challenge of a different or demanding role is energizing. I played Hsieh PingKuei in a college production of Lady Precious Stream by Chinese playwright and director S.I. Hsiung. Mr. Hsiung went to London in 1932 to pursue post graduate studies of Shakespeare. Shortly after his arrival he wrote Lady Precious Stream in English adapting it from his Chinese culture. It was a huge success running for 1000 performances in 1935 and 1936 at the People's National Theatre of London. Its cast was all Caucasian and in 1936 it moved to Broadway in the U.S. where is success continued. It was made into movies in England in 1938 and 1950 adapted by Hsiung again with Caucasian casts.I should like to see someone make a movie of Lady Precious Stream shot on location with the full original script. It could be with Asians in all the roles or it could include a mix if one or more Western stars wanted to tackle a Chinese role. I think many Western audiences today would enjoy it immensely. The story is a romantic sometimes comic domestic drama set in a time of instability during the Tang Dynasty. In the meantime Teahouse of the August Moon can entertain as a comic look at U.S. military management in a conquered country whose culture is much different from that of America.".

Then a few years ago I saw it again and thought that it had graciously passed the test of time. Today I made an introduction about it for the personnel of the Electoral Court of Panama as The Teahouse started a series of film projections with later discussions about themes subjects situations concepts contained in cinema. Movies like this one raise questions about democracy military occupation the meeting of cultures the oppression of one culture over people from a different place with a different worldview imperialism and so on. It is still an enchanting comedy with bright touches of satire a few old fashioned jokes and moving realizations by ordinary people both American and Japanese which compensate for its artificiality verbosity and Marlon Brando's forced characterization of the Japanese narrator. It does so with film editing that gives good rhythm to the plot which has by itself a lot of vitality in the way it was directed fine and fluid camerawork and funny performances by Glenn Ford and Machiko Kyo who also dances a beautiful choreography. The third part is excessively formulaic in order to reach a cheerful conclusion but it is after all a product of a time of world tension and political struggle and in those situations people ask for happy endings. Those were the days of the Cold War after World War II with the anticommunist witchhunting still fresh in everybody's minds and the Hays Code still ruling the representation of life in all its manifestation most notable eroticism which is a strong element in the story. Watch it it is very good.".

The ending is less organic than Eddie Albert's vegetables.Marlon Brando  well he's not Japanese. He's too tall and too hefty and the role was really beneath him. The guy at the time was a fantastic dramatic actor not a comedian. Paul Ford as Colonel Purdy is fine. No one has expressed disbelief better while on the phone. Albert doesn't have to do much. But Glen Ford couldn't be improved upon as Captain Fisbe the abject schlemiel who always flunks every test of wits that's thrown in his direction. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the scenes  Kyo wrestling with Ford while she struggles to remove his clothing and Colonel Purdy on the phone asking him What are you doing about physical education? as Ford flops gracelessly on the floor. Ford doing a fine imitation of having a manic episode when Albert visits him  This is my cricket cage and then adding quickly so as not to be misunderstood I haven't got my cricket yet.The script is full of yoks. Colonel Purdy demanding an explanation from Ford of exactly what he's been teaching the villagers. Well Colonel you know from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs share and share alike  Purdy That's COMMUNISM!Alas it falls apart after the show at the opening of the teahouse.

Also what a fantastic way to combine and confront two radical and different ways of thinking the American way of life with the mystic way of the Asian people.

	schema:reviewBody "The Teahouse of the August Moon 1956 Daniel Mann dir. Vern J Sneider author and John Patrick playwright Starring Glen Ford Marlon Brando.This film is the one most people will recall as the one that features Brando playing an oriental coolie. More specifically he plays an Okinowan Interpreter who presents a tale of culture clash between the US occupational forces and the native Okinowans following WW2.Detractors will argue that the stage play was superior and that Brando was miscast. They may or may not have validity and most of us including me will never know. What we are left with however remains one of my very favourite films. It's a very well conceived and intelligent comedy. If I were to level any criticism it would be that the pacing is rather too quick. The laughs mostly come too thick and fast to digest but at least repeat viewing pays off.As it was made in 1956 the style is also of its time and this includes to an extent the humour too. I enjoy this as part of the experience. Making a 'period' film is a very different thing to making a contemporary one of its own time or within 10 years anyway. In other words this lends authenticity to the period in social terms which is close to impossible to do by any other means.I estimate I have watched 'TeaHouse' at least a dozen times over the last 20 years. The experience has never diminished in all that time. Marlon Brando commands attention every moment he is on screen but its Glen Ford whose performance I most enjoy. I can't imagine any other actor doing full justice to the role of Capt. Fisbee after witnessing his performance. Yes it is larger than life but that's part of the style of the cinematic period. What counts is his delivery his body language and the seamless alternation between bungling weakling and sensitive intelligent humanitarian.Brando himself is believable in his very demanding role. He doesn't pull it off perfectly. There are fine cracks in one or two places but I think the job he did remains a credit to him. Few actors other than Okinowan ones could have done as much I suspect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Okinawans and for that matter the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain have seen it all before as Sakino remarks to Captain Fisby when he arrives at his assigned village to give them the conquering hero speech. Actually author John Patrick of The Teahouse of the August Moon knew what he was talking about. Over their history these people due to geography have been taken over time and again by the Chinese and Japanese going back and forth. Maybe American skin color was paler and the eyes didn't slant but to the Okinawans it's just another occupier.That particular island cost plenty in the last great battle of the Pacific in World War II. The Japanese at this point considered the Ryukyus their homeland and fought dear for it. In part it led to the decision to use those atomic bombs to bring the war to a conclusion.The Teahouse of the August Moon was one of the biggest successes of the Broadway theater in the Fifties. It ran for 1053 performances from 1953 and 1955. It received the Tony Award for Best Play Best Actor for David Wayne as Sakino Best Writer for author John Patrick and a Pulitzer Prize for drama. Leads David Wayne and John Forsythe were dropped from the film version as MGM wanted film names and they signed Marlon Brando as Sakino and Glenn Ford as Captain Fisby. Both performed ably in their roles and rumor has it didn't get along. From Brando's point of view that might have been partly due to Louis Calhern's death on the set. Calhern and Brando apparently became close on the set and when Calhern died it unnerved Brando. It did allow the Paul Ford who had originated the role of Colonel Purdy on Broadway to repeat it for the screen and for the sake of the film I can't see how Calhern would have been better.To say that the occupation of Japan went a whole lot better than what's going on now in Iraq is an understatement. Of course it helped no end to have the Emperor telling his people not to resist. It also helped to have Douglas MacArthur in charge who spent his formative years in the Far East and knew the Orient well.Not everyone under MacArthur's command had his sensibilities and Paul Ford was one of those officers. He had a manual which as he so eloquently put it saves you the trouble of thinking. The problem Ford has is when Glenn Ford is assigned to his command. He's an officer who's had a problem adjusting to the army because he does think too much. But in occupation duty it serves him well as it turns out.Ford with Okinawan interpreter Marlon Brando is assigned to a small village where he throws away the plan because the villagers very democratically decide they have their own ideas. One of them is to build a teahouse for the geishas.It would take a lot of time and words to describe the importance in their culture of the teahouse. It's not merely a bordello and the geishas have a function that's not just sexual. Suffice it to say that Ford recognizes this and instead of a schoolhouse as per the manual allows the Okinawans to build a teahouse.Marlon Brando's role functions in the play and also as a Greek chorus narrator. He did a good job but in these days of political correctness his performance is now damned by political correctness. And irony of ironies he lived long enough to see it.Where does respect for tradition start and end? The British trampled on a lot of Indian traditions in their occupation. They also helped do away with a lot of barbarous practices like the strangling cults of thugee and that lovely custom of suttee where the widow is supposed to allow herself to be cremated live beside her dead husband. I'd say that was one positive result of their occupation. Certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan there are things in fundamentalist Moslem culture that are an abomination. But how to change it. Not apparently as we're going.The Teahouse of the August Moon is both entertaining and thought provoking and might have a timely message for today.".

Suffice it to say that Ford recognizes this and instead of a schoolhouse as per the manual allows the Okinawans to build a teahouse.Marlon Brando's role functions in the play and also as a Greek chorus narrator. He did a good job but in these days of political correctness his performance is now damned by political correctness. And irony of ironies he lived long enough to see it.Where does respect for tradition start and end? The British trampled on a lot of Indian traditions in their occupation. They also helped do away with a lot of barbarous practices like the strangling cults of thugee and that lovely custom of suttee where the widow is supposed to allow herself to be cremated live beside her dead husband. I'd say that was one positive result of their occupation. Certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan there are things in fundamentalist Moslem culture that are an abomination. But how to change it. Not apparently as we're going.The Teahouse of the August Moon is both entertaining and thought provoking and might have a timely message for today.";

Fisby is showered with gifts from the villagers. Amongst the gifts is a geisha girl Machiko Kyo. In pronouncing render Japanese names as sharply and gutterally as possible. Thus Marchycore with the word snapped off extra fast.NOTES The stage play opened on Broadway at the Martin Beck on 15 October 1953 and ran a colossal 1027 performances making it one of the fifty most successful plays ever produced on Broadway. A long way from Fiddler On the Roof's 3242 performances or Life With Father's 3224 but a highly commendable achievement nonetheless. Adding spice to the success the play was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The judges were particularly finicky that year too making no award at all for Fiction though Charles Lindbergh took the Biography prize for his Spirit of St Louis. The play also won the New York Drama Critics' Award for Best Play of the Year. It was inevitable that it should spawn a film version a musical  Lovely Ladies Kind Gentlemen 1970  and even a surprisingly shortlived Broadway revival of a miserable 14 performances in November 1956 starring Gig Young.With a domestic film rentals gross of 5.7 million Teahouse came in 6th at the U.S.Canadian boxoffice for 1957. The movie achieved exactly the same position in Australia but in the U.K. failed to make the top ten list of moneyspinners.COMMENT A riot on the stage but something less on the screen. The players try too hard particularly Paul Ford here recapping his stage role. Louis Calhern was originally cast but suffered a fatal heart attack whilst on location in Japan. Although Marlon Brando was a popular choice for Sakini I would have preferred Broadway's David Wayne. Still Brando's portrait viewed in 2016 doesn't seem quite as outrageous or ridiculous as it did 60 years ago.Robert Lewis directed the Broadway show. For the movie we're stuck with the considerably less talented Daniel Mann. Not only is his handling overemphatic he seems totally unable to judge when a jest is exhausted. A joke or comic situation mild to begin with is often elasticized way past boredom point. And though his training ground was the stage Mann makes surprisingly little use of the width available to him on the CinemaScope screen. If this is an example of his method of staging with all the action crowded into the center we wonder why he didn't face an actors' revolution. Stage players are very fussy about blocking. A director is continually forced to find all sorts of reasons excuses and pretexts to string his actors out from one end of the stage to the other so that the audience has a good view of each performer.But stay with it folks. Despite the initial lack of promise things do improve when Eddie Albert of all people comes on. Often a rather dull yet too earnest actor Albert gives here a wonderfully relaxed thoroughly professional performance that even overwhelms the dead hand of Mann's tepid direction. Albert's enthusiasm even infects some of the other players. Paul Ford is occasionally amusing despite all the exaggerated bluster and Henry Harry Morgan briefly shines. Miss Kyo however remains stubbornly giggly if attractively decorative but little else. As for Glenn Ford in the John Forsythe role well Glenn Ford in comedy mode is Glenn Ford in comedy mode period. Although John Patrick himself penned the screenplay on film Teahouse seems much less pointed much less amusing than on stage or in print. Even Alton's grainy CinemaScope photography falls disappointingly short of his usual standards.SUMMING UP The opening twenty minutes or so of Teahouse of the August Moon promise great things. An American Army officer Glenn Ford is sent to establish the recovery and welfare of an Okinawan village with a rascally Japanese interpreter Marlon Brando as an assistant. Alas great things do not happen. Brando is woefully miscast.".

You looked like you were having fun and for once I could understand exactly what you were saying as you were not mumbling. I would love to hear the story behind your casting as a Japanese villager.The film is a farcical and feel good social satire about American attempts to spread their values and way of life in the village of Tobiki Okinawa after World War 2. Glenn Ford is the good hearted solider who is trying to impart the merits of democracy to the unsuspecting villagers with the help of Sakini. But things do not go according to plan and Ford's character ends up falling in love with the village and even helps them set up a brewery. A lighthearted study of American follies ..... I mean foreign policy and attitudes towards the natives the film has some great one liners and some of the scenes are truly hilarious. It is worth the price of admission for your comedic role as a Japanese villager Marlon. Paul Ford turns in a great performance as the hawkish Col. Wainwright Purdy III.Best Regards Pimpin.610".

In fact he was a Guatemalan immigrant who came to the United States illegally at the tender age of 14. His tragic tale is retold in this brutally frank German documentary which traces his journey from his poverty stricken birthplace to a new land where his status as a rootless working class male of a certain age made him easy pickings for military recruiters. If war truly is a force that gives us meaning Exhibit A could be Jose Antonio Gutierrez whose troubled life ended in an illegal war fought on behalf of a nation that constantly demonises immigrants whilst relying on them for cheap labour and cannon fodder.

It has enough cool sounding guitar and organ notes to set it apart from the boring music found in most American westerns. The cheesy dubbing is also here in full force. The movie made me chuckle a few times which is always a plus whether the humor is intentional or not.This is a standard good guys vs. bad guys story with a lone rangerlike lead character named Jim Hart played adequately by Cameron Mitchell. Hart's friend the man called Guitar is actually more like the typical spaghetti western protagonist. Neither good nor bad Guitar is simply out for his own good time. Kitty Carver is stunning as Dolores the feisty barmaid who becomes Guitar's girlfriend. She has that incredible exotic beauty that so many female spaghetti western characters possess. Livio Lorenzon is entertaining as Jess the cheesy over the top villain who keeps laughing through the whole movie even while he is dying in the finale! It is possible that this film may have been trying to be an American western but thankfully it did not succeed. It's much more entertaining just the way it is. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but if you're a diehard spaghetti western fan who doesn't take things too seriously this one's worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen a lot of westerns but I've seen few like this one. At first I thought it was a comedy or a parody. It starts off with what has to be the most mindnumbingly awful theme song in motion picture history by an offkey singer who stumbles over his words actually loses his place oncewhy they didn't just rerecord it is beyond meand not a single line of this opus rhymes. Then a short chubby beerbellied gunslinger standing on top of a large boulder calls out some guy walking his horse ! gets shot for his trouble slides down the boulder and in the next shot his body is lying at least 25 feet from itand it's on flat land! Then although I didn't think it was possible the film goes downhill from there. Everybody laughs hysterically all through the movie the bad guys the saloon girls and especially the leader of the bad guys who has apparently ingested a year's supply of laughing gas because he can't stop roaring with laughter even as he's shooting everybody within eyesightcivilians cowboys he meets on the trail women he's just raped his own men . . . you name 'em this guy shoots 'em. And of course he does so without reloading his pistol at one point he fires at least 12 rounds in a row from a sixshot revolver. What's even more hysterical is that he's wearing a hat that is at least two sizes too small for him. It was only after about 15 minutes of watching this atrocity that it finally sunk in that this was NOT a parody or a comedy. The people who made this stinkeroo actually thought they were making a serious western. Amazing.Another curious thing about this movie is the dubbing. We all know that the English dubbing of Italian movies of the time whether westerns or Herculestype epics was atrocious beyond belief and this one carries on that noble tradition. But even star Cameron Mitchell's voice is dubbed and not by Mitchell which is very odd. What's even odder is that Mitchell is obviously speaking English but the English lines the dubber speaks don't match Mitchell's lip movements which makes no sense at all. But neither does anything else in this relentlessly stupid senseless idiocy wait until you get a load of the masked avenger who shows up about a quarter of the way through this thing. The action scenes are laughable the cinematography is terribleit looks like it was shot on an 8mm home movie camerathe script is something even Ed Wood would have been too embarrassed to put his name on the acting wouldn't pass muster in a onedaywonder porn flick. In other words this movie is not only worthless it's BEYOND worthless. Shoving your head into a drill press wouldn't be as painful as having to sit through this thing. Don't waste your time.".

	schema:headline " Okay PreSpaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Nothing about Stranger in Sacramento director Sergio Bergonzelli's largely predictable horse opera The Last Gun qualifies as original but this derivative Spaghetti western is more than palatable with solid production values. Cameron Mitchell who appeared in his share of westerns in Tinseltown stars as a notorious gunslinger who hangs up his hardware so he can settle down as a respectable storekeeper in a frontier town. Meanwhile a triggerhappy outlaw Jess the ubiquitous Livio Lorenzon who looks like the Europe's answer to Telly Savalas plots with a corrupt local banker to hijack a shipment of gold. Not surprisingly things don't go as planned for Jess and his army of gunfighters. It seems that a mysterious pistolero turns up when they least expect him and thwarts our villain's every move. The Last Gun is an appropriately loquacious sagebrusher when one of the villains isn't being gunned down by an enigmatic figure in black leather with a bandanna covering his face. The townspeople quarrel among themselves about these intruders but they are powerless to evict them. Clearly The Last Gun draws inspiration from those traditional Hollywood oaters where an unsympathetic gunslinger struggles to blend into the scenery and not call attention to himself. Eventually our reluctant hero must decide whether to maintain his anonymity or behave like a vigilante to preserve law and order. This movie pays homage to 1950's westerns with its opening ballad. Actually The Last Gun recalls John Wayne's first singing western Riders of Destiny 1933because one of the key characters rides through the rugged terrain warbling a tune to the accompaniment of his own guitar strumming. After the opening theme ballad things settle down as Jess's gang terrorizes the town of Sanderson. Moreover The Last Gun hero is a reformed gunman instead of a swiftshooting bounty hunter. Bergonzelli and scenarists Ambrogio Molteni and James Wilde Jr. unveil the film's the bestkept secret during the final moments of the action. Livio Lorenzon makes a thoroughly slimy villain. His men and he run roughshod over everybody in town and the dutiful sheriff has to tolerate their presence because he is only one man.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that Cameron Mitchell is in this movie should give you a warning as to what is to come. If not let me put it bluntly  this is a TERRIBLE western! Though made in the same year as A Fistful Of Dollars this probably came first  if the makers of this movie had seen that movie they probably would have given their plans a major overhaul.

Meadows is not much of a thief. Indeed in his late teens he is not much of a man at all. His great crime was to try to steal forty dollars from the admiral's wife's pet charity. For this he's been sentenced to eight years behind bars. At first Buddusky and Mulhall view the journey as a paid vacation but their holiday spirits are quickly depressed by the prisoner who looks prepared to break into tears at any moment. And he has the lowest selfimage imaginable. Buddusky gets it into his head to give Meadows a good time and teach him a bit about getting on in the world. Lesson one Don't take every card life deals you. Next he teaches Meadows to drink and as a coup de grace finds a nice young whore to instruct him in lovemaking. Mule who worries aloud about his own position with military authority seems pleased ...";

It's a nice image but the real version is much more human much more interesting and much more likable.I was a naval officer for seven years. The best part of my service was the wonderful opportunity to get to know the many men and women who make up the enlisted ranks of our armed services. They tend to be from the rural towns of the south and Midwest or the inner city ghettos. Most of them were average students with limited financial prospects. The ones who succeed in the ranks enough to stay for 20 years do so because the Navy is the first place where they belong. And because they enjoy the job. They get good at it and they believe that what they are doing is much more rewarding and challenging than their friends back home.They also love to party. To drink and to chase skirts and raise hell. They feel entitled to and they are almost always out for a good time without hurting anyone. They also love to mentor the younger sailors to show them how to survive and how to enjoy the time in.The details of this movie are wonderful. The dreary time in transit ironing uniforms and staring at the walls. Wanting to be at sea something that few people can imagine until they've done it. The thrill of a few days per diem to blow in bars. The resignation of being a lifer and above all the nature of Navy friendships.Jack Nicholson's character and Otis Young's are not natural friends. They probably wouldn't have time for one another in any other line of work but having the shared experience of being First Class Petty Officers at the same base is enough for them to be comfortable with one another and to enjoy each other's company. They also both take to the young kid and they both know how to treat him because they've been doing it for so long.I can't tell you how real these characters were to me. I can's say Oh Jack reminds me of GSM1 Soandso and Otis reminds me of QM1 Whatshisname. IT's too real for that. They both remind me of many many people I had the good fortune to work with.And they are flawed. They lack the guts to spare Randy Quad from this injustice. They don't even stick together on the way back to Norfolk probably because they know they did something less than wonderful to the young man. They are indoctrinated but not inhuman.I also enjoyed seeing shades of Jack's work in One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest. Badass is kind of a rough draft of his McMuphy. This is Jack at his finest.Randy Quaid's performance made me feel a little bit sad. Not just for the character but for the actor. He had so much talent back then and somehow he got pigeon holed playing big dopes. He certainly has as much talent as his younger brother but not the leading man looks. I don't think I'll ever see him in the Vaction movies without cringing. He should have become so much more. Of course his other work is entertaining but it's never touching or through provoking as it is here. And Otis Young was terrific too. I'm not sure why he never got more good roles but this is something to be proud of.In short this is the most realistic navy movie I've ever seen. If you're thinking about enlisting or if a loved one is this is not a bad way to see what the navy does to a mangood and bad. And it's funny that they do this without ever setting foot on a vessel.I want to find the poster and hang it on my walls next to my commission.".

	schema:reviewBody "My absolutely favorite Jack Nicholson film has always and forever will be The Last Detail. I don't think he was ever better on the screen as William Baddusky of the United States Navy. I enjoyed his performance and the film itself on so many levels. Probably not surprising since the script was done by Robert Towne who would soon be teaming with Nicholson again for the critical and popular success Chinatown.It's a simple story not really any plot to the film. Two sailors Jack Nicholson and Otis Young both of them lifers in the Navy are stationed in Norfolk and get themselves an assignment to escort a prisoner to the Naval Stockade at Portsmouth. Of course with the per diem allowance for the two men and the prisoner and five days to travel in Nicholson and Young are thinking of a minispree at government expense. It comes to that and a lot more. the prisoner is newcomer Randy Quaid whose big crime is that he attempted to steal 40.00 from a charity collection box. For that he's getting eight years in military prison and a dishonorable discharge. A dishonorable discharge even today is not a good thing for one's resume. As Nicholson and Young both remark someone really stuck it to him. Let's face it what Quaid did in civilian life would probably be considered petty larceny and his jail time might be measured in days. Turned out it was the base commander's wife's favorite charity so it got stuck to him good. Sad because the indications we get is that Quaid was a troubled kid in civilian life and probably military service offered him a chance to straighten up and fly right.It's done that for many others including Nicholson and Young who make it very clear even on this disagreeable detail they do like the Navy and like serving in it. They've got five days to deliver Quaid to Portsmouth so the journey becomes quite the odyssey for the three of them up the Atlantic coast. The three men have a great chemistry between them you get involved with their lives and really feel for young Quaid and his plight. Quaid gets shown a good time and maybe that's not such a good thing considering what he is facing.The Last Detail is a nice realistic look at the military both its flaws and good points. A lot of similarity here in the issues raised to From Here to Eternity and if I mention The Last Detail in the same sentence favorably as From Here to Eternity you know how good it must be.".

It even grows on the viewer if seen multiple times where what seems to be dragging on is loaded with nuance. There's a level of existentialism to it how free are Buddusky and Mulhall or their choices? Probably not much at all at least not any more or less than the doomed Meadows. But this is not the only method of Ashby on the material there are also superlative performances from Jack Nicholson Otis Young and a newcomer at the time Randy Quaid. Nicholson and Young play Buddusky Badass and Mulhouse Mule who are assigned chickens detail to transport petty thief Quaid sent up for eight years in a naval brig. On the way up the Eastern seaboard the three stop in Washington New York and Boston and the two try to show the youngster a good time before imprisonment. Probably one of the most underlooked pictures of the 1970's though one of the more noteworthy especially for it's attitude delivered tenfold by Nicholson's Cannes winning Buddusky and Towne script. A scene in a bar in Washington and a scene at a Nichiren Shosu meeting steal the lot though there's plenty to look for. It's one of my favorite tragiccomic sleepers and one of Ashby's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read somebody's comment that this film isn't deep.  I think that viewer missed a whole layer of the story.  you have to keep in mind that this was written and produced during the vietnam war and released during the early months of Watergate.The story is about these two working class sailors who are completely disenfranchised just doing their job.  They're good guys but in the end don't lift a finger to stop a massive injustice. They don't even take the time to think about it because they feel there's nothing they can do about it.  They pay lip services to how wrong things are about the situation but in the end they do what the man says and they're just as much to blame for the problem as the commanding officers above them.Through the course of the film the sailors meet a lot of chatting class folks who are mad at Nixon and discussing politics and they meet Hari Krishnas who are chanting to change things but nobody is really taking any ACTION.  Everyone is pissed off at the injustice of the world but nobody does anything about it.  It's about inaction.  And that inaction slowly boils up in the main characters and turns into anger that brings the film to a sad end.  It's one of those great stories that gets you pissed off at the injustice in the world...Having said all that on a more tangible level the performances and scripting are full of emotion and Nicholson's and Quaid's performance are amazing and hilarious to watch.  But this isn't really a comedy in the end...more tragic really with some good laughs along the way.Check it out!".

They pay lip services to how wrong things are about the situation but in the end they do what the man says and they're just as much to blame for the problem as the commanding officers above them.Through the course of the film the sailors meet a lot of chatting class folks who are mad at Nixon and discussing politics and they meet Hari Krishnas who are chanting to change things but nobody is really taking any ACTION.  Everyone is pissed off at the injustice of the world but nobody does anything about it.  It's about inaction.  And that inaction slowly boils up in the main characters and turns into anger that brings the film to a sad end.  It's one of those great stories that gets you pissed off at the injustice in the world...Having said all that on a more tangible level the performances and scripting are full of emotion and Nicholson's and Quaid's performance are amazing and hilarious to watch.  But this isn't really a comedy in the end...more tragic really with some good laughs along the way.Check it out!";

If you can't take the heat get the hell out of the galley.Gritty cinematography of the earthy lowrent world of enlisted sailors for example watching the decent peoples' world pass by the filthstreaked windows of a worn smelly railway car communicates much of the characters' experience of life in the margins and their ethos and how they came by them.

But without Otis Young as his fellow seasoned petty officer and Randy Quaid as the naive young brigbound seaman Nicholson's tour de force would have fallen as flat as a flathat for all you landlubbers the navy blue Donald Duck US NAVYribbon bound winter sailors' hats which sailors hated intensely that were abolished in the early 60's.Politically correct leftleaning folks should discover in Gunners Mate 1st Class Mule Mulhall a perfect example of an African American professional sailor serious yet funloving jocular but nononsense competent and quietly selfassured in short a sailor among sailors a man among men. I know because I served and when the chips were up or down no sailor cared about color and each of us cared only that he or she could rely or not on our shipmates. Though it has its arcane rules written and unwritten the naval service is remarkably egalitarian in opportunity  and it is so without all the hue and cry of civilian social consciousness.Though it's a marvel of a film 'The Last Detail' could not cram into its running time all the humor and pathos of the eponymous toughtender Ponicsan novel in which petty officer Mulhall's character looms quite a bit larger than he does in the movie and Billy Buddusky's reflexive resorting to signalling with his Signalman's semaphoring hands spells out apt clues to his worldview and the novel which incidentally I read while on active duty before the film had been made turns out with a dramatically different ending  with a true denouement absent from the screenplay's conclusion that left me wanting and which is the film's only grave if quibbling flaw. But the screenplay incorporates characters scenes Carol Kane as the careworn young whore providing Quaid's Seaman Meadows his first experience of coupling and dialogue that might also have helped the novel to better flesh out and plumb the characters and their experience. Small matter really the book and the film contrast and complement each other perfectly.Anyone considering enlistment should see 'The Last Detail' because it tells enlisted sailors' life like it is. If you can take life like it is with or without the occasional fix 'An Officer and a Gentleman' anyone? of kitschy unrealizable romantic fantasy then 'The Last Detail' is your meat.The Real Deal.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when it was released and just watched it again in its entirety for the first time since. This means that I'm completely discounting the horribly butchered version I saw on Bravo for shame! a year or so ago. They didn't just bleep out the expletives as you would expect whole scenes were cut leaving the work so diluted I almost forgot why I had loved it. It was like Jaws without teeth!Revisiting books films or any work of art first experienced in youth can be very interesting and I found that watching The Last Detail through my now  unspecified! yearold eyes was one of the many times something turned out to be even better the second time around. I guess that makes it a classic. For those that don't know this is the story of two career enlisted Navy men who are assigned the dreary detail of delivering a young seaman to prison in Portsmouth NH where he will serve an eight year sentence for attempting to swipe 40 from their commanding officer's wife's favorite charity box. It's obvious that poor Meadows played by Randy Quaid has been thrown to the dogs for his offense receiving a dishonorable discharge from the service in addition to the excessive prison term but this is the Navy and our boys must do as ordered. It's a sht detail but it will take them out of their insulated and listless existence on base in transition  that is waiting for assignment to sea duty  and they quickly formulate a plan to relieve themselves of their charge as fast as possible and spend the bulk of the allotted time and money remaining to party the way good sailors do namely drinking and whoring. Enter young Meadows and the master plan takes on a life of its own as the seemingly hardened Bad Ass Buddusky Jack Nicholson and Mule Mulhall Otis Young find themselves caught up in Navalinfused fraternity with the childlike Meadows. Resigned to his fate the hapless swabbie's frustrating passivity is fuel to Baddusky's pugnacious nature and Mulhall and Meadows are swept along with Chief Signalman Bad Ass on a journey of discovery. From teaching him how to get his hamburger served the way he likes it with the cheese MELTED thank you very much to facilitating the loss of his virginity Carol Kane is perfect as the young prostitute this is really a buddy movie at its finest. In the final frames we watch the two lifers stroll out of the shot in lockstep Anchors Aweigh piping as they're off to reestablish themselves as individuals for a brief moment before returning to the shelter of their sacred family that is the US Navy.There's nothing sappy about this film don't get me wrong. There's a definite hard edge to it and life as a Naval enlisted man is not romanticized in any way. Visually it's quite somber from our side of the screen and the military music in the score is to music as the military justice in the story is to justice. There are some fabulously funny moments and of course Nicholson kills in this part that no one could have played better. Otis Young is really good as the cooler head who doesn't want to get himself jammed up in any way but who is none the less down with showing Meadows a good time. It's Randy Quaid though who impressed me most on this viewing. He played the ingenuous candy barfilching boy just right and I'm afraid in retrospect that he got typecast as the big goofy dumb guy as a result of his work in this picture.I loved everything about this movie wouldn't change a thing.Oh and just for the heck of it... here's a little movieNavy trivia tidbit I found online when I looked up Portsmouth Naval Prison. I have no idea whether there's any truth to it or not but when I came across it three different times I decided to add it here. This is from Humphrey Bogart To Have and Have Not by Daniel Bubbeo....Bogart's long time friend author Nathaniel Benchley claims it is true that Bogart was injured while on assignment to take a naval prisoner to Portsmouth Naval Prison in New Hampshire. Supposedly while changing trains in Boston the handcuffed prisoner asked Bogart for a cigarette and while Bogart looked for a match the prisoner raised his hands smashed Bogart across the mouth with his cuffs cutting Bogart's lip and fled. Bogart used his .45 to drop the prisoner who was eventually taken to Portsmouth. By the time Bogie was treated by a doctor the scar that caused him to lisp had already formed.Wow huh? SO much better than say getting hit in the mouth with a tennis racket or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Detail by Hal Ashby is much like John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy in that they are both road trip movies as well as buddy movies. They are about friendships that forged in extreme circumstances and the effect that these experiences have on each character's lives.In the last detail an unfortunate seaman by the name of Meadows Randy Quaid is condemned to jail for eight years for a misdemeanor crime he was unable to even complete. Being caught with his hand in the cookie jar after a mere forty dollars he is consequently transported from a naval base in the south to the naval prison in Portsmouth Maine. The last detail of a few veteran naval officers namely Billy Bad Ass Buddusky Jack Nicholson and Mule Mulhall Otis Young is to transport this eighteen year old soon to be prisoner up the east coast.The three gentlemen have never met before and all seem to have different interests. Billy and Mule are after some welcomed time off from the suffocating life on the naval base while Meadows is drowning in his own depression. Billy is more of a lenient presence while Mule seems to want to do his duty first and then relax. Soon the men form a bond. This bond and their relationship is what carry the movie. Meadows is an innocent and modest teenager who found his way into the navy because of a shop lifting problem. However after hearing his story and spending time with the boy the two officers realize the ludicrous charges that have been brought against such an undeserving soldier.They take pity on him and decide to make his last days of freedom ones in which he will cross every right of passage yet to be undiscovered and make them days that he will never forget. As they gradually open up to each other they grant the prisoner a certain degree of freedom beginning with the removal of the cuffs in the beginning of the movie. They get him drunk in Washington D.C. involve him in his first fist fight in New York City and help him lose his virginity in Boston. Beyond these rights of passage the officers also relate to the emotional side of Meadows. They allow him to visit his mother. What the two officers did not realize is that the journey they would take would be reciprocal. They all end up taking their guard down.One of the more poignant lines in the film is when Meadows refers to the officers as his beast friends. Although he has only known them for less than a week the sad fact is that these men are probably the closest friends that he has ever had. Mule and Billy have had much more life experience and are well versed in the details and idiosyncrasies that life involves. They connect with meadows because before this trip he had been yet untouched by the worse side of life. His general doe eyed demeanor drives home the fact that he really does not deserve the treatment that he's receiving. Upon leaving the prison I don't believe that Mule and Billy are so much angry with the way the ascending officer treated them as they are with the situation that Meadows is now faced with. We could have prevented this.".

In this film he overwhelms at every turn. In the bar scene he shows brute anger and a desire for dominance. The scenes with a young Nancy Allen are delightfully witty because of Nicholson's schoolboy antics of getting a woman into bed.It is the scenes with Randy Quaid also wonderful where Nicholson shines brightest. Bad Ass represents a paternal figure lacking in Meadows' life. He makes him a man by demanding he send back a hamburger if it's not cooked the way he likes it. He demands Meadows to stop crying and be a man. He demands Meadows to stand up for himself and fight when someone pushes his buttons. He demands Meadows to want to have sex like other men his age. Nicholson's father figure image here is played off perfectly as Meadows sort of imitates things Bad Ass does. If Bad Ass has a beer Meadows has a beer. If Bad Ass wants a woman Meadows wants a woman. There's a secret trust between the two. It's unspoken but it's there. That trust is broken in the end when Meadows tries to escape. It wasn't all a lie Meadows just felt that it was time to stop learning and start moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who portrays Jack Nicholson being an actor playing a role. That's not meant to be disparaging at all. I mean that Jack imbues almost every character I've seen him play  from The Shooting 1967 through to The Departed 2007  with the same zest and zing. The man is simply tireless and timeless almost and a joy to watch always.I missed this film when it was first released. And I kept missing it every time I saw it advertised at a local classic cinema or on late night TV. Finally I got one of my sons to send me a copy he had.As stories go it's not that engaging being simply about the transportation of a young prisoner to a military prison. What carries this story however are the characters the quality of acting of the 'three amigos' shall I say and the script by Robert Towne. The production is good the editing a bit choppy I'd say but the direction from Hal Ashby is always sure. The filming was done on location and by the looks of it with very few frills  and considering the nature of the journey very few thrills of the type viewers today expect to see. But that doesn't matter.I first saw Randy Quaid in The Last Picture Show 1971 and had been impressed by his ability even then. In this film he does an even better job as Larry Meadows the quintessential homespun goodnatured rural hick who knows very little about the world beyond hamburgers milkshakes apple pie and Mom. So when he begins his journey to prison escorted by two roughasrails naval ratings Bad Ass Budusky Nicholson and Mule Mulhall Otis Young  both detailed for the job against their wishes of course  he's given a chance to experience some of life's pleasures before being incarcerated.So it's an ordinary story but enlivened by the antics of the two older men particularly Buddusky who think nothing of having some fun beating up some Army personnel in the john at a railway station  with the help of Larry and Mule of course. Together they drink lots of booze. They visit a Hari Krishna type sect to witness and listen to the chanting. They drink more booze. They try to get a drink at a bar where Bad Ass threatens to shoot the bartender who refuses to serve them. They buy more cans and get another hotel room at the next whistle stop. They take Larry to a whore where he finally does it. They have a picnic in the freezing rain. Then they finally get Larry to the prison and hand him over to the grunts as Bad Ass calls the Marines. He hates grunts with a passion.Why do the two oldtimers do all this for the young guy? Why didn't they just get the job done and get back to base ASAP? Could've done it in two days but they take five? They do it because the young fella has been shafted royally he's going down for 8 years for stealing or trying to steal actually forty dollars. Forty lousy bucks! They can't believe it. But that's the Navy. That's the system they're dealing with day in day out. They can't change it but they can sure as hell help to bring some change into Larry's life before he's ruined  or worse killed  by prison life.Call it guilt call it anger call it frustration  but they both had to do something to make Larry feel better and more importantly to make themselves feel better about having to take him to his premature doom so to speak which is ably illustrated by an icily cold reception from the Marine O.D. Michael Moriarty at the prison. Moriarty always does bad guys so well especially when they all realize the irony of the overlooked last detail of their mission...So the final scene of Bad Ass and Mule leaving the prison and walking away is exquisite  their anger and frustration now redhot hunkering down against the frigid wind their images fade as they round a corner almost running they're walking so quickly not looking back but the memory lingers on...Recommended for all except young children.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had once heard that the Navy supported the making of the film until they saw the final cut. They quickly distanced themselves. Like my title says..it was a little too realistic for comfort. But my question is Why Is That A Bad Thing? I served as both an enlisted man and as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army. I was enlisted in the late 70's. The Army was a mess then. Still I met some of the best and ...yes..some of the worst people I have ever know there. They drank. They catted around. And my God could they swear!!! They joined for a wide variety of reasons. But the common thread of the career men I knew was that they had an important job and they were good at it. I had to guard two prisoners for their last night before being picked up by the MP escorts to go to Fort Leavenworth Kansas. One was a little punk who I dearly would have loved to shoot. The other WAS THE U.S. ARMY VERSION OF LARRY MEADOWS! I felt like total st but still I did my job and he was safely turned over to his escorts the next morning In the 80's I was introduced to the world of the commissioned officer. I saw a wide variety of personalities. The one I came to loath driven undoubtedly by my prior enlisted service was the bully. The guy who enjoyed pushing his authority on his subordinates because he could. Michael Moriarity played him to a T. All he had was the rank and the ability to hassle the two enlisted man. What he didn't have was the sense to pull a few copies. And like a bully folded when someone stood up to him and threatened him with action from a greater authority.This brings me to my point. You don't have to be a Navy veteran to understand this film. Understand that this is a realistic portrayal of the very imperfect very rough VERY HUMAN people who swear the oath and don the uniform and have offered to die to preserve the average American's right to bitch about Reality TV and the price of cold cuts at the market. I love the fact that the youngsters in the service today are finally getting the respect they deserve. I sincerely mean that. But please don't put them on too high a pedestal because the reality will never match the ideal. Just be grateful that these imperfect beings have decided to do what they do. Like Kipling said in his tribute to British soldiers Tommy...We aren't no thin red 'eros nor we aren't no blackguards too But single men in barracks most remarkable like you An' if sometimes our conduck isn't all your fancy paints Why single men in barracks don't grow into plaster saints. So see this film. As others have said see the uncut version for the flavor. See this film and understand that it's virtue is the raw unvarnished unpretty world of the armed forces. And then hit your knees and thank your personal God that there are people willing to live like that so that you can sleep in freedom.".

	schema:headline " Naval Lifers are bad for recruitment images";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Detail 1973 Hal Ashby depicts a side of the US Navy that the Navy didn't want the public to focus on. The country at the time was in an uproar over the Vietnam Conflict. These were the days of The Weatherman The Weather Underground Organization and the SDS. The country was divided severely over the US involvement in Vietnam and the military was falling out of the public favor. The movie carefully skirts talking about the conflict by setting the action on the Eastern Seaboard from Norfolk VA to Portsmouth NH and having the main characters be Navy Shore Patrol. As the odd pair played by Jack Nicholson and Otis Young get their unusual assignment and venture north with their captive an odd side of Navy life emerges the career lifer. The plot of The Last Detail is a little farfetched. Billy Buddusky Nicholson and Mulhall Young are ordered to escort Larry Meadows Randy Quaid from Norfolk VA to the Naval prison in Portsmouth NH which closed the year after the film was released. Meadows is sentenced for 8 years in the brig for attempting to steal 40 from a polio donations box. The Old Man's Wife was big into the polio cause and had her husband put the screws on Meadows thus the harshness of his sentencing. Yet this is really commentary on the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Nowhere else in the US would someone be sentenced for 8 years for attempting to steal not actually even stealing 40. They might be morally shunned and given some jail time but certainly not time in prison. This sentencing shows the corruption if you will of the justice system in the military. Moral judgment was wrought upon Meadows because he had deeply offended The Old Man's Wife. Along the journey from VA to NH Buddusky and Mulhall try to show Meadows who is presumably under 18 a good time by fulfilling all of the masculine desires such as drinking smoking marijuana sexual involvement with a prostitute fighting with Marines etc.During this adventurous trip the characters of all the sailors emerge and we see what being a lifer in the Navy is like. The only thing these two guys can do is their job in the Navy they've nowhere else to go. We discover that Buddusky's nickname is Bad Ass and he tries to live up to that image in a very conscious way. I am a badass! he exclaims more than once. He provokes a bartender after Meadows is refused a beer pulling and aiming his unloaded gun at the barkeep. He suggests getting drunk getting laid getting high and getting into a fight with some Marines for no reason whatsoever. I have a flair for this sort of thing. There has always been brotherly tension between the Marines and the Navy but Buddusky provokes a fight for no reason other than to show how manly he is and get Meadows into a brawl. Bad Ass Buddusky clearly depicts one type of naval lifer. He is hypermasculine and feels the need to assert this at every opportunity whether that means starting a fight in a train station bathroom or saying he doesn't give a damn about a kid going to prison for an unjust amount of time. Mulhall or Mule depicts another type of lifer. He is into doing his job thus the name Mule. He isn't bright but he can carry a task to its completion. He helps to balance Buddusky who'd probably not made it to NH in the allotted 5 days without him. He still likes to do masculine pastimes but he's more conscious of the task at hand.The Navy doesn't like to discuss lifers really. They're in the Navy because they had nowhere else to turn to. They need the fraternity the protection from social norms and conventions the steady check and the structure of military life and consequently the liberties that this also allows for. While the military was struggling to gather new recruits to fight in Vietnam there were these other guys goofing off on the Eastern Seaboard having the time of their life. This is not an image that helps to reinforce the sense of duty and commitment that the military tried to instill on new recruits.".

Moral judgment was wrought upon Meadows because he had deeply offended The Old Man's Wife. Along the journey from VA to NH Buddusky and Mulhall try to show Meadows who is presumably under 18 a good time by fulfilling all of the masculine desires such as drinking smoking marijuana sexual involvement with a prostitute fighting with Marines etc.During this adventurous trip the characters of all the sailors emerge and we see what being a lifer in the Navy is like. The only thing these two guys can do is their job in the Navy they've nowhere else to go. We discover that Buddusky's nickname is Bad Ass and he tries to live up to that image in a very conscious way. I am a badass! he exclaims more than once. He provokes a bartender after Meadows is refused a beer pulling and aiming his unloaded gun at the barkeep. He suggests getting drunk getting laid getting high and getting into a fight with some Marines for no reason whatsoever. I have a flair for this sort of thing. There has always been brotherly tension between the Marines and the Navy but Buddusky provokes a fight for no reason other than to show how manly he is and get Meadows into a brawl. Bad Ass Buddusky clearly depicts one type of naval lifer. He is hypermasculine and feels the need to assert this at every opportunity whether that means starting a fight in a train station bathroom or saying he doesn't give a damn about a kid going to prison for an unjust amount of time. Mulhall or Mule depicts another type of lifer. He is into doing his job thus the name Mule. He isn't bright but he can carry a task to its completion. He helps to balance Buddusky who'd probably not made it to NH in the allotted 5 days without him. He still likes to do masculine pastimes but he's more conscious of the task at hand.The Navy doesn't like to discuss lifers really. They're in the Navy because they had nowhere else to turn to. They need the fraternity the protection from social norms and conventions the steady check and the structure of military life and consequently the liberties that this also allows for. While the military was struggling to gather new recruits to fight in Vietnam there were these other guys goofing off on the Eastern Seaboard having the time of their life. This is not an image that helps to reinforce the sense of duty and commitment that the military tried to instill on new recruits.";

The Last Detail is what we mean when we talk about a 70s movie  a personal exploration of theme design boundary culture. King of Marvin Gardens Brewster McCloud Two Lane Blacktop Blue Collar. All that bleak humor all those subversive politics. So risky we think in hindsight. What a decade we'll never see those times again. Well don't fool yourself. Don't say you couldn't make these movies today. You could make them. The industry makes as many weird little art movies now as it ever did.

The Last Detail is a warning against the backward mindset necessary to a life of dull toil. I can't take this sht indefinitely says a sailor but he's talking about the party not the work anyway he's wrong. He's a lifer. And who among us can say that we are not? But in consoling ourselves that it could be worse we often forget that it also could be better. If it's any comfort not that many people went to see movies like this in the Nixon era either.

	schema:reviewBody "Hal Ashby  whoever remembers this name probably drown in the flood of directorial talents that survived the New Hollywood era like Scorsese Coppola Lucas or Spielberg.Yet like Friedkin Bogdanovich or Peckinpah Ashby is one of the most underrated and emblematic filmmakers of his era not quite underrated because his movies actually outlived by the remembrance of his name  Harold and Maude Being There Bound for Glory the fifth Best Picture nominee of 1976 and of course The Last Detail a gripping malebonding comedydrama that encapsulates the rebellious and fatalistic flavor of its time and served by one of Jack Nicholson's greatest performances as Navy First Class Signalman Bill 'Badass' Buddusky.The film's spirit it perfectly captured in its iconic poster Nicholson with a sailor hat a defying look and a charismatic pose holding his cigar as to exhilarate the perpetuate thrill of freespirited and skintattooed insubordination as a man who doesn't get obedience and submission mixed up his looks clearly express the fact that he doesn't take it from anybody. And the tagline Jesus H. Christ what a tagline! says it better than any summary No !! Navy's going to give some poor !! kid eight years in the ! brig without me taking him out for the time of his !! life needless to say that profanity is as ubiquitous as God in the Bible.The 'tagline' kid is Larry Meadows Randy Quaid as a young sailor who's going to serve 8 years in Portsmouth Naval Prison for having stolen money from a charity box belonging to the wife of a Superior officer we easily get that the sentence would've been lighter for another 'victim'. Buddusky and Otis Young as Mulhall aka 'Mule' are assigned to escort him. They have one week on their hands and a poor psychologically unstable and obviously kleptomaniac 18year old kid who never had any fun in his life and is nowhere near having it. So that's The Last Detail in a nutshell three men and a limited trajectory from Norfolk where the assignment was given to Portsmouth where the delivery would be done. Orders are limited in space and in time one week.One week before jail like Edward Norton's last day before jail in Spike Lee's 25th Hour and with a lesser sense of urgency this week might be Meadows's last opportunity to have his share of fun and to get the spirit 'in him'. Of course this spirit is carried by Nicholson in a tailormade role only followed by Meadows because he's handcuffed and Mule because he's 'in the same boat'. Badass is the joker Mule the straightman and Meadows in the middle doesn't know how to fit. Randy Quaid delivers a remarkable performance as a poor vulnerable kid victim of circumstances and a perfect counterpart to Badass' exuberance and flamboyant personality. No wonder that Badass would try to teach him how to get mad at things or get them the way he wants. Both actors would be Oscarnominated for their performances.That's what I love with these 70's films they reflected the atmosphere of their era with a raw authenticity and gritty realism without distracting the viewers from the many purpose of being entertained or let's just say spend a good time and learn one thing or two about a guy a woman or a bunch of people. I can't think of a more humanistic period moviewise than this 19671976 decade with The Last Detail as one of its highlights. You have three men who belong to the military side during probably the most antimilitary era ever they incarnate the very establishment they hate themselves yet they remain faithful to a sort of moral code. They have fun within their own group drink beer and bang whores but rules still exist. And while we're transported by the poignant sight of the young Meadows haplessly skating on the ice rink we know that sooner or later we'll be reminded of that goddamn assignment.But one can't deny the impact a biggerthanlife personality like Buddusky would have on a submissive character like Meadows while not being a character study a la Five Easy Pieces we expect from Meadows' youthful naivety that the film would depict a comingofage if only for the incredible bar scene that echoes Bobby Dupea's chicken salad moment when Buddusky asks for a beer to the underaged sailor. He protests not because it's unfair but because he thinks that a guy who had the hardest time of his life coming is adult enough to get some privileges. We accept this logic and feel for both Buddusky and Meadows. It's not in him says Mule referring to this spirit Buddusky tries to inculcate but the intelligence in the script is that whatever sickness stroke Meadows we feel that the cure would be much worse.The script written by Robert Towne who'd win an Oscar for Chinatown one year later reflects the paradoxical approach to rules and authority during the postVietnam era incarnated by the Navy trio each one being more complex than what he seems at first. The script is also one of the film's strengths in the way it feels absolutely real and genuine without any clich and allows each of the character to shine and to make us feel for them or for the kind of persons they were and the kind of cities they grew in like the North East to which the film delivers a sober but no less appealing painting. In fact this film made in 1973 makes me wonder in 2042 when people will ask about the 20002010's which movies I would recommend if I'm still alive.Now that cinema traded its dignity for money 3D special effects and unspecial stories where have gone all the true authors eager to express their view of life on the world? Where have all the 'Hal Ashby's gone goddammit?".

They have one week on their hands and a poor psychologically unstable and obviously kleptomaniac 18year old kid who never had any fun in his life and is nowhere near having it. So that's The Last Detail in a nutshell three men and a limited trajectory from Norfolk where the assignment was given to Portsmouth where the delivery would be done. Orders are limited in space and in time one week.One week before jail like Edward Norton's last day before jail in Spike Lee's 25th Hour and with a lesser sense of urgency this week might be Meadows's last opportunity to have his share of fun and to get the spirit 'in him'. Of course this spirit is carried by Nicholson in a tailormade role only followed by Meadows because he's handcuffed and Mule because he's 'in the same boat'. Badass is the joker Mule the straightman and Meadows in the middle doesn't know how to fit. Randy Quaid delivers a remarkable performance as a poor vulnerable kid victim of circumstances and a perfect counterpart to Badass' exuberance and flamboyant personality. No wonder that Badass would try to teach him how to get mad at things or get them the way he wants. Both actors would be Oscarnominated for their performances.That's what I love with these 70's films they reflected the atmosphere of their era with a raw authenticity and gritty realism without distracting the viewers from the many purpose of being entertained or let's just say spend a good time and learn one thing or two about a guy a woman or a bunch of people. I can't think of a more humanistic period moviewise than this 19671976 decade with The Last Detail as one of its highlights. You have three men who belong to the military side during probably the most antimilitary era ever they incarnate the very establishment they hate themselves yet they remain faithful to a sort of moral code. They have fun within their own group drink beer and bang whores but rules still exist. And while we're transported by the poignant sight of the young Meadows haplessly skating on the ice rink we know that sooner or later we'll be reminded of that goddamn assignment.But one can't deny the impact a biggerthanlife personality like Buddusky would have on a submissive character like Meadows while not being a character study a la Five Easy Pieces we expect from Meadows' youthful naivety that the film would depict a comingofage if only for the incredible bar scene that echoes Bobby Dupea's chicken salad moment when Buddusky asks for a beer to the underaged sailor. He protests not because it's unfair but because he thinks that a guy who had the hardest time of his life coming is adult enough to get some privileges. We accept this logic and feel for both Buddusky and Meadows. It's not in him says Mule referring to this spirit Buddusky tries to inculcate but the intelligence in the script is that whatever sickness stroke Meadows we feel that the cure would be much worse.The script written by Robert Towne who'd win an Oscar for Chinatown one year later reflects the paradoxical approach to rules and authority during the postVietnam era incarnated by the Navy trio each one being more complex than what he seems at first. The script is also one of the film's strengths in the way it feels absolutely real and genuine without any clich and allows each of the character to shine and to make us feel for them or for the kind of persons they were and the kind of cities they grew in like the North East to which the film delivers a sober but no less appealing painting. In fact this film made in 1973 makes me wonder in 2042 when people will ask about the 20002010's which movies I would recommend if I'm still alive.Now that cinema traded its dignity for money 3D special effects and unspecial stories where have gone all the true authors eager to express their view of life on the world? Where have all the 'Hal Ashby's gone goddammit?";

Rarely are murders committed at random although the recent horrific thriller Funny Games 1997 remade 2007 presents the worst possible scenario.But random murders do occur in real life all over the world people disappear and forever remain 'dead' with family and friends who are forever in limbo unable to achieve closure. Only sometimes are the perpetrators caught.With that thematic background The Silence presents just that scenario with the rape and murder of a young female teen that remains on the books of the local police for 23 years  until it happens again to another teen on the same day of the year at the same place and with the same modus operandi.Unlike other serial killer movies  for example The Silence of the Lambs 1991  we know the identity of the killer from the getgo. Moreover we also immediately know there are two perpetrators although one of them is obviously reluctant to participate even passively as he watches. As the two criminals Ulrich Thomsen as Peer Sommer and Woltan Mohring as Timo Friedrich give strong and believable performances that center upon their individual but similar proclivities for depravity brave actors both to take on such abhorrent roles.But why a gap of 23 years? Well that's where the story really starts after we see the first murder in the first five minutes. And when the second murder occurs so also occurs the retirement party for the local police detective Krischan Mittich played by Burghart Klaussner who failed to solve the first so also the return to duty of an eccentric grieving widowed officer David Jahn played by Sebastian Blomberg who is obviously still distraught by the loss of his wife to cancer and who engages in bizarre activity and so also the emotional awakening of the mother of the first murdered teen Elena Lange played by Katrin Sass who has been locked in unrelenting grief for over twenty years.And in that mix there is repressed and introverted Timo  now a successful architect beautiful home lovely wife two munchkins the works  who when he reads about the second murder knows immediately who it is and decides something must be done But what?As the police investigate and as the clues are revealed the net  so to speak  tightens without the two miscreants knowing. But as viewers we know it all and gradually we move to the edge of our seat as we see how the wrong decisions are made how the wrong inferences are drawn how actions by one can be misconstrued by another all too easily and ultimately how facts can be ignored or discarded for political expediency or professional jealousy and for the need to close a case once and for all.Arguably suspenseful story doesn't get much better than this although some viewers might argue about narrative holes and coincidence. However because it's so believable it's so much better especially the ending which I'm sure many  maybe most  viewers will not see coming including me. Only in the last thirty seconds perhaps when the full irony hits you between the eyes.The setting is semirural ordinary and faultless the production is well paced even at two hours the dramatic acting  there is absolutely no comic relief  is flawless and the direction is so good well a glance or look truly is more effective than a thousand words. The background music is appropriate but at times borders on clichd I think. However this is a movie I'll watch again  not only for the story but also for the narrative structure that combines so many different threads of lives shattered by indifference inaction inadequacy or inconsolable sadness.Highly recommended.November 2011.".

	schema:headline " Most times the audience gets a happy ending...but in some instances reality over rules";
	schema:reviewBody "From the get go we the audience find out who the perpetrators are who is the aggressor and who is the submissive accomplice to the first rape and murder of a young girl riding home on her bicycle in 1986. As the two criminals Ulrich Thomsen as Peer Sommer and Woltan Mohring as Timo Friedrich lives unfold over the next 23 years we observe the police relentless pursuit of what they believe to be a single rapist and murderer. Families of the victim and police are heart broken and suffer immense internal pain and personal break ups in their respective marriages. We the audience can't wait to see how these two evil doers will be discovered and justice will prevail.Then 23 years later we witness another young girl arguing with her parents about her school grades and in a retaliatory stance she takes off with her back pack and tennis racket under the pretense that if her father won't drive her to the tennis court she will get there on her own. Instead once outside of her parents near grasp she heads to the amusement park to meet her friends who don't show up at the amusement park. As dusk falls she decides to ride her bike home alone but a cars bright headlights are following her and within the time it takes the audience to take a deep breath she disappears and is announced by the police and media as another missing person.Who killed her? We are not sure but we have a pretty good idea.

As the two criminals Ulrich Thomsen as Peer Sommer and Woltan Mohring as Timo Friedrich lives unfold over the next 23 years we observe the police relentless pursuit of what they believe to be a single rapist and murderer. Families of the victim and police are heart broken and suffer immense internal pain and personal break ups in their respective marriages. We the audience can't wait to see how these two evil doers will be discovered and justice will prevail.Then 23 years later we witness another young girl arguing with her parents about her school grades and in a retaliatory stance she takes off with her back pack and tennis racket under the pretense that if her father won't drive her to the tennis court she will get there on her own. Instead once outside of her parents near grasp she heads to the amusement park to meet her friends who don't show up at the amusement park. As dusk falls she decides to ride her bike home alone but a cars bright headlights are following her and within the time it takes the audience to take a deep breath she disappears and is announced by the police and media as another missing person.Who killed her? We are not sure but we have a pretty good idea. The submissive perpetrator Timo Friedrich who now has a loving wife and two children of his own is still haunted by the 1986 murder and decides to confront the alpha dog Peer Sommer.

	schema:headline " Original crime thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been quite a while since we've seen a pregnant policewoman on the cinema screen. Since 1996 to be exact when Frances McDormand played the slow but efficient crimesolver Marge Gunderson in Fargo. Jana Glser the pregnant policewoman in Das Letzte Schweigen The Last Silence unfortunately is not as efficient as Marge. At one point she looks the killer in the eye holds the evidence in her hand asks the right questions but nevertheless lets him go. Not because she doesn't do a good job but because the circumstances work against her. This German film about the killing of a little girl on the exact same spot where 23 years before another girl was raped and killed is not a classic whodunit. We know who committed the crime. What the film maker shows us is how this new killing opens old wounds that were not really healed after the first one. A retired police officer tries to solve the case because he failed the first time. The mother of the first victim has to live through the whole thing once again because she gets involved in solving the new crime. And most intriguing the accomplice of the first killer gets emotionally shocked by this new and almost identical crime. Apart from the very good script this film stands out because of the original cinematography. There are beautiful shots and original camera angles throughout the film. Just an example when the first killers drive their car out of the garage this is shown with an aerial shot of almost geometrical quality. Near the end of the film we see almost the same shot when the killer drives his car into the garage. Another beautiful shot full of suspense is the one where we see the car of the killers back up on the road when they see the little girl ride her bike on a dirt road in the woods. The film is shot in Bavaria. The brightly coloured shots of spotless streets and lush landscapes contrast with the inner feelings of the characters. Almost every one of them has some sort of problem. This creates an atmosphere of uneasiness which is emphasized by repeated fast motion shots of rolling clouds. Das Letzte Schweigen is an original crime thriller with lots of extra qualities to make it stand out above the average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Letzte Schweigen a.k.a. The Silence is a sleeper thriller that genuinely shocked and dumbfounded me but mainly AFTER it was finished! It's the type of film that slowly gets under your skin and the true horror of the plot only hits you afterwards because you are subconsciously analyzing and reprocessing the agitating events over and over again. It was quite a harsh confrontation for me especially because I'm into dark and devastating horror  cult cinema for nearly two decades now and I have seen numerous of allegedly controversial movies. But The Silence is largely different to anything I have ever seen before. It's an extremely slow and moody tale full of totally messed up characters not a single one qualifies as even remotely normal and horrifying events  themes that are depicted in a nihilistic and almost everyday fashion. The plot gradually unfolds and the viewer absorbs everything that is coming at himher but the truly evil nature of the denouement and the injustice of the climax only hit you  and quite hard I may add  once the end credits are rolling over the screen. The story starts in a remote little German town in the summer of 1986. Two young men who share the disgusting passion of watching child pornography it's not explicitly shown but clearly suggested are driving around in their red Volkswagen when they spot an 11yearold girl bikeriding on a dirt road. One of them Peer Sommer viciously rapes and murders the defenselessly screaming girl while his pal Timo remains motionless and petrified in the car. Shortly after the incident Timo flees away from Peer in an attempt to forget everything that has happened and start a new life elsewhere. 23 years later on the exact same day and on the exact same place the bicycle and a couple of blood stains of 13yearold Sinikka Weghamm are discovered. The disappearance of the girl is a nightmare for her parents but also for the mother of the still unsolved previous murder case as well as for the police officers  retired and incompetent new ones  that are charged with the case. Is it the work of a copycat killer or has the original killer returned? The truth is even more nightmarish than anything you can think of. The Silence benefices from a continuously foreboding atmosphere and the gradually revealed details of the case make you uncomfortable. At several points during the movie you'll find yourself cursing and screaming at the screen in an attempt to speed up the slow police investigation. Themes like child murder and pedophilia automatically make any thriller disturbing but the sober tone and bleak characters in The Silence are almost unbearable. Young director Baran Bo Odar maintains the nailbiting ambiance throughout the entire film and all the acting performances particularly those of Ulrich Thomsen and Wotan Wilke Mhring are deeply impressive. There are definitely some plot holes to detect regarding the police investigation and the involvement of the media but somehow it feels like a factual murder case really could be as ineptly led as this one. The total absence of music humor and certain background explanations only make the film more haunting. This definitely isn't viewing material for everyone but highly recommended to thriller fanatics in search of a mature and complex story.".

The lifeshattering impact on the parents along with their inconsolable grief the frustrations of the investigators the remorse and guilt or lack thereof on the part of the criminals  all are woven into a rich tapestry that mixes crimeanddetection elements with generous dollops of morbid psychology.The most interesting character is Timo Friedrich superbly enacted by Wotan Wilke Mohring an accomplice to the initial crime and a prime suspect in the second who has so many inner demons of his own to account for that he has become utterly consumed by feelings of guilt and selfloathing.Unlike in the typical American police procedural the investigators here are not played by dropdead gorgeous movie stars but by frumpy slightly saggy and balding middleaged performers who look like actual honesttoGod people you might encounter in real life. And all are excellent.In addition the movie doesn't cater to the audience's desire for a clearcut resolution and in so doing acknowledges that life does not always work out the way it does in the movies.Odar's direction is both spare and slightly surreal at times so that the world he's portraying always feels strangely offkilter as befits the subject matter.A triumph for all concerned The Silence is easily one of the best movies of 2013 thus far.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film opens in 1986 two men in a car follow a young girl as she cycles down a farm track one of them gets out rapes and murders her. The other man does nothing to stop him but leaves town almost immediately afterwards. Returning to the present we see another young girl cycling away from home after an argument with her parents. She does not return and her bicycle is found at the site of the previous killing. No body is found but that matches with the original case where it wasn't found for some time. The police obviously realise the two cases are connected and after further investigations it looks as if there may have been a third girl although as her disappearance wasn't the same they are unsure all they know is that a red car was seen at the time and one was seen at the same time as the 1986 case. Before learning exactly who killed the girl and why we don't just see the police investigation but also the effect it has had on her family and the actions of the two men we saw at the start one of who is clearly trying to get back in touch with the other.This German crime drama was quite interesting in the way that it didn't only follow the police but also the families of the two missing girls and the men responsible for their grief. This led to some uncomfortable scenes when one of the two went to visit the mother of the first girl and later when a pregnant police woman visits the other to ask about the car he drove in the eighties. The actors did a good job although some of the characters were a little clich the main policeman was dealing with the death of his own wife and he disagreed with his boss about the case for example. The way the action moved between the protagonists kept the story interesting in a way that could be disturbing at times this sense was heightened by the music used. Without giving blatant spoilers I will say the resolution is quite disturbing although given what had gone before it didn't exactly shock me. Overall I'd say this was worth watching but I'm not sure it is the sort of film I'd want to watch more than once.".

The police obviously realise the two cases are connected and after further investigations it looks as if there may have been a third girl although as her disappearance wasn't the same they are unsure all they know is that a red car was seen at the time and one was seen at the same time as the 1986 case. Before learning exactly who killed the girl and why we don't just see the police investigation but also the effect it has had on her family and the actions of the two men we saw at the start one of who is clearly trying to get back in touch with the other.This German crime drama was quite interesting in the way that it didn't only follow the police but also the families of the two missing girls and the men responsible for their grief. This led to some uncomfortable scenes when one of the two went to visit the mother of the first girl and later when a pregnant police woman visits the other to ask about the car he drove in the eighties. The actors did a good job although some of the characters were a little clich the main policeman was dealing with the death of his own wife and he disagreed with his boss about the case for example. The way the action moved between the protagonists kept the story interesting in a way that could be disturbing at times this sense was heightened by the music used. Without giving blatant spoilers I will say the resolution is quite disturbing although given what had gone before it didn't exactly shock me. Overall I'd say this was worth watching but I'm not sure it is the sort of film I'd want to watch more than once.";

	schema:reviewBody "Das letzte Schweigen or Das Schweigen or The Silence is a German crime thriller from six years ago. The writer and director is Baran bo Odar and this was his second movie not counting an early short film he made. I saw in his profile that he was born in Switzerland but I am not sure about the origin of his name. It sounds a bit Danish to me so it's fitting that Ulrich Thomsen one of Denmark's finest actors plays a major character in here. The film is about two child murders one that took place almost 25 years ago and one that takes place in the now. Is it the same killer? The fact that we find out very early about what exactly happened in the past implies that it's not but no further spoilers.The cast includes a handful really famous names from Germany such as Klauner Sa Mhring Blomberg Michelsen... so it's not much of a surprise that the film got some recognition in terms of popularity as well as awards even if it did not get as popular as the filmmaker's most recent work Who Am I. I personally enjoyed the watch overall. What I liked maybe most about it is that it did not take the easy route at all. Basically all the plot developments in here are not by the books at all and that includes the ending as well as the killer's motivation for his crime. Very welldone and wellwritten. Sadly there are also areas when the movie is not particularly wellwritten. This is mostly about the characters' relationships such as the stereotypical death of one major character's wife or the relationship between Sa' and Klauner's character which was pretty ridiculous even if it had a touch of Goodbye Lenin to it obviously.As a whole I recommend the movie. For a German crime thriller it is fairly good and way better than 90 of Tatort episodes. The good certainly outweighs the bad. A lot of it is due to the strong acting by basically everybody involved even if Sa plays pretty much the same character as usual. It's especially worth seeing because it is a pretty daring film and you do not have to expect anything stereotypically bad to happen during these almost 2 hours. Thumbs up. Give it a go if you like the genre and get a chance to see it. Nicely atmospheric little movie.".

Centring on two identical murders some 23 years apart while we're clearly shown the perpetrator of the first murder the identity of the second slayer is kept from us until close to the end but isn't difficult to work out. The film I suspect fancies itself more as a psychological analyses of disturbed individuals rather than a more conventional murder mystery but fails largely due to inconsistencies in the writing especially the numerous unlikely alliances made by various parties in the narrative. There's an awful lot of pairing which goes on on all sides of the fence but many seem too unrealistic and unnatural to convince especially the key one involving the murderer and his abettor but also the disturbed recently widowed detective and his obviously pregnant partner not to mention the retired but still rebellious detective from te first murder landing up in the bed of the first victim's mother. I especially didn't get the hearton hissleeve widower detective who resembles a slightly deranged Daniel Day Lewis and who seemingly is given largesse by his superior to openly question and indeed harangue the latter's orders but who of course cracks the case with an observation I got to before he did himself. The film dwells at length on the grief processes of sundry parties to the extent that you feel it forgets it should primarily be dealing with the emotive subject of childmurder. Also I am fast growing tired of those several aerialperspective tracker shots plus I felt just too many scenes were unlikely not to mention unbelievable. I want greatly struck by the acting either so that in the end it just came across to me as an overearnest overambitious but ultimately overdull policeprocedural".

There's an awful lot of pairing which goes on on all sides of the fence but many seem too unrealistic and unnatural to convince especially the key one involving the murderer and his abettor but also the disturbed recently widowed detective and his obviously pregnant partner not to mention the retired but still rebellious detective from te first murder landing up in the bed of the first victim's mother. I especially didn't get the hearton hissleeve widower detective who resembles a slightly deranged Daniel Day Lewis and who seemingly is given largesse by his superior to openly question and indeed harangue the latter's orders but who of course cracks the case with an observation I got to before he did himself. The film dwells at length on the grief processes of sundry parties to the extent that you feel it forgets it should primarily be dealing with the emotive subject of childmurder. Also I am fast growing tired of those several aerialperspective tracker shots plus I felt just too many scenes were unlikely not to mention unbelievable. I want greatly struck by the acting either so that in the end it just came across to me as an overearnest overambitious but ultimately overdull policeprocedural";

The police response consists of a bureaucratic supervising detective primarily concerned with allaying public fears a detective who commiserates with the victims' families but who's also struggling with the loss of his wife to natural causes and a retired detective anxious to not allow the killer to escape justice this time. Director Baran bo Odar does an excellent job of creating a chilling atmosphere that never slackens. The term nail biter may be overused but I feel it's entirely justified in this case. The evil depicted here seems all the more terrifying because it is so banal. Almost like a Nordic Fargo this community hardly seems as if a dark day would descend on it and yet the rustic fields and lakes yield horrors. The cast is first rate especially Ulrich Thomsen and Wotan Wilke Mohring. Katrin Sab gives a beautifully controlled performance as the mother of the original victim. Sebastian Blomberg is the detective who spends as much time fighting his own demons as working on the case.".

His Bruce Pearson isn't just a simpleton for whom the audience is supposed to feel a truckload of sympathy  there are many television movies that do just that  he's a multilayered person. DeNiro squeezes more emotion out of a single sideways smile than many actors can do in their entire careers. What's more even though you the viewer know what Pearson's fate is you're no less pulling for him. Call this a tearjerker and you'd be correct.

I figured that De Niro would be the big tough talkin' hot shot which he does very well anyway but instead he's the dumb country boy. The friendship the two men create is the big reason to watch this movie. As the hardships occur the stronger the frienship gets. Robert De Niro does an outstanding job in one of his first real big hit next to 'Mean Streets' as Bruce Pearson the ignorant country boy you can tell he used the same accent in 'Cape Fear' from Georgia who is dying of Hodgkin's Disease and Michael Moriarty is also fantastic as Henry Wiggen the tough talkin' hot shot New Yorker. The two men are trying to keep De Niro's illness a secret so that it won't spill out into the media so they have to find excuses for going to hospitals and such. The film is a powerful drama yet it also has a good dose of comedy. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes great acting and unbreakable friendship. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Bang the Drum Slowly is among the best baseball movies. For my money it might be the very best. Its story is simple  Henry Wiggen the intelligent and savvy ace pitcher of the New York Mammoths learns that his best friend on the team simpleminded kindhearted catcher Bruce Pearson has terminal cancer and a year to live. A baseball season to live.This is a story about friendship and about being a decent human being. It's about how as Bruce laments there's just no sense to his death. The movie is built around a baseball season and it's certainly a baseball movie but it's a rare sports movie where the human drama isn't clichd and predictable but actually makes the film. The baseball elements are welldone to be sure the teammate's show a realistic mix of cockiness and genuine concern for a teammate and the plot involving the manager's spirited investigation of Bruce's offseason activities not yet knowing he was at a cancer hospital is funny and realistic at the same time. However the reason to watch this is the simple but powerful human drama  the baseball season can't help but take a back seat to that.Aside from the stellar story this movie is memorable for the acting. Of course Robert Deniro gives an excellent performance in a role that's quite different than what he'd become known for. But Deniro as the kindhearted simpleminded Pearson really shows off his range. As overlooked as the film itself is Michael Moriarty's topshelf performance as Wiggen. While Moriarty evidently has less range he plays Wiggen much as he would play Ben Stone in Law  Order two decades later right down to calling everyone sir Moriarty's intelligent noble and soulsearching demeanor is naturally perfect for the role. And I can't forget to mention Vincent Gardenia as manager Dutch Schnell. Playing any other character Gardenia's work here would have been absurd but his zany acting is totally appropriate for a famous baseball manager a line of work where flamboyant overthetop behavior is essentially a job requirement regardless of what era of baseball you're talking about.While I don't know if we could ever definitively determine a best baseball movie because a lot of it comes down to personal taste. But for me Bang the Drum Slowly is everything I want in a baseball movie. I think any fan of the game owes it to themselves to check this film out if they have the chance.".

Upon learning of his friend's condition Henry negotiates as part of his contract that Bruce will remain with the team for the entire season. He also strives and this is perhaps the biggest crux of conflict of the film to keep Bruce's condition their secret for reasons far greater than mere confidentiality. Henry doesn't know what the fallout would be from disclosure and one of the best scenes in the film is a grilling he gets when the manager suspects that he is hiding something. Henry is also there as Bruce deals with the unsettling prospects of terminal illness. Although the setting is baseball and writer Mark Harris is one of the best authors of baseball fiction the story is really about friendship and what a man will do for a friend when he knows that more is at stake than winning games. Younger viewers might not relate to a number of things that date the film somewhat such a a player negotiating his contract without an agent and Henry's offseason moonlighting as an insurance salesman yes players really did do that back before free agency. Any baseball fan will appreciate the footage of Old Yankee Stadium before it was renovated in 197475 drastically changing the character of the legendary old park. There is an eerie reallife foreshadowing of the fate of another New York catcher also wearing Bruce's number 15. It must be said that the supporting roles such as the team's salty old manager Dutch Vincent Gardenia and Bruce's gold digging girlfriend Katie Ann Wedgeworth are portrayed extremely well.".

I haven't seen it in many years but fondly remember it as one of those pictures that leaves an indelible impression. Based on an early '50s novel by Mark Harris about a fictional N.Y.City Baseball Team The Mammoths the movie's focal point is the friendship between the team's star pitcher and a dying catcher a naive backwoods boy lacking in the social graces.I'll never forget Michael Moriarty's Henry Wiggen in a scene where he reaches out to embrace a distraught frightened Bruce Pearson Robert De Niro trying his best to console his dying roommate.  We're all dying   Wiggen says to his friend and thus begins and shortly ends one of the most tender scenes ever filmed between two men in a movie about baseball no less. And yet it's really not about baseball at all yes there are the obligatory scenes of the team at play and a humorous locker room speech by the team's crusty manager the wonderful late Vincent Gardenia who received a supporting actor Oscar nomination for this film. There is plenty of humor to go along with the pathos in this story but pathos wins out. Death hangs over everyone's head in this picture  the message is pure and simple . To quote the movie's poster tag line Nothing is more important than friendship not even death. I suppose a movie like this wouldn't work as well nowadays. The team support and management along with ridiculous sky rocketing salaries and apathetic treatment of sports fans has changed everything for the worse this sweet little movie touches on a more innocent time. BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY will not enter the record books as one of the all time greats it's too pat and maudlin at times the locker room scene where Piney Woods plaintively strums the title song on the guitar is overkill although it gets to me every time. But Moriarty and De Niro and a timeless reminder of the importance of love and friendship make this an unforgettable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Very probably the best of the slew of a loved one dying of an unnamed and incurable disease movie of the early 1970's Bang the Drum Slowly predated the grand daddy of all those five handkerchief tearjerkerLove Storyby some 15 years. The 1973 movie was originally shown on TV's United States Steel Hour in September 1956 staring Paul Newman and Albert Saimi in the leading roles of Henry Wiggen  Bruce Pearson.It's when New York Mammoth star pitching ace Henry Wiggins Michael Moriarty held out sighing his yearly club contract during spring training that it was suspected that he wanted something far more then the money 70000 smackers that his team offered him. Soon it became obvious that his relationship with his roommate and catcher Bruce Pearson Robert De Niro was behind Wiggens holding out! That Wigens relationship with Pearson was far more important then what he can get in cash from the Mammoth's owners. Wiggens insisted that if Pearson who was having a rotten spring training is ever traded to another team he's to be traded along with him!You could just imagine all the rumors and snickering Wiggens' demands conjured up among his fellow Mammoth teammates and the teams manager the I've seen it all but in this case I'll have to pass Dutch Schnell Vincent Gardenia. What exactly is going on between these two guys anyway! Was it that mysterious hunting and fishing trip last winter to the wilds of Minnesota that somehow caused them in being alone in the states dark and forbidden forests to somehow change their outlook on life. Did that romp in the woods cause then to get off the straight and narrow road and become unnaturally friendly with each other?It's later in the baseball season with poor Bruce Pearson playing the best baseball of his entire career being on the verge of collapsing from sheer exhaustion that Wiggens finally reveals to Mommoth teammate Goose Williams Tom Signorelli the shocking truth behind his odd friendship with his ailing battery mate. It was that winter when a concerned Wiggens had his friend Pearson secretly checked into the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota that he found out that he was in fact dying from an incurable disease Hodgkins lymphoma! All Pearson now wanted was to not only finish out the season as the club's first string catcher but be a part in helping the team win the league's pennant as well as the World Series.With the cat now out of the bag in what Pearson is going through in him having a few months left to live the Mommoth players stop their bickering with each other as well as picking on and needling the good natured and friendly Bruce Pearson and instead get down to business. It's then that he Mommoth players join together as a team and with Pearson providing the glue stick together and go all the way to the top of the baseball world as its World Champions.SPOILERS In the end Pearson didn't live out the year dying just before Christmas but at least being part of the Championship New York Mammoth team. This had Pearson go out of this world as a winner not only in baseball but even over the dreaded and fatal disease that eventually took his life Hodgkins lymphoma. It was fitting that only Pearson's good friend and teammate Henry Wiggins was the only members of the Mammoth team to attend his funeral.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Very probably the best of the slew of a loved one dying of an unnamed and incurable disease movie of the early 1970's Bang the Drum Slowly predated the grand daddy of all those five handkerchief tearjerkerLove Storyby some 15 years. The 1973 movie was originally shown on TV's United States Steel Hour in September 1956 staring Paul Newman and Albert Saimi in the leading roles of Henry Wiggen  Bruce Pearson.It's when New York Mammoth star pitching ace Henry Wiggins Michael Moriarty held out sighing his yearly club contract during spring training that it was suspected that he wanted something far more then the money 70000 smackers that his team offered him. Soon it became obvious that his relationship with his roommate and catcher Bruce Pearson Robert De Niro was behind Wiggens holding out! That Wigens relationship with Pearson was far more important then what he can get in cash from the Mammoth's owners. Wiggens insisted that if Pearson who was having a rotten spring training is ever traded to another team he's to be traded along with him!You could just imagine all the rumors and snickering Wiggens' demands conjured up among his fellow Mammoth teammates and the teams manager the I've seen it all but in this case I'll have to pass Dutch Schnell Vincent Gardenia. What exactly is going on between these two guys anyway! Was it that mysterious hunting and fishing trip last winter to the wilds of Minnesota that somehow caused them in being alone in the states dark and forbidden forests to somehow change their outlook on life. Did that romp in the woods cause then to get off the straight and narrow road and become unnaturally friendly with each other?It's later in the baseball season with poor Bruce Pearson playing the best baseball of his entire career being on the verge of collapsing from sheer exhaustion that Wiggens finally reveals to Mommoth teammate Goose Williams Tom Signorelli the shocking truth behind his odd friendship with his ailing battery mate. It was that winter when a concerned Wiggens had his friend Pearson secretly checked into the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota that he found out that he was in fact dying from an incurable disease Hodgkins lymphoma! All Pearson now wanted was to not only finish out the season as the club's first string catcher but be a part in helping the team win the league's pennant as well as the World Series.With the cat now out of the bag in what Pearson is going through in him having a few months left to live the Mommoth players stop their bickering with each other as well as picking on and needling the good natured and friendly Bruce Pearson and instead get down to business. It's then that he Mommoth players join together as a team and with Pearson providing the glue stick together and go all the way to the top of the baseball world as its World Champions.SPOILERS In the end Pearson didn't live out the year dying just before Christmas but at least being part of the Championship New York Mammoth team. This had Pearson go out of this world as a winner not only in baseball but even over the dreaded and fatal disease that eventually took his life Hodgkins lymphoma. It was fitting that only Pearson's good friend and teammate Henry Wiggins was the only members of the Mammoth team to attend his funeral. Since it was Wiggens who was by Pearson's side right from the start until the end as he was dying from his incurable disease. And it was Wiggens more then anyone one else with the exception of Persons family members who should have been with him when he was laid to his final resting place.P.S it was nice to see that some of Bang the Drum Slowly scenes were filmed at the old old before it was closed down and completely refurbished in 1974 New York's Yaknee Stadium known as The House that Ruth Built.

And even the movie fans look at me funny when I mention one of my favorite actors from the 70s Michael Moriarty.But there are only a handful of truly fine sports films and of course even fewer in the sub genre of baseball. But Bang the Drum Slowly is in that handful without a doubt whether anyone you know has ever heard of it or not.Search for this on Amazon and you can get a very good used copy for 3.95 plus shipping and it will be a fine spent eight dollars. Many a night especially later in the lives of the young when sleep will not come and you're alone in the dark you'll slip this movie in and have a warm feeling even if sleep never comes.The story of mediocre catcher and a great pitcher going through their final season together as the lessertalented player is dying of an unspecified disease. This brief description in a TV Guide would never draw many people and even as a kid years ago when I saw it listed as thus on the proverbial late movie on the local Chicago channel I wasn't looking for anything promising. But having seen Who'll Stop the Rain recently I liked Moriarty's restrained intensity and I knew of the new intensity in acting known as DeNiro. So I took a chance and that old bard Robert Frost was proved true again.Perhaps a lesser pair of actors couldn't have delivered the true feeling of friendship between this odd couple. Moriarty is the star who is a true pro on and off the field selling insurance in and off season dutifully looking out for his and his family's future. DeNiro is one of the oldfashioned goodol'boys that used to populate baseball tobacco chewers and guys who never read a book without pictures. Stereotypical portraits of a time long gone now in baseball but these two skilled actors don't let it drop down into the easy maudlin most other movies would have easily and even willingly dipped into. But it stays above the easy area somehow accomplishing that difficult balancing act.The side stories of how a talented team can rag itself into a poor record is a telling one. It's happened far more than the stories of the Bronx Bombers or the 70s Oakland teams who hated each other yet still won. Teams need spirit and camaraderie even at the pro level and the movie is a good example of that. Helping one another makes a team better than it is most times as sappy as most people think it is these days. But it is a truism and it's explored here as well as anywhere.Take an hour and a half and change of your life and find a bit of a message and a bit of a bittersweet lesson in the end. And tell a friend and have them leave a fair evaluation at IMDb. This is much better than the 6.8 people have left.".

Doesn't attract from the beauty of the performances.Moriarty is the star pitcher and back in those days before big money for a year could set you up for life ballplayers had to both have another income for the off season and a career plan once your playing days are over. Moriarty is selling insurance and that was not uncommon for players who after their athletic days were over could always sell a policy to fans in between talk of past glory days.Pitchers star pitchers that is could always impose on a ballclub for a favorite catcher. In my youth I remember the Baltimore Orioles had a second string catcher like DeNiro's character named Joe Ginsberg. He was around because Hoyt Wilhelm wanted it so. Seems as though their star catcher Gus Triandos couldn't handle Wilhelm's knuckleball few could but Ginsberg better than most. The Orioles had Ginsberg for duty when Wilhelm pitched.For this current season Moriarty has a clause put in his contract that DeNiro and he are a package item. Something that doesn't sit well with management but he's a star and they have their quirks. What no one knows is DeNiro is dying of Hodgkin's Disease. Not noticeable at first but he's getting more and more bad days. Moriarty is also putting his future with Arcturus Insurance in jeopardy because he's pulling a stall on DeNiro who wants to change his beneficiary on a big life insurance policy to his gold digging girlfriend Ann Wedgworth. Still everyone in the world can see what she's all about except a simple trusting soul like DeNiro.The worldly star pitcher and the simple Georgia country boy second string catcher are unlikely companions. But both DeNiro and Moriarty have a matchless chemistry. It's like they were giving two halves of one performance.Vincent Gardenia plays their manager and he got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The whole story of the film is their effort to keep DeNiro's condition a secret but Gardenia knows something's up. One story after another they give him including a hilarious scene where they say DeNiro has had a bout of the clap but he's better now.The novel was written in the 50s but updated for the early 70s as the men's dress would indicate. The New York Mammoths were really the New York Giants but they were just a memory now as was their unusually contoured park the Polo Grounds. Which is why we saw Yankee style pinstripes and a home park that looked like old Yankee Stadium.Bang The Drum Slowly is one of the finest baseball films ever done. And DeNiro's character Bruce Pearson is the first of many firmly etched starring roles he'd give us for two more generations.".

One story after another they give him including a hilarious scene where they say DeNiro has had a bout of the clap but he's better now.The novel was written in the 50s but updated for the early 70s as the men's dress would indicate. The New York Mammoths were really the New York Giants but they were just a memory now as was their unusually contoured park the Polo Grounds. Which is why we saw Yankee style pinstripes and a home park that looked like old Yankee Stadium.Bang The Drum Slowly is one of the finest baseball films ever done. And DeNiro's character Bruce Pearson is the first of many firmly etched starring roles he'd give us for two more generations.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nominally a baseball movie this is actually more of a human interest story focusing on the relationship of a couple of teammates who hang together through the thick and thin of catcher Bruce Pearson's Robert DeNiro bout with Hodgkin's disease. You never get a clear idea of why New York Mammoth's pitcher Henry Wiggen Michael Moriarty takes a shine to his buddy but their loyalty to each other is convincing. I'm not sure if a real life ball player could have pulled off the contract demand that Wiggen did by forcing the owner and manager to agree to his terms for keeping 'Bill' employed but this was made over forty years ago when money hadn't yet become that big a deal.Now I'd never heard of Big League Tegwar before seeing this picture and I don't know if it was simply made up for the story but it looks like it could be a lot of fun. With a little creativity you could almost convince a newcomer that the game was on the up and up as long as you didn't get too carried away. But getting too carried away is probably the whole point of it.For DeNiro this was his last picture before really coming on as an actor with an appearance in Mean Streets as Johnny Boy in the same year. After that his career took off like a rocket and is still going as strong as could be. Michael Moriarty well I never really cared that much for him probably because I've seen him in too many roles like Hull Barret in Eastwood's Pale Rider where he's too much of a doormat. In this picture his character is a commendable sort to stand up for Bruce but his nonaggressive demeanor for some reason bothers me a bit.As for the baseball there are a handful of scenes to give the picture it's flavor as a sports film but if you're tuning in that's not the main reason to see it. It's the human drama that takes center stage here in a story that personifies the meaning of friendship and going the extra mile.".

Bang the Drum Slowly truly defies the Diamond in the Rough film that was seen by so few but respected by those honorable few. Though more of a drama than a baseball movie we seldom view the chronicle pain of DeNiro's Pearson. Films centered around a dying protagonist often throw it high on the melancholy. Why should we go through such excruciating pain as to sit back and weep ourselves to death during this hour and forty minute film? There's no point to it at all. We don't have to watch our dying victim suffer for the film to carry on this film is a breath of fresh air as Pearson though dying decides to keep his illness as lowkey as possible. That could make this tearjerker a little less tearful.The performances were overall above average. The young DeNiro gives poise and charisma as the simple but kindred spirited farm boy. Moriarty so talented and so underrated throughout his career is wonderful in his role as a star pitcher wheeler and dealer and acting brother to his dying friend and teammate. Vincent Gardenia is remarkable as the straight man manager of the Mammoths who are poised with talent though their personalities are quirky and inner problems.Bruce's intention was to keep his illness secretive but the secret unfortunately leaks out to the club an in the end though a bit predictable manages to pull the team together.The glue that held this movie together is the power of friendship between Wiggen and Pearson which also usurps the illness that's victimizing poor Bruce. It's not all serious though so tissue papers are not a necessity. In fact there's plenty of humor to go along on the ride.

It seems when the players got off of Bruce's back he was able to hit home runs and had more pep as a catcher. Henry brings Bruce to the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis and there was bad news for poor Bruce. Henry agreed not to tell anyone about the findings at the clinic and this is when the story gets funny at times and it hits a rather sad note.

	schema:headline " A small brilliant gem of a film that still holds up after 20 years";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Testament when it came out in 1983. At the time I was 30 years old and the mother of a two yearold son. As a child of the Cold War years I have always been interested in films about that most unthinkable event the detonation of a nuclear bomb or bombs somewhere on our fragile planet. If you are too you must watch Testament and another small gem of a slightly earlier era called FailSafe.This is a wonderful film that slowly unbearably reveals what happens in the small idyllic town of Hamlin after a fullscale nuclear exchange between the superpowers wipes out a large part of America. The town and its citizens including the Weatherly family escape initial destruction. But slowly the bonds that hold western societies together electricity communication fresh food medical help begin to fray and ravel. There is no television. Batteries to power transistor radios suddenly become more valuable than 20 bills in a town where suddenly there's nothing left to buy.The story and scenes are permeated with a sense of enormous loss. A family loses its husband and father who simply walked out the door waving a breezy goodbye one morning and disappeared into the holocaust. All his wife Carol and two children have left of him are their memories and some flickering images on home movies glimpses not just of a lost loved one but of a lost  and loved  world. A school play about the Pied Piper was in rehearsal before catastrophe hit and desperate to recapture some normalcy and to divert the children's attention from a reality to horrible to contemplate the town decides to go on with the show.In the earlier rehearsal scenes life was normal the future shone brightly in the children's faces. Now as the parents watch the performance they see no future for these beautiful innocents. To me this is the key scene of the film the contrast between what these people once had and what has been lost is staggering. It makes you want to go outside smell the air marvel at the full supermarket shelves and the working telephone lines. This is a gift that the movie gives its audience which goes far beyond entertainment and approaches enlightenment.Beyond the wonderful writing direction and performances I love the tiny touches in the story. For example there's the foreshadowing the implicit warning contained in the presence of a minor character a little Japanese boy with Down Syndrome who is cared for by the town after his father dies. The child's name is Hiroshi. Pay attention the script commands us in a whisper Hiroshima happened once but it can happen again and it can happen to you as well as them. In the end the movie is a testament to this undeniable fact a testament to the stupidity of men who continue building everlarger more lethal means of mass destruction and finally a testament to the strength of mothers like the character of Carol Weatherly who have no choice but to love and protect their children no matter what comes.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw Testament when it came out in 1983. At the time I was 30 years old and the mother of a two yearold son. As a child of the Cold War years I have always been interested in films about that most unthinkable event the detonation of a nuclear bomb or bombs somewhere on our fragile planet. If you are too you must watch Testament and another small gem of a slightly earlier era called FailSafe.This is a wonderful film that slowly unbearably reveals what happens in the small idyllic town of Hamlin after a fullscale nuclear exchange between the superpowers wipes out a large part of America. The town and its citizens including the Weatherly family escape initial destruction. But slowly the bonds that hold western societies together electricity communication fresh food medical help begin to fray and ravel. There is no television. Batteries to power transistor radios suddenly become more valuable than 20 bills in a town where suddenly there's nothing left to buy.The story and scenes are permeated with a sense of enormous loss. A family loses its husband and father who simply walked out the door waving a breezy goodbye one morning and disappeared into the holocaust. All his wife Carol and two children have left of him are their memories and some flickering images on home movies glimpses not just of a lost loved one but of a lost  and loved  world. A school play about the Pied Piper was in rehearsal before catastrophe hit and desperate to recapture some normalcy and to divert the children's attention from a reality to horrible to contemplate the town decides to go on with the show.In the earlier rehearsal scenes life was normal the future shone brightly in the children's faces. Now as the parents watch the performance they see no future for these beautiful innocents. To me this is the key scene of the film the contrast between what these people once had and what has been lost is staggering. It makes you want to go outside smell the air marvel at the full supermarket shelves and the working telephone lines.

	schema:reviewBody "This small film from 1983 might actually be more emotionally devastating than Schindler's List because it presents us with a horrific whatif scenario that I imagine scared the bejesus out of viewers in the Cold War era that it was made and will send shivers down the spine of anyone who watches it today.  The threat of nuclear holocaust may not be so looming now but the threat of bioterrorism or any other level of terrorist attack or all out war is very real in the post 911 era.  This film is so stark and intimate that it really doesn't matter what these people are dying from it could just as easily be biological warfare as it is nuclear fallout.  I was so deeply effected by this film's portrayal or one family in one small California town getting cut off from the rest of civilization which we can only assume is in the midst of WWIII and slowly falling apart while one by one loved ones succumb to nuclear radiation that I couldn't watch it all.  I had to flip the channels to watch a few minutes of The Simpsons before I turned back to watch the end.  This is possibly the most depressing film ever made.  Jane Alexander running frantically around the house searching for her youngest son's favorite stuffed animal and refusing to bury his body wrapped in bedsheets in the backyard until she found it is so heartbreaking that it made me sick.  As such this is the film that every politician the world over should watch before declaring any kind of war. War is not about winning or losing or politics or doing what it right war is about the death of our children.  Everyone needs to be reminded of that before making the war cry.  In the end we all die.".

People were crying in theatres and article after article told of how this extremely powerful film affected people. This was not hype the emotional strength of this movie is genuinely powerful.

But the effect on me was apparently visible immediately when I walked out of the theatre and passed thru the line of people waiting for the next showing a woman who was laughing with her friends happened to look at me and her face went completely serious. I very nearly hugged her right there this stranger. When I got home I cried for about two hours. The film's themes affected my at the time concerns about love relationships and such like. One scene I'll never EVER forget the most devastating the 13ish year old daughter asks her mother What's it like? MOTHER What's what like? DAUGHTER Making love. The mother Jane Alexander  my God what a performance! tells her in a very frank and beautiful speech and the daughter caps off that scene with a devastating remark that just kills you and got my tears flowing I probably couldn't hold back at that point.Before making TESTAMENT director Lynne Littman had made only documentaries so maybe that realism style added to the power and believability of this movie. One of my all time favorite supporting actors is in this film and he does a fantastic job Mako. He and the young retarded Down Syndrome? boy who plays his son make a phenomenal team. They're my favorite characters so full of innocence father so full of love strength and pain. Agh... my god my god... what a movie. Whew.".

No mushroom clouds no graphic scenes of mass destruction and death incarnate. Just simple raw human emotion. Testament handles its subject manner with a surprising gentle touch understated yet effective. The film is the best of the three because of its subtlety. A small Californian town isn't hit by the blast but rather the aftermath.It works. At first the town manages to hold together fairly well even proceeding with the elementary school play. But then the children begin dying then the grownups. And the film rapidly becomes a story about surviving as best you can rather than rebuilding and going on. I won't spoil the film by revealing plot details but there are several twists that are both subtle and heartbreaking.This film relies on its emotions to tell the story and the actors are up to the task. Jane Alexander is in a word brilliant how she didn't win the Oscar she got nominated for is beyond me but she's not the only one. Her children particularly Lukas Haas and Roxanna Zal in their movie debuts are stunning as well while some of the bit players make the most of what they have.In the end it's the gradual NONappearance of the actors that make the point. Life will go on yes but for how long? Testament relies on the loss of those we learn to love to make its point in the best way possible by letting us get it on our own.".

But each time I convinced myself to stick it out and I'm glad I did.I don't know what it was the strength of Jane Alexander's performance the combined performances by the younger actors playing her children the excellent and artistic yet remarkably matteroffact cinematography the haunting beauty of James Horner's score or all of the above but Testament just got into me and tore my very soul apart. There's no graphic ground zero scenes like in the other two films just the story of a family struggling to survive trying to stay hopeful beyond all hope.The scene that I think will stick with me forever is the shot of Jane Alexander tearing apart bedsheets. That's all I'll say about this scene for now since I don't want to give anything away but watch the film and you'll know what I'm talking about.As other reviews have alluded to The Day After and Testament both came out around the same time yet Testament is far less known and remembered among the two films even though most consider it the better of the two. I think the reason for this is that The Day After was presented on television while Testament though originally made for public television was instead released to theaters. With a movie like this I think it's easier to just watch it on TV than to bring yourself to actually go out to a theater to experience this type of film.Testament is one of those films like The Hours. It's beautiful breathtaking unforgettable... and so heartrending I'm not sure I can ever bring myself to watch it again. But if you haven't seen it you should. Trust me it will be worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forget Freddie and Jason if you want a real horror film then I recommend this because I think it will keep most normal people awake long into the night. This film doesn't rely on gore or violence to get its message across instead it takes the very familiar scene of a loving young family living in a closeknit town and dumps them into the harsh harrowing realities of nuclear war where there is no mercy for either the good or the innocent.'Testament' is a tale of what would happen if a nuclear strike devastated America and how average people who have no military training or the like would cope. There is no computer virus to fix things nor is there some hunky muscular hero to save the day people are left to fend for themselves in a world forever changed in conditions that are unforgiving and demoralising. The film revolves mainly around the Wetherly family made up by parents Carol and Tom  and their three children fourteenyearold Mary Liz twelveyearold Brad and sixyearold Scottie and it packs no punches for the fate of this little group.For a film that couldn't have had a massive budget not only is the script of good quality but so was the acting. Jane Alexander was excellent as a Carol a mother striving to see her family through this disaster watching as the town around her dwindles as people die of radiation poisoning or flee for safer pastors. But Ross Harris definitely deserves recognition for his part as young Brad. Through him we are able to see how a child would deal with such an event and how the innocence of childhood is brought to a sharp end as Brad is forced to take the role of an adult for the sake of his family.After seeing 'Testament' I don't think I'll ever really stop pondering the issues it raised and how it is vitally important that the governments of all countries do anything and everything to ensure we never have to deal with such an event in real life. It is very thoughtprovoking and terrifying in a way no horror flick can be. And if you want to add to your trauma I recommend checking out 'Threads' the same situation only set in England and so chilling that it makes this film out to be a bag of laughs and 'The Day After'.".

And if you want to add to your trauma I recommend checking out 'Threads' the same situation only set in England and so chilling that it makes this film out to be a bag of laughs and 'The Day After'.";

I have to say that Testament will look more realistic to rural people who may just die slowly as the characters in this film do rather than be subjected to the immediate effects of the attack.Rebecca De Mornay's appearance in this film which I only saw after seeing By Dawn's Early Light makes a connection between these two films. Everyone should see both films at least once as well. Excellent performances from Rossie Harris and Mako make this film stand out even further.Having seen The Day After now I prefer Testament but find both films excellent.".

No mass hysteria violence rape disfigurement or any of those other factors that are paraded as horrifying in the majority of Nuclear War films  I am thinking specifically of Threads and The Day After Here.In Testament we actually see humanity. We see how one family one community copes with the devastation of just that  their family and their community.This is what is so tragic compelling and ultimately horrifying about this film. It is not a panache it is not a broad canvas. It is about people not about issues and as such the humanity shines through.I am not saying the other films aren't powerful in their way. They are  and both Threads and The Day After gave me nightmares. But Testament was so far beyond them in terms of simple courage and purpose. There was no grandiose no glamour or tacked on love story. This was not hollywood was life or the end of it and all the more frightening for it.Testament is one of the main reasons why we should see more women making politic films  and perhaps running a few more countries.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are times when we ask ourselves in our subconscious what if this or that happened what would we do how would we react how would we survive even though it may not have happen now who's to say it won't tomorrow. This film is one of those rare films that actually broke my heart and made me cry and it still does whenever I watch it again it's also a film you never forget.The film is tragedy about the aftermath and what we would do and behave knowing that the world we used to live in is gone. there are many things that I appreciate about this film for one thing there are never any special effects. We see no big explosion or any other graphic details instead it has a power of suggestion which actually works. We actually witness in documentary style what the end of the world could actually look like. From seeing long lines which take hours to wait to get groceries or even a tank of gas the need for batteries which is one of the last sources of power garbage is littered everywhere. But the two images that I found the most chilling were the breakdown in the Eco System from seeing the leaves and vegetation turn brown and red as well as the sky becoming darker from the dust the bombs spread and has blocked some of the sun and contaminating the air. The second image was seeing gravestones and crosses everywhere from back or front yards one neighborhood homes you would pass by. Down to the park and playground just seeing several gravestones behind a playground and an empty swing now swinging emptily just made my heart bleed knowing kids use to play there.But what makes the film work the most is the characters themselves whom all feel like real people both major and minor we actually get to know these people as if their people that could live in our neighborhood or pass by on the street. Were completely involved with these people and the significant moments that occur which can be touching and heartbreaking. From Carol Jane Alexander talking to her daughter Mary about love and sexuality which Mary will never experience seeing Scottie Lucas Haas burying his action figures and thinking of running away Carol watching a family film and listening to her husband's voice on an answering machine as if she's waiting for him to come back home. It even comes down to the minor characters and what happens around town community leader Leon Ames through his radio communication activities we get a sense of what happened to the world Phil Kevin Costner seeing him walk the sidewalk with a chest drawer to be used as a coffin for his baby down to seeing the elementary school play The Pied Piper which is a little ironic to the current situation since that play takes place in the years of The Black Plague an overwhelming catastrophe that cost hundreds of lives.However what makes the film all the more heartbreaking is there's a sense of familiarity to the film. The character Brad the oldest son I identify with because he is very much like myself when I was his age the town reminds me of the towns I lived in. Even seeing the final family film footage reminds me of some of the multiple family film tapes that were made with my family. In the end of the film as the final characters pass away it made me break down and cry for a long while just the knowledge knowing there was once a happy family with some happy memories are never going to be able to make any more. All these familiar things are things I don't think about too much but after seeing this film it made me think about how valuable all those little things really are to me.The lessons in this film are showing that no one wins in a nuclear war and the terrible results it produces. But mainly just how valuable life truly is and how little time we truly have to live it. These are lessons that should apply not just to our current era but the future in general.The family and other souls in this movie may pass away but will live in our hearts forever.Rating 4 stars".

Almost nothing related to the bombing is really seen on the screen but a blinding light for some seconds. No sound nothing. This movie is far away from The Day After this film is hopeless.There is no after! People die even if they do it in a gentle way. The subject of the movie is what does people leave after dying.

Then suddenly a nuclear war breaks out leaving her small town cut off from the main cities. The nuclear fallout that ensues starts killing the townspeople. Now Carol has to endure watching friends and neighbors succumb to radiation. This is made harder when her own children are affected and slowly begin to die away.Critique This is probably the bleakest most depressing postnuclear war film you're likely to see. But don't let that dissuade you. What makes the film so good is its authenticity it pulls no punches. If there is a nuclear war chances are that the few survivors will probably end up this way. The film's theme is in the effects it has in this smalltight knit community and how people try to coexist in such tragic situations. The memories of loved ones dying will slowly seem to fade away and the 'goodness' that they project is tragically wasted. Though the subject is very somber it is nonetheless handled in a way that is sympathetic and makes the viewer think about such politically charged issues.Financed and produced by American Playhouse a subsidiary of American Public Service TV and directed by Lynn Littman it's based on a short story 'The Last Testament' by Carol Amen.".

Lives interrupted in a way that's so frightening  subtly slowly yet devastating from the beginning. If it's the harshness of the towns people fighting over food and batteries and gasoline to the gentleness of the mother not really knowing how to answer the simple questions of her five year old  why does the milk taste funny? When is our refrigerator getting fixed? When is Dad coming home? Every moment of this film just grips your heart! I cry every time I see it! A small bit of trivia  Sierra Madre was also the location of the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Notice the scene is Testament where the batterytrading station is  that is Kersting Court which is the same place the trucks pulled up with the pods in Body Snatchers".

I think this film is vastly superior to The Day After which dealt with the same plot and came out at approximately the same time. I don't want to repeat what others have already said so eloquently. I just want to point out some highlights that demonstrate the structure and subtlety of this film by a highly regarded female director.CAUTION POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD At the start the town's children are practicing and eventually despite everything they do perform the play The Pied Piper of Hamlin. In that famous medieval story the children of the the town all disappear because of the shortsightedness and stubbornness of the adults. Think about that and you will see the connection here.When the movie begins the protagonist's biggest problem is obtaining an appropriate gift for her son's upcoming birthday. By the time the birthday arrives she is lucky that the child is even still alive.The handicapped JapaneseAmerican child Hiroshi has already been mentioned. But there is another reminder of World War II  the Elden female music teacher apparently an Orthodox Jewish Holocaust survivor.To me the single most heartbreaking moment in the film is when the screen goes to black and you hear the sound of cloth ripping. You know that the mother is tearing up bedsheets to make a shroud for her child.I wish that this film would be shown on television again  as soon as possible. I think some people in Washington need to see it.".

With the threat of Y2K looming near this didn't seem like a fairy tale.So what IS the problem with Testament?  Relentlessness.  I was physically exhausted and emotionally drained by the time the credits were finally rolling.  Pretty impressive for a movie only 89 minutes long!  It is a powerful horrible film.  I am still haunted by the dulleyed image of Jane Alexander going through the motions of yet another death in the house  too spent to break down.  It's a good movie but depressing as hell.

One of its strengths is how realistic it seems and all sort of filmmaking techniques from art direction to music to cinematography help make it so. It feels very much like we are looking in through the windows at this family as they face the biggest story in the history of humanity not in some inauthentic cable TVheadlinestype way but as actual human beings who need to eat take care of each other interact with neighbors and come to terms with their own sickness and inevitable death.Others here have told their favorite moments mine is the exchange between the mother and teenage daughter when the latter asks what lovemaking is like. It's such a quiet moment so bittersweet so understated just heartwrenching to watch. It hits you first that this child will never have that experience and you grieve for her loss. You realize the conversation would have never taken place without these extreme circumstances you admire the mother's explanation and then you realize that she is being confronted yet again with more proof that her children will not survive.For the record I am not a mother I don't typically feel very squishy about kids or family stories and my ideal of a personal hell would be to be forced to live in a small town and attend school plays and do PTA stuff while I wait for some man to come home from an interesting job...but that perspective did not stop this movie from touching me deeply. The protagonist's wouldn't be the life I chose but it is the life she choseuntil the warlovers in governments made a terrible choice for herand I felt utterly engaged by her desires and concerns by the tragedy and waste of her long years of hard work as a parent coming to naught.The lack of images of bombs falling and big special effects and the lack of political context adds to its verisimilitude rather than detracts from it. For if a giant asteroid hit or nuclear war happened and all communications were interrupted we'd none of us have a clue what exactly had happened. We wouldn't see images on CNN over and overthere'd be no more internet no CNN no global community. If our cars didn't work we'd know what was happening in about a ten square kilometer circle around us what we could wander about in a busy week and no further. And does it really matter who started it over what? Not when you are burying those you love.".

This is also my fave Ham Radio movie. I grew up in the Cold War and was a practicing survivalist in 1983. For a limited exchange viewed from a remote suburban area this is probably roughly accurate. In terms of accuracy The Day After was a joke. Whiteman AFB ICBM fields were still open back then  Kansas and Western Missouri would have been a glowing hole. I can only find a fault with Testament because I suspect the generally nauseating Physicians for Social Responsibility had a hand in the financial backing of the production. Possibly the most depressing film experience available deeply disturbing. No matter which side of silo lid you are on you have to give credit to the film a masterpiece.

In a Short Cuts like manner it introduces us to a girl who babysits her neighbour?s daughter whose father is a penniless writer on the verge of either fame or breakdown and who later on will come across a wouldbe femme fatale and her timid friend whose teenage son is undertaking first sexual steps with his girlfriend. The aforementioned babysitter gets an invitation to a gym where a gay man decides to make her his date for a salsa party organised by a handsome guy who had come by the gym earlier and so she the babysitter gives the girl to a friend of hers who will then happen across the mother of that child. Meanwhile the mother's flatmate decides to kill herself because her cheating btard of a boyfriend forgot about her birthday and meets an Italian on the roof who wants to kill himself because of his cheating btch of a girlfriend. Of course they fall in love right as they are hanging from her balcony several meters off the ground. No summary can do justice to the many plot convolutions of this film which are very entertaining. Did I mention that all of this happens on the day the Pope visits the city?".

	schema:reviewBody "Das merkwrdige Verhalten geschlechtsreifer Grostdter zur Paarungszeit or Love Scenes from Planet Earth an entirely different translation is a German movie in the German language by director Marc Rothemund. It was actually his very first full feature film so i am not really too surprised that he is still far far away from his best here namely from his Oscarnominated work. Anyway the script is by Peter Gersina and looking at the latter's other works this certainly is not helping Rothemund at all. Neither does it help the actors. The lead actor is played by Austrian Christoph Waltz quite a while before his Oscar glories. And it shows that not even everything he touches turns to gold. The cast list includes many many names that in my opinion do not have the talent that justifies the careers they are having. This applies to Hagen Kramer Korittke Dobra Landgrebe Landuris Schenke Hrbiger and probably more. Some of them scored through charisma during their careers but hardly anybody has put on display that he has actually convincing range and talent.Now with this weak cast and script the film was bound to become a disappointment and so it did. It is a mix of romance and comedy and the drama aspects with central characters dying apparently are never to be taken seriously. So this is one of the very few pros that the film does not try to be really relevant. At times it works as a bit of a guilty pleasure perhaps but at other times it all just feels so extremely absurd and over the top in the most desperate attempt you could imagine to actually make a difference and entertain the audience. So yeah this film's semipopularity can probably explained by the title and that it was enough to get several people to theaters and also with the successes of Rothemund and Waltz that many people still watch it today. Including myself. But does it deserve the attention? I personally would not say so. I never thought that it was a genuinely entertaining work and give it a thumbsdown. Not even Waltz's opening monologue was good enough to get anyone interested about what happened and why it happened. Luckily this thing stays comfortably under the 90minute mark. Watch something else.".

Malcolm's life becomes a horror as the killer starts to take it out on him for his overshadowing his actions which lead to Christine's kidnapping.

At one point he's smugly satisfied to have found himself to be so deeply involved in an emerging story of a sadistic serial killer then he snaps at the killer when events aren't turning out favorably. This doesn't seem like the emotional response you would expect from a seasoned reporter. A serial killer is doing something like this just to play with the heads of authority. To expect him to behave rationally is naive and foolish.However Russell gamely does generally well with the character and there are effectively troubling and suspenseful aspects to the film. The subject of newspaper ethics is broached and discussed although I'm not sure all that effectively.Andy Garcia Richard Bradford and Richard Masur were excellent.Mariel Hemingway was absolutely terrible. She either was giggling looking completely bewildered or hysterical. Granted the script gave her little else to do but a creative actress could have made something out of it.

The Mean Season is taken from a novel entitled In The Heat Of The Summer by John Katzenbach whose other books include Just Cause later filmed with Sean Connery. The film is a fairly engrossing if familiar serial killer story set in Florida just as the summer ends and the stormy season begins.Miami Journal reporter Malcolm Anderson Russell writes a piece about the murder of a woman. Malcolm is getting bored of his job at the Journal and plans to move to pastures new with his girlfriend teacher Christine Connelly Mariel Hemingway. However he receives a mysterious phone call from the murderer congratulating him on his report and informing him of several more murders that he intends to carry out. Seems the killer wants to use Malcolm as his conduit to the public. More murders follow as promised and each time Malcolm is given exclusive information from the killer. Soon Malcolm is the toast of the journalistic world  every reporter wants his story every TV station wants to interview him and there's even talk of him being nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. But the psycho at the centre of the whole business is enraged that his acts are being overlooked in favour of Malcolm's newfound celebrity status. And so he plans to teach Malcolm a lesson.....There's a little suspense in the story especially when the unseen killer is on the phone to Malcolm. Also the gradual disintegration of Malcolm and Christine's relationship he's seduced by the media spotlight she wants him to end his liaisons with the murderer adds a further layer to the story. The main problem with The Mean Season is that its secondhalf drifts into the kind of silliness that the first half is so careful to avoid. After setting up an exciting and intriguing premise this comes as a disappointment. The killer who has been ruthlessly efficient to this point suddenly becomes sloppy and tries to make his murders ludicrously elaborate even though the story has already made it obvious that he's supposed to be unswervingly coldblooded. Also the film can't resist one of those clichd endings  a final frisson if you like which has been an overused device since Carrie 1976  in which the killer returns from the dead to terrorise his victims one final time. The Mean Season is an OK thriller but frustratingly it never quite becomes the firstrate movie that it might have been.".

	schema:reviewRating 7;
	schema:headline " Gripping thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the John Katzenbach story In the Heat of the Summer this Floridalensed crime thriller does hold ones' attention with its straightforward telling of an interesting tale. Kurt Russell is aces as Malcolm Anderson a star reporter for the Miami Journal who is contacted by a murderous psychopath Richard Jordan who has killed once and who promises that there will be other murders. The killer who craves the spotlight decides to use Anderson as his mouthpiece creating a very uneasy collaboration between killer and reporter. Things start to really turn South when Anderson starts getting the bulk of the attention leaving the killer feeling resentful. This is a solid setup for a movie that ultimately does indeed lose a fair deal of its impact by turning conventional for its final act but until then it's solidly entertaining with the performances of Russell and Jordan serving as effective anchors. The give and take between their two characters is compelling stuff and it's a good thing that Anderson isn't treated as some typically infallible movie hero. The supporting cast is mostly strong Mariel Hemingway as Anderson's schoolteacher girlfriend Christine is appealing as she always is but her character has little to do besides look and act concerned and eventually be put into peril. Richard Masur reunited along with producers Lawrence Turman and David Foster with Russell after The Thing is Anderson's editor Andy Garcia in one of his earliest movie roles and Richard Bradford are the weary detectives on the case Joe Pantoliano is a photographer and the almighty movie tough guy William Smith appears briefly as a character supplying critical information. The Miami setting adds a lot of ambiance especially as the storms start coming up towards the end of the story. Lalo Schifrin's music is also highly effective. Even in light of the clichd climactic confrontation there is some enjoyable resonance to The Mean Season as it deals with the big issue of journalistic culpability and the role that the media play in our receipt of the news. An overall grim feel to the presentation and an atmospheric opening are also assets in this generally good if not great and reasonably convincing movie. Seven out of 10.".

However Mariel Hemmingway makes a fool of herself with her overacting in the end. Well at least she shows her tits in the requisite early shower scene gotta' get that R rating after all.

	schema:headline " Russell's terrific but this is mostly an average thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of  I must admit to having a particular fondness for the glut of crime thrillers that lasted from the late 80s to the mid90s. Chief among these guilty pleasures are fun movies like Harold Becker's Malice the horribly titled Jack's Back the Goldie Hawn flick Deceived and the terrific Jagged Edge. 1985's The Mean Season is apparently one of the earlier entries in the beginning of this trend so it earns a few points there otherwise it's a pretty average effort certainly not helped by far superior films of its ilk in the years to come.Kurt Russell stars as Malcolm Anderson a Miami journalist who's getting burnedout covering eight years worth of deaths. Just as he's planning to leave his job behind and move with his girlfriend Mariel Hemingway to Colorado his latest assignment takes him on a wild spin. While covering the murder of a teenage girl he receives a phone call from the girl's killer himself who reveals that he plans to take four more victims. This soontobe serial killer is out for fame and wants Anderson to report his crimes and whatever bits of info he chooses to give him. But as the murders progress the killer is dissatisfied with the media coverage believing too much of the focus is on Anderson and as he sees it the only way this can be remedied is by eliminating the center of attention.Though the film is ultimately mediocre it does get off to an effective start. The premise is fairly interesting and an instant grabber. The filmmakers' do a good job of building some mild suspense by keeping the killer's face hidden the voice acting for this particular character is also quite effective occasionally reminding me of the similar voice work in Joy Ride.But the movie never really takes off like it should. Though we're intrigued by the bits and pieces of info that are revealed by the killer very little is ultimately revealed about his motives or his past. While this is an approach that often works The Silence of the Lambs and Seven are perfect examples it backfires in this case primarily because one of the more intriguing mysteries is wondering why he's duplicating these certain murders a lot of hints are given but trying to piece them together doesn't add up to any satisfying answers.Once the killer's face is revealed a lot of the movie's charm is worn off. The guy was creepy as a voice that nobody could match a face to but feels like a generic psycho once he's fully revealed. The film also fails to take advantage of the stormy weather that's promised in the title what could have been an instance of great visual atmosphere is totally squandered. The same goes for the Everglades setting which I've always found had a tinge of dread and mystery to it.For the most part the cast is quite good especially Kurt Russell who's one of the few movie stars out there who can exhibit a perfect balance of charisma and emotional intensity which he does here. He's always likable even when we think his character could use a little more common sense. A freshfaced Andy Garcia turns in solid support as the investigating police detective. Only Mariel Hemingway comes across as subpar but it doesn't help that her role amounts to little more than playing damsel in distress. One also wonders why Anderson and his girlfriend weren't given stronger police protection but that's probably just for the sake of moving the plot ahead.Middling stuff overall but watchable enough to be worth a viewing for Russell fans or if you're like me you just like to watch this kind of Hollywood thriller from the 80s and early 90s. But as far as this genre goes all the flicks I mentioned above are preferable to this.".

Andy Garcia makes a very strong impression and he is perfectly paired with Richard Bradford who reminds me so much of my 1st stepfather an ex Marine Corps drill instructor turned copthat i have absolutely no trouble believing him in the role of a burned out bitter homicide detective. Mariel Hemingway is awful as always. A truly terrible actress.The direction by Philip Borsos is very tight. His framing and cutting remind of Hitchcock there is a certain stylish elegance to the images each of the killings is filmed with a minimum of blood but to maximum stylistic effect and all in all the plot hurtles forward at just the right level of intensity. I will admit that there are 2 examples of ridiculous false scares in the film which were apparently studiomandatedno surprise reallyand I guess I should deduct points for that and Lalo Shifrin's sometimes bombastic scorebut I am not going to... because after 21 years of mostly pale imitators The Mean Season is looking better and better with age.".

Sadly the technical aspects of the piece far outweigh its substance for The Mean Season brings nothing new to a constantly tired genre even allowing for it being a mid eighties piece the turns in the plot had been done to death long before this Kurt Russell effort hit the screens. Highlight in the picture is a fine bad guy turn from Richard Jordan genuine menace portrayed from his voice work to his actual psychical acting but sadly the script fails to let his character get fully into evil territory. There is a reason that something like Se7en nine years later became such a popular movie because it's bringing new stuff to the table a serial killer film to get under your skin all The Mean Season does is scratch the surface and after it's more than great first quarter that is a major let down. 510".

There isn't any great style but has a good sense of impending doom. That probably has more to do with Richard Jordan's voice. The stormy weather motif also adds to the dark tones. It builds to a good stormfilled climax. There isn't much of a plot or an investigation. I do like the hardboiled sensibilities a lot even if the movie is filled with those clichs.

So it's like old home week watching this film.A good companion piece would be Russell's Breakdown.As with previous users I agree that the movie falls apart in the final reel. A major annoyance is the rush by Kurt to protect his girlfriend at her school being that the killer has informed Kurt that he is already there. Why doesn't anyone use the phone? Or radio police immediately? Granted the police arrive at the same time Kurt does but why were they delayed? He had run half of the way BY FOOT!Earlier in the film it is likely police would have placed surveillance on Kurt's home immediately after the killer had contacted him at his newspaper office.Supporting characters are wellacted although the female reporter sidekick appears an afterthought  perhaps her role was originally larger.Miami Vice was also filming at the time so it was an exciting time to be a film school student in the same city.No not a noir by any definition.".

It was practically announced that the crazy was going to snatch the reporter's girlfriend before this went its course and of course he did. Why oh why I asked myself did this intelligent educated and wellinformed man allow his girlfriend to stay in a flimsy house that has a front door that barely stays closed with this guy on the loose and always looking for a closer connection to the reporter. And of course they couldn't resist the final scene. Like all teenage horror films this one had to have that inevitable final snapper.

What starts as off as provocatively stimulating where the killer contacts Russell's newspaper reporter character to offer him the chance to become his link to the media  informing him about the murders before anyone else knows about it only goes on to be your normal predictable run of the mill psycho thriller where revenge threats for stealing the limelight away and kidnapping becomes the focal point. Early on the phone calls between the reporter and the killer drills out some suspense and it opens up the ambitious nature of the media and at what cost you would go to cement a story with the close ties that are formed. This is seen to be a big breakthrough for Russell's burntout character until it starts to affect everything around him namely that with his fiance Hemingway and instead of reporting it he eventually becomes the news. Set during the middle of Miami's stormriddled summer it's engulfed by a humid atmosphere and music scorer Lalo Schfrin cooks up one excellently saucy and characteristically unhinged score that blends right in.

Unless you're 5 years old you shouldn't be scared. The scenes of violence lack tension. The movie tries to be psychological  but fails. The red herring at the end was pathetic.The acting is OK.

Andy Garcia in his debut appearance is Ray Martinez a police detective. William Smith is Albert O'Shaughnessy a veteran counselor and is surprisingly good in the small role. But it is Russell who despite his best with his character is less than convincing. The story line is clear cut and chasing Jordon proves elusive.

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely a thriller.  And one of the reasons why is Richard Jordan who plays the psychopath Alan Delour.  He is so convincing he is absolutely frightening.  Especially his last scenes he gives me shivers every time I watch him.  He was definitely one of the finest actors that ever was and when he passed away we lost a great talent.  Kurt Russell also did a find job as Malcolm Anderson and the two worked really well together.".

Mariel Hemingway was a good choice she hasn't been in much lately.  I think she is still pretty.  Well Kurt does a good job. This is worth seeing and its from 1985.  It has violence language and nudity.".
