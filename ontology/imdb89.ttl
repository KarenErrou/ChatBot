His scenes with Herbert Lom as his son are so good they go far beyond the plane of mere acting.

When he meets the famous GrecoRoman wrestler Gregorius the Great Stanislaus Zbyszko in the arena of his son and the wrestling lord Kristo Herbert Lorn he plans a scheme to become successful. He cheats Greorious promising clean combats in his own arena and the old man accepts the partnership. However without money to promote the fight he invites his boss and owner of a nightclub Phil Nosseross Francis L. Sullivan to be his partner but is betrayed and his business fails ending in a tragedy.Night and the City is a great filmnoir with many twists and another excellent performance of Richard Widmark. The story shows the underworld of London with lowlives hustlers beggars gamblers and other amoral characters through a magnificent black and white cinematography. The direction of Jules Dassin is sharp and the screenplay perfectly develops the characters and the story in an excellent pace.

	onyx:emotionText "In London the swindler Harry Fabian Richard Widmark is an ambitious loser frequently taking money from his girlfriend Mary Bristol Gene Tierney. When he meets the famous GrecoRoman wrestler Gregorius the Great Stanislaus Zbyszko in the arena of his son and the wrestling lord Kristo Herbert Lorn he plans a scheme to become successful. He cheats Greorious promising clean combats in his own arena and the old man accepts the partnership. However without money to promote the fight he invites his boss and owner of a nightclub Phil Nosseross Francis L. Sullivan to be his partner but is betrayed and his business fails ending in a tragedy.Night and the City is a great filmnoir with many twists and another excellent performance of Richard Widmark. The story shows the underworld of London with lowlives hustlers beggars gamblers and other amoral characters through a magnificent black and white cinematography. The direction of Jules Dassin is sharp and the screenplay perfectly develops the characters and the story in an excellent pace.

It may be that this American expatriot character is just way out of his depth. His hucksterism is not much appreciated by many of his acquaintances in this seedy London underworld. If Harry Fabian would simply accept that he is destined to be a 3rd rate shill and stoogehe might have fund some small pleasures. However his mind is a shade too quick and his ambition too pumped.

Starring are Richard Widmark Gene Tierney Googie Withers Hebert Lom Francis L. Sullivan Mike Mazurki  Stanislaus Zbyszko. The score is composed by Franz Waxman and Max Greene is the cinematographer. It's shot on location in London England.Harry Fabian Widmark is a hopeless dreamer a twobit hustler who aspires to make it big and never want for money again. Over hearing retired wrestling superstar Gregorius Zbyszko bemoaning the fake wrestling bouts put on by his underworld son Kristo Lom Fabian hatches a plan to set up his own wrestling empire backed by Gregorius. Thus he be safe from retribution from Kristo and his heavies. That is as long as Fabian does right by Gregorius and doesn't abuse his trust. Things get complicated tho as Fabian needs money to back the venture money he hasn't got. So systematically he drags into the equation his girlfriend Mary Bristol Tierney club owner Phil Nosseross Sullivan and Sullivan's wife Helen Withers. Pretty soon things start to spiral out of control.Night and the City has been called many things from baroque masterpiece to being a turgid pictorial grotesque! Polar opposite reactions that have now over time dovetailed into a majority agreement from film noir purists that it is indeed one special piece of film noir movie making. The film opens in quite an unassuming way as the title sequence brings views of leisurely London then Dassin does a voiceover telling us that The night is tonight tomorrow night or any night. The city is London. We then cut to a man on the run pursued by a person unknown. The man being chased is Harry Fabian sharply attired in suit and hat he has left pictorial London and is now running thru bomb afflicted London thru murky alleyways. Until sanctuary comes at his girlfriend's tidy flat the contrast between the two worlds of Harry Fabian neatly marrying American film noir with British kitchen sinkism.However that sanctuary is a rare ray of hope in Dassin's movie a cunning trick by the makers for Night and the City is ultimately a dark and brooding picture one that deals in corruption  paranoia with a pervading sense of doom hanging heavy like a death warrant issued by some heavy underworld crime lord. The characters in this part of London are mainly blank personalities cold and calculating crooked and immoral. That Fabian is only a lesser light on the lower rung of this seamy ladder is irrelevant because he aspires to become just the same only richer. Duplicity and betrayal are things he's happy to jump in bed with and we the audience are part of it as we view this story thru Fabian's hopeless and oblivious eyes.Yet the movie in spite of its uncompromising story is by turns exciting  pacey even breath taking driven by one of the finest scores put down in film noir as Waxman prods and probes with pulse beats and deft ear clangers. With Greene's expressionistic and daring photography blending seamlessly with the mood crafted by director and composer alike. The cast are mostly strong with Widmark Zbyszko  Withers actually terrific the latter involved in a superb wrestling sequence with Mazurki. At times heart pounding at others wince inducingif you find yourself holding your breaththen that's OK it has that effect on many. Tierney was cast as a favour to Darryl Zanuck who was worried about Tierney's mental health at the time. She looks radiant and offers up an interesting counterpoint to all the darkness within the story. Dassin spoke very favourably of her work on the film saying she was no trouble at all and a consummate professional.As for Dassin himself? Well he was thanks to the HUAC outcry about to be out of work and on the run. He moved to Europe and never worked in America again he returned from film making exile five years later where he would make the much revered Rififi in France. A truly excellent director capable of pacing a film to precision and holding an audience in an atmospheric vice like grip. Night and the City is his masterpiece and it is also one of film noir's greatest treasures. 1010".

I wasn't born until the Cold War was winding down but it seems that with movies like Night and the City to his credit we could have turned a blind eye even if he really was a Commie.Honestly this film deserves to rank up there with the likes of The Maltese Falcon Double Indemnity or Out of the Past. The scenes of our hero Harry Fabian Richard Widmark at his best being chased through London's East End are as starkly beautiful as anything you'll ever see on film. For several minutes there isn't a single shade of gray everything is literally black or white and the camera itself seems to have joined in hunting Harry. Then there's the long semigrotesque wrestling scene that took me totally by surprise it's like something out of Fellini.Widmark is utterly believable as Fabian a charming twobit grifter who works as a club tout but hatches one illfated getrichquick scheme after another. The rest of the cast is excellent as well there isn't a cardboard character in the bunch except maybe Harry's girl Marry Gene Tierney though its really more a flaw in the character than the actress. Mary's saintliness may be the writers' only slipup though every other character has the sort of depth that makes the film a joy to watch. They inexorably follow their own motivations which of course rely on those of someone else who inevitably has a goal of his or her own which will eventually derail the plan of someone whom someone else is counting on actually the film is a little less twisted than this review  Criterion has just 205 recently released Night and the City and never has the phrase filmed in glorious black and white been more appropriate. Before this film seemed to lurk in the shadows of AMC or TCM only occasionally showing its face as if it were one of the genre's minor works.

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine Charles Dickens had to make a bit of extra money by writing Bmovies in Hollywood and you might get close to imagining this haunting wonderful film. It fuses the best traditions of film noir with a very British atmosphere a cast of character actors playing vividly drawn and desperate people.There's a mournful tone to the whole film like a boat's siren drifting across a foggy Thames. All the characters seem to be reaching for their hearts desire wanting to believe in a dream of a better tomorrow in something that's real and true for them. But they rip into each other trying to get there. That gives the film a poignant tragic trajectory.A compelling central performance by Richard Widmark as Harry Fabian a man with flair and drive and an infectious hope but a man who lacks something like the moral fibre to be honest. A man always looking for a shortcut. A nearlygreat man an almost classically tragic figure. Googie Withers is a revelation as Helen a woman who seems cynical but has hopes and dreams just like Fabian just like all our characters.So much I haven't even mentioned the sweaty muscular wrestling scenes are are action scenes of the best kind in that they drive and skew the plot as well as holding our attention. So many good performances. And a film that speaks to our hopes and our flaws and the tragic spaces between the two.Any Londoner or person who loves the atmosphere of that city should check it out too some lovely old footage of Trafalgar Square and Picadilly.".

	schema:reviewBody "It took a second look for me to enjoy this movie as it didn't really appeal much to me on the first viewing. Perhaps a better picture helped. If I had the Criterion DVD it would be much better I'm sure but for now I'll have to settle for the VHS. This is a very noirish with a lot of dark scenes so a good transfer is a must.Most of the action takes place at night in London alleyways nightclubs and gymnasiums. The storyline is a downer that's for sure. It is a rough and sometimes depressing story. Richard Widmark as Harry Fabian has the starring role and plays a real loser a desperate man who always has a scheme concocted but usually messes up. Some critics think this is Widmark's best performance ever. Francis Sullivan is interesting as the nightclub owner. Gene Tierney gets second billing but doesn't have much of role in here.Some memorable scenes include a wrestling match with big Mike Mazurki and Gregorious. I'm not much into wrestling but this was an amazing match extremely intense.This film is a bit different from most Americanbased film noirs. It's not a pleasant story it's moody and it has a certain fascination to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more films I see by Jules Dassin the more I wonder why he isn't better known or regarded as a director. It's been 56 years since he was blacklisted by the McCarthyites but his reputation never seems to have recovered at least not in the United States. Hopefully more DVD releases like the Criterion version of Night and the City will bring deserved attention to his excellent body of work.I want to call Night and the City a classic film noir which it is but that seems too limiting. It might be better to say that Dassin uses film noir to dig a little deeper into our human strivings and sufferings. There's a lot of sweat and desperation in the midst of this entertaining and wellpaced film and not just on the part of Harry Fabian the smalltime hustler who dreams of being great. We encounter a typically smooth and dangerous mobster who also happens to have a difficult relationship with his disappointed father. A wealthy but thugish club owner who might be a caricature in another film noir can't seem to express his powerful and animalistic feelings for his beautiful wife. She seems like a scheming femme fatale but turns out to have an almost quaint dream of her own. In the end we're in the muck and mire of human foibles a kind of lowlevel Shakespearean tragedy that we all live out to one degree or another. This story just happens to take place in the shadowy underworld of 1950 London.There's a poignancy to this film that separates it from others in the noir genre. Part of this lies in the strong writing part in the excellent acting ensemble. This is one of those rare and remarkable films where the secondary and minor actors seem like they were all giving the performance of their career. Richard Widmark probably could have done with a bit more subtlety as Harry Fabian he feels a bit histrionic at times but his manic energy is important to the pace of the film and the feeling of increasing desperation. Gene Tierney and Hugh Marlowe don't get to do much and seem a bit lost among all the other great roles. In an interview with Dassin included with the DVD the director says he put Tierney in the film as a favor to producer Daryl Zanuck adding her role at the last minute and it feels like that at times. But hey it's Gene Tierney.Herbert Lom delivers a chilling performance as Kristo the mobster and Stanislaus Zbyszko is a miracle as his father the oncefamous wrestler Gregorious who can't stand that his son has helped kill the great tradition of GrecoRoman wrestling with his shoddy wrestling matches. The great Mike Mazurki does well as The Strangler and the wrestling match he gets into with Gregorious may be the highlight of the film. Zbyszko and Mazurki were both former wrestlers and the realism of their fight heightens the emotional intensity of the scene. It's the brutal scruff and claw of existence brought to life on screen for a few powerful moments.I had never seen Francis Sullivan before so I was pleasantly surprised by his masterful work as the club owner Nosseross. Googie Withers also does a great job as his wife Helen managing to bring some good shading to an underwritten role. And some of the best moments of the film are delivered by minor characters such as Anna the woman who works down on the docks Figler the King of the Beggars and Googin the forger.After a brief voiceover intro Dassin starts the action with a bang as one man chases another through the darkness of latenight London across what looks like the plaza in front of the British Museum ???. The camera angle on this opening is fantastic the kind of shot you want to turn into a poster and hang on your wall. And the camera work remains excellent throughout the film. The final long sequence of Harry running all over London in the foggy darkness with the whole world seemingly after him is an exciting and powerful climax. Quite a memorable ending to this excellent film.".

And around him are character actors wrestlers and a very secondary lead Gene Tierney all playing vivid sharply chiseled characters. But it's Widmark's movie and he is convincing when thrilled and when beaten down. We see how he believes in himself and how disillusioned he appears to others. And London at night filled with dead ends and narrow alleys is ominous and glistening. The plot is interwoven and not at all simple but thanks to an ongoing logic supplied by American director Jules Dassin it is never confusing just increasingly interesting.The photography and associated lighting has to be admired even by people used to great noir filming. The shadows here are dark but always with a hint of detailnone of the total inky blackness blanking out large parts of the scene as in some American noirs. It's really a matter of great finesse to pull this off with such consistency and it makes the movie a visual masterpiece. Cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum Max Greene is barely known outside of this film so perhaps we can give Dassin a lot of the credit for the look and the really dynamic framing of so much of it.We don't usually associate British films with great film noir styling but here is one of the best though the two leads Widmark and Tierney and the director are American and this was officially a 20th Century Fox production. This comes just a year after that other great British noir of this period The Third Man with strong British creds but again American leading actors. If you like Night and the City and you almost have to it's really amazing stuff you'll definitely like Thieve's Highway.And Widmark? My opinion of him only grows over time. It's easy to typecast him in your head the way you might Robert Mitchum but both actors have extraordinary presence of depth on the screen. Here you might get the best of Widmark.".

	schema:reviewBody "Night and the City was the final film for Jules Dassin in the U.S. before being blacklisted. He eventually moved to France but didn't make another film until 1955. Though he is best remembered for the films he did with his wife Melina Mercouri this is one of his great movies a very gritty film noir with London as its background.Richard Widmark plays Harry Fabian a lowlife con man who makes money as a tout for a club i.e. he seeks out male tourists and gets them to spend their money there. The club is owned by Phil Nosseross Francis L. Sullivan and his wife Helen who hates her husband and wants to start her own business. Working there is Fabian's girlfriend Gene Tierney who loves him in spite of the fact that he's constantly borrowing or stealing money from her.Harry hits on a scheme to break into wrestling promotion in London. Unfortunately Kristo Herbert Lom has it sewn up. Though his father Stanislaus Zbyszko a reallife wrestler was a great wrestling champion doing GrecoRoman boxing Kristo does not promote it. This has actually caused a rift between father and son and Harry moves right in. With the elder Kristo on his side Harry gets his chance to promote GrecoRoman wrestling. He gets the needed money by promising Helen that he will get her a license to open her business though the building supposedly can't be licensed for another year. The results of Harry's project lead to tragedy as he brings everybody down with him.Filmed in black and white only adds to the grittiness of Night and the City as Harry runs through London. The film moves as swiftly as he does leading to the inevitable but exciting climax.This was a powerhouse role for Richard Widmark who is a slimy desperate and fasttalking Harry. The problem with Harry is he's really not that good of a con man. He's sloppy. He can get guys into the club but that's about it. He rubs the wrong people the wrong way and he makes everyone angry until finally he's a complete untouchable as Kristo chases after him. Widmark gives us a perfect portrait. Tierney is in the film only at the request of Zanuck who wanted to distract her from her personal problems she has a surprisingly small role. Herbert Lom is fantastic as Kristo. Stanislaus Zbyszko whom Dassin sought out gives a poignant performance as Gregorius the Great. The wonderfully talented Googie Withers is great as the cold and sophisticated Helen. You totally believes she loathes her husband. And Sullivan's Nesseros is easy to loathe as a wealthy worm who plays both ends against the middle to destroy Fabian. They all end up destroying themselves.Apparently this film did not get appropriate distribution or something because it's a great film now out on DVD and very few people know it. Hopefully like Nightmare Alley another film that was illserved by Hollywood it will continue to gain in cult status. It deserves to be seen.".

Stanislaus Zbyszko whom Dassin sought out gives a poignant performance as Gregorius the Great. The wonderfully talented Googie Withers is great as the cold and sophisticated Helen. You totally believes she loathes her husband. And Sullivan's Nesseros is easy to loathe as a wealthy worm who plays both ends against the middle to destroy Fabian. They all end up destroying themselves.Apparently this film did not get appropriate distribution or something because it's a great film now out on DVD and very few people know it. Hopefully like Nightmare Alley another film that was illserved by Hollywood it will continue to gain in cult status. It deserves to be seen.";

He is in a category of his own when it comes to making a film that makes use of the city as well as capture the feel of a city. This is black and white film making at its peak. Not a bad performance in it. This was obviously an AngloAmerican production from 20th Century Fox so it is a mystery why it has been kept such a well kept secret. It certainly has all the credentials of a film noir classic. I would put this one up there with Out of the Past Odd Man Out Third Man DOA Double Indemnity and others.".

The taut fastpaced plot takes us to the seedy back streets and dingy nightclubs of post worldwar two London where twobit street hustler Harry Fabian scrounges for a life of ease and plenty. Richard Widmark brings a frenetic energy to his role as Harry. He plays Fabian as a highstrung bundle of nerves never missing a beat as Harry's mood swings run the gauntlet from giddy hysteria to suicidal despair.Harry impresses with his sharp sports coats and slick banter but the big score always seems to elude his grasp. He stumbles into a scheme to succeed as a bigtime wrestling promoter but can't swing the deal for lack of cash. Girlfriend Mary Gene Tierney is a jaded barmaid still longing for a decent life. She's heard it all before and refused to help. Double dealing business partner Phil Francis Sullivan sees Harry as a foolish but dangerous rival  one who must be stopped. Phil's wife Helen Googie Withers plays the seductive vamp planning to use Harry for her own purposes. Fabian finally meets his nemesis when he runs afoul of Kristo Herbert Lom the local wrestling kingpin.While there is no gunplay we still get plenty of action and suspense. The theme of the film is summed up in a brutal wrestling match where the truth and beauty of GrecoRoman wrestling is pitted against the cheap and phony modern style. The finale sees Harry lurching through the urban landscape unable to outrun his pursuers or his selfloathing. For one brief moment he teeters on the edge of redemption but in the end he can't avoid his fated destiny.Night and the City is notable for its wonderful noir mood and atmosphere. Director Jules Dassin sets the tone right from the opening credits where flickering titles printed in tiny neon lights blink out from the fogshrouded London night. Shot on location in moody black  white cinematography the movie exudes a hard and gritty realism. Tilted camera angles and shadowy lighting place us smack in the center of Harry's corrupt and desperate world.A recent DVD release should result in more exposure for this seldom seen gem. Night and the City stands as a fine introduction to the filmnoir genre as well as a mustsee for the hardcore fan. Recommended.".

If the traditional Western is about escape from a fixed identity than Fabian's quest is as is appropriate to such an interior urban genre as the crime film its opposite  he wants to stop running to earn a fixed place a recognisable identity to be treated with respect to be somebody.But in the first ten minutes he is a divided man.  Scrounging cash from his unbelievably tolerant girlfriend Mary oh yes she shows him a photo of their past an idyllic picture of harmony on a rowing boat presumably on some pleasant English river.  Harry has fallen from this pastoral paradise he has moved from this fixed frozen image to a lift of constant movement where to stop is to die assuming and casting off identities as he goes. The film's negative drive is very similar to Godard's 'A Bout De Souffle' and like Michel Poiccard Harry is a dead man A Maxwell's Demon of energy and information overloading hurtling into inertia.Although the film comes within the description of film noir it's rise and fall narrative more properly belongs to the 30s gangster genre and Harry is like a man out of time.  His bluster quickthinking energy and absurd sense of style he stops n the middle of lifethreatening flight to pick up his fallen buttonhole would be thoroughly appropriate in the worlds of 'Scarface' or 'The Public Enemy'.  But film noir in an interior subjective genre the laws are less easily manipulable everyone's looking out for himself.  Harry doesn't even rise very high  although he almost convinces you that he does  he gets as far as the rehearsal stage for the big drama that will be his success.The figures of drama seep through the film from Mary's singing to an audience to the extraordinary wrestling rite that sparks off the action climax.  This fight is extraordinary as the film changes registers changes from one plot to another with Harry marginalised in his own drama moved from playwright and actor to impotent observer.  Because throughout Harry is the former willing events dreams even people into existence performing a constant series of roles adapting for the different audiences even playacting a crucial narrative plot point getting Gregorius to fight the Strangler.  This further splits the already divided Harry  the man of public performances has nothing left for himself  he is indeed a dead man.'Night' is about 34 a masterpiece.  Unusually for a noir which often forsook coherent narrative for 'meaningful' spectacle it is an exciting action film full of unbearable suspense and good chases.  The filming of London after the initial jolt of a spiv hero with an American accent is unparalelled its seedy underworld given a gothicDickenisan intensity all shadows Chineseboxlike interiors and grotesques  Francis L. Sullivan as Phil Nosseross half Satan half sympathetic cuckold is outstanding.  The mechanics of underworld commerce club touting hostesses etc. is brilliantly done and more economically than 'Casino' as well as sociologically important showing that the film is about much more than a man's downfall.Anyone who knows Jules Dassin from his interminable Melina Mercouri films may be surprised by the level of invention here  the bursting lurching miseenscene threatening to explode at any moment full of overspilling wide angles masses of intrusive decor brilliant composition in which mise en scene ironically frames and imprisons characters who think they've all the freedom or the placing of characters in space to reveal their true power.  Franz Waxman's score is a neurotic marvel full of sudden shards of lightening.  Best of all is Widmark's astounding performance a seedy Jerry Maguire full of talk and promises hiding inner terror and emptiness charming and cocky at the right times shockingly paralysingly brutal when he needs to be.The last quarter is a little disappointing with its codpsychological 'explanations' of the end diluting the hero's potency although the 'revelation' of past here mirrors the photo at the beginning and the Willy Loman'Angels with Dirty Faces' stretch for redemption is a bit much.  But the ending is bravely downbeat  this is a rare Hays Code era film that allows the villain go unpunished.".

This is film noir and film noir doesn't look too kindly upon those who dream bigger than is good for them.

Only in the sad betrayed eyes of Gene Tierney  regrettably underused in this film  does Dassin appear to find virtue and so he offers her an alternative to the damned Fabian. Mary fittingly ends the film in the arms of an ordinary but dependable artist Hugh Marlowe.Filmed onlocation in London by cinematographer Max Greene 'Night and the City' has an incredibly gritty realistic immediacy. Too often in American noir it's only too clear that the characters are tramping through a studiobuilt set in which one doesn't expect there to be any unpleasant surprises. Conversely Dassin's decision to film in the shadowy city streets recreates that uncertain sense of dread one feels when trudging alone through an unfamiliar urban locale exposed to the elements and whoever might happen to cross your path. The film was shot while Dassin was facing being blacklisted from Hollywood for his alleged affiliations with the Communist Party he was betrayed to the HUAC by fellow noir directors Edward Dmytryk and Frank Tuttle leading a nervous Darryl F. Zanuck to urge shoot the expensive scenes first. The American likely took some stylistic inspiration from Carol Reed's 'Odd Man Out 1947' and 'The Third Man 1949  both of which concern wanted men who are betrayed by those they thought close to them. Reed in turn probably took wrestling inspiration for his own 'A Kid for Two Farthings 1955.'Jules Dassin passed away on March 31 2008 having reestablished his directing career in Europe with the stellar heist movie 'Rififi 1955.' Just one week earlier star Richard Widmark also checked out having lived a substantially fuller life than his onscreen persona. Widmark's manic performance is an interesting and multifaceted one. Perfectly in tune with the character of Harry Fabian nothing Widmark says sounds entirely convincing. There's always the slightest trace that he's bluffing  feigning toughness or otherwise stalling for time. He really is like a kid with ADHD bouncing about with too much energy to spare and no worthwhile endeavour in which to invest it. Fabian's doom is never in any doubt. The spectre of death hovers above him for most of the film but he stubbornly refuses to relent from his final grab at being a somebody. Like a dead man walking he goes through the motions still trying to convince himself that this time he can win. He doesn't deserve and doesn't receive any sense of nobility even in death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jules Dassin bid American cinema adieu with Night and the City after he was blacklisted by the dreaded HUAC committee and what an adieu that was. A hardboiled film noir taking place in seedy morally bankrupt London that deserves a place in the noir pantheon along such gems as The Third Man and Double Indemnity.Night and the City chronicles the life and ambitions of smalltime hustler Harry Fabian played perfectly by Richard Widmark a man full of plans for breaking big and delusions of grandeur much to the amusement of his boss and the dismay of his girlfriend. Dassin takes us through the fascinating underworld of London as Fabian tries to score big in the wrestling ring using his competitor's father to make a name and money for himself. Through a series of encounters and lots of scheming he will find himself in a very strange position. Like an obese cabaret owner comments he has it all but he's a dead man.It's near impossible to find flaws with this movie. From the inspired script to the very tight plotting with never a dull moment to the grim black and white cinematography that uses London's dreary streets as another character that comments on the action and mood Night and the City is a truly fascinating glimpse in a kind of cinema long gone. A classic film noir gem that excels in both what it presents to the viewer and what it leaves to the imagination.

	onyx:emotionText "Jules Dassin bid American cinema adieu with Night and the City after he was blacklisted by the dreaded HUAC committee and what an adieu that was. A hardboiled film noir taking place in seedy morally bankrupt London that deserves a place in the noir pantheon along such gems as The Third Man and Double Indemnity.Night and the City chronicles the life and ambitions of smalltime hustler Harry Fabian played perfectly by Richard Widmark a man full of plans for breaking big and delusions of grandeur much to the amusement of his boss and the dismay of his girlfriend. Dassin takes us through the fascinating underworld of London as Fabian tries to score big in the wrestling ring using his competitor's father to make a name and money for himself. Through a series of encounters and lots of scheming he will find himself in a very strange position. Like an obese cabaret owner comments he has it all but he's a dead man.It's near impossible to find flaws with this movie. From the inspired script to the very tight plotting with never a dull moment to the grim black and white cinematography that uses London's dreary streets as another character that comments on the action and mood Night and the City is a truly fascinating glimpse in a kind of cinema long gone. A classic film noir gem that excels in both what it presents to the viewer and what it leaves to the imagination. The approaching steps of someone echoing off screen as we watch Fabian's increasing distress only to discover it's his girlfriend played by the gorgeous Gene Tierney. The cat and mouse game as Fabian with a reward on his head is being chased by every hoodlum and beggar in London that recalls Fritz Lang's noir godfather M 1931.Apart from technical proficiency and a maddening atmosphere Night and the City really succeeds in portraying one of the best and most memorable character ensembles in the film noir universe.

To go with the spurious title there's a spurious introduction on the theme of Night and the City which is at least easy on the eye though fortunately brief. What the film is really about is the existential failure of one Harry Fabian a cheap conman but full of life. The movie is a very sordid one an initial lecture is given to a bunch of ahem companions in the Silver Fox nightclub about how to fleece the customers there is however to be no actual theft from them on the premises although suggestively what happens to the customers on leaving the club is of no concern to the management. A friend of my brother has posttraumatic stress from being the victim of such a honey trap whilst drunk in London this year so I really connected with the cutting edge of nastiness this film provides. Although this movie is set in a moonlit criminal demimonde there are about five separate love stories arranged in a complicated geometry. These are what pull the heartstrings and kept me rapt throughout. The central love story is Mary's love for Harry who does little more than use her. She sees a vitality in him that attracts her helplessly as if he's a magnet and overlooks all his faults for this. He's a hamstrung man who's damaged heart spills out in a final scene of electrifying intensity. Richard Widmark who I have rarely appreciated as an actor here throws everything at his role but the kitchen sink and deserves all the praise he gets.Night and the City is an absolutely heartbreaking film that I realised had really shaken me up after I left the cinema. I had fish and chips to celebrate in Cockney style. Peripherally I think it's worth mentioning that there is more than one version of this movie and it can look a bit strange because a lot of the build up to the possibly overwrought action of the denouement is cut in what I believe is the American version. Would pay to rent out the Criterion DVD of this movie as it apparently has explanatory extras on this subject. I would also like to express my admiration for the seductive qualities of Googie Withers' portrayal of Helen Nosseross and for the horrid wrestling scene in the movie which actually aroused this hysteric feeling in me that happens when a fight starts in real life and which films very rarely manage to achieve.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie's an all right way to spend 95 minutes. I didn't find it to be great or any kind of classic.It's a lowbudget 'b' movie from 1950. It's mostly about a lot of seedy characters in the underbelly of a big city who mostly seem in a race to see who can stab each other in the back fastest. The lead character Harry Fabian Richard Widmark is particularly unlikable a hustling getrichquick schemer who at two low points robs his own girlfriend's purse to finance his schemes.I did read in the liner notes the director didn't think much of this film and I agree. It gets a little too obvious too many times. Like Widmark. We get the idea he's pretty low the first time he tries to steal from his own gal's purse. Bringing that back a second time feels a little heavyhanded.I did feel a little bit sorry for Widmark at the end when he knows he's going to die but not really a lot. I mostly felt relieved for his girlfriend's sake who is played by Gene Tierney. I wish there were women nowadays who looked like Gene Tierney does here. There's still plenty of women being made so maybe it's the period clothes or Hollywood cinematography. Or maybe just the way she carries herself with a certain amount of class dignity and respect.Probably the most believable strain of the story is how she's also getting interest from a decent and betterlooking guy Hugh Marlowe but she sticks with her unlovable rake Widmark. That's a human trait that's all too recognizable.Widmark winds up strangled to death and having his corpse dumped in the river so Tierney can shrug off her lovin' the bad boy chapter and run into Marlowe's arms who's already running towards her waiting.If you think you're getting a 'film noir classic' with this let me warn ya except for some of the later ones 'film noir' was definitely a genre after the fact. Some French film critics noticed a group of postwar Hollywood movies had some dark themes and lighting and direction to match and started calling them that. Until then no one involved knew at the time they were making a 'film noir.' They tended to be lowbudget crime dramas made as usual to try to make money. Apparently the postWorld War II audiences wanted something harsher so movie makers gave it to 'em. It isn't until you get to the later ones called 'film noir' like Orson Welles Touch of Evil that it really seems a conscious genre choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent film noir with Widmark in top form. The film opens with Widmark running down narrow London streets and from there the film never loses it's frenetic energy. Widmark plays a guy who wants to be somebody always dreaming up new schemes to make him rich and a big shot. But he's really doomed from the beginning lots of foreshadowing makes his eventual fate quite easy to predict as one of life's losers. He scams his way into gaining a deal to manage a young wrestling star but things spiral out of control in true noir fashion.Interesting that this archetypal film noir should be shot in the shadowy streets of London when dark American streets were the movement's ancestral home. But as with The Killers and Out Of The Past this is one of the defining noir films. Just look at the title. It pretty much encapsulates noir with the film taking place predominantly at night and in an urban setting. Director Jules Dassin's London underbelly is a disturbing fascinating world in a way it's almost Dickensian in tone. The cinematography and DVD transfer looks wonderful.While Widmark is awesome the film is really given it's colour from the great supporting cast. Googie Withers is one woman who Widmark really shouldn't trust or mess with but he does and with fatal consequences. Her morbidly obese husband villainous but tragically in love with his nogood wife is memorably played by Francis L Sullivan. Stanislaus Zbyszko is unforgettable as the proud GrecoRoman wrestling warrior and Herbert Lom brilliantly underplays as his mafioso son. And to make things even more noir throw in Mike Mazurki as Strangler! Tierney unfortunately does not have much to do with her faithful girlfriend role readily familiar her role was actually added in by Dassin as a favour to Zanuck.An incredibly moody sometimes grotesque and tragic noir piece that while brutal manages to fit in more than a few moments of touching sensitivity and human tragedy. Who can forget Lom's final scene with Zbyszko?".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently out on Criterion DVD with a restored print this is a very nice example of 1950s film noir although when it was made the director Jules Dassin didn't even know there was a classification known as film noir. In fact the DVD extras which include a fairly recent interview with the aging Dassin is as captivating as is the movie itself. Back in the late 1940s when blacklisting was a reality Dassin was essentially told go to London quickly make this movie quickly it may be your last. He made Night and the City without ever reading the source material the book and the movie is apparently quite different. Two versions were made simultaneously using the same source film but with different musical composers and different film editors. The DVD extras contains excerpts to demonstrate some of the differences including a drastically different ending. Good movie worth a viewing for the acting of underrated Richard Widmark who plays Harry Fabian an American postwar hustler in London. Fabian had big ideas of halfbaked schemes and always was hitting up a friend for a hundred quid here 300 quid there to finance his latest get rich quick scheme. In the extras we learn that Gene Tierney was requested for the part of Fabian's girl Mary Bristol because she was in a bad way after a recent romantic breakup and according to Dassin was suicidal. This movie helped bring her back to a good state. Googie Withers an actress I had never heard of is good as Helen Nosseross married to the rich but disgusting Phil Francis Sullivan and just wanting to get a license for her own night spot and a chance to break away from her husband. She is forced to deal with Fabian a decision that cost her dearly.Perhaps the most interesting actor is Stanislaus Zbyszko one time world's strongest man from Poland in 1949 living in New Jersey. Even though he was unexperienced he gives a super performance as an old retired wrestler Gregorius the Great who was grooming his son for a wrestling career. Mike Mazurki plays his nemesis The Strangler.Although the story gets a bit complex in the various relationships it simply distills into Fabian seeing an opportunity to contract Gregorius to feature a wrestling match that will allow Fabian at least in his eyes to control wrestling in London. But his various scams catch up with him and all does not turn out well as is the case in a film noir.".

But after 911 is pretty sure that questions like terrorist or freedomfighter? isn't so stupid at all. So the idea of naive alien helping terrorists doesn't look weird anymore.Movie's special ultramodern design cold style and dark atmosphere looked maybe a bit over the top in late 70s but became mainstream in 80s especially in scifi and A category horror movies. The Hunger for example has very similar visual style but was filmed 5 years later. The Grnberg's music isn't typical 70s movie soundtrack the cold and synthesized soundscape became popular also in 80s and later.

	schema:reviewBody "25 years ago Hukkunud alpinisti hotell was considered to be among one of the three best Estonian films together with Viimne reliikvia and Navigaator Pirx. No crime nor fantasy films were often produced in Estonia. So making a real scifi movie and shooting it in a far land Caucasian mountains ? had to be quite an event here. That was then... The thing i don't understand is why this piece of crap is still kept for the golden fund of Estonian films. Well the beginning that is very much Shining alike is yet promising. But the more the film goes on the worse it gets. Anticipation that is cognizable in the beginning doesn't form into tension as it should. Lack of technical cull disturbs enjoying the movie instead. First of all the cinematographer Jri Sillart should have been drunk or disabled filming constantly closeups. The picture is jumping from one closeup to another so there's practically no overview what's going on in general. I don't even talk about conveying the characters through the picture. Shooting straight into the sun and its reflections in the film for no reason is the cinematographer's style too. Light in the hotel is extremely poor so the action is time to time only cognizable not visible. Secondly the director couldn't reform the mediocre script into fluent running film. The action is nervous jumping from here to there so watching it i had a feeling that i had fallen asleep and missed some parts. Thirdly the muchhyped Sven Grnberg's music doesn't fit in the movie at all as it is too monotonic and doesn't support the action. I can say that the movie interferes the music a bit but the music doesn't help the film at all. For the fourth special effects are feeble and even embarrassing to watch. For example the scene in the end when the ETs were escaping from the hotel gliding on the snow was miserable ! It should have remade and not to put in the movie ! For the fifth it's incredible how its possible to present good actors so poorly. The most important actor Uldis Pucitis is OK in the beginning where he didn't have to do much yet. The man's charisma helps him out there. Later when his role turns to much more demanding one he doesn't control it anymore. He just exists on the screen. Estonian farfamed Mikk Mikiver shows that he should have stayed producing as his performance is very very nonrealistic. The same critics goes almost to all the other actors as they don't manage with their rather a difficult roles. The actors are rather tin soldiers than individual characters so even at the end of the movie it is not clear how many people were involved. The only exception is grand old Jri Jrvet who is good as always. And Aarne kskla reading text for Pucitis is superb. So watch it and i hope that the myth of the great Estonian scifi film is going to be broken at last.".

I came to this because it was represented as clever and also as the best Estonia has. But everything about it excepting the makeup of the women is amateurish to the extreme. If it were on that 60's TeeVee show for kids it would be considered a bad show.I understand the book is much better in the way it fools you into thinking this is a normal mystery formula with a random collection of people cut off avalanche and with a detective as our designated onscreen viewer. The red herring here is not to confuse among suspects but among genres. Its supposedly successful in the book But not here.

	schema:reviewBody "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is such a basic Science Fiction story that many firsttime viewers have been stunned by the reverence in which it is held. An alien arrives on earth is misunderstood and is nearly killed passes a warning to mankind to not carry the weapons of potential nuclear war into space or face annihilation then leaves. The FX are minimal there are no 'space battles' or 'monsters' even the score by the legendary composer Bernard Herrmann is simple lacking the bombast of later 'epics'. Yet in it's very simplicity director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other 'message'driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates' short story Farewell to the Master which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community Gort the enforcer robot is revealed to be the true 'Master' of the story not Klaatu thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu believing that the legendary star's wellestablished persona would make the SF elements more 'understandable' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie a gaunt sensitive British actor whom he felt best suited the Christlike quality Klaatu had to possess even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was 'Carpenter'. For earth's greatest scientist a thinlydisguised Albert Einstein Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe which also brought a howl from the studio as the actor was being investigated by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the midst of their infamous 'witch hunt' and blacklisting of Hollywood's supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice however displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to 'Dr. Zorba' on Ben Casey.Rounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper Hugh Marlowe fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE and Billy Gray who would go on to great success in Father Knows Best. The true casting coup however was finding 7foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot Gort. Encased in foam rubber 'armor' and 'lifts' to bring his height to nearly eight feet he actually wore two different outfits as the seam was impossible to hide and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera Martin who Wise acknowledged was not a physically strong man would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion if you watch him carefully during the film you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over. The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant and the actress who was afraid justifiably that she might be dropped!The filming was by and large an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew although Patricia Neal in later interviews said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film's famous 'tag' phrase Klaatu Barrada Nikto without breaking into giggles. Everyone knew the end result would be special Michael Rennie ten years later would call the role the most important of his career NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film on Saturday Night at the Movies.With it's antiwar stand the film was the direct counterpart of the year's other 'classic' SF production THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD the first of Hollywood's 'alien invasion' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 'Mankind' is the true monster toying with nuclear weapons constantly fighting and willing to kill a peaceful emissary without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. Man must grow up or be destroyed was a powerful message in 1951 particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery with it's thousands of headstones as KlaatuCarpenter viewed sadly the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant today which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.".

For earth's greatest scientist a thinlydisguised Albert Einstein Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe which also brought a howl from the studio as the actor was being investigated by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the midst of their infamous 'witch hunt' and blacklisting of Hollywood's supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice however displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to 'Dr. Zorba' on Ben Casey.Rounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper Hugh Marlowe fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE and Billy Gray who would go on to great success in Father Knows Best. The true casting coup however was finding 7foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot Gort. Encased in foam rubber 'armor' and 'lifts' to bring his height to nearly eight feet he actually wore two different outfits as the seam was impossible to hide and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera Martin who Wise acknowledged was not a physically strong man would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion if you watch him carefully during the film you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over. The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant and the actress who was afraid justifiably that she might be dropped!The filming was by and large an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew although Patricia Neal in later interviews said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film's famous 'tag' phrase Klaatu Barrada Nikto without breaking into giggles. Everyone knew the end result would be special Michael Rennie ten years later would call the role the most important of his career NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film on Saturday Night at the Movies.With it's antiwar stand the film was the direct counterpart of the year's other 'classic' SF production THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD the first of Hollywood's 'alien invasion' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 'Mankind' is the true monster toying with nuclear weapons constantly fighting and willing to kill a peaceful emissary without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. Man must grow up or be destroyed was a powerful message in 1951 particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery with it's thousands of headstones as KlaatuCarpenter viewed sadly the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant today which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "This science fiction classic is more relevant than ever and I don't mean its silly message about peace. Yes yes we're all violent silly warlike humans and we should all throw away our guns and atomic bombs posthaste if we know what's good for us. Thanks Klaatu. We'll get right on that. Meanwhile we'll enjoy the chance to watch your story on DVD because we live in an age  yes of war and cruelty and weapons of mass destruction  but also of Jar Jar Binks and Alien vs. Predator.Klaatu Michael Rennie is a gentlemanly outerspace alien who comes to earth in his flying saucer to send us Earthlings a very important message. Sadly we shoot him on arrival and try to imprison him in a hospital room. He escapes however and goes out among us to find the basis for our strange unreasoning attitudes. He takes a room in a boarding house where he meets the widowed Mrs. Benson Patricia Neal and her young son Billy Gray. The widow is being romanced by an insurance salesman Hugh Marlowe who later displays a lust for glory that endangers Klaatu  and thus the rest of the world. Klaatu is in better hands when he reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt Sam Jaffe a brilliant scientist and the best hope for the survival of Earth.It's funny but I never think about this movie in terms of that plot outline. To me this film is composed of small moments about people  especially Mrs. Benson. Mention The Day the Earth Stood Still to me and the first thing I think about is that moment where the strange new boarder tells her that he'd like to spend the day with her son. She hesitates a moment and says in a lowered voice Well that's awfully nice of you to suggest it. It's a tiny moment about her concern for her son her good manners and her intelligent ability to reply quickly and diplomatically. Patricia Neal not Gort the robot makes this movie come alive for me.The real reason this story is so fresh is because  it's a good story. It's not an excuse to slap us senseless with fastpaced cutting or drown us in great globs of special effects. It has an engaging plot with warm interesting characters. If we stupidly and as you know Klaatu we humans can be so very stupid limit ourselves to the New Releases section of the video store we forget that some scifi thrillers put story before special effects.The trick work in this movie is excellent though. I think the robot looks silly but when Gort opens its visor and we hear that unnerving theremin music we don't care that this supposedly metallic creature bends like Styrofoam at the knees. We know those laser beams eyes are about to scorch everything in their sight.Michael Rennie makes up for Gort's deficiencies. He gives what easily could have been a humorless sanctimonious character a quiet graceful authority. His slightly otherworldly looks add to the illusion and Neal as Mrs. Benson completes it by reacting to him with obvious respect  even when she fears him.Under Robert Wise's direction every shot is strikingly composed and brings out the maximum dramatic potential of the story. The sense of rhythm and pacing is beautifully suspenseful. Bernard Herrmann with the theremin as one of his instruments gives the movie both a nervous tension and a sense of wonder. And the story is so perfectly constructed that it even gets away with a big speech for a climax.What's the heart of this movie? There's a bravura sequence where Billy Gray secretly follows Rennie from the boarding house to his spaceship. It's a simple wordless scene where the entire team of filmmakers  and that goes double for Herrmann  meld the ordinary and the fantastic. You want a special effect? That's it.".

I thought it was going to be so cheesy and lame since it was a 50's film but after watching a little bit of it I didn't realize the strong message it held. I remember in Terminator 2 there was a line that I still hold true to this day It's in your nature to destroy yourselves that maybe it's not all technology that will destroy us but we are our own worst enemies. The Day the Earth Stood was before The Terminator just like Metropolis was before this film but these are the best stories and it's like watching a history lesson on film about the time and feel of the 50's.An alien spaceship has landed in Washington D.C. but it's not what you think with the take us to your leader type of thing rather a human like alien comes out offering input on what is going on in the universe but he is immediately attacked by the humans and taken hostage. His name is Klaatu he tries to explain several times that he's not here to hurt anyone but the humans don't trust him. He escapes and goes to a family since no one knows what he looks like they think that he's a regular man who just needs a place to stay. He stays with a family and they show him around they think he's a little strange but very polite and nice but when they learn of his true identity he tells them of what his intentions are to mearly warn Planet Earth of it's impending doom.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a true classic I know there are a lot of young people who complain about the ending how it's so anticlimatic but I feel that it's a perfect film and I am so ticked off that it's being remade. But I guess we will have to see what the film will be like who knows? It might be good... yeah right sorry was just trying to be nice. But I highly recommend you watch this movie it's a true classic that has a strong message has great actors and fun effects. It's fun to watch these films I wonder if they realized while making this film back in 1951 that they were acting out their own culture and history.1010".

I don't care to venture any guesses as to what they may be but it's easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic while so many others sank into obscurity. The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples' minds in the early 1950s in America and the rest of the world and that is the conflicts between many different nations and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other. It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high. Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title why it's not very frightening at all!Okay that made no sense but I couldn't resist. My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man but a good looking man who spoke perfect English but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years. Unlikely but it's an explanation which is more than most science fiction films provide. Granted not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction but in this case something had to be said. The alien didn't give may details as to his physical condition but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet.Speaking of which there is one thing about the science that I'm also curious about. At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s? I'm wondering how far into space scientists were looking because Carpenter the alien states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth which in astronomical terms is a tiny tiny distance. Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system. And here's another little factoid  Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year as you know. Pluto on the other hand takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun. That has nothing to do with the movie but is an interesting digression I should think.I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time. It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda oxymoron intended. I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has.When Carpenter who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations he was genuinely surprised and saddened. He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth's atmosphere and since humans clearly are unable to get along he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration. Most importantly if we chose the latter they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space. The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another.This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted. They have created robots which we seen in the Iron Man to prevent the rise of violence in their society. The robots have tremendous power which cannot be revoked and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor which results in a peaceful society. I'm also reminded of Gulliver's Travels also by Jonathan Swift particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which interestingly enough are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace. When at one point Gulliver describes lying which does not exist to the Houynymns one of them responds incredulously with something like Why on Earth would one say something that isn't so? Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world.The famous quote that I've quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness. The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does. Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005 it's obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie but then again as Arnold stated in Terminator 2 It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.Scary.".

I can honestly say that every alien encounter I've experienced through movies t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still and most have come up short. I credit the film's depiction of humanalien interactions with my presentday feelings about how people should treat each other  within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said it is still entertaining a joy to revisit. There are no expensive hitech special effects that look great in teasers but do nothing for the plot. It's very straight forward honest pure. It's emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shootemup space battle films that are today's norm. And while I enjoy a good explosion now and then the change of pace is refreshing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Day the Earth Stood Still is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie Patricia Neal Hugh Marlowe Sam Jaffe Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. Classic scifi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate's short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don't see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today but the core message is not up for argument. Wise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton where here aided by Tover's beautiful photography he blends the feel of semidocumentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it's scenes of Klaatu Rennie trawling the wet night streets or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house the visual imagery by way of lowkey lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. All the cast are spot on in their respective performances with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn't resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann's understated score is dynamite and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it's a glorious slice of celluloid and in Gort the robot Lock Martin we have one of the biggest icons in scifi cinema. Once viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still its message its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time a game changer in the critical year for the scifi genre. All told it's magic cinema still standing the test of time. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "When a space ship lands in the middle of a playing field in Washington the military respond with an immediate shut down of the area.  The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien Klaatu is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's scifi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture  the score alone has been aped or lifted in the Simpson's case in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends rather than a beware the red menace' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the alien' is from earth ie Russia only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light. Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's preemptive strike while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect  the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking sorry  accidental pun at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichs set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wideeyed all American boy Bobby but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy to see the whole thing but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a preemptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.".

I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's preemptive strike while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect  the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking sorry  accidental pun at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichs set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wideeyed all American boy Bobby but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy to see the whole thing but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a preemptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.";

Also the acting is not be overlooked.

TDTESS is is a simple story of a visitor to the earth with a simple message if you begin to threaten other planets with your belligerence and petty sqabblings you are in trouble. It is not a comforting message.It is brought by Klaatu diffidently but effectively played by Michael Rennie who appears to be a Christlike figure. He comes among the people he dies he rises again he ascends upwards. His assumed name while staying in a lodging house is Carpenter. He does not bring salvation however he brings judgement. His angel is not Gabriel but a robot called Gort and this angel acts independently of the creator. As the flying saucer takes off at the end of the film the feeling is one of disquiet.Apart from the myriad of meanings social and political as well as religious that could be put on the film it is well made and keeps one's attention. The supporting actors are well chosen. Mention should be made of Sam Jaffe always watchable and Patricia Neal who brings her usual intelligence to her role. The special effects are OK but are not the centre of interest anyway. It is filmed like a film noir giving it a fascinating atmosphere unlike similar 1950s scifi. The scene in the dark lift with Klaatu and Helen bars of light and dark falling on them is classic film noir but it is not a killer she is trapped in a lift with but someone who could destroy her planet. Much of the film is set after dark.An excellent film on all counts. It is a real work of art much more than those films with a huge sense of their own importance but don't bear viewing more than once. TDTESS can be seen again and again.".

One for example is when Ms. Benson's boyfriend betrays the trust of knowing Mr. Carpenter's secret. He says 'I don't care about the world' which is an example of how people are selfish and think of their own needs even when other's needs would be more productive.

Thorn comes to the fancy apartment and meets Simonson's bodyguard Tab Fielding and the furniture woman that is rented together with the flat Shirl and the detective concludes that the executive was not victim of burglary but executed.

	schema:reviewBody "It is the year 2022 and nothing has changed even if things have gotten worse. New York City has become even more overpopulated and is just yet another city heaving in its own filth with countless havenots fighting over sparse resources. Energy supplies are low water is strictly controlled living spaces are small and cramped and real food is a luxury reserved for the very rich. The masses do not have such luxuries and eat rationed supplies of highnutrient processed foods from the Soylent Corporation. Detective Thorn is a havenot and just like everyone else is out to get what he can for himself and friend Sol Roth. Called to a burglary that became a murder Thorn learns that the victim is a director at Soylent and suspects that all the curious thing about the crimes may be coming together to be far more than the work of some random thug.Famous for its shock ending which everyone must know and most people will guess this film is actually more than just one scene and is actually an intelligent scifi detective story that has an engaging central story and a generally interesting vision of the future that is much more convincing than the one of Hollywood blockbusters and such. The investigation is solid but it is the world it happens within that is most interesting as we see a world where surprise surprise the poor people are left to make do while those better off can still enjoy the finer things while they remain. It is not an earth shattering view of the future but it is a convincing one and I enjoyed being in this story and seeing this world played out. Personally I bought it but it may help that I mistrust corporations anyway and believe that the poor will be the first to get shafted when anything bad happens simply because they have less to work with.The narrative is not the strongest though and in terms of it being a detective story it could have been better. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action which I think is a pretty unfair accusation since it wasn't trying to be that type of film. The main characters are interesting. Thorn is a man of authority but he is just like everyone else out to get what he can and takes advantage of others the first chance he gets. His relationship with Roth is not fully explained but it worked anyway and provided a touch of humanity. It helps that both actors did good jobs of it as well. Heston normally plays the gruff hero but here at least he allows the corruption within man's heart to come out. Robinson has less of a character but his performance is assured and is touching for reasons internal and external to the film. Support is not so good but it is less important in the smaller roles Cotton is a nice find though.Overall this is a famous film that is good but not without its faults. The narrative is reasonably interesting and carries the film all the way to a nice but too wellknown conclusion but it is in the general vision of the future of a world where the people are struggling to get by with resources running low. A smart scifi that is well worth seeing.".

I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period. Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screenand the cinematoraphy writing music used and everything about it works. The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future. Just think how the world population grew the rain forest that disappeared resources used up green house effect getting worse since 1973. I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years. Its reputation should be better.Speaking of reputations often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in ElCid Soylent Green The Warlord The Omega Man Will Penny and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors. Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.".

This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plotsbut whatever the cause I have always found this difference fascinating.The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buyincluding furniturea euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment. At the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discussit could ruin the film for you. However the film has a great plot and acting and is superexciting to watch. Plus it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great scifi film that is allegorical and profound.".

	schema:headline " The 1970s was another mighty fine decade for sciencefiction.";
	schema:reviewBody "Nowadays it's easy to suspect governments and big corporations of just about any nefarious doings. And there's a sinister plot afoot here to deal with an Earth of a future year 2022 just five years away in reality where the greenhouse effect and over population have turned the planet into a portrait of Hell. For example the opening text tells us that there are 40000000 people in NYC alone. A harddriving NYPD detective Thorn Charlton Heston stumbles onto something big when he investigates the murder of Simonson Joseph Cotten a corporation bigwig.Partly because this movie has been in the public consciousness for so long it's hard to imagine many people not knowing what the story's big reveal is. You of course won't hear it from this viewer but it's not hard to figure out. Still the plot constructed by novelist Harry Harrison originally titled Make Room! Make Room! is intriguing enough to pull you in and keep you entertained. It might not be quite meaty or involved enough for some tastes mind you. Part of Thorn discovering the big secret involves our wrongdoers not seeming to go to great lengths to keep it hidden.One of the most impressive marvels is the use of extras as MGM and director Richard Fleischer of the classic Disney adaptation of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea give us an amazing depiction of overcrowding. For instance every day on his way to work Thorn has to clamber over dozens of bodies filling the corridors and stairways of his run down building. Excellent use is made of classical music both preexisting and new stuff composed by Fred Myrow Phantasm.The cast is full of reliable familiar actors Chuck Connors Brock Peters Paula Kelly Stephen Young Mike Henry Lincoln Kilpatrick Roy Jenson Leonard Stone Whit Bissell Celia Lovsky Dick Van Patten. Leigh TaylorYoung is beautiful and endearing as Shirl a young woman living in a future where a young woman can be referred to as furniture and simply come with an apartment. Heston is solid as usual but Soylent Green really belongs to the wonderful Edward G. Robinson around 80 years old at the time and making his 101st feature film appearance. Sadly it would turn out to be his last making his final scenes even more poignant and powerful.This is definitely striking entertainment even more when one considers the ending.Eight out of 10.".

For instance every day on his way to work Thorn has to clamber over dozens of bodies filling the corridors and stairways of his run down building. Excellent use is made of classical music both preexisting and new stuff composed by Fred Myrow Phantasm.The cast is full of reliable familiar actors Chuck Connors Brock Peters Paula Kelly Stephen Young Mike Henry Lincoln Kilpatrick Roy Jenson Leonard Stone Whit Bissell Celia Lovsky Dick Van Patten. Leigh TaylorYoung is beautiful and endearing as Shirl a young woman living in a future where a young woman can be referred to as furniture and simply come with an apartment. Heston is solid as usual but Soylent Green really belongs to the wonderful Edward G. Robinson around 80 years old at the time and making his 101st feature film appearance. Sadly it would turn out to be his last making his final scenes even more poignant and powerful.This is definitely striking entertainment even more when one considers the ending.Eight out of 10.";

Thorn comes to the fancy apartment and meets Simonson's bodyguard Tab Fielding Chuck Connors and the furniture woman that is rented together with the flat Shirl Leigh TaylorYoung and the detective concludes that the executive was not victim of burglary but executed. Further he finds that the Governor Santini Whit Bissell and other powerful men want to disrupt and end his investigation. But Thorn continues his work and discovers that the oceans have exhausted and the bizarre and disturbing secret of the ingredient used to manufacture Soylent Green.Soylent Green is one of the best scifi ever made and a film that has not aged. On the contrary when I saw it in the movie theater in 1973 it was another good film with catastrophic view of the future. Along the years I have seen this film on VHS at least four more times and every time that I see it I find it better and better. In Brazil this film has not been released on DVD or Bluray only in the movietheater in 1973 and on a rare VHS with the title No Mundo de 2020 translation In the World of 2020 despite the story takes place in 2022 and I have just bought the imported BluRay and saw it again.It is impressive how the writer Harry Harrison was capable to foresee the future in 1966 with pollution overpopulation and menace of exhaustion of the natural resources and write his novel Make Room! Make Room!. In those years the concept of ecology did not exist at least the same way in the present days. The grim view of the cannibalism to fee the population introduced by Stanley R. Greenberg in the screenplay fortunately has not been achieved yet.Soylent Green is also the film number 101 in the career of the unforgettable actor Edward G. Robinson that was with cancer and almost deaf during the shooting and died two weeks after the conclusion of this film. The BluRay has in the extras a tribute to this great actor. My vote is ten.Title Brazil No Mundo de 2020 In the World of 2020".

The murder case and eventual reveal could have actually been done in just about any world. Yet here we have a world of overpopulation poverty women being used as furniture... and these concepts are never really explored. Why do people sleep on the stairs rather than in the street? If the world is overheated I would much rather be in an alley than a staircase! Charlton Heston is great of course but the heart and soul of this movie are in Edward G. Robinson. Making this film while almost completely deaf and dying of cancer he is the most human character in the film. He may be the only one who remembers the world the way it used to be the way we the audience expect the world to be. Robinson nails it giving the performance of his career.

New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green.

As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people that we've become a race of cannibals the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. We've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.This was the farewell performance of Edward G.

A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia he passed away in real life. Not many did but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally ill and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.Though the timetable was off it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass.

This was the final film for screen legend Edward G Robinson and had a great rapport and chemistry with Heston. The film is gritty and grimy and paints a nightmare picture of the future. Richard Fleisher did his best work with this film and is a great sci fi thriller with lots of social commentary and suspense.

In 2022 the population of New York has about forty million inhabitants living in miserable conditions and grossly overcrowded  a real hellhole  and Manhattan has become a big rubbish . In the overpopulated futuristic city  a New York police detective named Thorn Charlton Heston  finds himself marked for murder by government agents when he gets too close to a bizarre state secret involving the origins of a revolutionary and needed new foodstuff . Food is so scarce and to combat hunger the government creates a strange product  a synthetic food made of soybeans and lentils  the Soylent Green title refers to a precious stuff for people to eat  but the cop and his old partner named Roth Edward G. Robinson a survivor from another era  are investigating killing of bigwig  and they suspect the tracks behind the new food result to be a little unsettling . In the process  Thorn stumbles onto explosive secret . Richard Fleischer creates a magnificent science fiction film without special effects and full of intrigue  melodrama  thrills  suspense  fights and interesting issues . Charlton Heston starred a pessimistic but wellintentioned trilogy about Distopian Earth  Soylent Green along with The Planet of the Apes and The Omega Man all great films . The whole film has a great originality from the point of view narrative  dealing with a cop who investigates and discovers an incredible government secret . It has a great argument for a very bitter ending  which is accompanied by a sensible musical score . The best moments are in the privacy of starring Charlton Heston and especially by the presence of Edward G. Robinson in his last film  a kind of testament of his own life where Robinson says us goodbye . In very poor health with cancer Edward G. Robinson was almost totally deaf when he made this movie and only able to hear anyone if they spoke directly into his ear. Because of this scenes with him talking to other people had to be shot several times before he got the rhythm of the dialogue and was able to respond to people as if he could really hear them. And because he was unable to hear director Richard Fleischer yell cut when a scene went wrong Robinson would often continue acting out the scene unaware that shooting had stopped seconds earlier .The music which played when Edward G. Robinson was going home is the following  The overture was the principal theme from the first movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 the Pathetique. When the visual presentation starts the music is the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony n6 The Pastoral. When the flock of sheep appear the music is Morning from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite . The director Fleischer  shows that we do not need special effects to carry out the horror of the prophecies of Malthus . The last fifteen years the Richard Fleischer's films were not exactly very bright  filming Charles Bronson or Chuck Norris vehicles  but in his first twentyfive years had proved his own right as one of the most interesting directors of American commercial cinema . He was an expert director  including adventure classics Vikings 20.000 leagues under sea and noir cinema Narrow margin  Clay pigeons  Trapped . The film will appeal to SciFi buffs with enough thoughprovoking themes to make it worth looking in on . In other words it seem likely Charlton Heston enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because thrills action and intrigue are brilliantly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact . Rating  Better than average  watchable movie and well worth seeing .".

	schema:reviewBody "The world of the 1973 scifi drama SOYLENT GREEN is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. It is a world in which New York City's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022. Overpopulation air pollution yearlong heat waves and food shortages are the rule. The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green. But what is this particular food stuff really made of? That question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film based on Harry Harrison's 1966 novel Make Room! Make Room! Charlton Heston stars as Thorne an NYPD detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive Joseph Cotten. As it turns out Cotten was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing. Heston believes that this wasn't just a gardenvariety murder that Cotten was bumped off for a reason. He gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute book Edward G. Robinson in his 101st and final cinematic appearance and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like. What Robinson finds out about Soylent Green shocks him beyond all imagination but before he can tell Heston all of what he knows he has himself euthanized. And when Heston does indeed find out the secret of Soylent Green...well that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.Under the very professional guiding hand of director Richard Fleischer THE BOSTON STRANGLER FANTASTIC VOYAGE SOYLENT GREEN is a fairly grim but thoughtprovoking look at a Dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources. Indeed this was a project that Heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968 after he had struck gold in the scifi genre with PLANET OF THE APESa fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultraconservative political philosophy comes up in conversation after all SOYLENT GREEN is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism. Robinson as always is the consummate professional in his last role the sequence where he is euthanized as he looks at video of the world from a better era set to the music of Tchaikovsky Beethoven and Grieg is quite simply heartbreaking. The film also benefits from solid supporting help from Chuck Connors as a very convincing heavy Brock Peters as Heston's superior and Leigh TaylorYoung as the woman who tries to help Heston in his inquiries.It must seem easy these days to dismiss SOYLENT GREEN for being dated. But those who do it ought to think twice for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the 1966 novel Make Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison this is an extremely engrossing and thoughtprovoking film. Set in 2022 it depicts a world which is suffering from chronic overpopulation  New York alone has a population of 40 million  and a perpetual heatwave caused by the greenhouse effect. As a result resources have been severely depleted and things such as meat eggs soap clean water and even new paper are luxuries enjoyed by the idle rich. Food if you can call it that is derived from high energy plankton by the Soylent company. Real food may be expensive but life is cheap as the world has become a dark unfeeling depressing and cold figuratively if not literally! place. The terrible state of the world has brought out the worst in human nature and I have to say that it is very realistic in that respect. The highest position that any young woman can aspire to is to be the concubine  or furniture  of a wealthy man. This provides some very good social commentary on sexism and the objectification of women. As with another Charlton Heston film Planet of the Apes 1968 and another Joseph Cotten film Citizen Kane I was aware of the final revelation long before I saw the film due to pop culture osmosis but that did not effect my enjoyment of it in any way. The film has an excellent script by Stanley R. Greenberg and the direction of Richard Fleischer a master in the art of maintaining tension is superb.Charlton Heston gives an extremely good performance as the protagonist Detective Thorn. He is an extremely bitter and cynical man but this is hardly unusual given the society in which he has grown up. However he shows a softer side when it comes to his relationship with his elderly and increasingly infirm researcher  book Sol Roth whom he cares for and is hinted to love like a father. This is also seen in his relationship with the furniture Shirl. At first he treats her with the same mild contempt that he treats most people and things. He demands sex from her during his investigation but this is seemingly standard practice for a furniture so she is in no way offended or even surprised. However over the course of the film Thorn becomes genuinely fond of her and protective of her. She is played well by a young Leigh TaylorYoung the film's last surviving star who will hopefully live to see the real 2022.The best performance in the film however comes from Edward G. Robinson. After a hugely impressive career spanning more than five decades this was Robinson's final film. At the time that it was made he was in the final stages of bladder cancer and he therefore knew that he was going to die very soon. This knowledge likely influenced his performance as the world weary Sol Roth the oldest character who regularly hearkens back to a time when food was plentiful and there were seasons. The best and most moving scene in the film involves Sol going to a euthanasia clinic  or going home  as he is unable to live with the terrible secret of Soylent Green. There is a beautiful moment in which Thorn is reduced to tears by footage of wild animals hinted to be extinct rivers and mountains all of which he is too young to remember. This was the last scene that Robinson ever filmed and he died less than two weeks later.It was an excellent idea to cast Joseph Cotten as the former Soylent executive William R. Simonson whose murder Thorn investigates throughout the film. He only has two scenes but he was a wonderful actor and brings a great deal of pathos to his performance as the guiltstricken Simonson one of the wealthiest men in New York. Not only that but the casting of an old Hollywood star in the role meant that Fleischer successfully subverted the audience's expectations as they would assume that an actor of his standing and calibre would have much a bigger role. The film also features great performances from Brock Peters as Thorn's superior Lt. Hatcher depicting a black man in a position of authority over a white man was still quite unusual in 1973 so I appreciated that Chuck Connors as Simonson's suitably intimidating bodyguard Tab Fielding Whit Bissell as Governor Santini Leonard Stone as Charles and in her final film Celia Lovsky as the Exchange Leader.Overall this is an excellent film which is extremely effective in painting a picture of a bleak hopeless world on the brink. I can't imagine it having much of a future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember before Star Wars when scifi was smart? wrote one IMDb reviewer apparently astounded at the intellectual merits of this film the 1973 adaptation of Harry Harrison's novel Soylent Green.I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the film here too but let me start off pointing out everything that's wrong with the above statement  sure there were plenty of intelligent scifi films before Star Wars like the original Solaris 1972 JeanLuc Godard's Alphaville 1965 and Chris Marker's La Jetee 1962 amongst others but it's not as if Star Wars set in motion an outofcontrol train wreck of brainlessness.In fact in the time since Star Wars we've had Terry Gilliam's superb Jeteeinspired Twelve Monkeys 1995 The Matrix 1999  the first one had plenty of brains and Dark City 1998 to name only a few. Perhaps the argument might only be made that the genre took some time to recover from the actionoriented Star Wars but the fact remains.The main flaw here is the idea that Soylent Green is a great example of an intelligent film. It's not. A dystopian look into the future and a bunch of unhappy humans does not necessarily turn a mediocre story into a great one and nothing the film puts in place does anything to change that. Heston is his usual wooden masculine posturing self and the only bright sparks amongst the actors come from Edward G Robinson's last role as Sol and the police inspector.The story is so welltrodden by now that it's essentially common knowledge and it's not a horrible one. But the circumstances are obvious predictions to make if you have a pessimistic enough mind and the surprise twist has nothing on that of the other famous Heston vehicle Planet of the Apes.But the film soldiers on. There are good things about it  the moments of calm between Sol and Thorn are occasionally poignant  like when Thorn brings home rare foods  vegetables and even meat.

	onyx:emotionText "Remember before Star Wars when scifi was smart? wrote one IMDb reviewer apparently astounded at the intellectual merits of this film the 1973 adaptation of Harry Harrison's novel Soylent Green.I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the film here too but let me start off pointing out everything that's wrong with the above statement  sure there were plenty of intelligent scifi films before Star Wars like the original Solaris 1972 JeanLuc Godard's Alphaville 1965 and Chris Marker's La Jetee 1962 amongst others but it's not as if Star Wars set in motion an outofcontrol train wreck of brainlessness.In fact in the time since Star Wars we've had Terry Gilliam's superb Jeteeinspired Twelve Monkeys 1995 The Matrix 1999  the first one had plenty of brains and Dark City 1998 to name only a few. Perhaps the argument might only be made that the genre took some time to recover from the actionoriented Star Wars but the fact remains.The main flaw here is the idea that Soylent Green is a great example of an intelligent film. It's not. A dystopian look into the future and a bunch of unhappy humans does not necessarily turn a mediocre story into a great one and nothing the film puts in place does anything to change that. Heston is his usual wooden masculine posturing self and the only bright sparks amongst the actors come from Edward G Robinson's last role as Sol and the police inspector.The story is so welltrodden by now that it's essentially common knowledge and it's not a horrible one. But the circumstances are obvious predictions to make if you have a pessimistic enough mind and the surprise twist has nothing on that of the other famous Heston vehicle Planet of the Apes.But the film soldiers on. There are good things about it  the moments of calm between Sol and Thorn are occasionally poignant  like when Thorn brings home rare foods  vegetables and even meat. Robinson's face tells a story that Heston couldn't approach in a million years. Affecting also is Sol's departure staring up with wonder into an enormous television screen of fields and waterfalls.Unfortunately things that could easily have been strengths are not acted upon.

I have read in places that there is an effort to remake it and that would be interesting. I certainly think it would be a good project for Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Charleton Heston part since a lot of physical grunt work is not required.

That is unless you are one of the many whose viewing pleasure has already been spoiled by popular culture. Watching this movie today would be akin to watching a documentary on the O.J. Simpson trial and wondering how it came out. I feel fortunate in that I was able to watch from an uninformed viewpoint. I vaguely recalled there was something significant about the movie which was why I checked it out from my local library but couldn't remember what it was. Then when it was over I said Oh it's THAT movie. With no expectations the end was mildly shocking. Probably very much so in 1973 but less so 40 years later. I don't really think we are capable of being shocked any more.Unfortunately it felt like someone thought up a great ending for a movie and then tried to put in enough filler to get there. Maybe that is why with 10 minutes left I actually said to myself How could this possibly wrap itself up in 10 minutes? Then it ended and I said Oh it's THAT movie. Granted working backwards from an ending is not a bad recipe for success and even authors will tell you not to start a book unless you know where you are going. But it was a somewhat disjointed journey. The movie paints an overall bleak picture of the future illustrating its premise with a few insights on how we've digressed. Some are somewhat original but many could have been generated in a 6th grade creative writing class. As with all movies of this type the aberrations keep us thinking and analyzing and there is a lot of could that really happen? going on amongst Soylent Green viewers. Most seem to think no and I tend to agree with them. One puzzling and bothersome aspect is that there is very little exploration on how we've progressed. All the gressing is negative. I can not imagine a future 50 years hence in which our world looks exactly like our presentday world only less advanced.Soylent Green is fairly typical of most 60sera B movies. The acting is marginal and the plot is somewhat sketchy but the premise is mildly cuttingedge. It is a vehicle designed to set you up for a 5second knock on the head. There are glimmers of originality and if you just sit back and allow the movie to move you forward it will do so albeit at a fairly slow pace. There are enough thoughtpondering nuances that it is better than cleaning your bathroom. On the other hand if your bathroom really needs cleaning you could probably break away in the middle and come back for the last 10 minutes to get your daily dose of pop culture.".

You can't completely negate a movie that involves a desperate man who tries to gain back the love of his fiance by jumping out of a plane dressed like Elvis.  The flying Elvises concept is definitely an original touch but there are others as well.  I like the running gag involving Robert Costanzo suspecting that his fat ugly wife is cheating on him with Mike Tyson because of obviously doctored photos of her and Iron Mike.  There's also that great scene with the 5yearold Elvis impersonator who's actually quite good.  Anne Bancroft makes a brief but funny appearance at the beginning of the film.  Peter Boyle also has a funny cameo as Chief Orman an Indian Chief who has a love for showtunes.  James Caan gives his usually savvy performance.  I could've done without the cliched fat henchman character who basically repeats everything that Caan says and bumbles all over the place.  Nicolas Cage is overthetop as the paranoid Jack but his overacting works in the context of the film and he's often very funny.  And finally who can resist a film with tons of Elvis songs in the soundtrack?  My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POSTThis was a really fun movie. I watched it solely because Nicholes Cage one of my favorite actors was in it so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And I was right. It was actually better then I thought it would be.There isn't any way to describe this movie except a lighter funnier sappier version of Indecent proposal. While indecent proposal the book was great the movie was pretty bad. This however was a really fun time from beginning to end. Cage and parker make an adorable screen couple and James Caan was absolutely great. This movie hooks you in the first five minutes and retains a fun atmosphere throughout. It doesn't hurt that the two main settings for the movie are Las Vegas and Hawaii. The movie will make you want to visit both places. It is also peppered with unforgettable funny characters amidst two great settings one a non stop partyVegas and one stunning peaceful island beautyHawai.What's also great about this movie is it is actually unpredictable in a few places and I don't say that lightly because there are not a lot of romantic comedies that can do that. Give you the warm fuzziesoh yeah most of them do that no problem but it's the rare romantic comedy that can leave you guessing.For me I didn't know at first who parker's Betsy would actually end up with. Cage is at first presented as a jerk who yells almost non stop through the first part. And Tommy actually appears to be if a little questionable genuinely attracted to Parker. And the two have chemistry as well. So I wasn't quite sure which road the movie would choose to take.That Tommy ultimately becomes much nastier then he was at first presented was to me at first a disappointment and didn't seem to go with what I'd seen so far but the end made it worth it as this tops many romantic comedies with it's Completely over the top yet somehow appropriate ending. The sky diving sequence was thrilling not to mention how fun the Elvis impersonators were. This movie is an easy 7 maybe even a bit higher7.5 and is a movie I'd completely recommend it's fun it's funny it's pretty and it's well acted. Makes a great summer's late night watch and should be rated a bit higher on here.".

It doesn't hurt that the two main settings for the movie are Las Vegas and Hawaii. The movie will make you want to visit both places. It is also peppered with unforgettable funny characters amidst two great settings one a non stop partyVegas and one stunning peaceful island beautyHawai.What's also great about this movie is it is actually unpredictable in a few places and I don't say that lightly because there are not a lot of romantic comedies that can do that. Give you the warm fuzziesoh yeah most of them do that no problem but it's the rare romantic comedy that can leave you guessing.For me I didn't know at first who parker's Betsy would actually end up with. Cage is at first presented as a jerk who yells almost non stop through the first part. And Tommy actually appears to be if a little questionable genuinely attracted to Parker. And the two have chemistry as well. So I wasn't quite sure which road the movie would choose to take.That Tommy ultimately becomes much nastier then he was at first presented was to me at first a disappointment and didn't seem to go with what I'd seen so far but the end made it worth it as this tops many romantic comedies with it's Completely over the top yet somehow appropriate ending. The sky diving sequence was thrilling not to mention how fun the Elvis impersonators were. This movie is an easy 7 maybe even a bit higher7.5 and is a movie I'd completely recommend it's fun it's funny it's pretty and it's well acted. Makes a great summer's late night watch and should be rated a bit higher on here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Honeymoon in Vegas is a charming little romantic comedy directed by Andrew Bergman which sees him working with Nicolas Cage for the first time. Two years later would seem them collaborate once more with It Could Happen To You a film that is equally as funny and equally as underappreciated. The pair work really well together as Bergman's style of comedy utilises what makes Cage such a good actor his ability to portray anxiety in a way that makes you laugh and yet still be fully sympathetic with his plight.In a pretty high concept plot Cage plays a private detective haunted with dreams of his dead mother who is in a long term relationship with a teacher played by Sarah Jessica Parker but is afraid to tie the knot. Relationship troubles persuade Cage to take the plunge deciding to head off to Vegas to get married as fast as possible before he is able to change his mind. The comedy really kicks in when James Caan's character a wealthy professional gambler spots Cage's fiance and decides to pursue her himself using the most underhand of tactics as she looks similar to his recently deceased wife.Granted the premise might not be the most edgy or original of ones but it consistently manages to serve up some really funny moments. Towards the end it starts to slightly go off the boil with James Caan's character seeming to change in a way that seems geared to reach a resolution rather than unfold naturally. This problem only really briefly manifests itself in places throughout the last fifteen minutes of the film but can't really detract from the heartwarming climax involving a planeload of skydiving Elvises.If you are looking for a goofy comedy to watch that you don't need to think about a great deal then you'll not do much better than Honeymoon in Vegas. If you are still not convinced then watch it because Sarah Jessica Parker spends a lot of the time scantily clad and this is before she looked like some genetic engineering atrocity where the DNA of a horse was spliced with a prune.".

Nicolas Cage stars as Jack Singer a guy in love but hampered by a promise he may or may not have made to his mother Bea Anne Bancroft on her deathbed which causes him to drag his heels on the path to the altar.  When he finally manages a breakthrough he spirits his girl Betsy Sarah Jessica Parker off to Las Vegas with the intention of tying the knot once and for all.

And Betsy may be the flame but Korman is the flint. It's an amusing comedy that never gets too deep beneath the surface or purports to be anything but what it is though the plot does dip in to a bit of a gray area morally speaking.  The performances are good all around though nothing here is anything approaching a stretch for any of the principals involved.  Cage conveys the angst of his situation with aplomb and employs that hangdog look he does so well to great effect while his emotions implode.  Parker looks fetching and makes a credible character of Betsy but even though the action revolves around her there is not a whole lot for her to sink her teeth into with this part.  But to her credit she handles what she is given to work with convincingly enough.  Caan looks every bit the part of Korman in fact to put this part over he had little more to do than show up.  Even at that there are times when he takes it just a trifle over the top.  The supporting cast includes Pat Morita Mahi Mahi Johnny Williams Johnny Sandwich Seymour Cassel Tony Cataracts and Peter Boyle who creates one of the more memorable scenes in the movie as Chief Orman. With Honeymoon In Vegas' Bergman has put together a film that while not entirely memorable is good for some laughs the highlight of which is when Jack must of necessity interact with the flying Elvis impersonators.  In the end with some popcorn and a little imagination for Cage fans especially this movie will make for a satisfying evenings entertainment.  I rate this one 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fun enough little movie to watch but for a comedy it certainly still isn't quite funny enough.It's a bit of a lacking movie but nevertheless it's still one that flows well with its story and has some good characters in it as well. It just seems as if they forgot to put some more great jokes and comedy in the movie which seems amazing from the guy who also thought up the story for Blazing Saddles. But then again he also did Striptease and the remake of The InLaws. I'm talking about Andrew Bergman here who wrote and directed this movie and just doesn't seem to quite have the right skills and qualities for the genre. I mean he can definitely write and tell a good story and he can handle some decent characters but he just can't quite seem to get a grip on the right tone and style for a comedy. The movie does have some fun and crazy moments in it but even when watching these moments you'll have the idea and feeling that if they had pushed it a bit further all this movie could had truly been hilarious. In this particular case it probably wouldn't had harmed the movie if they went a bit overthetop with it all.Nevertheless it still really is a perfectly watchable movie that doesn't really ever bore and you'll simply have a good time watching it. It is still a movie with more hits than misses in it. Those hits just aren't very hard however.It's of course also really a movie that gets made interesting by its cast. When you have a cast with Nicolas Cage Sarah Jessica Parker James Caan and a strong supporting cast as well you are of course quite blessed as a filmmaker. Even though the genre isn't their strongest point with the exception of Sarah Jessica Parker perhaps they still make the movie a good watch with their performances.A good enough movie to watch though just nothing too impressive or memorable.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a fun enough little movie to watch but for a comedy it certainly still isn't quite funny enough.It's a bit of a lacking movie but nevertheless it's still one that flows well with its story and has some good characters in it as well. It just seems as if they forgot to put some more great jokes and comedy in the movie which seems amazing from the guy who also thought up the story for Blazing Saddles. But then again he also did Striptease and the remake of The InLaws. I'm talking about Andrew Bergman here who wrote and directed this movie and just doesn't seem to quite have the right skills and qualities for the genre. I mean he can definitely write and tell a good story and he can handle some decent characters but he just can't quite seem to get a grip on the right tone and style for a comedy. The movie does have some fun and crazy moments in it but even when watching these moments you'll have the idea and feeling that if they had pushed it a bit further all this movie could had truly been hilarious. In this particular case it probably wouldn't had harmed the movie if they went a bit overthetop with it all.Nevertheless it still really is a perfectly watchable movie that doesn't really ever bore and you'll simply have a good time watching it.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie started out hysterical especially the interaction between Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker. Suddenly however as James Caan's character was introduced that chemistry faded away for good and would never again be seen in the movie. Bergman's biggest mistake was that he shouldn't have made Parker's character so fickle and he should've made Caan's more nefarious not out for love. It becomes another stupid love triangle tale that's been rehashed a thousand times instead of being something fresh and exciting like it had potential to be at the beginning of the movie. Still there are many good gags throughout most notably the different types of Elvises and some funny PA announcements that you'll only catch with the subtitles on. The soundtrack is amazing and the closing fifteen minutes start to recapture the hilarity of the first few scenes but ultimately there's just too much time allotted to Nicolas Cage screaming and James Caan sweettalking Parker. Definitely worth a rental and if you can get it for less than ten bucks buy it. It's a good film but it had the potential to be an awesome one.".

One night Terangi does manage to escape even though he unknowingly knocks a guard to the ground killing him.

A very good movie. I was expecting much footage of hurricane destruction I didn't realize the plot aspect of the prison which was a lot more than plot filler. Hall and Lamour were good even though I enjoyed their movies from the 40's a lot better. Massey gives one of the best performances of his long career as De Laage as a heartless and sadistic fellow.

It stands head above shoulders over should such miserable cinematic fare like CBS's ludicrous Category 7 Day of Destruction. For one thing the hurricane in The Hurricane is not the focus of the story but its climax. Ford spends most of the movies developing the main characters of Terangi and Murama played by Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour respective and their lives on the fictional South Pacific island of Manukura in French Polynesia. John Ford spends his time as any good story teller does in presenting sympathetic and unsympathetic characters such as Raymond Massey's governor Eugene De Laage and John Carradine's sadistic wardenand shows the obstacles that face these characters before leading up to the climatic hurricane of the movie title. Such patient work by Ford on his characters pays off in the climax of the movie when the hurricane hits. We the viewers care about the death of the people so affected. I found myself riveted by the climax appalled at the death and destruction as one should be by any disaster. Unlike Category 7 there is no temptation at all to laugh because Ford ultimately wasn't interested in special effects but in people and their effective characterization.".

He had an incomplete trip with Mister Roberts in 1955 but then made it back for Donovan's Reef in 1963. Both The Hurricane and Donovan's Reef deal with racism and have as their settings French colonial possessions in the south Pacific. Of course Donovan's Reef takes a far more light hearted approach. In both films Ford feels that colonialism is at best a mixed blessing for the native populace.Jon Hall is a happy and content resident of the small island of Manakoora with a new wife. He's a sailor by trade first mate on a ship captained by Jerome Cowan. While in Tahiti he defends himself in a barroom brawl but gets sentenced for assault because he struck a white man. An obnoxious lout with political influence. His lot is made worse with repeated attempts to escape adding time on his sentence and all kinds of torture physical and psychological by a cruel guard played by John Carradine.Meanwhile back on Manakoora wife Dorothy Lamour gives birth to a child and Hall becomes something of a native folk hero. That's most unsettling to the Governor Raymond Massey. Massey is one uptight dude with a lot of issues. He says he's defending the law but he knows he's defending the concept of white supremacy and that fact isn't escaping any of his peers including his own wife Mary Astor.Thomas Mitchell got nominated for his performance as a doctor with a bit of a thirst problem on Manakoora. A decent man he's revolted by a lot of what he sees. As is C. Aubrey Smith the priest. Both Mitchell and Smith take comfort where they can Mitchell in booze Smith in his Catholic faith. Mitchell lost to Joseph Schildkraut for Best Supporting Actor but two years later won with essentially the same role in Stagecoach.The Hurricane won the very first Oscar given out for Special Effects and the hurricane which should have been called a typhoon in that part of the world even today is something to see. You will not forget the fury of nature that destroys C. Aubrey Smith's church. This ain't your Wizard of Oz type storm.".

Despite sympathetic tendencies of others Hall is convicted of striking a white man and imprisoned in Tahiti600 miles away. He escapes in time for the big blow that seems to his the island in retaliation for the white man's laws.Lamour is quite good as the island beauty and Hall brings more to his role than the usual hunk attitudes and poses.

John Carradine is the sadistic guard. Spencer Charters is the inept judge. Inez Courtney is the girl on the ship. And best of all is the regal C. Aubrey Smith as the island priest.The hurricane is awesome and the special effects among the best of the decade. The scenes of Astor crawling along a rope to find refuge in a tree and windblown Smith playing the organ as the church roof blows away are great. The destruction of the island is totally convincing and becomes almost mythic as a natural force to wipe out man's inhumanity. Great film and very underrated.".

I felt overall it was an excellent movie.

The original novel was written by Jon Hall's uncle. On the island of Manakoora Terangi Hall and Marama Lamour marry amidst a happy celebration though their happiness will be shortlived. Terangi must deliver cargo to Tahiti though Marama has a premonition about the trip and warns him not to go. While in Tahiti he gets into a barroom fight and is sentenced to 6 months in prison. The governor of Manakoora DeLaage Raymond Massey despite the urgings of his friends and his wife Mary Astor refuses to ask for Terangi to be brought back to Manakoora and put on parole. Unable to endure a life with no freedom and desperate to get back home Terangi continually attempts to escape. Each time he does 2 years are added to his sentence until he has to serve 16 years. At last Terangi escapes and makes his way back to his island where he meets his daughter for the first time. Knowing that DeLaage will capture him and return him to Tahiti islanders prepare to help the family sail to another island. But a hurricane actually a typhoon strikes.Besides those mentioned The Hurricane also stars Thomas Mitchell as the French doctor on Manakoora C. Aubrey Smith as the local priest Jerome Cowan as Terangi's captain and John Carradine as a sadistic prison guard.The effects are astounding and are a nomiss particularly considering it is 1937! The tremendous winds the rising waters the trees falling buildings collapsing  all magnificent. John Ford did an excellent job of directing this film which has racism as its underpinning  the prison sentence was the result of a socalled dark man hitting a white man and DeLaage's patrician and cruel attitude has racism at the base of it. I disagree with one of the comments that states that Hall was a whiteskinned movie star trying to pass himself off as a dark man Hall's mother was Tahitian.Dorothy Lamour exotic and beautiful has very little to do in this film except look frightened and lovely  you can count her lines on one hand. Hall a total hunk if there ever was one has more to say and do but one is so distracted by his face and physique that it becomes difficult to pay attention to anything else. The acting burden falls to Mitchell Massey Astor Carradine and Cowan who are terrific.Ford isn't known for his tales of the sea but obviously he was good at everything. He wouldn't see water again until the 1950s. Lamour carried on the sarong tradition in better roles and Hall worked into the mid'60s at the age of 65 dying of cancer and in excruciating pain he shot himself.Highly recommended as a feast of skin and brilliant special effects.".

Although at a quick glance that may seem to be the case in reality nothing could be further from the truth. My uncle worked with Mr. Hall back in the early 1950's. And having Jon Hall play this part was not really a backwards idea because although his features tended to favor his father he was actually the son of a Tahitian mother. It's been said that he was descended from Tahitian royalty as his mother was a Tahitian princess. In the islands he would be referred to as a HapaHaole. A term describing someone who is half Caucasian and half Polynesian or Asian. Also worth noting is that the movie Hurricane was adapted from a book written by Jon Halls uncle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by John Ford with an extraordinary eye for detail and with tremendous sympathy and sensuality this picture will be a surprise for those who only know the later Ford films that explore the male worlds of military life on the frontier. In those Ford seems to take the side of authoritarian severity as if he had come to agree with the Raymond Massey character of THE HURRICANE for whom human nature can and should be broken on the wheel of law. But in this earlier film you can feel Ford's deep yearning for the freedom and eroticism of a natural life of the body and the senses.I grew up with THE HURRICANE which was a staple of TV viewing throughout the '60s and '70s. But seeing it now for the first time in years I am struck by how subversive of convention it must have seemed in the '30s and how much it was in sync with the cultural and political wars of the late '60s. Terangi the kind capable natural man wants merely to live freely and happily but he is imprisoned and tortured and unwittingly finds himself in opposition to a rule of law that is antilove antilife antihuman. Every frame of this film sides with Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall the gorgeous young lovers against the hard fanaticism of Massey's governor. Meanwhile the priest the doctor the sea captain and the governor's own wife are sensible kindhearted if condescending humanists who are on the correct side of the debate but who are helpless in the face of insane obedience to authority.Yes the hurricane is marvelously done impressive and absorbing and it acts as a very necessary catharsis after the anxiety aroused by the many injustices Terangi must endure. But what seems to matter most to Ford is the idyll of sexy young love not seen in films since the first two precode TARZAN pictures from MGM. Once married the couple are stripped of their western clothes by their friends and returned to their nearnaked state wearing sarongs and flower leis. It is Lamour's character who signals to her husband that she is ready for the honeymoon to begin and the camera follows the happy couple to their private island where they lay in the sand to make love under palm trees. Just as sensual is the morning after where Lamour raises the shades of their hut letting the sun fall on her husband's naked back and her hair falls around him as she leans down to kiss him tenderly on the neck. This must have been a powerful vision of romance and eroticism to workaday Depressionweary audiences. The island scenes cast a naive spell like something from Melville's early books of south sea island life. Ford films these like silent screen montages with dissolving images of swaying palms bare tanned legs the look of young tawny bodies and shining hair. Rather than just a professional job for him his work on THE HURRICANE seems deeply felt.Lamour was just right here Though not yet the wry comic actress she would become she was rather gravely beautiful in a way unusual for an American star then and now full of languor and sometimes a startling natural grace. The way Marama suddenly pulls her hair back from her face when first seeing Terangi after eight years is an expressive gesture full of emotion. Hall was very appealing with the grace of an athlete and for all his muscularity there is something feline about him. And for those aware of rumors that director Ford may have nursed closeted yearnings all his life as revealed by Maureen O'Hara in her autobiography of 2005 the fevered way that Hall's body and face are photographed in the midst of his torments will have an added charge and interest.".

Terangi gets married with Marama Dorothy Lamour and sooner he sails to Tahiti. While in a bar playing with other natives Terangi is offended by an alcoholic racist French and he hits his face breaking his jaw. Despite the testimony of Captain Nagle Terangi is sentenced to six months of forced labor since the victim had political connections with the Powers That Be. Captain Nagle asks the Governor Eugene DeLaage Raymond Massey to uses his influence to help Terangi but the governor refuses. Terangi unsuccessfully tries to escape from the prison and each attempt increases his sentence. Eight years later he finally escapes and his jailbreak is celebrated in Manukura. Father Paul C. Aubrey Smith finds his canoe and brings Terangi hidden to the island. But a devastating hurricane also arrives in the island threatening the dwellers. The Hurricane is a tale of injustice in the South Seas that recalls Victor Hugo's Les Misrables. The saga of the sweet Terangi is very similar to the story of Jean Valjean both characters victims of the injustice of the French criminal system in those years. The sequence of the hurricane is very impressive for a 1947 feature. I can not say that the hurricane was brought in a divine intervention since the despicable governor saves his life in the end and most of the natives die.

	schema:headline " A Movie Classic That Never Received Its Due";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hurricane is a movie all movie buffs need to see. It's great on so many levels that its minor drawbacks or imperfections are entirely forgivable. First of all you have one of the best hurricane scenes in any film ever. This is so realistic intense and prolonged that even today you keep wondering how did they do this? This is what hurricanes do  to people's lives and to the topography of our world. But then you look at the cast. Jon Hall was just OK yet we have Thomas Mitchell John Carradine Mary Astor and Raymond Massey  four movie heavyweights who infuse this with its neargreatness putting in performances that fans of great acting need to see. These are actors who usually have a supporting role yet when given the chance they bring a gravitas and realism that rivets the viewer and draws one into the story such that you're bonded to it...entirely invested in the story's outcome rooting for the muchmaligned good characters to win in the end your emotions going up and down with their fortunes. That's the sign of a really really good film. The story too speaks of universal truths and injustices done in the name of imperialistic governments wrongs done native islanders laws applied unbendingly and cruelly and the bitter ends that come of political power struggles  all of this plays out along with the more immediate story the plight of a young couple with a child victims of circumstance struggling to find happiness in a mad political situation that's become of their prior idyllic world. So if you don't pick up on the greater picture or care about it you still care deeply about the lives of these young lovers and their child  as well as their people the native islanders played in some instances by real Polynesians. You have to have patience to get beyond the first few moments in the film where the writing and the acting primarily because of Jon Hall was not as great as the rest of the film because then brilliance takes over as Hall's role greatly diminishes and the story unfolds in all of its horror and wonder and you'll be hooked...on the edge of your seat to the end. Finally...there's some redemption at the end. This is key to a great film and it happens. Not easy to pull off  in a way that moves you. Here it's real and it affects you rewards you  even though as in life the redemption isn't complete or perfect. Like life lives are ruined in the process  which is a credit to this film. It scrupulously avoids the hackneyed and sugar coats nothing. Dorothy Lamour...fine actress beautiful as a saronged islander...has a somewhat limited role though key because she is the angel that makes us really care about the plight of the young family. Her performance though spare is to her credit always believable and full of appropriate intense emotion. No shallow beauty here. In sum...this is a mustsee film!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine film based on the novel by Charles Nordoff and James Norman Hall from Samuel Goldwyn in 1937 and directed by John Ford.  The hurricane scenes alone were outstanding.  I'm told they used up almost the entire water supply from Los Angeles to make this happen on their backlot.  The filming of the sequences of wind and water were magnificent.  Even compared to today's standards.  The performances were very close to the book itself. The island of Manakoora was a small and beautiful island of Polynesian natives in the south Pacific ruled by a gobythebook governor played splendidly by Raymond Massey.  There is a wedding of the chief's daughter Marama played by the alluring and sarongclad Dorothy Lamour to the island's popular hero Terangi played by a handsome youthful Jon Hall related to the author James Norman Hall.  Mary Astor plays Massey's wife who is sympathetic to the lovers who are wronged by a political injustice to Terangi while in Tahiti.  Terangi escapes the prison and heads back to his wife Marama only to be followed by Massey who believes only in justice and the law.  Thomas Mitchell gives another rip roaring performance as the drunken doctor of the island along with C. Aubrey Smith as the Father of the Mission and Jerome Cowan as Captain Nagle.  With the attempt to capture Terangi the hurricane hits the small island and all the natives run for cover.  However most of them are wiped out by the storm and the island becomes a sand belt that the doctor explains happened to have had the misfortune to be born in the path of a hurricane belt.  Nice touch is that Frank Loesser known later for score to Guys And Dolls and Most Happy Fellow wrote a tune that was used as the theme of the film and became a popular tune of the time.  The name of the song is The Moon of Manakoora. All in all a delightful adventurous and romantic film of it's time.".

This was also established Dorothy Lamour's image as an exotic South Sea island beauty even though she was born in New Orleans. This film is also a great commentary on colinization and how any country can wind up treating the natives as less than human.  This truly is an underrated classic.".

The plot of the film is this a very handsome native played by Jon Hall is arrested while in Tahiti for punching a white man and breaking his jaw. Hall is sentenced to 6 months in jail but continually tries to escape thereby increasing his time in jail to 16 years. His reason for wanting to escape is to get back to his home island to his beautiful pregnant wife played by Dorothy Lamour. The kindly priest on the island C. Aubrey Smith and Thomas Mitchell both want the islands Governor played by a nasty Raymond Massey to grant Hall a pardon.The film is very tastefully done and even though the film was made after the Hays code went into effect the film is still quite sensual beautiful shots of Lamour and Hall some risqu shots showing just their legs and in several scenes it looks as though both at one time or another are swimming around naked.The highlight of the film is the final 20 or so minutes when a massive Hurricane though in the South Seas this would be known as a Typhoon approaches the island. The scenes of destruction are quite frankly very realistic and had me on the edge of my seat.Mary Astor must get special recognition in this role. She plays the sympathetic wife of Raymond Massey in this film which was filmed shortly after a very highly publicised divorce case between Astor and her husband Dr. Franklin Thorpe. Astor had been having an affair with married playwright George S. Kaufmann and had kept the details well documented in her diary. When her husband found out the details of this he filed for divorce and custody of their young daughter. The diary was included as evidence in the press and lets just say the press had a field day printing some of the more xrated excerpts of the diary.Portions of the film were filmed on location in Tahiti and the film does the islands justice showing the natives and the beautiful scenery.".

	schema:headline " A hidden Ford gem";
	schema:reviewBody "One of John Ford's best films. It's a pretty straightforward adventure but with a great script and exceptional direction. A young man of the islands John Hall the first mate of a ship marries his childhood sweetheart Dorothy Lamour. A few days later the man sails away to Tahiti. When a white man orders him and his friends to vacate a table Hall punches him which lands him in jail for six months. Unwilling to be trapped away from his wife friends and home for so long he attempts escape after escape from prison and each time he fails and ends up with several more years tacked onto his sentence. Meanwhile on his home island the French governor Raymond Massey is repeatedly asked to repeal the unjust sentence. Although not a bad man his style of governing is strict. Soon Hall does make his escape and Massey is on the lookout for him. Also in choice roles are Thomas Mitchell as the island doctor also a drunk predicting his role in Stagecoach he gives an exceptional performance and won the film's only Oscar nomination Mary Astor as Massey's wife C. Aubrey Smith as the priest his second exceptional performance in a Ford film in 1937 Jerome Cowan as Hall's captain and John Carradine as the prison warden. The native actors are also very good especially Al Kikume as the chief of the island and Hall's father. And satisfying my curiosity over whether Ford had seen and was inspired by Murnau's and Flaherty's Tabu 1931 Reri who was the lead actress in that film has a bit part here. I didn't recognize her however. And then there's the titular storm. Though it often gets compared to the disaster epics of the 1970s it's far more believable and also far more tasteful. Disaster films use death and destruction to entertain with nary a care for the fictional human beings who are dying. This storm is devastating both physically and emotionally. The scene with Thomas Mitchell right after the storm is heartbreaking. The film moves with a perfect story arc starting with a romantic island paradise moving into the frustration of imprisonment and then into the danger of the storm. It also deals with French colonialism somewhat critically. The other Ford film of the same year has to do with British colonialism in India but it's not so harsh. The film depicts the government being unnaturally hard on the islanders. The supporting cast is absolutely perfect although as she gives such a wonderful performance I was wishing Mary Astor had a little more to do. John Hall and Dorothy Malone have excellent screen presence. Hall is quite good himself. He never achieved much success in his career. Malone is probably the weakest part of the film. She doesn't deliver her lines very well. The two are to seem as islanders of course and while Hall accomplishes it pretty well Malone doesn't. Fortunately she's barely in the film. She was the draw of course but it was her sexiness not her acting Hall's sexy as well or er um I'm only guessing wink. There is a scene near the beginning where after they are married in a Christian ceremony the other islanders strip off their clothes for their own this predicts Ford's multiculturistic celebration in his later island film Donovan's Reef. The more films I see from this period of Ford's career the more I think it was the strongest or at least most consistently strong part of his career. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Brits learn Japanese in WW II India";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on a novel by British author Richard Mason who also wrote The World of Suzie Wong. In The Wind Cannot Read Mason weaves a story that seems to be based on several of his personal experiences in WWII. He studied Japanese and served in the RAF in the Far East where he interrogated Japanese prisoners. This movie is a rather unique war film. It's one of a small number of WWII movies about the war in and concerning the Far East especially India. It covers the training of military personnel to speak read and write Japanese. Is there another film that does that? And it covers interrogation of Japanese prisoners  something rare in WWII films. These aspects give this film historical value. For that reason and the very good acting by everyone in the film I rate it eight stars.The plot and script of the movie are disjointed and the film in three or four places jumps from one place and situation to another rather abruptly. The core of the movie is a love story that is more believable than most romances in war flicks. The location encounter and time in the film lend well to the possibility of a meaningful romance. One military situation in the film stands out for its absurdity. That is toward the end when the three officers who are expert Japanese interpreters and interrogators run into the enemy. What were they doing traveling together in a war zone? A single ambush land mine air strafing or tossed grenade could wipe out all of the British Japanese linguists in the Far East at once. Under no circumstances would those three men be in a lead jeep driving miles ahead of a convoy. Under no circumstances would they be scouting to set up a new interrogation base in an area that wasn't already secured by their own forces. Under no circumstances would they set out without knowing where they were going and where the enemy was. Yet in this movie they do all of those things and drive right into the enemy's hands. This was a combatexperienced Brigadier at the head of the group. In real combat something like this would never have taken place. So it begs several questions. Was this incident as portrayed true to the book? If so was it meant as a black eye to the British for military incompetence at times? And if it was not intended as such why in the world did the filmmakers not change it? They could easily have written another short scenario for Bogarde's injury and then return to his love. But that this scene remains as it is in the film seems to be a jab at the British military for its incompetence at times. And it shows the serious consequences from such incompetence. Surely the killing or capture of three highly trained officers as Japanese interrogators would be a huge loss at the Far East war front.".

Under no circumstances would those three men be in a lead jeep driving miles ahead of a convoy. Under no circumstances would they be scouting to set up a new interrogation base in an area that wasn't already secured by their own forces. Under no circumstances would they set out without knowing where they were going and where the enemy was. Yet in this movie they do all of those things and drive right into the enemy's hands. This was a combatexperienced Brigadier at the head of the group. In real combat something like this would never have taken place. So it begs several questions. Was this incident as portrayed true to the book? If so was it meant as a black eye to the British for military incompetence at times? And if it was not intended as such why in the world did the filmmakers not change it? They could easily have written another short scenario for Bogarde's injury and then return to his love. But that this scene remains as it is in the film seems to be a jab at the British military for its incompetence at times. And it shows the serious consequences from such incompetence. Surely the killing or capture of three highly trained officers as Japanese interrogators would be a huge loss at the Far East war front.";

Charming music embellishes the film and wraps it up in bittersweet romance which never gets too sleazy since there are constant complications.It's an odd film for Dirk Bogarde and a very singular war and love story very much akin to William Holden's war and love experiences in Korea and Hongkong but this is both more idyllic more intimate and more personal since Yoko Tani is a more Madame Butterfly kind of girl more sensitive and vulnerable and Dirk is delicate enough to treat her with care. so he doesn't make matters worse as he did in Simba.The film leaves you with a few question marks though. Whatever happened to the miserable Fenwick? You can only suppose the worst. But the worst gaffe is the tremendous mistake of Brigadier Anthony Bushell not to immediately turn back when he sees an obvious boobytrap on the road a dreadful tactical mistake which no qualified Brigadier would have risked committing. But then without that goof there would have been no great finale to the melodrama.The most beautiful detail of the film is the symbology though which doesn't become clear until afterwards. A sign says that you may not pluck cherry blossoms while they bloom but the wind cannot read and plucks them anyway one of those enigmatic but most appropriate Japanese philosophical adages as a motto for the whole film.".

I'll buy it.The blossom here is the ingratiating Yoko Tani the picker is Dirk Bogarde the wind is love and the sign is Tani's increasingly severe headaches.The film sticks pretty closely to a formula that seemed popular during the 1950s  Love Is A Many Splendored Thing Sayonara South Pacific. A Westerner usually a service man and a local Oriental girl fall in love and eventually usually something separates them. Well as Ernest Hemingway observed every love story is a tragedy if followed long enough because one of the lovers dies.Depending on what distracting additional ingredient are added to the formula it's also known as soap opera. In this instance Dirk Bogarde and a couple of friends are RAF officers during World War II assigned to a school in Delhi where they will learn Japanese while they recuperate from their efforts in combat. The senior officer also a student is a little stuffy but that has nothing to do with the plot. I kind of enjoyed the scenes in the classroom where an expressionless instructor has them repeat phrases over and over until the far more demure expressive and colorful Yoko Tani joins the faculty. It reminded me of the classes I took in Mandarin Chinese until I saw the handwriting on the wall and it was in English.The development of the love affair between Bogarde and Tani is achingly familiar. They visit the Taj Mahal wander through the local market giggle while they sample food from street vendors and stand around watching blind local musicians play tunes in the middle of the street. That's when Yoko Tani first complains that the music is giving her a headache. If you can't divine where that headache is headed  well I feel sorry for you. You need to watch more weepers.There are some scenes tacked on penultimately in which Bogarde and the stuffy senior officer are captured and interrogated by the Japanese but they're not very interesting nor well integrated. The fact that both officers know Japanese isn't even worked into the plot.The Brits turned out some superlative war movies during the 1950s. This isn't one of them.

The dialogue must have turned John Waters chartreuse with envy and the performance by Steven Boyd is akin to what if one of the THUNDERBIRDS marionettes had been cast in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE?. His body language is quite like some poor puppet being randomly jerked around while the puppeteer tries to shake off LSDconjured spiders. And the incredibly strange dialogue from a knifewielding strip joint ownerattempting to be intimidating with a crazy gleam in his eye and tossing his switchblade between both of his hands Pretty? Pretty? No one in the history of civilization has ever talked like any of the characters in this film. If you are fortunate enough to have this unjustly outofprint film at your local video store not only should you rent it immediately but you should invite over all of your friends and let them stare at this mess in slackjawed amazement. A solid 10 on the laughs scale! And you will pee your pants at Tony Bennet's narration performance!!! RENT IT RIGHT NOW FOR GOD'S SAKE!".

	schema:reviewBody "This obscure sublimely overheated film is a second cousin to Valley of the Dolls in terms of pure unadulterated Hollywood camp.  The film is like a massive wad of cotton candy for those who enjoy a two hour trip to movie hell.  Opening at the ceremony for the title statuettes we see that Boyd is the frontrunner for Best Actor.  But first the audience must step back in time to discover how he got there.  It falls to Bennett to narrate the with the most dry delivery of horrendous socko '60's scripting.  Looking like a Dean Martin wax figure that's been left in the sun for two hours he is a stumpy squatty disaster in this film.  Billed as Introducing Tony Bennett he has zero charisma receives corpselighting doesn't sing even once and forever after thankfully played only himself in films.  At any rate as the film flashes back lean mean Boyd in a performance that ensured he'd never see another BenHur is instantaneously irredeemable and agonizing as a big mouthed roamer who's joined by his stripper girlfriend St. John and a passive buddy Bennett.  In these early scenes St. John actually manages to come off as sexy despite a crazed tigress costume and the tacky surroundings.  Soon though she's chewing one end of the scenery while Boyd chews the other.  They meet in the middle where hapless Bennett is sitting like a bump on a log.  Soon Boyd is trying to make it as an actor with the assistance of lovestarved talent scout Parker in a typically dedicated performance and agent Berle solid also in a noncomedic role...at least it is meant to be noncomedic!  Boyd's eternal bad attitude and horrible personality continue to inflict pain on all those around him and the viewing audience.  In the film he has a magnetic presence that draws everyone to him and causes them to embarrass themselves repeatedly.  This charm is invisible to the film's viewers.  One of his victims is the lovely Sommer who looks stunning in an array of Head gowns and intricate hairstyles.  His rise to the top of his profession is spoiled by his own ego and eventually he gets tripped up.  He even gets one of those hilarious dreams with smoke swirling and actors dully repeating their lines. The movie is jampacked with bits by stars who should have known better some of them even Oscarwinners themselves Crawford Brennan Borgnine. Other cameos of people playing themselves lend a faux verisimilitude to the proceedings Hopper shortly before her death Head Hope Oberon even James Bacon appears at a press conference looking pouty because Archerd got all the lines.  There's a great little part for Hale as a snotty demanding starlet and it's one time when Boyd comes off well.  Lawford has a bit as a fallen star who works in a restaurant.  Sadly his own career would soon hit the skids as well.  Adams adds a bit of verve as Borgnine's showy wife.  She has one unfortunate scene though in which her behind is spread right in front of the camera.  The film is a feast of kicky '60's production design fun clothing and enormous hairdo's.  There are a few clever touches in the film.  At least twice scenes involving different people are duplicated to show the parallels.  The film has one of the alltime hilarious surprise resolutions...one last cackle before the credits roll.  A MUST for any connoisseur of bad films!".

Bad move.I was hoping for an over the top completely ridiculous scenery chewing melodrama and I was rather disappointed. Granted Stephen Boyd definitely does have some ludicrous dialog and plays bigger than he should for what he's doing but it really isn't fun to watch. Even more to the point there's no one in the film who can challenge him. Milton Berle comes the closest as his agent. But Berle doesn't get to crack wise as we would expect him to do with a knucklehead client like this one. He plays it straight up. What was the point of that? And Elke Sommer is such a conflicted character it's difficult to understand what she brought to the film aside from the obvious eye candy intended.The other oddity is in seeing Tony Bennett play his one and only acting role. Clearly he wasn't ready for this sort of challenge and I can't blame him for begging off film for the safety of his music career after this disaster. Wasted were Oscar Winner Ernest Borgnine who plays some two bit private eye and Edie Adams who actually seems the most realistic character in the entire film. Also Edith Head the multiple Oscar winning Costume Designer who was seen on screen in three different scenes and uttered half a word. But I'm seriously still reeling over the credit spoilers. If you do watch this film and I don't recommend you do because it definitely isn't good and it unfortunately isn't bad enough to be amusing don't read the opening credits!".

Clearly he wasn't ready for this sort of challenge and I can't blame him for begging off film for the safety of his music career after this disaster. Wasted were Oscar Winner Ernest Borgnine who plays some two bit private eye and Edie Adams who actually seems the most realistic character in the entire film. Also Edith Head the multiple Oscar winning Costume Designer who was seen on screen in three different scenes and uttered half a word. But I'm seriously still reeling over the credit spoilers. If you do watch this film and I don't recommend you do because it definitely isn't good and it unfortunately isn't bad enough to be amusing don't read the opening credits!";

And sad to say that was something Stephen Boyd just doesn't bring to The Oscar.Even when one is an antihero there has to be certain qualities brought out that make you root for the guy. Two minutes into watching The Oscar and I wanted to punch out Stephen Boyd. This guy is all heel with no charm and uses people like toilet paper.Joseph E. Levine assembled quite a cast to support Boyd and I don't think I've ever seen so much talent squandered on such a mediocre picture. Try counting the number of Oscar winners in it. Just Edith Head's Oscars and she plays herself in the film must bring the total to over 20. She got a nomination here for costume design one of two The Oscar got the second was for ArtSet design.Tony Bennett is the hero's best friend who is similarly used and abused doesn't give a half bad performance and this was to be a breakthrough for him as a dramatic actor like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra. I also liked Milton Berle as his agent.Some of the women in Boyd's life in this film are Eleanor Parker Elke Sommer and Jill St. John. The one I liked best was Jean Hale as a star who the up and coming Boyd is sent on a publicity date with. She's a female version of him so there is one great moment where she gets dumped on literally.One woman who was in Stephen Boyd's life and who always tried to promote his career in her column appears her as herself in one of her last appearances. Rumor has it that Boyd made old Hedda Hopper's life particularly memorable in her golden years. In the old My Favorite Martian series there was an episode where Ray Walston uses a special light bulb in the room and it gives off a benevolence bulb. You just become inexplicably likable to all around. Bill Bixby sees this as a great way to score with women and he uses it. But Walston tells him that on earthlings it gives you a hate me glow and the two spend the rest of the episode trying to find the antidote. That's what Boyd projected here a two hour hate me glow. And in fact this review is dedicated to an attorney I knew back in Brooklyn a man who had ambitions for a great political career but had a hate me glow that made Boyd look like Albert Schweitzer. No names of course but Ronald J. D'Angelo this film is for you.The Oscar is a campy all star look at an ambitious actor and if you can stand the hate me glow that Boyd projects you'll like looking at the stars.".

Everyone that is except Tony Bennet who would have served the film better by being a singer in a nightclub scene. Elke Sommer does strange things with her eyes to emphasize emotion and many of the fine actors must have cried themselves to sleep the night of the premier or thrown tantrums aghast at what they had been part of.

This film IS Hollywood of the mid '60s.The Oscar isn't any worse than 75 of the films of the era. Or today when you get down to it. In that day an allstar cast was employed to conceal all inadequacies these days CGI fulfills the very same function. I get it. A lot of people don't simply because CGI is so big and bombastic by its very nature as to overwhelm judgment. Another fifty years from now I think there are going to be lots of films like The Oscar films that people laugh at because they have nothing going for them but an obvious patch meant to cover their weakness. You can bet on it.The film is built around three male roles with everyone else more or less stepping out of their way for the big acting moments given to them. Boyd always the stonyjawed steelyeyed manly male actor is exactly as you remember him. Tony Bennett does a really nice job which is a pity given this films negative rep. Milton Berle was a surprisingly good dramatic actor and proved it in many films and TV shows just like this one. Eleanor Parker rises above the secondary status to which the actresses in this film are consigned. She makes the development from haughty to pathetic entirely credible.Bottom line Enjoy it as a chance to see names names names even if you don't buy the drama or the story. It comes straight from the heart of the last demi golden age just past the decline and disappearance of The Golden Age of Hollywood. It commemorates this unique time and place as well as any film.".

Another fifty years from now I think there are going to be lots of films like The Oscar films that people laugh at because they have nothing going for them but an obvious patch meant to cover their weakness. You can bet on it.The film is built around three male roles with everyone else more or less stepping out of their way for the big acting moments given to them. Boyd always the stonyjawed steelyeyed manly male actor is exactly as you remember him. Tony Bennett does a really nice job which is a pity given this films negative rep. Milton Berle was a surprisingly good dramatic actor and proved it in many films and TV shows just like this one. Eleanor Parker rises above the secondary status to which the actresses in this film are consigned. She makes the development from haughty to pathetic entirely credible.Bottom line Enjoy it as a chance to see names names names even if you don't buy the drama or the story. It comes straight from the heart of the last demi golden age just past the decline and disappearance of The Golden Age of Hollywood. It commemorates this unique time and place as well as any film.";

Although it lists on its credits the brilliant and acclaimed scifi writer Harlan Ellison who around this time won an Emmy for his Star Trek script and gifted vet Russell Rouse whose D.O.A. was an actual Oscar surprise in 1950 the film boasts of nothing more than a poverty of imagination. Although it features all kinds of celebrities playing themselves such as Edith Head Hedda Hopper and Merle Oberon and although it has some of the best character actors playing supporting roles including Milton Berle Peter Lawford Eleanor Parker Jack Soo Walter Brennan I mean the list goes on and on  people who should not be in this movie frankly  its emotional center is a character played by a nonactor Tony Bennett and leading man Stephen Boyd plays it like a 200 soap opera. I mean they could not have invested more in the support of this movie and less in the leads.Much respect to Mr. Bennett  he's a wonderful singer and a great celebrity but he does not look good in a movie. He looks kind of impish his character is given nothing to do but complain and the character is built on a contradiction  he's a sensitive man as we see in his early scenes with the stripper played by Jill St. John another example of the movie's creativity and yet he hangs out with this bizarre sociopath played by Boyd. Boyd's character is just incredible. The best scene in the movie is when he lurks behind a cabinet listening while an obese coworker makes a pass at his girl Elke Sommer delivering a typically phonetic performance and disses him then comes around the corner and punches the guy in the nuts whereupon the man makes a comical face covers his mouth and runs into the bathroom! And believe me or don't but this scene was actually NOT written as comedy! The movie is highly watchable despite being such a disaster.... well partly because it's a disaster but also because the support is really excellent. Maybe sensing the Oscar in the air both Berle and Parker deliver the goods and the scene with Peter Lawford is touched with semiautobiographical sorrow. Every two or three minutes if you keep your eyes open you'll see somebody interesting at least to fans of Hollywood classics. But the drama is so over the top with Boyd's performance coming off almost like a villain from the Batman TV show I mean it's impossible to take the movie seriously for five minutes. I'm surprised Ellison allowed them to leave his name in the titles. Of all the films that have ripped him off and not given him credit it's funny to think that his name is actually on this steaming pile.By the way at least I learned something from the movie  I'd never seen a picture of Edith Head much less footage of her and I instantly realized that she is the basis for the character in The Incredibles the little woman who designs the superhero costumes. Costume designer yeah.....If you're in doubt.... see it. It's terrible but in a uniquely 1960s American way.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the name Harlan Ellison doesnt mean anything to you let me point out that he is one of the most respected science fiction authors of the 20th century . Ellison also wrote a couple of episodes of the original OUTER LIMITS series in the early 60s which James Cameron seemed to have borrowed for THE TERMINATOR . In fact Cameron borrowed so heavily that Ellison won a succesful court battle for plagerism and latter prints of THE TERMINATOR acknowledge the works of Harlan Ellison . Seeing as Ellison co wrote this screenplay you wonder if Harold Robbins didnt think about doing something similar at one point !!!! SPOILERS !!!! This screenplay has Harold Robbins ugly signature written all over it . Its a melodramatic pot boiler along the lines of THE CARPET BAGGERS set in the movie world . The story opens at the Oscars where Frankie Fane is rubbing his hands in anticipation of getting his hands on the academy award for best actor . The story then flashes back to Frankies younger days and for the rest of the movie were shown hes an amoral manipulative S.O.B from the mean streets . In a rather contrived manner were shown how he got into movies  His knife skills served him well  then once he got his foot in the door he walked all over everybody  he exploited everybody  he used everybody to make it to the top of the movie world . Duh isnt that how everyone makes it Hollywood ? I think Tom Hanks and a few other people may be genuinely nice human beings but can you say that about most players and movers in Hollywood ? So it seems rather rich Frankie Fane should be condemned for exploiting people And theres a confusing morality message to all this . All the way through the movie were wanting to see Frankie fall on his face which happens in the end since the best actor Oscar goes to Frank Sinatra  but think about it  Frankie is an amoral shark  hes no scruples and hebasically a ruthless thug but hes become a major movie star  he has lots and lots of money and theres no certainty that he will never win an Oscar in the future . Is this actually the fate you would want to see happen to a movie villain ? If having a movie career as a film star with loads of cash in the bank and an Oscar nomination is failure Id sure like to how success is defined ? I suppose its open to conjecture if Mr Sinatra invited Frankie to the after show party where he was never seen again but Id better not comment on that in case I wake up with a horses head in my bed THE OSCAR isnt all bad despite it being a bad movie . Its one of those movies that has a watchable quality mainly down to its schlock value . If you like Harold Robbins novels youll like this though perhaps fans of Harlan Ellisons work should stick with THE TERMINATOR".

If you have the desire to keep with it it becomes totally engrossing. It's so over the top in its presentation you can't argue with the fact that it entertains. In fact it boasts a very colorful and memorable supporting cast including Elke Sommer Eleanor Parker Ernest Borgnine Edie Adams and Milton Berle who is surprisingly believable and underplays his role as Stephen's agent. Despite the fact that Stephen Boyd's ego is practically the whole show everyone else is just great in their roles especially Edie Adams. If you get a chance to catch this don't turn the channel. In fact I'd watch it again right now. It's that much of a guilty pleasure. It's the kind of bad picture that is a lot of fun and is better than it has a right to be.

	schema:reviewBody "The Sandpiper was the second in a number of films The VIPs was the first made together by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Their romance which had begun on the set of Cleopatra had both enthralled and scandalised the public and the studios wanted to make the most of their notoriety. The public perception of Dick and Liz as a glamorous but scandalous couple can only have been increased by the subjectmatter of The Sandpiper. At one time a film about a clergyman engaged in an adulterous affair would have been an unthinkable violation of the Production Code. By 1965 however the Code although not quite dead was no longer in robust health and a film on this subject although still highly controversial was no longer impossible.Taylor's character Laura Reynolds is an unmarried mother who works as an artist and lives with her nineyearold son Danny in an isolated California beach house. The film's title derives from an injured sandpiper which she rescues and nurses back to health thereafter and becomes a symbol of freedom. Danny's behaviour however has got him into trouble with the law and a judge orders her to send the boy to a local boarding school. Laura is reluctant to do this she is a free spirit who distrusts any form of institutionalised education. To make matters worse from her point of view the school is run by the Episcopalian Church and she is an atheist whose attitude to religion is one of positive hostility rather than mere indifference. Nevertheless she realises that she must comply with the judge's order or risk losing custody of her boy.Burton plays Dr. Edward Hewitt an Episcopalian priest and headmaster of the school. Although his values are very different from Laura's Edward is something of an idealist and is becoming disillusioned with his life at the school feeling that he is neither a priest nor an educator but merely a fundraiser. The school is currently engaged in a major fundraising drive to build a new chapel something Edward feels is unnecessary. Edward takes a great interest in Danny's progress and finds himself increasingly drawn towards Laura possibly because she is so different both from him and from his wife Claire. Claire is attractive and supportive of her husband but rather staid and conventional compared to the bohemian Laura. Eventually Edward and Laura begin an affair even though he is a married man. This plot line reminded me of Iris Murdoch's novel The Sandcastle published a few years before The Sandpiper which also dealt with an adulterous affair between a married older schoolmaster at a boarding school and a young female artist.Danny himself does not play a major role being more of a plot device than a character in his own right. I felt that this was a weakness given that one of the themes of the film is two different philosophies of education. Laura's view is that all formal educational establishments particularly conservative boarding schools like Dr Hewitt's are undesirable because they exist in order to turn children into conventional conformists. Her own solution however homeschooling Danny in a remote part of the world away from any other children and without a fatherfigure in his life struck me as being likely to turn him into a selfcentred loner although the film rather shies away from criticising Laura on this point. The opening scenes in which Danny shoots a deer strike a particularly jarring note. It seemed to me highly improbable that a woman like Laura whose whole philosophy seems to be one of living in harmony with nature would allow her young son to have a rifle and then when he uses it to kill an animal out of wanton curiosity shrug the whole thing off as a harmless youthful escapade.Elizabeth Taylor looks stunning but neither she nor Burton are really at their best here. Burton is certainly not as good as he was as the worldweary spy in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold also made in 1965. The relationship between Edward and Laura is not based simply upon sexual attraction but upon a growing realisation that despite their differences they are kindred spirits. The unbeliever Laura paradoxically has more in common with Edward's Christian idealism than does the conventionally pious Claire. The trouble is that one never really senses in Burton's performance the idealistic religious believer hiding behind the mask of the formal and pedantic schoolmaster. Taylor always comes across as slightly too glamorous to be altogether convincing as a protohippie.The film contains some attractive photography of the Californian coastal scenery although the colours in the indoor scenes are often rather dull and there is a notable musical score including the song The Shadow of Your Smile. As a psychological and emotional drama it has its points of interest but overall it is a rather dated sixties periodpiece most interesting as a record of that decade's official Golden Couple. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sandpiper is not a great movie but it has a certain appeal and is graced by some beautiful seascapes along the rugged Big Sur coastline. The opening sequence a montage of steep emerald hills and deep blue sea shot from a helicopter is particularly well done featuring a deer dashing up one of the oakcovered slopes building swells breaking on the rocky shore and one or two fiery red sunsets. Similar scenes continue to bolster the sense of setting throughout the movie. The storyline although interesting can't quite live up to the dramatic natural location. The love affair between Richard Burton a jaded Episcopalian priest and headmaster at a boys school in San Simeon and Elizabeth Taylor an alienated artist seeking peace and solitude at an isolated beach house is reasonably convincing. Yet the priest already has a comely wife in the form of Eva Marie Saint and his motivation for stepping outside their marriage isn't well explained except that he wants to recapture the idealism of his youth. When a local judge orders that Taylor's troubled son must attend Burton's school he is almost instantly attracted to her and apparently there is nothing to be done about it. Set in the midsixties when sexual morays were loosening but we were still in the grip of a churchy moralism this had to be a controversial film and I vaguely recall that it was. You can visit the locations used in the movie because some are easily recognizable such as the storeclubrestaurant in Big Sur known as Nepenthe. And of course there are the famous stone bridges on Highway One spanning two or three of the rugged chasms. Coursing through the movie especially during the several seascapes is the theme The Shadow of Your Smile. It's a nice movie if not a great one and worth seeing more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not only in Cleopatra but in her next two films as well The V.I.P.s and The Sandpiper Taylor was more the worldfamous celebrity and less the conscientious actress than at any other time in her career The three movies exploit the public's fantasy of what the lovers must be like tempestuous as in Cleopatra quarreling on the verge of separation as in The V.I.P.s illicit lovers defying the moral norms as in The Sandpiper. As the ancient Queen of the Nile as modern day grande dame or as a hippie artist Taylor is Taylor hemmed in by her spectacular fame The international celebrity the world's most famous lover takes over from the burgeoning actress of the Fifties and Taylor walks through the movies as the fabled beauty she'd become rather than the highstrung Southern belle she had been before RomePlaying an unmarried woman who lives with her son exactly the way she wants to live in harmony with the California coast Liz Taylor for once gets to talk about ideas her character proclaims the joys of independence and selfexpression Taylor is no Jane Fonda alight with radical fervor but the role does express something of herself it lets us see a side of her that differs from the standard screen Taylor Here she's a 'new' woman free and wise who teaches a thing or two to a rigid churchman The film's symbol is the sandpiper with a broken wing which she offers as proof that every creature should be allowed to fly freeWe know too much about her to believe her as a hedonistic artist who would dress so fashionably in such an impossibly expansive beach house... The character's broad humanistic philosophyher objections to organized religion and to formal schooling her advocacy of free love and her celebration of the naturalness of physical loveare oddly enough at the film's center The story that interrupts the characters ongoing declarations about life is the old number of a minister tempted by a beautiful woman Bombarded by the artist's charms the man succumbs only to depart at the end weighed down by guilt and vowing to seek the way of repentance and purificationThe movie's morality is thus a mingling of the old and the new The movie plays it both ways admiring the woman's freedom and righteous selfjustification but making the clergyman pay dearly for his indulgence in forbidden fruit It's an old Hollywood romance trying to masquerade as a love story in the modern manner Burton's prude is impossible and he plays him in a harsh oratorical manner as if he's deadening himself to the pain of it all but Taylor's character almost approaches being a real rebel with ideas The movie exploits the public image of her as a challenger of conventions but the role also gives her a chance to sound reasonably articulate about matters other than love Under Vincente Minnelli's graceful guidance Liz is sweet if not entirely convincing".

As the ancient Queen of the Nile as modern day grande dame or as a hippie artist Taylor is Taylor hemmed in by her spectacular fame The international celebrity the world's most famous lover takes over from the burgeoning actress of the Fifties and Taylor walks through the movies as the fabled beauty she'd become rather than the highstrung Southern belle she had been before RomePlaying an unmarried woman who lives with her son exactly the way she wants to live in harmony with the California coast Liz Taylor for once gets to talk about ideas her character proclaims the joys of independence and selfexpression Taylor is no Jane Fonda alight with radical fervor but the role does express something of herself it lets us see a side of her that differs from the standard screen Taylor Here she's a 'new' woman free and wise who teaches a thing or two to a rigid churchman The film's symbol is the sandpiper with a broken wing which she offers as proof that every creature should be allowed to fly freeWe know too much about her to believe her as a hedonistic artist who would dress so fashionably in such an impossibly expansive beach house... The character's broad humanistic philosophyher objections to organized religion and to formal schooling her advocacy of free love and her celebration of the naturalness of physical loveare oddly enough at the film's center The story that interrupts the characters ongoing declarations about life is the old number of a minister tempted by a beautiful woman Bombarded by the artist's charms the man succumbs only to depart at the end weighed down by guilt and vowing to seek the way of repentance and purificationThe movie's morality is thus a mingling of the old and the new The movie plays it both ways admiring the woman's freedom and righteous selfjustification but making the clergyman pay dearly for his indulgence in forbidden fruit It's an old Hollywood romance trying to masquerade as a love story in the modern manner Burton's prude is impossible and he plays him in a harsh oratorical manner as if he's deadening himself to the pain of it all but Taylor's character almost approaches being a real rebel with ideas The movie exploits the public image of her as a challenger of conventions but the role also gives her a chance to sound reasonably articulate about matters other than love Under Vincente Minnelli's graceful guidance Liz is sweet if not entirely convincing";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was designed to take advantage of public curiosity about the recent marriage of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton who were kind of the Bragelina of the 1960's. Their star power were enough to make this picture a hit at the box office. Here Taylor plays a freespirited beatnik artist and single mother. She lives on the beach in a glamorous shack and makes a living as an artist while raising her son. Very touching. Her son played by Morgan Mason gets into trouble and winds up being sent to a religious boarding school. The school is run by the Reverend Richard Burton along with his pretty and supportive but staid wife Eva Marie Saint. Well Burton is going through a midlife crisis and it comes to fruition when he first meets Taylor and is taken by her heavy makeup and look at my breasts wardrobes. So he visits her home to help her keep tabs on her son's progress at school and meets some of her beatnik friends including Charles Bronson absurdly cast as a hippie sculptor. What happens then? Well after taking forever to set up the story Taylor and Burton fall in love and have an affair to the surprise of no one. In the process we are treated to the majestic Big Sur beaches and beautiful music including the Oscarwinning theme song The Shadow of Your Smile. In fact the music and seascapes are more interesting than the story and characters who just talk everything to death while the story drags on in predictable fashion. This would have been a better coffee table book than motion picture. My recommendation? Watch the opening credits and closing credits which are by far the best parts of the movie.".

Although not terribly far from Hollywood I am very surprised that more films have not been set around Big Sur and Point Lobos just south of Carmel and Monterey California as it's one of the most beautiful places on Earth. See this location in person if you canI just did and was captivated by its beauty and the film just brought back memories of the place. But...back to the film itself! The Sandpiper begins with a VERY freespirited mother Elizabeth Taylor being hauled into family court because her young son has had another brush with the law. The problems are not serious but the judge is shocked that Taylor is so unrepentant in the way she raises the kid. She's an atheist is extremely permissive and home schools the boy with her own blend of unusual teaching. Nowadays or even in the late 60s this sort of child raising wouldn't have gotten much notice particularly in Californiabut here in 1965 it's a bit scandalousespecially since Taylor's character never married nor does she care about legitimizing the boy. Because of this and the child's actions he is sent to live at a nearby residential school run by the church. Taylor thinks that the Episcopal priest running the place Richard Burton is shocked by all this and immediately dislikes him but he seems rather patient and caring. However through the course of the film the two begin to see each other more and more and it's apparent that soon the two will be hitting the sheets togethereven though he's married to a woman not just God. What's to come of these two? See the film if you'd like.Apart from the great location shooting the film is a mixed bag. Some would clearly be offended by its irreverent plot others bored as it's VERY talky at times and the dialog becomes awful at about 80 minutes into the film and others would love it. Those who like really salacious soaps of the era such as Peyton Place and the like will probably adore the filmas it is filled with fiery content not just the affair but an attempted rape and a good looking couple well at least Liz. And in many ways these same folks often felt like they were peering into the real life relationship between this couple. As for me I loved the scenery and laughed at the love story. It seemed contrived and you wondered just how any priest could be that stupid. Plus the dialog between Liz and Dick on the beach was pretty laughable as was the fight at the 106 minute mark and Dick's sermon towards the end. I see the film as a guilty pleasure you see once...and only once. Then afterwords to make penance for this you should watch a really GOOD film! By the way despite the name San Simeon School is supposed to be in nearby Monterey just north of Big Sur and has no relation to the Hearst mansion San Simeon a couple hours south. Also I was impressed by a supporting role by James Edwards. For a black actor it was a great rolea nonblack and nonstereotypical role. For its era it was ahead of its time.".

	schema:reviewBody "For their third film together and their first as a newlymarried couple the Burtons chose one of the most infamous bad movies of alltime the hilariously misguided effort THE SANDPIPER 1965. The film had a great pedigree starting with director Vincent Minnelli who helmed such classics as 1944's MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS 1958's GIGI and even 1970's criminally underrated ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER and great supporting cast featuring Eva Marie Saint Charles Bronson Robert Webber and James Edwards. Unfortunately the film misses the mark on almost every occasion undermining a potentially interesting love story with poorlydeveloped characters and cornball dialogue. I won't spend the time discussing the film's clumsy attempts as addressing such complex issues as theology which are handled even worse than the central love triangle.In all fairness Burton has the right degree of sullenness to play the conflicted reverend but the script gives him little else to do other than appear solemn. Burton is unarguably one of the greatest acting talents of his time but this character is so onenote that even he cannot save it. Unfortunately Taylor fares even worse  although she does display a believable rebelliousness that is necessary for her role of the freespirited agnostic artist she is simply out of her element amongst the midsixties beatnik scene. No matter how hard she tries it simply impossible believe a glamour queen like Taylor as a shackliving braburning hippie and the characterization only becomes less convincing and more ridiculous as the movie goes on.In the supporting cast only Robert Webber's villainous Ward makes much of an impression as Eva Marie Saint is completely wasted as Burton's wronged wife and Charles Bronson is as miscast as Taylor as a sexually ambiguous sculptor. Even with its terrible dialogue leaden plotting and unconvincing performances The Sandpiper is still certainly watchable. The location footage of the Big Sur is sometimes breathtaking and the Oscarwinning theme song The Shadow of Your Smile is memorable but these attributes alone cannot lift the movie out the realm of being a bad movie classic. Despite it's dubious quality and unanimously bad reviews from critics or maybe because of them THE SANDPIPER was yet another significant hit at the box office for the Burtons.".

I won't spend the time discussing the film's clumsy attempts as addressing such complex issues as theology which are handled even worse than the central love triangle.In all fairness Burton has the right degree of sullenness to play the conflicted reverend but the script gives him little else to do other than appear solemn. Burton is unarguably one of the greatest acting talents of his time but this character is so onenote that even he cannot save it. Unfortunately Taylor fares even worse  although she does display a believable rebelliousness that is necessary for her role of the freespirited agnostic artist she is simply out of her element amongst the midsixties beatnik scene. No matter how hard she tries it simply impossible believe a glamour queen like Taylor as a shackliving braburning hippie and the characterization only becomes less convincing and more ridiculous as the movie goes on.In the supporting cast only Robert Webber's villainous Ward makes much of an impression as Eva Marie Saint is completely wasted as Burton's wronged wife and Charles Bronson is as miscast as Taylor as a sexually ambiguous sculptor. Even with its terrible dialogue leaden plotting and unconvincing performances The Sandpiper is still certainly watchable. The location footage of the Big Sur is sometimes breathtaking and the Oscarwinning theme song The Shadow of Your Smile is memorable but these attributes alone cannot lift the movie out the realm of being a bad movie classic. Despite it's dubious quality and unanimously bad reviews from critics or maybe because of them THE SANDPIPER was yet another significant hit at the box office for the Burtons.";

	schema:reviewBody "The enormity of Elizabeth Taylor's breasts in this ridiculous 1965 sudser overshadows pardon the pun even the grandeur of Big Sur captured nicely by Milton R. Krasner's expert cinematography. She was at the height of her notoriety as a Hollywood star enflamed by the media for her highly publicized affair with and marriage to Richard Burton who looks understandably embarrassed as her costar probably the least of their bigscreen couplings back in the 1960's. Consider that Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was their next film. Taylor is hilariously miscast as beatnik artist Laura Reynolds a freespirit mother to tenyearold Danny. They live a solitary life in a striking home overlooking the rugged Pacific coast. How she can afford such prime real estate on just her paintings is one of many suspensions of belief the movie asks of the undemanding viewer.The threadbare plot written by four screenwriters including the legendary Dalton Trumbo has Danny being sent to a local Episcopal boarding school for killing a deer out of curiosity. The pompous headmaster is Dr. Edward Hewitt who feels constantly cheapened by his gladhanding efforts to raise funds to maintain the school and build a new chapel. His repressed wife Claire teaches there and in no time Danny starts to enjoy school and the company of the other students. Meanwhile Laura is initially resentful of Hewitt's academic approach but of course given this is Taylor and Burton in their prime they fall quickly into a torrid love affair. Of course Hewitt grows guilty for his uncontrollable passion and confesses to his wife. This leads to a rather absurd but inevitable conclusion. The film's director is surprisingly VIncente Minnelli who can't seem to do anything intelligent with the limp script handed to him and lets his two stars flail excessively on screen. With her zaftig figure and designer outfits Taylor simply looks disengaged while Burton tries to inject some dignity to a basically unsympathetic character but to no avail.Poor Eva Marie Saint is left stranded by Claire's frigidity and ignorance. Charles Bronson has a few silly scenes as a sarcastic bohemian sculptor while Robert Webber has his standard role of a wealthy cad lusting after Laura. Morgan Mason plays Danny insipidly though interestingly enough he would grow up to become Reagan's Chief of Protocol and marry Belinda Carlisle of the GoGo's. Much of the dialogue is painfully bad with a lot of counterculture talk that sounds hopelessly pretentious out of Taylor's mouth yet for all its flaws the film is utterly watchable as a trash wallow. The familiar Johnny Mandel song The Shadow of Your Smile comes from this movie and plays over the opening and end credits. The 2006 DVD contains two vintage featurettes The Big Sur narrated by Burton about the challenges of filming in the area and A Statue for The Sandpiper featuring the artist who carved the redwood statue of the bodacious Taylor used in the film.".

He's on the board at Burton's school and has had his fling with Taylor as well.

Taylor is a naturalist who believes that mankind has no business manipulating young minds as they destroy each other while Burton has forgotten about the initial ideals of why he became an Episcopal priest in the first place. Their love affair threatens to destroy Burton's marriage to the sweet Eva Marie Saint while Taylor's freewheeling lifestyle is constantly getting in the way threatened by fellow artist Charles Bronson and an old beau Robert Webber whom Taylor refers to as a slime.Thanks to the wonderful scenery beautifully photographed to capture each sunset the technical crew could capture the lush score and tight direction by Vincent Minnelli The Sandpiper rises above mediocrity. It may not be a masterpiece but it avoids the melodrama and braying of future Taylor  Burton pairings. In their next film they would perfect the art of dysfunctional coupling with the film version of a certain play by Broadway genius Edward Albee.".

Their love affair threatens to destroy Burton's marriage to the sweet Eva Marie Saint while Taylor's freewheeling lifestyle is constantly getting in the way threatened by fellow artist Charles Bronson and an old beau Robert Webber whom Taylor refers to as a slime.Thanks to the wonderful scenery beautifully photographed to capture each sunset the technical crew could capture the lush score and tight direction by Vincent Minnelli The Sandpiper rises above mediocrity. It may not be a masterpiece but it avoids the melodrama and braying of future Taylor  Burton pairings. In their next film they would perfect the art of dysfunctional coupling with the film version of a certain play by Broadway genius Edward Albee.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tops names in front of and behind the camera went to work on this colorful at times beautiful but muddled and unsatisfying romantic drama. Taylor plays a freethinking beach bumartist whose son Mason takes some of her ideas on life a bit too literally and winds up in trouble. He is sent to a parochial school run by man of the cloth Burton and his wife Saint. Sparks fly between Burton and Taylor then at the height of their extraordinary fame as a real life couple and soon Burton is torn between the blonde prim tall slender Saint and the brunette earthy curvy sensual Taylor. Burton puts up a rather weakwilled fight but soon finds himself enveloped in the charms of Taylor until he's exposed and has to face up to what he's done. Burton who apparently had a fondness at this time for playing priests and the like gives his role a certain amount of weight and commitment but he's defeated by a subpar script and heavyhanded direction. Taylor is all wrong for her role though she gives it her best shot. She's supposed to be a late 20's beatnik girl from Illinois but with her accent and manner it's more than a stretch. Speaking of stretch her clothes in this film are atrocious and seem to get worse every time she appears. Alternating between loud caftans or ponchos skintight clamdiggers and unflattering cinchwaisted dresses with ugly hats it's a rare occasion when she's allowed to look her best in this film. Buttonedup Saint whispers the vast majority of her lines except for her hilarious Method meltdown which is filmed in a long shot and is mostly relegated to the sidelines though she certainly lends the film a touch of class and taste at least. Bronson in another amusing casting gaffe plays a hippie sculptor who takes a dislike to Burton. Webber ably portrays one of Burton's associates who has enjoyed a previous affair with Taylor and who wouldn't mind a reunion. The opening credits for this film are nearly illegible. God save anyone who doesn't have a big screen TV. The scenery of Big Sur is shown off to great advantage however and adds immeasurably to the movie. All the ingredients are there for a stylish involving and striking film but it falls short. It turns into a tiresome stagnant string of ruminations and regurgitations about love and man while the title bird keeps fluttering around symbolically at one point the sandpiper actually SITS on Taylor's head during a lengthy scene! The characters rarely behave or proceed the way anyone with half a brain actually would Taylor and Burton meet in a restaurant in the very locale in which Burton is about to give a fundraising speech?! In a startlingly idiotic move the audience is denied even one scene between Taylor and Saint. This drab story could have used one nice showdown between them. Instead preposterously Burton uses his pulpit to process his feelings for the two teary women as they sit at opposite ends of the congregation. It's worth seeing for the scenery the camp value and to see the Burtons in action during their heyday but it ultimately has to count as a misfire.".

To that end there is much trashy treasure to be found in the star's filmography from the 1960s and '70s. Whether it's a pretentious hog wallow like Boom! campy weirdness like Secret Ceremony and Reflections in a Golden Eye or a Eurotrash psychothriller like The Driver's Seat Taylor's formidable presence outrageous behavior and often ridiculous costuming always manages to increase the movie's entertainment value tenfold. So I was quite excited when I got the opportunity to see The Sandpiper another one of Taylor's missteps from the 1960s. It's as bad as it's reputed to be but unfortunately it's not nearly bad enough to be entertaining.As she was in Boom!' and The Only Game in Town Taylor is miscast here. She's got the attitude for her role as a free spirited artist but she's just a tad too old and way too regal to fit in with the beatniks who surround her save an equallyand hilariouslymiscast Charles Bronson as a beatnik sculptor. Her costuming is a bit too glamorous for the character and her beach shack looks like prime beach front property to me. Director Vincente Minnelli could shoulder some of the blame here. As he demonstrated in his next film On a Clear Day You Can See Forever Minnelli wasn't exactly in tune with the youth culture of the day. In place of potsmoking hippies with scraggly hair and dirty jeans Minnelli gives us freshly scrubbed perfectly coiffed 20somethings in coordinated scarves and ponchos.Richard Burton is a much better fit in his role as a minister though as another reviewer commented what Liz's character sees in him is something of a mystery. A throbbing hunk of passion he is not. And poor Eva Marie Saint is reduced to little more than walk on part though she gets kudos for being able to maintain a stoic expression while a boy recites Chaucer.The dialog is lively if overwrought and ridiculous at the film's beginning but once Liz and Dick fall in love it immediately becomes overheated mush. I spent the last 30 minutes of the movie checking my watch. The beach scenery is nice though. Overall The Sandpiper is more bland than bad and that ain't good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wildly scandalous couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for those who are too young to remember the Brangelina of their day in terms of sex play roles they were miscast in for this mid60s soaper. Taylor is Laura Reynolds a freespirited singlemother artist living a quasi bohemian lifestyle on the California beach. Her son is forcibly sentenced to a religious boarding school unthinkable today! by a judge when he gets into too much trouble and it's either that or juvenile hall. There she meets the headmaster stoic Burton playing stoic David Hewitt an unsmiling humordevoid cleric with a perfect wife the perfectly named Eva Marie Saint playing the naive and saintly wife and perfect life. Hewitt is instantly attracted to the stunning Reynolds and inevitably they end up in bed. For Reynolds it's love for the first time. For Hewitt it's an enlightening experience that forces him to look hard at the values he's based his life on and begin to question them.There are moments of realism such as Hewitt's wife gives him the exact same description of HER life that Reynolds had previously described as her reason for being against marriage. The sandpiper of the title is a little bird rescued by Reynolds and cured of a broken wing but is unable to leave the little beach house. I suppose this is meant to be a metaphor for Hewitt locked into his values and lifestyle he comes to question and unable to leave it until set free by Reynolds.I found the music score corny and too Ferrante and Teischer but others may like it. Charles Bronson is miscast as a beatnik artist as is Taylor who has the right rebellious flair to play the hedonistic artist but is so clearly of another time and place and doesn't fit with the ponchosandbongos crowd. Burton as Hewitt never cracks a smile even when romping about with luscious Liz one wonders why such a soughtafter woman is drawn to him in the first place. Not a bad movie altogether clearly of its time. The California scenery is stunning. The story is somewhat engrossing. It's interesting to watch the leads interact despite being miscast. Not the best Burton and Taylor had to offer but far from the worst.".

There she meets the headmaster stoic Burton playing stoic David Hewitt an unsmiling humordevoid cleric with a perfect wife the perfectly named Eva Marie Saint playing the naive and saintly wife and perfect life. Hewitt is instantly attracted to the stunning Reynolds and inevitably they end up in bed. For Reynolds it's love for the first time. For Hewitt it's an enlightening experience that forces him to look hard at the values he's based his life on and begin to question them.There are moments of realism such as Hewitt's wife gives him the exact same description of HER life that Reynolds had previously described as her reason for being against marriage. The sandpiper of the title is a little bird rescued by Reynolds and cured of a broken wing but is unable to leave the little beach house. I suppose this is meant to be a metaphor for Hewitt locked into his values and lifestyle he comes to question and unable to leave it until set free by Reynolds.I found the music score corny and too Ferrante and Teischer but others may like it. Charles Bronson is miscast as a beatnik artist as is Taylor who has the right rebellious flair to play the hedonistic artist but is so clearly of another time and place and doesn't fit with the ponchosandbongos crowd. Burton as Hewitt never cracks a smile even when romping about with luscious Liz one wonders why such a soughtafter woman is drawn to him in the first place. Not a bad movie altogether clearly of its time. The California scenery is stunning. The story is somewhat engrossing. It's interesting to watch the leads interact despite being miscast. Not the best Burton and Taylor had to offer but far from the worst.";

Two men jump into a white Cadillac and keep following them as one of them Marcel wants the two women to go to another night spot. We also see a somewhat mysterious man who gets on his motorcycle and tails the car and the women. This shadowy figure will remain a mystery until the last minutes of the film yet he will be connected with the women in ways that are not immediately known to the viewer.Jane is a bold woman who seems not to be a stranger to sexual pleasures. Jacqueline on the other hand has a romantic nature. After spending some time with Albert and Marcel in the cabaret Jacqueline is bored and goes home. Jane who goes with the men to their apartment returns home in time to change to go to work. Ginette and Rita are the other friends and coworkers in a small appliance store. Louise the cashier is more or less in charge of the girls and she identifies herself with Jacqueline who in spite of having come in late for her first day at the shop seems to be a kindred soul.Ginette who shares a flat with Jane is a woman living a double life. She works in the shop but is a singer who works in a theater that has variety acts. She doesn't want to let the other girls know what she does. Rita the fourth friend is engaged to a fatuous man who appears to be embarrassed to be introducing her to his parents.These four women appear to be living boring lives. Their only escape is the night life all around them. Jacqueline who is approached by a delivery man at the shop for a date refuses him. At the same time that night at a swimming pool she is saved from Marcel and Albert's horseplay with her in the water by the motorcyclist. This meeting leads to an unexpected turn of events for Jacqueline who doesn't have a clue as to what is going to happen to her. A hint to Jacqueline's fate is comes later in the film as she asks Louise about a fetish she carries with her.This film was not seen widely in this country after it was released. In fact it remains an enigma why it was not discovered by film fans the way it deserved. Claude Chabrol the director who also contributed to the screen play gives the story a great staging. It's one of his works that most closely resembled a product of the New Wave movement as it took the cameras into the streets to show a slice of the lives of these four women that are so closely connected.There is a lot to admire in the way Mr. Chabrol designed this film. He got great support by the amazing cinematography of Henri Decae one of the best in the French cinema. Even after more than forty years after this film made its debut it has much to be admired in what Chabrol was able to accomplish with it. The character studies of these women living ordinary lives reveals the director knew them well.Clothilde Joano makes an impression as Jacqueline. Bernadette Lafont does wonders with her Jane. Stephane Audran who went to star in a lot of films of her then husband is quite effective as Ginette. Lucile SaintSimon is Rita who had a short role. Ave Nimchi has some good moments as Louise the cashier. JeanLouis Maury and Albert Dinan are seen as Marcel and Albert. Mario David plays Albert Lapierre the motorcyclist.This film is a must see for all Claude Chabrol's fans".

	schema:headline " a girl I Vitelloni with even more observation and a curious if obvious Hitchcock angle";
	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol made a film before Les bonnes femmes Les Cousins which is what made him known as part of the French New Wave he preceded Truffaut and Godard by a year. But viewing Les bonnes femmes before seeing Les Cousins I almost feel like this is a director's first film for a director like Chabrol as it shows a lot of his concerns as a filmmaker an observational stance with women their sexuality and their distance from the opposite sex the mundane in a bourgeois life and the Hitchcock angle of danger and the unknown. It's also in line with the other Nouvelle Vague films in the sense that the filmmaker has broken out of any ties to a studio or sets and everything is out in the streets or on location in places like nightclubs and music halls and swimming pools and usually with handheld cameras and seeming improvisation with the actors. This is a gritty onthestreets Chabrol one isn't used to from seeing films like This Man Must Die and The Butcher.And yet I don't know if I can say it's as great as the big early films of the period like The 400 Blows and Breathless. Chabrol's film does carry I'm sure some personal weight. And he's interested in these girls their casual life and goingson and how so easily one of them can be lured by a mysterious man in a mustache who follows them around in a motorcycle. But it's such a loosely structured film barely a plot even less if you can imagine than Breathless that it takes a moment for us to realize something is going on. Which perhaps is part of Chabrol's angle here like Fellini's film I Vitelloni we're just watching these four girls in their everyday occurrences going to a zoo going to a nightclub and hooking up with two obnoxious strangers going to a music gall where one of the girls is secretly singing and doesn't want to go on for fear of embarrassment of the others seeing her and just walking around. Or as well the complacency of working at a TV store where no one comes in.We are drawn in to these girls and who they are however limited they're really shown as full characters moreso Chabrol is interested I think in these girls as 'types' possibly or in looking at them in a semidocumentary perspective. And metaphor is used from time to time I'm sure the visit to the zoo and Chabrol's carefully timed and composed reaction shots of the animals in the cages is deliberate as to the girls' own selfprison of 20something frivolity. And there's also the matter again of the motorcycle guy who somehow charms this girl. Actually not somehow as in this sort of Nouvelle Vague filmworld it's precisely the kind of guy a girl would fall for even one seemingly so uptight as the one he goes after. Seeing how this plays out between them can go one of two ways and how Chabrol shows it in the last fifteen minutes is totally masterful. There's a sense of the inevitable but he keeps us uncertain as an audience which is good. I'm glad I couldn't quite see where the ending would go though when it came it made sense and was satisfying it even raised up the worth of the film overall a full notch.But a masterpiece? Probably not. It's like a breezy fling through a Parisian quarter on the dark streets and cool nights with beautiful girls and notsobeautiful but flirty men and it has some wonderful moments. It just doesn't add up completely into something that makes you want to shake your friend up and say You MUST watch this! like 400 Blows or even The Butcher.".

The surreal modern music at the beginning clues you in and the awesome final scene with the empty tragic eyes of the girl finding her only happiness when a man asks her to dance brings it all together beautifully. Man! what a great film! I didn't want to leave the theater after watching it twice in a row but I was too tired. As disappointing as Chabrol's films have been to me over the years this one was a jackhammer of a surprise. The Hitchcock elements are there but they don't dominate and straitjacket everything else. On a level with Breathless Shoot the Piano Player yet completely unlike either of them this film defines the New Wave aesthetic which to this day some forty years later provides a standard for Tarantino types to strive for. Films like these can only be directed by masters who have the nerve and audacity to bend genres to their whim and speak their ultimate truth through the nature of the medium itself.".

DON'T READ UNLESS YOU ARE 100 SURE YOU DON'T MIND LEARNING ABOUT A MAJOR PLOT TWIST.There seems to be quite a bit of disagreement about this Claude Chabrol film. Some see it as a masterpiece and some really dislike it. I was less than enthusiastic about itmostly because the script seemed to have a lot of problems though the direction was very good.The film is about four female coworkers and is a small snippet of their lives and loves. The problem with it is that some of the characters seemed very shallow and difficult to like or connect to for the audience. One seemed rather trampy and dumb one was engaged to a man who was a real spineless weasel one had aspirations to become a professional singer but hid this from the others and one seemed like a nice lady who dreamed of a Prince Charming to sweep her off her feet. Frankly there was too muchtoo many ladies and none of them were well explored or executed. The film probably would have done better concentrating on one or two.Another problem with these plots is that when this Prince does arrive near the end for the one lady he eventually turns out to be a serial killer and the film ends with her brutal murder. What's entertaining about all of this?! And considering that her character like the others was never fully developed her murder seems less sad and more of a plot device.As for the rest of the film the direction is lovelywith some excellent closeups excellent composition etc.. Overall however I have seen many of Chabrol's films and have found that they are a mixed bagsometimes they work very well THIS MAN MUST DIE and L'ENFER and sometimes the story lacks connection with the characters and they are too often just pawns who are just there to eventually be killed in the film. In fact this is a sort of trademark in his filmssuch that after a while you expect a random and senseless death and so it's only a surprise when it DOESN'T happen.Overall while this film is interesting it's also not particularly noteworthy or enjoyable.".

It's sure gives me some feeling of the nightlife in Paris then. Clotilde Joano is Jacqueline who faces a tragic ending in this movie. I have tried to find out some more about this classic and beautiful actor but the internet contains very little information beside her biography and that she was Swiss and died in 1974.

It is the mood more than the events in the film that make its strong impact. Jane is mesmerizing charming and complex at different times a little girl a rebellious teenager or a flirtatious temptress. On the opposite side Jaqueline is an utter mystery implying a nature both extremely intelligent and extremely troubled. The men in the film are basically facades people there to react to the girls or to lead them into situations where they must react or spoiler coming claim them as their victim. But even in the case of the murder it is less about the killer and more about Jaqueline allowing herself to be taken by him emotionally and what came to her as a result.

I guess now we would call them retail clerks but in 1960 they were shopgirls. The women are all looking for romance and they do no one any harm but their lives are not filled with the glamor and excitement that the term good time girls evokes. They go to music halls public swimming pools and the zoo. They let men cruising by in cars pick them up. They stay out all night and stumble half asleep into work the next day. One of them is pursued and courted by a mysterious motorcyclist.All four young women are attractive. Three of them went on to have important careers in the French cinemaBernadette Lafont  Clotilde Joano and Stphane Audran. Audran later married director ChabrolAlthough Chabrol is a superb director and the actors are talented the film just didn't work for me. The young women had vacant lives they had no aspirations or dreams of something different and they had a naivet that was sad rather than charming. This is a movie worth seeing if you have a particular interest in the French New Wave in Claude Chabrol or in the young actors who were not yet major stars. I wouldn't seek it out as casual viewing. We saw it on VHS and it worked well on the small screen.".

	schema:reviewRating 9;
	schema:headline " Powerful";
	schema:reviewBody "I agree with most of the reviewers.  This movie is just as powerful as it was 44 years ago.  Inside the cheesy braggadocio of an angry gangster is a confused kid.  I can't think of a single person that did not feel alienated as a teenager.  James Dean represents what every teenager would want to be. Individualistic  has a set of values and sticks to them Brave  engages in activities most of us would never consider esp. chicky run Kind  caring to Plato and JudyJames Dean is perfect in his role as Jim Stark.  More is said in this movie through gestures than words.  One lift of his eyebrow one syllable can say so much.  When he does speak you know that he believes what he is saying. The shot of Jim rolling out of the speeding car is amazing.  I can think of few modern action films that have had me riveted to the seat as I was during the switchblade fight.Natalie Wood is superb in her role as well.  Judy is looking for attention that isn't there.  This is perfectly summed up when she says I love somebody all this time I was looking for someone to love me but now I love somebody.  She desperately looks for acceptance and acknowledgment in the wrong places because her father does not want to see her as a young woman.Even though Dennis Hopper's role is rather small you can see that he knows what he is doing.  He portrays in my mind someone easily pushed around when he tries to fit in.  He seems different than the rest of Buzz' gang and even looks more boyish.  He timidly tries to interject a comment in front of Buzz and is just brushed off.I don't think that this movie is strictly an us versus them type of scenario.  Trying to take care of Plato and to protect him Jim realizes that being a parent is not as straightforward as he thought.  His parents are more than just caricatures of the nagging wife and emasculated husband. Everyone in the film is confused about how they fit in to the big picture. The movie is simply told in the self centered manner any teenager would view it as.  This can account for the sequences which many would see as over the top.  I think the central theme of the cosmos presented in the planetarium show demonstrates how teenagers view themselves as the center of the universe.  Thus all the scenes concerning each of the three teens conflicts are equally dramatic.".

	onyx:emotionText "I agree with most of the reviewers.  This movie is just as powerful as it was 44 years ago.  Inside the cheesy braggadocio of an angry gangster is a confused kid.  I can't think of a single person that did not feel alienated as a teenager.  James Dean represents what every teenager would want to be. Individualistic  has a set of values and sticks to them Brave  engages in activities most of us would never consider esp. chicky run Kind  caring to Plato and JudyJames Dean is perfect in his role as Jim Stark.  More is said in this movie through gestures than words.  One lift of his eyebrow one syllable can say so much.  When he does speak you know that he believes what he is saying. The shot of Jim rolling out of the speeding car is amazing.  I can think of few modern action films that have had me riveted to the seat as I was during the switchblade fight.Natalie Wood is superb in her role as well.  Judy is looking for attention that isn't there.  This is perfectly summed up when she says I love somebody all this time I was looking for someone to love me but now I love somebody.  She desperately looks for acceptance and acknowledgment in the wrong places because her father does not want to see her as a young woman.Even though Dennis Hopper's role is rather small you can see that he knows what he is doing.  He portrays in my mind someone easily pushed around when he tries to fit in.  He seems different than the rest of Buzz' gang and even looks more boyish.  He timidly tries to interject a comment in front of Buzz and is just brushed off.I don't think that this movie is strictly an us versus them type of scenario.  Trying to take care of Plato and to protect him Jim realizes that being a parent is not as straightforward as he thought.  His parents are more than just caricatures of the nagging wife and emasculated husband. Everyone in the film is confused about how they fit in to the big picture.

	schema:reviewBody "East of Eden and Giant are both great don't get me wrong.  But this is the James Dean that set the archetype for not only the cool Fifties American teenager but perhaps every teenager since.  Dean has his white tshirt sleeve rolled up for his smokes.  He has his red jacket and blue jeans he's ready to drag and he's ready to fight.  From the first moment we see Dean drunk on a school night busted by the cops he's amazingly both personally secretive and universally accessible at once.  He's hurt lonely and looking for kicks  and no one understands him except maybe just maybe that one person in the audience...Sure this movie has it's faults.  The parents are cartoonish some of the kids are hip in only a stilted sense and a lot of the movie is unrealistic.  There's something disturbingly hokey and amateurish in this portrayal of a typical American town with it's typical American high school. Yet Dean Mineo and Wood put on performances that let the viewer suspend reality all the way through..each of these three put on the performance of their lives!Sal Mineo plays a mousey misfit named Plato whose homosexuality is thinly veiled.  Natalie Wood plays a young women named Judy part of the incrowd who deep down is at wit's end.  Both of these characters are amazingly believable even fifty years later.  Mineo's never been as enigmatic or as compelling as he is here as Plato.  Then there's Wood  as cynical and alone in her world as Judy feels we realize quickly she likes James Dean she needs James Dean  and Dean can dig her.In retrospect it's not surprising that the jacketed juvenile delinquent that Dean plays here would become a role model for both young gay men and young straight men alike. He's comfortable being intimate with Plato his words his expressions are all too much too overly emotional for a straight man.  But the kids the town itself quickly learn Dean's no pushover.  He yells he fights and he's afraid of nothing that other people are afraid of  staring down death is just a way for him to kill time. But he's afraid something just isn't right with his life. And most importantly even if he never really does connect with this typical town filled with typical people Dean does indeed connect  to anyone whose ever been young  and alone.....".

To die also in a manner highlit in this movie  he was coincidentally a promo for it. Fast driving and fast cars. Poor James.What I enjoy most though in all of it is the aforementioned exploration of hitherto fairly underdeveloped film themes in the America of the fifties. For one there is the underlying homosexual element to the Sal Mineo character and his obsession with James. And here James is allowed to indulge and return this love not overtly but it is there the tolerance and acknowledgment of it.The character of Judy played by Natalie Wood is also of tremendous interest. Here there is an incestuous component in her relationship to her father. It seems to me that the father is terrified of his attraction to his gorgeous daughter and keeps pushing her away to the degree that at one point he slaps her as she tries to kiss him. She escapes from home at every chance seeking male attention from wherever she can get it.James' parents are a little overblown and too quickly resolved at the end. But the appearance of an emasculated Jim Backus he wears an apron in case we don't quite get it! is a sight for sore eyes. A little dated in the world of today but so far ahead of its time in 1955.9 out 10. Satisfying on many levels.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was quite impressed with Rebel Without a Cause. I expected it to be quite standard having only gathered its reputation because of the tragedy surrounding James Deans' death. Fortunately it stood up on its own quite well. Its superficial situations are somewhat dated which was inevitable but its themes remain potent after many decades.The major theme is the burgeoning relationship between adults and their teenage children. All three of the main characters are at different stages in this process. Jim James Dean is surprisingly at the earliest stage of this. His mother is pretty distanced and unresponsive already but he still seems to communicate well with his father Jim Backus who is amazing. His character's relationship with his wife also provides an interesting view into 1950s gender politics in one scene Backus is wearing a cooking apron which is very obviously meant for a woman. Judy Natalie Wood whom I didn't even recognize here is almost completely rejected by her father who feels that her affection is out of place in her teenage years. Worst of all is Plato both of whose parents have left him alone in the world. He tries desperately to make Jim and Judy his parents although from this vantage point in time Plato seems resoundingly sexually attracted to Jim and he sees Judy as a threat to their relationship. Although the writerdirector has denied that forever no human being can watch it nowadays without that thought constantly crossing their mind.The reason that I say this film is flawed lies in the actions of Plato near the end of the film. I felt his escalating insanity was kind of a copout. Instead of actually delving into Plato's true character and motives by having intelligent and realistic dialogue and actions he is just made to go batty wherein he spouts off his thoughts as if he were some eight year old or manchild. Plato may have been sycophantic throughout the film but he was anything but a moron. His actions provide an easy way for the directorwriter to answer all questions about his character and then to facilitate an ending which is tragic but more than a little contrived.Despite what I feel is a copout ending Rebel Without a Cause remains a thoroughly powerful film. I liked it and I'll never forget it. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Ray may be the most distinctive American director of the 1950s and certainly the most deeply romantic.  His career was marked by indiosyncratic stories about characters driven by deep internal conflicts inward violence and outward sexual confusion.  Rebel Without A Cause is the film where all of his themes meet and slightly edges out Johnny Guitar and In A Lonely Place as my favorite Ray film.Some people will certainly find the dialogue here to be rather stilted and the performances melodramatic.  I won't argue.  Ray's films in general opposed 'realism' that most unreal of artistic concepts in favor of the mythic.What's particularly satisfying about the film is its cohesiveness binding together its many disparate events and characters with highly parallel themes and motifs.  All of its central characters seem caught in psychosexual conflicts rife with familial gender conflict.  Jim James Dean is caught between a weakling effeminated father and a domineering but inneffectual mother.  Judy Natalie Wood and her father are seperated by his uncomfortable relation to her sexuality.  Plato Sal Mineo worst of all is a practical orphan who suffers all the more for his just under the surface homosexuality. It's interesting to note here that Plato may be Hollywood's first sympathetic of a gay character.  All of them are driven by internal demons springing from these conflicts.As usual Ray is a remarkably sensitive photographer.  And here he proves himself a master of color.  There are too many beautiful scenes to mention here but the planetarium scene with the recorded voiceover about human loneliness beginning of the 'chickie run' are both stunning.The film seems divided between claustrophobic nightmares and utopian fantasies.  The skewed camera angles of Jim's scenes with his parents contrast with the heavenly dream of teenage paradise in the abandoned house. The staircase motif seems to mark several of these transitions.In any case this is a stunning film by a consummate artist and should certainly be viewed apart from the distorting lens of the James Dean myth. Dean for his part is remarkable here although as I stated above the performances here are in a style far removed from what today's audiences are accustomed to.It's quite silly to say as several people have here that this film's themes are 'dated'.  They seem to be the constant themes of youth idealism vs. cynicism the turmoil of sexual awakening the desire to fit in and the internal violence that constantly threatens to become external.  To say that these no longer apply because these kids have never heard of ecstasy or the crips is like saying that Hamlet no longer rings true because nobody swordfights anymore.My one complaint about this film is with the title.  Certainly quite dramatic it sounds more like a marketing tagline than any kind of description of the goings on of this film.  Jim seems less like a rebel than a young man caught in an inescapable turmoil and his reaction to the final tragedy belies his lack of a cause.  But this is a minor complaint and I can recommend this film without reservation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well what I thought was going to be a movie about James Dean being a total rebel turned out to be a movie filled with completely mental teenagers.Let me get started. The character Plato is introduced in the first scene in the police station where all of the other main characters are introduced as well. But instead of being held there for being out too late or for a bit of drunkenness it is discovered that he killed some puppies. This should already be a red flag for his character. And when asked about why he did it he responds with I don't know. Except you can tell that he little douchebag is lying you know that he has some dark reason hidden on the inside on why he killed those puppies. From the beginning of the movie you know that he is going to be a little douchebag. The next day comes and he meets James Dean's character. For some reason he becomes so attached to his character for no reason at all later saying I hope he takes me hunting and fishing because I don't know how and I know he'll teach me. like James Dean is his dad or something. What a weirdo. Then later when he realizes that James Dean is in danger he grabs a gun. RED FLAG. We can tell that no good is going to come out of this. When he falls asleep at the abandoned mansion James Dean and the character Judy go to another room to make out or some crap. Then when the stereotype greasers come to beat him and James Dean up he freaks out and pulls out his gun and almost kills one of the greasers and almost kills James Dean. He then goes into a trance like condition where he acts like a baby and complains about not having a mommy or daddy while running from the police. He ends up dead. Good. Screw Plato. This all takes place in ONE DAY. In ONE DAY he becomes this attached to another person. COME ON.Then there is the character Judy. Judy meets James Dean on the first day of school and treats him like fat people do to salad to fit in with her boyfriend Buzz and his stereotype greaser friends. So then later at the Chicken race or whatever it is called Buzz dies by having his jacket caught in the door before he can jump out. So what does Judy do about her now dead boyfriend? Mourn? Cry her eyes out? Nope! She barely appears sad about it and then moves on straight to James Dean within AN HOUR of Buzz's death. Dear Buzz Sorry but I don't really care about your death because James Dean is here. From Judy. P.S. Screw you. Later in the movie which is only like a couple hours later in the story of the film Judy literally tells James Dean that she is in love with him. Really? She literally just met in him earlier that day. And she is in love with him? It makes no sense at all really I do not like her at all. I wish that James Dean could carry this movie on his own but I just don't like his character that much. I thought he would be more of a rebel but he just acts more like a rebel when he tries to fit in with the rebel crowd.I'm sorry I just thought this movie was really disappointing for me.".

Equally great are the performances of Natalie Wood as a wannabebadgirl who is hurt by her parents' implications that she is a tramp and the childlike Sal Mineo who lives in a mansion with a maid but feels the pains of neglect from neverpresent parents.The trio first meet at a police station where they all see a wellmeaning officer who is genuinely interested in getting these troubled kids back on the right track rather than throwing the book at them. He does seem to reach James Dean who seeks help after getting into more trouble.The relationship between the James Dean character and that of Sal Mineo is somewhat elusive. At times a more than friendly association is suggested then the appearance of Natalie Wood makes it look like an odd threesome. 1950s America was definitely unprepared for any spelling out of suggested terms so for nearly 50 years now anyone's guess as to what was going on here is as good as the next.The supporting cast include Jim Backus as James Dean's welltodo yet wimpish and henpecked father as well as a young Dennis Hopper as a member of a greaser gang. The parade of big name stars in itself is eyecandy of the highest caliber! References to scientific findings are still aweinspiring today. Showing young college students' reactions to film footage during a lecture shows that humans can't fully grasp the insignificance of earthly life compared to the vastness of the universe. Carefully watch the final scene as the end credits are shown when this point is driven home.Rebel Without A Cause is one of the great classics with a sociological impact that has seldom been reached by any film and likely never surpassed. This film is a ceaseless source of discussions. I recommend this film also for high school History Sociology or Language Arts classes.".

For the youth of the middle 1950's Dean's screen image was a symbol of loneliness anger and frustration...Jim's appealing characteristics are his sincerity his warmth toward Judy his concern for his friend Plato whom no one else likes his protectiveness his shyness his bravery his good looks his tender way of kissing and his desperate need to be loved...Jim is a troubled new student in a high school in Los Angeles who is not only willing to reveal that he loves his father but also has the capacity to cry  which he does often...

Each will drive a stolen car toward the brink of a cliff and the first to jump before the automobile lunges over will be a coward...In the 1950s the two basic ways that youth could rebel seemed to be through acts of violence and delinquency and through gathering into groups and being directed by a group leader... Richard Brooks' Blackboard Jungle vividly described that situation...As teenagers we liked being called 'rebels.' At that age we weren't out to destroy the 'system' but like Jim we wanted the 'system' to become more sensitive to our needs to apologize for being careless and to make us part of the existing order...At that age we recognized Jim's failure to communicate with his parents and the way he mumbled when he thought no one was listening and started his sentences over louder and clearer... He was our ideal... Everything he said was so right so clever so cool...When the unfriendly Judy calls him a YoYo and runs off to join her friends he says softly I love you too.

Jim Judy and Plato pretend to be a family unit based on a mutual trust and understanding the only structure which can combat the cosmic emptiness of 'man alone.''Rebel Without a Cause' is the first film to suggest that juvenile violence is not necessarily bred in the poor neighborhoods... It is the disenchanted cry of youth neglected by their parents and alienated from the adult world...Judy sobs that her father stops kissing her when she was sixteen and causes her pain when he labels her a 'dirty tramp.' Plato is lost and in despair because his absent divorced parents have left him completely in the care of a black housekeeper... During questioning he asserts Nobody can help me.In watching 'Rebel Without a Cause' we can see the desperate fatherson relationship the need to be loved and understood as an individual... That is why 'Rebel Without a Cause' is the best of the alienatedyouth films of the period and the most emotional of films...Dean's death in an automobile accident in 1955 was a crippling blow to one of the most characteristic elements of fifties cinema...".

Dean's onscreen persona together with his vivid intense performance overwhelms all other elements in this film about 1950s teenage confusion and angst.Newly arrived in town Jim Stark finds himself trapped in a typically hostile high school and confronted by an incrowd of leatherjacketed hoods with names like Buzz Crunch and Goon. They challenge Jim's honor by calling him chicken. What to do? Jim asks his weak mealymouthed father well played by Jim Backus. But his father is no help. Indeed the film conveys a grim view of adults selfindulgent weak insensitive unobservant and inept.Then there's Plato Sal Mineo the high school kid who has always been alone with no apparent father or mother. In Jim Stark Plato has finally found a friend. Eventually another student joins Jim and Plato. Judy Natalie Wood changes her caddy behavior toward Jim after an event changes her life. But it's still a hostile world and the bond that these three young people form as substitute family is fleeting en route to a poignant ending.The film's characters and thematic tone are representative of a Cold War era in America when the threat of nuclear annihilation hovered over everyone and everything like the sword of Damocles. And thus the story's astronomy motif amplifies a sense of loneliness insignificance isolation and helplessness so characteristic of the 1950s.There are things about this film I do not care for. The compressed widescreen projection in CinemaScope is annoying. The music which varies from jazz to rhythm and blues to nondescript noise is too loud and too manipulative. And there's something vaguely contradictory about a macho James Dean in the role of Jim Stark whom bullies pick on.But none of these irritations can diminish the thematic depth of the story. Nor can they diminish the overpowering presence of James Dean the actor the perfect Hollywood symbol of youthful cool whom actors subsequently looked to as a model of acting excellence and cinematic charisma.".

James Dean is a good actor but honestly aside from him everyone else is over the top.Let me first list a few things that seemed completely implausible to me The people in James Dean's new town hate him immediately without him even doing anything.  A highschooler gets his shirt caught in a car door flies screaming off the edge of a cliff to a explosive firey death and no one cares.  These first two problems wouldn't be that bad if the movie didn't appear to be going for an element of realism.  If the whole thing was played as little surreal or as some sort of social black comedy I could accept these events but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.The character of Plato is atrocious both acting wise and thematically wise. And yet he becomes the focal point of the movie.  My biggest problem is that the themes are literally batted over the audience's head.  It becomes immediately clear that James Dean is serving as a replacement father figure for Plato.  Plato has mentioned he has no father and no friends it just becomes very obvious.  Does he really need to say things like yeah I'm hoping we can go on fishing trips like my dad used to take me on.  I refuse to believe audiences were that dumb in the 1950s.  as an aside the person who argued that Plato was gay I agree that this is intentional how else would he be so attracted to James Dean after only knowing him 3 seconds and the movie does get some points for slyly tackling a taboo thing like that. However I desperately wanted Plato to fall victim to a flail of gunfire by the final scene.Maybe my hopes were too high It could be that all the themes in this movie have been redone in more audiencetrusting fashion.  Still James Dean was a much better teen idol than we have nowadays.".

	schema:headline " A Classic the Bestever Film about Adolescence";
	schema:reviewBody "Contains spoilersFilms about juvenile delinquency were not new in 1955 but earlier films on the subject such as 'Angels with Dirty Faces' from the late thirties and even others from the same period such as 'Blackboard Jungle' which also came out in 1955 had tended to locate the problem among the urban poor of the slums. 'Rebel Without a Cause' is different in that it focuses on delinquency among the teenagers of an affluent middleclass community.The film starts with a teenage boy named Jim Stark being arrested by the police for being drunk and disorderly and taken to the police station. His parents have recently moved to the area and he is depressed because his parents move house frequently and he finds it difficult to make new friends. The school which he attends is dominated by a culture of swaggering masculine bravado and aggression. A premium is placed on displays of physical courage and on proving one's worth by fighting the worst insult in this society is 'chicken'. Boys are expected to fit in with the prevailing ethos in order to gain the respect of their peers and to stand a chance of getting a girlfriend. Although Jim longs for friendship and acceptance he is also skeptical of this ethos which makes him something of an outsider. He quarrels with Buzz the leader of the 'incrowd' who accuses him of being a 'chicken'. Jim feels forced to prove his courage against Buzz first in a knifefight and then in a 'Chickie Run' a ritualised test of nerve which involves driving stolen cars as close as possible to the edge of a cliff before jumping out. During the latter Buzz is killed when he is unable to escape from his car in time it is Jim's feelings of guilt arising from this incident and the desire of Buzz's friends for revenge which provoke the film's tragic climax. Although much of the comment about this film has concentrated on the charismatic figure of Dean the film is not just about Jim. It has at its heart a triangular relationship between Jim and two other teenagers Judy and Plato all of whom can be seen as a rebels 'without a cause' in the sense that they are not motivated by any political or social ideal but also 'with a cause' in the sense that there is a reason why they act as they do. Nevertheless in each case the cause of their revolt is subtly different. Each has been brought up in a different way. Jim's parents are kindly and liberal but are too indulgent. His father in particular is wellmeaning but weak unable to provide his son with intelligent advice or with a rolemodel of manliness. Plato whose real name is John but who prefers to be called by his nickname which suggests his intellectual nature is a strange lonely boy. Our first view of him is at the police station where he has been arrested for shooting some puppies. We do not learn any more about this incident but what we hear is enough to suggest that Plato is emotionally disturbed. Plato's parents are separated he never sees his father and his mother is frequently absent leaving him to be brought up by an elderly maidservant. The shy bookish Plato makes no attempt to fit in with the other students who look down on him but he sees Jim as a fellowoutsider and befriends him. I felt that there were hints that Plato is sexually attracted to Jim and jealous of his growing friendship with Judy but in the moral climate of the fifties these hints could not be fully developed. If my theory is correct Plato's nickname may also have ironic overtones Plato being the philosopher who advocated sexless 'platonic' love between males.Whereas Jim's parents are overliberal and Plato's absent Judy's are cold and authoritarian. Unlike the boys she starts off as a member of the 'incrowd' as she is Buzz's girlfriend but after Buzz's death a romance develops between Jim and herself. The main theme of the film is the choice between the desire to conform to accepted values and the desire to rebel by finding one's own individual ones a choice that seems particularly acute in one's teenage years. The film suggests that this choice is more complex than might be thought. Although the students are rebellious in the sense that they scorn the more peaceful values of adult life they are also deeply conformist in the sense that they will tolerate no deviation from their own values. Jim Judy and Plato can be seen as rebels against not only the older generation but also against the values of their contemporaries. Even Buzz as much as Jim or Plato can be seen as a victim of the students' system of values. A more attractive side to his character is shown in the scenes before the fateful 'chickie run' where he and Jim discover a respect even a liking for one another certainly neither wishes any harm to befall the other but for reasons of honour neither feels able to withdraw from their ritual duel.Throughout the film there is an atmosphere of heightened emotion it has not one but two emotional climaxes the 'chickie run' and the final scene where Jim Judy and Plato are hiding in the planetarium from Buzz's friends and from the police. It is a film that needs fine acting both to convey this emotional atmosphere and to do justice to its ambitious theme. Fortunately all three leads are equal to the task. Sal Mineo as Plato and Natalie Wood as Judy are both good but James Dean is better than good making the anguished figure of Jim come vividly alive. Although Dean was twentyfour at the time several years older than the supposed age of his character he was brilliant at portraying a tormented adolescent. It is strange that he did not receive a 'Best Actor' Oscar nomination. He was of course nominated for his role in 'East of Eden'. Is there a rule which prevents the same actor from being nominated twice in one year? Some of the supporting cast are also excellent particularly Jim Backus as Jim's weak but wellmeaning father and Corey Allen who resists the temptation to play Buzz simply as an arrogant hooligan. 'Rebel Without a Cause' is in my view one of the best films of the fifties and probably the bestever film about adolescence and 'coming of age'. I am surprised it has not made your top 250 films and that it was not nominated for 'Best Picture'. 1010.".

Jim feels forced to prove his courage against Buzz first in a knifefight and then in a 'Chickie Run' a ritualised test of nerve which involves driving stolen cars as close as possible to the edge of a cliff before jumping out. During the latter Buzz is killed when he is unable to escape from his car in time it is Jim's feelings of guilt arising from this incident and the desire of Buzz's friends for revenge which provoke the film's tragic climax. Although much of the comment about this film has concentrated on the charismatic figure of Dean the film is not just about Jim. It has at its heart a triangular relationship between Jim and two other teenagers Judy and Plato all of whom can be seen as a rebels 'without a cause' in the sense that they are not motivated by any political or social ideal but also 'with a cause' in the sense that there is a reason why they act as they do. Nevertheless in each case the cause of their revolt is subtly different. Each has been brought up in a different way. Jim's parents are kindly and liberal but are too indulgent. His father in particular is wellmeaning but weak unable to provide his son with intelligent advice or with a rolemodel of manliness. Plato whose real name is John but who prefers to be called by his nickname which suggests his intellectual nature is a strange lonely boy. Our first view of him is at the police station where he has been arrested for shooting some puppies. We do not learn any more about this incident but what we hear is enough to suggest that Plato is emotionally disturbed. Plato's parents are separated he never sees his father and his mother is frequently absent leaving him to be brought up by an elderly maidservant. The shy bookish Plato makes no attempt to fit in with the other students who look down on him but he sees Jim as a fellowoutsider and befriends him. I felt that there were hints that Plato is sexually attracted to Jim and jealous of his growing friendship with Judy but in the moral climate of the fifties these hints could not be fully developed. If my theory is correct Plato's nickname may also have ironic overtones Plato being the philosopher who advocated sexless 'platonic' love between males.Whereas Jim's parents are overliberal and Plato's absent Judy's are cold and authoritarian. Unlike the boys she starts off as a member of the 'incrowd' as she is Buzz's girlfriend but after Buzz's death a romance develops between Jim and herself. The main theme of the film is the choice between the desire to conform to accepted values and the desire to rebel by finding one's own individual ones a choice that seems particularly acute in one's teenage years. The film suggests that this choice is more complex than might be thought. Although the students are rebellious in the sense that they scorn the more peaceful values of adult life they are also deeply conformist in the sense that they will tolerate no deviation from their own values. Jim Judy and Plato can be seen as rebels against not only the older generation but also against the values of their contemporaries. Even Buzz as much as Jim or Plato can be seen as a victim of the students' system of values. A more attractive side to his character is shown in the scenes before the fateful 'chickie run' where he and Jim discover a respect even a liking for one another certainly neither wishes any harm to befall the other but for reasons of honour neither feels able to withdraw from their ritual duel.Throughout the film there is an atmosphere of heightened emotion it has not one but two emotional climaxes the 'chickie run' and the final scene where Jim Judy and Plato are hiding in the planetarium from Buzz's friends and from the police. It is a film that needs fine acting both to convey this emotional atmosphere and to do justice to its ambitious theme. Fortunately all three leads are equal to the task. Sal Mineo as Plato and Natalie Wood as Judy are both good but James Dean is better than good making the anguished figure of Jim come vividly alive. Although Dean was twentyfour at the time several years older than the supposed age of his character he was brilliant at portraying a tormented adolescent. It is strange that he did not receive a 'Best Actor' Oscar nomination. He was of course nominated for his role in 'East of Eden'. Is there a rule which prevents the same actor from being nominated twice in one year? Some of the supporting cast are also excellent particularly Jim Backus as Jim's weak but wellmeaning father and Corey Allen who resists the temptation to play Buzz simply as an arrogant hooligan. 'Rebel Without a Cause' is in my view one of the best films of the fifties and probably the bestever film about adolescence and 'coming of age'. I am surprised it has not made your top 250 films and that it was not nominated for 'Best Picture'. 1010.";

In the case of Rebel without a cause I fear this wasn't the case. People in their Mid Twenties play characters who go to High School. James Dean was a grown up man but acts like a 13 year old through out the movie. It was so ridiculous I thought at first Wait was this supposed to be a parody? The only character that wasn't miscast was Plato. It just didn't fit. But that wasn't the only problem. Take for example the scene after the chicken run. Judy's boyfriend just died in a car accident but then Jim gives her back her makeup mirror and she's happy again. Come on! I'm not willing to believe that people were so stupid back in the 50ies. And it wasn't just James Dean's rebel that had no cause. Hardly anything that anybody did in this movie had any kind of reason at all. It was anarchy and you could argue that that was the point of the movie but I consider that lack of motivation for the character's actions were indeed a failure in the attempted psychological approach. It was overdone and the casting problems made this entire picture hard to cope with. To me it seemed like a Bmovie not a classic in any way.".

Not much substance but with an exceptionally attractive male displaying both strength and sensitivity it's a formula to make profit. That's why I'm surprised this is a classic.

	schema:reviewBody "The teenage years are a confusing time for anyone. You start to act different think different and realize that you are growing up and there is nothing you can do about it. For Jim Stark this is more than he can handle.Nicholas Ray's classic Rebel Without a Cause is a look into the life of Jim Stark James Dean and his attempt to try and figure out what he wants to do with his life. Should he try to become an adult or should he enjoy what little time he has left and cut loose?The movie opens with Jim after he has had a few too many drinks. After being taken to the police station his parents are brought in to help find out what he did and why he did it. His parents Jim Backus and Ann Doran are torn over what to do with him. The father is understanding but the mother wants him to learn his lesson and make sure it does not happen again. Their fighting is tearing him apart!.Also at the station is Judy Natalie Wood and John Plato Crawford Sal Mineo. Jim offers his coat to Plato but he refuses. It was just a kind gesture but given Plato's emotional state it is a justified response.The next day is Jim's first day at his new school. He leaves the house in a good mood telling his parents how this might be it for him. After meeting Judy who appears to be unfazed by the incident she had in the police station Jim is off to school where he learns of a field trip for that afternoon to the planetarium.It is hear where he encounters Buzz the leader of the cool crowd. After slashing Jim's tires it's examination time or a little knife fight. No jabbing just sticking. Jim almost loses it but keeps his cool. Buzz challenges Jim to a chicee race at the bluffs. Jim accepts having no idea what that is.The events that follow are like a wild goose chase for Jim and his new friends. They go everywhere from the bluffs to an abandoned mansion and the planetarium. It's a wonderfully written script using great dialogue between Jim and his parents. The camera work is also a magnificent display using great angles and unique shots. Ray had the perfect vision of what he wanted his film to look like.Color is often used to showcase significance or symbolize a certain aspect of the film. Jim's red jacket Judy's red coat in the beginning and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films none the less he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father the understanding somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's. A movie that to this day is a perfect example of how each new generation is as rebellious as the one before it.".

After meeting Judy who appears to be unfazed by the incident she had in the police station Jim is off to school where he learns of a field trip for that afternoon to the planetarium.It is hear where he encounters Buzz the leader of the cool crowd. After slashing Jim's tires it's examination time or a little knife fight. No jabbing just sticking. Jim almost loses it but keeps his cool. Buzz challenges Jim to a chicee race at the bluffs. Jim accepts having no idea what that is.The events that follow are like a wild goose chase for Jim and his new friends. They go everywhere from the bluffs to an abandoned mansion and the planetarium. It's a wonderfully written script using great dialogue between Jim and his parents. The camera work is also a magnificent display using great angles and unique shots. Ray had the perfect vision of what he wanted his film to look like.Color is often used to showcase significance or symbolize a certain aspect of the film. Jim's red jacket Judy's red coat in the beginning and Buzz and all his cronies where black leather coats.Dean's performance is remarkable. It is a shame he was only featured in 3 films none the less he is one of America's icons. He symbolizes what every guy wants to be. He is not the only good performer. Backus gives a tremendous performance as the father the understanding somewhat lenient parent of Jim Stark. Wood and Mineo both received Oscar nominations and both were well deserved.As mentioned earlier these are the most confusing years for a teenager. One scene that says it perfectly is after the knife incident when Jim comes home. He walks up the stairs to find what appears to be his mother in an apron cleaning up. It turns out to be his father cleaning up the food he spilled for his wife who is a little under the weather. They both laugh and Jim tells him to leave the food so she can see it. The father doesn't understand and Jim just keeps telling him to. He gets flustered and walks away. He stutters and just can't give a straight answer to his father. This is a perfect comparison to much of Jim's life. He does something but cannot explain it.Rebel Without a Cause is a classic from the 1950's. A movie that to this day is a perfect example of how each new generation is as rebellious as the one before it.";

	schema:headline " A Tale Of Three Misfits";
	schema:reviewBody "In his three film trilogy James Dean worked with three of the best directors around George Stevens in Giant Elia Kazan in East of Eden and Nicholas Ray for Rebel Without A Cause. The first two films came from the inspiration of two of the best American writers of the last century Edna Ferber and John Steinbeck. But in Rebel Without A Cause the inspiration was director Nicholas Ray himself who wrote was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Story for the screen.The Fifties was certainly the era for those rebel type films but Rebel Without A Cause is unique because it deals with these bored upper middle class kids. It's as different a film as The Wild One with Marlon Brando and those working class biker types or the urban school kids of The Blackboard Jungle as you can get. The problems of this crowd just don't seem as serious as those in the other two films.But because of the quality performances of James Dean Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo you do sort of feel for these kids. Dean is a misfit like he was in East of Eden in fact his parents have just moved because of trouble he'd gotten into in his previous school. Unlike in East of Eden where Dean had this almost godlike father in Raymond Massey who he felt he couldn't measure up to in Rebel Without A Cause he's dealing with Jim Backus who's an ineffectual henpecked sort with Ann Doran and her mother Virginia Brissac. Dean himself was raised by an aunt and uncle in Indiana so he could identify with both Cal Trask and Jim Stark. Come to think of it you could include Jett Rink in there as well.Natalie Wood also has father problems William Hopper who just doesn't know how to deal with the fact that 'daddy's little girl' is blossoming into womanhood. Her mother Rochelle Hudson is one of those who looks like she's suffering a permanent headache and has abandoned the family ship to dear old dad. It's more an absence of mother and Hopper trying to do both roles which he just can't handle.But Dean and Wood have parents. Sal Mineo is being raised by the maid in his very wealthy home. He's got all the material things but he's a rather geeky kid who just doesn't fit in. He's also experiencing latent homosexuality in an age where that was the worst thing on the planet to be and no visible gay community to tell you it wasn't. By the way Marietta Canty as the maid is outstanding in this film she's miles away from the maid roles of Louise Beavers and Hattie McDaniel.So these three find each other and find a gang of kids who race their expensive automobiles against each other for speed and against each other for daring in the famous 'chicken run' scene. When the gang leader Corey Allen is killed racing against Dean he becomes a kind of martyr to them and trouble brews for our three misfits. Both Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor. Wood lost to Jo Van Fleet from that other James Dean classic East of Eden and Mineo lost to Jack Lemmon in Mr. Roberts. As for Dean he was up that year posthumously for East of Eden.It wasn't only James Dean's tragic death that made him a legend. He was getting acclaim for his performance in East of Eden when he was killed on September 30 1955. His stunning impact came after his death as fans were mesmerized by the promise of things to come in Rebel Without A Cause which came out about four weeks later and with Giant which Dean had just wrapped shooting on. This dead actor had film fans talking everywhere right up to the Oscars of 1957 ceremony where he was nominated for 1956's Giant. If ever a player left the scene with fans begging for more it was James Dean.Seen today over 50 years later Rebel Without A Cause still remains the ultimate film in teen angst. I think it's destined to be so for generations to come.".

A rebellious adolescent named Jim Stark James Dean with a troubled past comes to a new town finding friends and enemies. He is alienated from both his peers and parents Anna Doran  Jim Backus . He finds underdog youth as Plato Sal Mineo and Judy Natalie Wood  to whom Ray was rumored to have made advances in a Police Station and soon later they befriend turning into three outcast friends .Good film dealing with adolescence problems from the 50s  being magnificent played by a group of splendid young men . Many memorable setpieces  including the chickie run between James Dean and black leatherjacketed Corey Allen . James Dean's most important screen appearance in the second of his three movies  following East of Eden and his final was Giant. Director Ray touches upon his favorite theme two lovers searching for a quiet place to live in peace that also used in former picture titled Lovers of the Night 1945 one of his few totally controlled pieces of work . Awesome support cast formed by newcomers who would have an acceptable and uneven career as Dennis Hooper  Corey Allen  Nick Adams and special mention to Sal Mineo as lone and feeble Plato . Ray screenwriter Stewart Stern costar James Dean and Sal Mineo himself all intended for Mineo's character Plato to be subtly but definitely understood as gay  although the Production Code was still very much in force and forbade any mention of homosexuality all worked together to insert restrained references to Plato's homosexuality and attraction to Jim including the pinup photo of Alan Ladd on Plato's locker door Plato's adoring looks at Jim his loaded talk with Jim in the old mansion and even the name Plato which is a reference to the Classical Greek philosopher  for that mansion scene Dean suggested to Mineo that Plato should look at me the way I look at Natalie. Furthermore  the film packs a colorful and glimmer cinematography in Technicolor by Ernest Haller . Moving as well as thrilling musical score by Leonard Rosenman .The motion picture was very well directed by Nicholas Ray who researched L.A. gangs by riding around with them for several nights. In September of 1954 Ray wrote a treatment to The Blind Run about three troubled adolescents who create a new family in each other. This would form the basis for this picture . After some rewrites Ray started shopping for a lead actor. After a trip to the Strasberg Institute in New York proved fruitless he learned that Elia Kazan had recently discovered a New York stage actor for his latest film but he wasn't recommending him even after Ray saw a rough cut of this actor's latest film he still wasn't sure. It was only when Ray met 24 year old James Dean at a party did he realize that this hot new talent would be perfect for the role of Jim Stark a troubled youth whose world is unraveled in a 24hour period. Ray and Dean formed a very close bond during filming with Ray allowing Dean to improvise and even direct to his liking. The rest of the cast came together with the talents of two fifteenyearold  Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo as well as smaller roles which Ray cast based on weeks of bizarre improvised auditions as well as interviews with the actors. The three superb young stars carry this inthegut tale of teens . However  all three leads met with reallife tragic end  Dean dead by a car crash  Natalie by drowning and Mineo was killed . Filming was a wild ride but it paid off Mineo and Wood were both Oscarnominated in the supporting acting categories and Ray received his only Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Ray and Dean planned to make more movies after this but Dean's death would never make that possible and at least they left movie audiences with one great film. Rating  two thumbs up  extraordinary  topdrawer material . Indispensable and essential watching this classic movie .".

Therefore you have to make allowances for this and take it in the context of its time. Those willing to do so will recognize the film as a substantial offering especially for a film about young people.Certain aspects of the plot may be dated but the emotions are timeless. Each of the teens is looking for something different from their parents. Jim is hounded by the question of what it takes to be a man but gets no help from his henpecked father. Judy justifiably feels unloved due to her father's suddenly frigid demeanor. Plato meanwhile doesn't even have his parents around at all therefore he feels lonely and abandoned. These problems and a multitude of others haven't vanished in the time since this film was released.The direction by Nicholas Ray brings this story to life and shows some interesting touches along the way. The opening credits with Jim drunkenly messing around with a toy monkey is just one memorable scene. The 'chickie run' scene is perhaps the film's most memorable setpiece.The movie also benefits from a legendary performance from James Dean who didn't even live long enough to see the film hit theatres. His performance here is angstridden and filled with nuance. Perhaps his best scene is the one in which he confronts his parents when he returns from the chicken run. Puzzlingly though he never got an Oscar nomination while both Mineo  Wood did. Mineo was certainly deserving but to me Wood's performance was nothing particularly special. Also notable was Jim Backus who turned in a fine performance as Jim's father.The film contains a wealth of deeper meaning and depending on who you ask possibly some taboodefying sexual undertones. After seeing the film a few times I'm no longer so sure about the supposed homosexual subtext of Jim  Plato's friendship that may be more of a byproduct of their respective issues stemming from missing or ineffective father figures. Judy's relationship to her father is also not without sexual undertones but again this may be a byproduct of the issue at hand that is her father's lack of overt affection as she blossoms into maturity. Regardless of whether or not any of this was the intent of the filmmakers they were nevertheless daring to present such provocative material while the production code was still in effect.All in all a fine film that is deservedly lauded as a classic decades later. Check it out but be sure to put yourself in a fifties state of mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a bythenumbers kind of TV movie about a cranky widower Griffith with a heart condition his daughter Brown that he has issues with his beloved grandson who dies and the runaway girl Burnette with a dark secret whose appearance on the scene reconnects the emotional dots for oneandall.The Good Griffith is always appealing especially when you know his cranky act will fade as the story progresses. Burnette is a cute little thing and a natural. She's also the age of the character so we don't have some latetwentyish actor playing a seventeenyearold. Brown is fine too especially since she gets almost all of the toughest emotional scenes. Also the idea that a desperate runaway finds refuge in the Mayberrylike setting is appealing. Griffith and Burnette work well together. The Bad Griffith is much too agile for an old man with a recently transplanted heart. He even tackles a character in the finale! Before the film is twenty minutes old he's gone from heart condition to transplant and out of the hospital without so much as a scene or mention of a followup visit or medication or anything related to such a huge procedure. It's treated as if he had his appendix out! And his cranky attitude toward Burnette's character would have been better if played longer. Sure it's sweet Andy but the antagonism between the two plays so well and realistically... it would've been so much stronger when Griffith finally realized he really needs the kid in his life. And the issues between Griffith and Brown when revealed are clichs. Strangely their bland emotional issues are handled more dramatically than when Burnette's dark secret is revealed which is far more powerful yet treated almost indifferently with a quick tsktsk windup. But all and all it's just a sentimental TV movie so no need to really carp.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time the 1940s were rolling around Cecil B. DeMille was doing a lot less work but the work was getting more expensive. DeMille took off a couple of years now between films to create the opulent splendor that typifies his work.Well Samson and Delilah abounds in opulence. The color cinematography is first rate and reason enough to see the film. Of course it has the usual stilted dialog that is common in DeMille's costume work. But one has to remember that DeMille made his show business bones with David Belasco in the Edwardian era. And that's how folks talked in those Belasco plays.Acting honors in this go to George Sanders as the Saran of Gaza Philistine ruler and sophisticated cad. This was the height of Sanders career he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for All About Eve the same year. I think the Saran and Addison DeWitt would have understood each other very well.Angela Lansbury is the original object of Samson's lust and she does okay but personally if you had the choice between Jessica Fletcher and Tondelayo who would you choose? Is that ever a nobrainer.DeMille got a couple of loanouts to play the leads. Hedy Lamarr could easily lay claim to be the most beautiful woman in the cinema. She never had much acting skill but all she has to do is be seductive and that no one could do better.And Victor Mature away from his home studio of 20th Century Fox where he was languishing Samson and Delilah provided a whole new vista for him with roles in spectacle pictures where he could truly be that beautiful hunk of man.Fay Holden is good as Samson's mother. In modern times I can just hear her telling him about settling down with a good Jewish girl.".

I was mesmerized by it which led me to check out the story in that Chapter of the O.T. called Judges. And I remember being asked by my 6th or 7th grade teacher to do an oral report about the film before the class. I found it a bit awkward to discuss the idea of seduction at that time especially when I heard the pubescent girls giggling. At any rate I did make that report and remember displaying the book I had bought about the film right at the theater. I estimate from age 11 to 14 I saw the film a dozen times and I'm not kidding. In my adulthood I saw it once on free TV and rented it once for kicks. Quite honestly I never saw a more beautiful woman than Hedy in that role. And Victor was perfect thanks to his countenance and physique. After seeing it first and then reading the story in the O.T. I came to the conclusion that the film certainly was factual and illuminating. The bible came alive thanks to the genius of Cecil B.DeMille. The special effects were brilliant way ahead of its time. What I especially loved about this film was the haunting score by Victor Young and I do remember going out to buy it on 78 rpm disks. And I do have the radio program on cassette Lux Presents HollywoodSamson and Delilah starring Mature and Lamarr. That last scene will always stick in my mind as Samson standing blind between the two main pillars of the Temple of Dagon the Phillistine Godcalled on Jehovah to give him the strength to crush his enemies and WHAT A SCENE FOLLOWED. Good heavens DeMille was indeed a GENIUS! I recommend the film to EVERYONE because of the amazing story color".

	schema:headline " What invisable power strikes through his arm?";
	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille is best remembered for his biblical epics even though in a fortyyear eightyfilm career he only made four of them. It wasn't just that the bible pictures gave him some of his biggest hits it was in these features that DeMille seemed most at home and the one genre in which he had unique ability.Samson and Delilah brought an end to a long phase of epiccumadventure movies from DeMille. This period beginning with The Plainsman in 1936 had some of the weakest pictures of his career for a number of reasons. For one thing DeMille was not really very good at individualistic action scenes and there was too much DeMillean historical grandeur and not enough of the freespirited feel of the Errol Flynn or Tyrone power swashbucklers he was to some extent an trying to copy. What's more these were mostly original stories or at least ones which were not well known and DeMille's poor choice of source material and screenwriters meant the new characters and situations tended towards the feeble. DeMille's strength lay in his staging and presentation of a familiar tale and as such his return to Sundayschool moralising stuffy and pompous though it may be is apt and welcome.You see DeMille was probably aware on some level that although these fables were wellknown in a largely Christian society to a modern audience they were also historically distant emotionally neutral and even ridiculous when presented literally. But DeMille never attempted any humanity or realism in his features instead turning the remote mythical nature of the stories into a virtue portraying his subject matter with a kind of dignity and grace. Of course most ancient world epics do this to some extent but DeMille did it the most effectively because he never demanded that the audience sympathise with the characters merely that we marvel at their deeds.Specifically DeMille composes the picture with overstated gesturing and painterly tableau like a Gustave Dore print come to life. This is combined with the vivid colours of a bible stories illustration coded with drab shades for humbleness and virtue garish ones for extravagance and sin. Throughout DeMille's flair for dreamlike rhythmic motion keeps the images flowing most notably in the establishing tracking shot at the wedding feast  although if you watch closely you'll see one of the two men engaged in a mock swordfight is actually camply slapping his opponent with a feather duster.And DeMille was perhaps unique in that he even used the imagery to turn God into a character. You can see from one of his much earlier religious pictures 1929's The Godless Girl that DeMille associated God with natural beauty and in Samson and Delilah God makes several key appearances as a breathtaking skyscape. This touch would be expanded upon in the 1956 version of Ten Commandments.It's a pity DeMille didn't associate God with good acting because even the theatrical presentation on offer here could do with at least some halfdecent hamming. The trouble is DeMille chose his actors for their physicality not for their ability to qualify their job description. In this respect Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr are natural choices. DeMille's business associate Henry Wilcoxon whom the director unbelievably used to cast in lead roles is as wooden as ever and the somewhat hitandmiss Angela Lansbury misses this time. The only standout is George Sanders who proves just as Herbert Marshall did in DeMille's Four Frightened People that bad dialogue becomes bearable if you underplay it.Fortunately when it came to crew DeMille always procured the best. Samson and Delilah boasts Oscarwinning costumes and art direction from no less personages than Edith Head and Hans Dreier respectively. The Technicolor cinematography is great with some remarkably clear night time shots. Some of the effects may be a little dubious whenever Victor Mature lifts up something heavy it's obvious it's being hoisted from offscreen and that woollyruglion tamer scene is actually betrayed by bad editing but overall this is a solid highquality production.Yes Samson and Delilah is as corny as anything but it looks great and above all it entertains. Don't be too harsh on DeMille's staginess or his archaic moralism for as his willing appearance as himself in Sunset Boulevard proves he probably didn't have a sense of irony. And his earnestness was probably his greatest asset.".

For one thing DeMille was not really very good at individualistic action scenes and there was too much DeMillean historical grandeur and not enough of the freespirited feel of the Errol Flynn or Tyrone power swashbucklers he was to some extent an trying to copy. What's more these were mostly original stories or at least ones which were not well known and DeMille's poor choice of source material and screenwriters meant the new characters and situations tended towards the feeble. DeMille's strength lay in his staging and presentation of a familiar tale and as such his return to Sundayschool moralising stuffy and pompous though it may be is apt and welcome.You see DeMille was probably aware on some level that although these fables were wellknown in a largely Christian society to a modern audience they were also historically distant emotionally neutral and even ridiculous when presented literally. But DeMille never attempted any humanity or realism in his features instead turning the remote mythical nature of the stories into a virtue portraying his subject matter with a kind of dignity and grace. Of course most ancient world epics do this to some extent but DeMille did it the most effectively because he never demanded that the audience sympathise with the characters merely that we marvel at their deeds.Specifically DeMille composes the picture with overstated gesturing and painterly tableau like a Gustave Dore print come to life. This is combined with the vivid colours of a bible stories illustration coded with drab shades for humbleness and virtue garish ones for extravagance and sin. Throughout DeMille's flair for dreamlike rhythmic motion keeps the images flowing most notably in the establishing tracking shot at the wedding feast  although if you watch closely you'll see one of the two men engaged in a mock swordfight is actually camply slapping his opponent with a feather duster.And DeMille was perhaps unique in that he even used the imagery to turn God into a character. You can see from one of his much earlier religious pictures 1929's The Godless Girl that DeMille associated God with natural beauty and in Samson and Delilah God makes several key appearances as a breathtaking skyscape. This touch would be expanded upon in the 1956 version of Ten Commandments.It's a pity DeMille didn't associate God with good acting because even the theatrical presentation on offer here could do with at least some halfdecent hamming. The trouble is DeMille chose his actors for their physicality not for their ability to qualify their job description. In this respect Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr are natural choices. DeMille's business associate Henry Wilcoxon whom the director unbelievably used to cast in lead roles is as wooden as ever and the somewhat hitandmiss Angela Lansbury misses this time. The only standout is George Sanders who proves just as Herbert Marshall did in DeMille's Four Frightened People that bad dialogue becomes bearable if you underplay it.Fortunately when it came to crew DeMille always procured the best. Samson and Delilah boasts Oscarwinning costumes and art direction from no less personages than Edith Head and Hans Dreier respectively. The Technicolor cinematography is great with some remarkably clear night time shots. Some of the effects may be a little dubious whenever Victor Mature lifts up something heavy it's obvious it's being hoisted from offscreen and that woollyruglion tamer scene is actually betrayed by bad editing but overall this is a solid highquality production.Yes Samson and Delilah is as corny as anything but it looks great and above all it entertains. Don't be too harsh on DeMille's staginess or his archaic moralism for as his willing appearance as himself in Sunset Boulevard proves he probably didn't have a sense of irony. And his earnestness was probably his greatest asset.";

Paramount did not spend big bucks for this movie this is quite obvious but with Lamarr as Delilah and Mature's Samson this became a major example starpower. George Sanders won the acting laurels here. He was the quintessential powerful man who understood that he could never completely dominate Delilah. Angela Lansbury was O.K. in a minor role. Edith Head effectively designed the costumes for Hedy sexy but not overwhelming think Irene Shariff's over the top designs for Liz Taylor in Cleopatra. Hedy was sultry sexy in a subtle and an utterly believable way Mature was strong the epitome of masculine strength and totally confident that he could control and have his way with any woman. If Paramount and DeMille had agreed to add at least 12000000 to the budget I think the film would have even been a bigger blockbuster than it was. Folks this films was among the top five moneymakers after its first release. Only Gone With The Wind The Best Years of Our Lives Duel In The Sun and maybe Snow White. As of 151 SD was in the top moneymakers of all time. Pretty good for a halfbakrd effort and investment from Paramount and DeMille. LamarrMature  910 in my book.".

	schema:reviewBody "While having some very major flaws this is a thoroughly decent biblical epic on the story of Samson and Delilah. It is nicely filmed with lovely costumes nice sets and good cinematography and has a rousing score. Also the acing is not bad at all Victor Mature is a dashing Samson and Hedy Lamarr pretty much steals the film as the beautifully captivating Delilah it somehow reminded me of Rita Hayworth in Salome. George Sanders proves here he is the epitome of calculation and worldweariness and while Angela Lansbury is good she has been better. Plus the final scene with the temple coming down is brilliantly staged and serves as the highlight of the film. However the script is not always that great neither is the pacing which is quite slow or the direction which is disappointingly stodgy. Overall though Samson and Delilah isn't bad it could've been better but it was decent. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the film DeMille was making when Norma Desmond visited the Paramount sound stage in 'Sunset Blvd'. That little reference was enough to lure me into watching Samson and Delilah.I've always thought Lamarr was the most beautiful woman in films though she looked pretty ordinary in 'Ecstasy' before MGM got its hands on her but she was wooden with an annoying accent which somewhat cancelled out the magnetism of her beauty. But in this film she's animated and alluring and believable as Delilah the wicked seductress who late in the film finds her heartless self in love. In love with Victor who is perfectly cast as the barrelchested strongman Samson. Technicolor biblical extravaganzas do not require the acting skills of Mr and Mrs Olivier and both leads were up to the task of delivering their lines and hitting their marks with precision. Hedy was 35 during production and physically in her prime wearing gorgeous figure revealing costumes that not one woman in a thousand could wear and that includes Lana Turner even more scantily clad in that colossal biblical bore The Prodigal.The Victor and the Lion scene looked like the real thing to me. I kept a close eye on that lion and not once did it look like a stuffed rug. My compliments to the stuntman and the welltrained Oscarworthy lion.As for the ridiculous dialogue I heard none. DeMille's narrative at the film's beginning states the theme  man's yearning for freedom  something the 1949 audience 4 years after the end of WW2 responded to. Also the spiritual message came through without bombast and when Victor talked to or about his God he was believable and moving. And I was mesmerized by the seduction scene in the desert tent  walls of colored silks satins ala Valentino  and the tofro conversation as they moved about the tent. Yes Delilah lured her man with words. I've always wondered about the biblical account where Delilah tried and failed multiple times to get Samson to reveal the secret of his strength. Didn't he know what she was up to? How could he be so dumb? Well this scene expertly written shows us how she did it and No it wasn't because Samson was a knucklehead.The temple destruction scene is powerful because of DeMille's skill in conception and editing allowing the scene to build slowly as ever so gradually cracks appear in the columns. What a triumphant emotionally satisfying ending.George Sanders always a treat to watch is given witty pithy dialogue by the script writers which combined with his customary subtlety showed that he understood Delilah's character. He's an older wiser man waiting patiently for his Scarlett to grow up and know herself. The writers give Lamarr too ample opportunities to show the twists and turns in her character development. All in all this is a terrific popcorn movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon.".

	schema:headline " Biblical story when Israelites being enslaved by the Philistines then Samson seeks justice and vengeance";
	schema:reviewBody "Spectacular hokey Bible epic produced and directed by the great Cecil B Mille concerning about Samson Victor Mature won the role over Burt Lancaster and Delilah Hedy Lamarr  among most serious candidates for the role were Jean Simmons  Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth who plans to seduce him into revealing his secret and then to betray him to the Philistine leader the Saran George Sanders  as she robs Samson his incredible strength . The story of Samson from chapters 1316 of The Book of Judges  but being based on a novel titled Judge and Fool aka Samson the Nazarite Samson  Prelude to Delilah . As it is the pattern throughout the book of Judges  the Israelites again turned away from God after 40 years of peace brought by Deborah's victory over Canaan and were allowed to be oppressed by the neighboring Midianites  Amalekites and Philistines . According to the biblical account  Samson was given supernatural strength by God in order to combat his enemies Philistines and perform heroic feats such as killing a lion  slaying an entire army with only the jawbone of an ass and destroying a pagan temple . Samson had two vulnerabilities however  his attraction to untrustworthy women such as Delilah and his hair without which he was powerless . These vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him. One day the Philistine leaders assembled in a temple for a religious sacrifice to Dagon one of their most important deities for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can gather on the roof to watch. Once inside the temple Samson his hair having grown long again asks the servant who is leading him to the temple's central pillars if he may lean against them . He pulled the two pillars together  and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people . Thus he killed many more as he died than while he lived .Samson and Dalilah remains an enjoyable and entertaining picture with great camp performances that still looks fine today . This dumb but fun film contains breathtaking outdoors and indoors  a lot of extras and with glorious paperMach sets on the temple of Dagon  in fact  it was far and away the topgrossing film of 1949 . Victor Mature is surprisingly nice as Samson along with a young Angela Lansbury as Semadar and a cynical Saran of Gaza well incarnated by George Sanders . Victor Mature as Sansone or Samson is acceptable though his famous fight against a philistine army is hopelessly phony . For the scene in which Samson kills the lion  Victor Mature refused to wrestle a tame movie lion . The scene shows a stunt man wrestling the tame lion intercut with closeups of Mature wrestling a lion skin . Hedy Lamarr supplies biggest surprise by playing a tempter and beautiful vixen Delilah . Being a lavish production here appears several actors usual from Hollywoood pictures such as Cecil B DeMille's longtime associated Henry Wilcoxon  Julia Faye  Fay Holden  Moroni Olsen  Mike Mazurski  George Reeves and a sympathetic boy  Russ Tamblyn  as Saul . Spectacular and climactic sequences in the Temple of Dagon  it took two tries to bring it down . During the first time some of the dynamite charges in the miniature temple failed to go off on schedule  as the temple had to be rebuilt and the second attempt was more successful. Colorful and luxurious cinematography by usual Hollywood director of photography George Barnes . Victor Young's lush background music nominated for an Academy Award in the competition for 1950 would become his penultimate bestscore recognition . The motion picture was realized in Cecil B DeMille's ordinary style  with a 28 million gross domestically  the film was Paramount's biggest hit since DeMille's silent version of Ten commandments 1923. Cecil produced and directed 70 films and was involved in many more . Many of his films were romantic sexual comedies  as he is supposed to have believed that Americans were curious only about money and sex . His bestknown were biblical epics that further established him as the symbol of Hollywood such as King of Kings 1927 The ten Commandments 1923  The Crusades 1935 and  of course  Charlton Heston's Ten commandments 1956. Other films about this Biblic figure are the followings  Gedeon and Samson 1965 by Francisco Perez Dolz with Anton Geesink and Rosalba Neri  Samson and Delilah 1984 by Lee Philips with Anthony Hamilton  Belinda Bauer  Max Von Sidow  Samson and Delilah 1996 by Nicolas Roeg with Eric Thal  Elizabeth Hurley  Dennis Hooper  Samson et Dalila 2002 with Plcido Domingo and Olga Borodina .".

He kills a lion with his bare hands while with Delilah but Lord Saran George Sanders doesn't believe them.

It all crumbles as Samson battles Ahtur and his 30 men. Samson escapes but Semadar is killed. He burns everything down and Delilah vows vengeance against Samson.The Technicolor looks brilliant. There is a nice stunt wrestling a real lion early on. Of course Victor Mature is wrestling a stuffed lion. He is a big guy and he plays Samson as a self assured brute. The acting is not subtle. Hedy Lamarr is playing the vixen for all her worth. Her acting is extremely broad. This is a grand epic from Cecil B. DeMille. It's all very old fashion in everything from tone to style to acting. I doubt that I should count that against it. It is simply an epic of a compelling biblical story.".

If Delilah was not in the film i would have immediately left the room she stole my heart with her bness and a tear of joy came down my face when she cut of Sampson's hair and unsaved him. Hedy Lemarr stole the movie. If you love Cecil B. De Mille films go see the movie.If your someone who gets snippy when there's a historical inaccuracy's don't go see it there that all I have to say.

	schema:reviewBody "First off Victor Mature plays Samson just so no one's confused.  He and Hedy both have chests and black hair so I thought I'd clear everything up right off.This is the story of Samson a brawny but honorable guy and the woman he loves.  He loves two in the course of the film.  The first is Angela Lansbury who had a very bizarre name that escapes me.  Ms. Lansbury a marvelous actress is my first bone to pick with Cecil B. DeMille.  Who in heck would believe that Angela Lansbury and Hedy Lamarr are related?!? Even more incredulousAngela Lansbury as Hedy's OLDER SISTER?!?  You have to be a movie fan to know that Hedy was several years older than Jessica Fletchertobe Angela but any moron can tell they're from two different countries.  Angela's plummy English tones versus Hedy's Germanic mutterings makes for a weird family.  Anyway that's nitpicking.Early in the film Samson goes over to see sweetheart What's Her Name only to have her sister Delilah bounce rocks off his ample chest.  She looks like someone who isn't to be trusted but nevertheless he's consumed by love's fire.  Isn't that soooooo dramatic.  He decides to go fight a lion barehanded so he can win What's Her Name.  The things you had to do back then to get a date.  When she is amazed by his lion taming she decides that she will indeed marry him.  Delilah is enraged but decides to wait for her chance for revenge.  It comes at the wedding where a silly chain of events leaves Samson alone again and Delilah homeless.  One of my favorite moments is in this scene as Delilah's dad keeps begging people to take her instead of her sister.  No one wants her!Fast forward an undetermined amount of time to reveal a plot against Samson. He's a huge pain in the neck to the bad guys and they just can't figure out how he got to be so darned big.  We know it's God's doing but the bad guys don't believe in God.  DeMille hadn't made the more famous Ten Commandments yet so we can understand their ignorance.  Delilah demands an unheard amount of money from several rich merchants saying that she can find the secret of Samsons's strength.  He tricks her a couple of times but finally she guilts him into telling the truth.  When she ruins him he spends his time wishing he could break her scrawny neck.  Frankly I can sympathize with him.  She does have a scrawny neck.The finale comes when Delilah repents she asks God to forgive her indicating that she now believes in him and is truly sorry she annihilated another human being and aids Samson in his extermination of all the mean people.  The temple scene before it falls down seems really cruel with everyone terrorizing Samson and him completely unable to stop them.  Good wins out in the end though and everyone remembers Samson as a true hero. They don't remember Delilah in a nice way because she neglected to tell anyone she repented.  Thanks to that she gets a bum rap to this day.Favorite partthe jaw bone of an ass scene where everyone tries to see how many times they can say ass and get away with it.".

I was about to pass on it as stereotypical Mature Bible fare when I remembered just how hot Hedy was. Next thing you know they're tearing around the desert in his horsedrawn ragtop.Fortunately this was just before the great bareknuckled fight with the lion even Leonard Maltin concedes it was great although hopelessly phony and who can look away from that? Then I was hooked as I realized what terrific fodder this would have been for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Hunting party pulls up just after Samson does in Big Kitty Anyone seen our pet lion? Reward for the Prince's lost pet lion . . . HEYYYYYY! Or that great headwear So you're Samson. Nice hat Ahtur. How much beer does it hold? What made me totally lose it though was the riddle bet. First off Who cares if Hedy or Angela looks older WHO CAN BELIEVE VICTOR KICKED HEDY TO THE CURB FOR ANGELA??? Movie sorta loses credibility right there. Then he bets 30 wedding guests they can't solve his riddle the stake being fancy new cloaks. He wins what's he going to do with 30 coats open a menswear store? And if they win how's he gonna pay up? I was wondering about that in addition to marveling at the unspeakably poor sportsmanship of the Philistine guests  If he wins kill him! when Angela cheats and gives away the answer to the riddle. After telling her to go sleep in the gutter a surly Victor stomps out the door promising the guests their winnings and that's the absolute best part HE GOES AND MUGS 30 PASSERSBY FOR THEIR CLOAKS!!! I laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks! What did he have them drycleaned or just hand them over with smelly pits?!This is a gem. Think it belongs up there with John Wayne in The Conqueror.".

No doubt that de Mille's usual luxurious and expensive touch is in this film and it is clear once more that the man didn't care about expenses whenever he entered a project and so the movie doesn't lack a sense of greatness and spectacle.The special effects are excellent for 1949 mainly the final sequences when a blind Samson demolishes the pagan temple with the only strength of his arms. There is also a fine musical score by Victor Young.Though not too gifted when it came to acting Hedy Lamarr was indeed a beautiful woman and she comes out acceptably as the treacherous Delilah. Victor Mature Samson a good choice as for his physical presence overacts as he usually did most noticeably in the action sequences in which he doesn't look too comfortable. George Sanders brings an interesting performance as the Saran carrying the role of a ruler with dignity and class and a young Angela Lansbury is good as Delilah's sister Semadar Samson and Delilah turns out as an entertaining and watchable film in its genre though in my opinion inferior to the almost contemporary Quo Vadis by Mervin Leroy or de Mille's later product The Ten Commandments in which he was aided by an all star cast.".

No point of comparing to major features the action is thinner but the idea behind the story is deeper and less predictable than your average Saturday night actionadventure.

The train is stopped which would take several 100 meters a door is opened  and there she stands just few meters away from the train on flat land. To make us suspend disbelief some much more plausibility checks should have been done.All in all I was disappointed though I wouldn't say it was all bad. Just too incongruent too often.

I should have known Ben Stiller wouldn't do a totally straight movie but the comedy wasn't so over the top either. It was a perfect blend of comedy and sincerity. One of the standout performances came from Hank Azaria. His portrayal of the French scuba instructor Claude was a scenestealer. One of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I recommend this as a perfect date movie or if you're just sitting at home and want to LOL! Be sure to check out the gag reel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again Ben Stiller gives us yet another comedy about love life and being an adult nerd. Yet this sadly doesn't hold a candle to 'Something About Mary' which may have been his best movie of his career.We begin the film seeing Reuben Stiller marrying Lisa Messing. After their reception they head to St. Bartes for their honeymoon. While on the beach they meet a French scuba instructor who has offered to take them out on his boat. Rebuen declines because he has a nervous stomach but he insists that his beautiful new bride go to make her happy. When he returns later that day to the boat he finds his wife cheating on him. Upset and hurt he flies home depressed that he has not only lost his wife but now has decisions to deal with because of hers.Enter Polly. Several days after he returns to New York his friend takes him to a party where he runs into a waitress Aniston whom he went to school with when he was in junior high. He calls her the next day and asks her out. Throughout the rest of the film he learns how to deal with his phobias irritations and just how to cut loose.Each time I see this film it somehow has the opposite effect on me as most where as normally I grow to love the film more and more each time I see it this one actually seems to get worse and worse with each viewing. It is funny and it's not a bad film at all it's clever and cute it's just that it does tend to lose flavor each time you see it.Aniston and Stiller were equally good in this and I still recommend it. It's a light comedy and not at all like 'The Cable Guy' or 'There's Something About Mary'. So if you're looking for films that were as dark or adult as those you won't find it here. But it still is cute and clever in its own way so it might still be worth a watch. Plus Alec Baldwin plays a small part which is not to be missed.".

However I would not consider this to be one of those movies to watch again and again. A one time watch or just once every so often is good enough.Reuben Feffer Ben Stiller analyses risk for a living and is an extremely cautious man with an extremely cautious life. When he marries Lisa Debra Messing everyone considers them the perfect couple as they are well suited to one another. But when Lisa cheats on him on their honeymoon with their FrenchieFrench scuba diving instructor Claude Hank Azaria...BUFFED UP! Reuben's heart breaks. He returns to New York and bumps into Polly Prince Jennifer Aniston and they begin dating despite being very different. Polly lives in the moment Reuben thinks ahead. Polly loves ethnic food Reuben hates it. Polly isn't too big with longterm relationships whereas Reuben swears by it. Nevertheless their relationships seems to work. But when Lisa comes crawling back to Reuben he is forced to make a decision. Who will it be the freespirited Polly or Lisa with whom Reuben shares a lot in common?I thought this movie was very cute and I liked the ferret . Ben Stiller's performance was not outstanding in this movie but he did play Reuben well and to be honest I cannot imagine another actor as Reuben at all. He has a very identifiable voice and the knack of just being plain adorable. I would not say he owned the movie like he usually does but he certainly was very good. Jennifer Aniston was also just over average. I loved her in Friends Bruce Almighty but sadly I don't think she did as well as she could have. But her role was smaller than I would have thought. I really liked her character Polly Prince though and I think this was because Polly was so much like myself. The lastminute planning being untidy liking ethnic food the hunting for keys...all of this screamed 'ME' all the way through and I thought Polly was a very realistic and likable character. Hank Azaria was so cute as Claude! Okay so he was meant to be the villain but come on he's BUFF. He has a six pack and the French accent was just amazing. He is really talented if he can do about 5 different voices in 'The Simpsons' and then the Frenchiest French accent ever here. Debra Messing made a small role as Lisa but she wasn't anything great Philip Seymour Hoffman was hilarious as Sandy Lyle. I thought the character was gross but very likable.Not the best from Stiller or Aniston but still delivers laughs.".

This type of character is perfect for Stiller.In Along Came Polly Stiller stars as Reuben Feffer the neurotic slightly OCD riskinsurance salesman who looks at the outcome of a situation before getting involved.

Although they don't see eye to eye with certain issues the two have a sort of brotherly bond that lasts thru thick and thin.

The plot is very similar to There's Something About Mary and it even steals from an episode of Friends. The film is not very original so that's one strike against it lucky for the film it has a funny cast. What really makes this movie work is Philip Seymour Hoffman he is hilarious as Sandy and he is the best part about this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is funny including Hank Azaria as the scuba instructor and Alex Baldwin as Reuben's boss. Ben Stiller is funny but its getting tiring to see him in the same role. Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 710 a funny movie that's worth a look".

Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 710 a funny movie that's worth a look";

	schema:reviewBody "OOOO! There are cheeky spoilers in this review.Along Came Polly is the type of film that will be advertised as a 'date movie' when actually it's not really. It's a romcom with grossout elements.Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston are both intelligent and especially Aniston fairly versatile actors. Aniston is often talked about as only playing Rachel Green but I believe she actually is a very good actress both in straight and comic roles. However they were let down by some strong flaws in the script. Ben Stiller's character had some good comic lines and was very likable. He does however not seem overly devestated by his wife's betrayel. I realise this is comedy and not meant to be heavy but the most we see him let his grief and anger and resentment go is when he knifes some cushions.My main problem with the film was the bad representation of Polly. I think the writers missed the point of her character as a sort of unique and bohemian wild girl who was so crazy and freespirited Reuben couldnt help but fall for her. She actually came across as a bit of a cow a bit messed up relationship wise and a not particularly sensitive person. I got the impression she was relieved when she saw the risk assesment for her and Ben Stiller's exwife as it gave her a way out and though it was nice when her and Reuben got back together at the end it was fully expected and she didnt seem as overly happy as she should have been. And why is it that I just didnt find it THAT rough when Reuben ate the nuts off the pavement? It's only a gritty pavement....hmmm....maybe I'm just too British....or common.Casually stealing the show was Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's truly disgusting narcissist of a friend. He was endlessly funny and is such a brilliant actor and was definitely the high point of this film.Also great was Debra Messing from Will and Grace who did a great job at playing Reuben's totally silly but glacially beautiful wife.And watch out for Karen from Notts Landing!!!510".

	schema:reviewBody "Along Came Polly 2004Along Came Polly is not Ben Stiller's best film nor his best performance but I really enjoyed it. It's not that original but it is still somehow fresh. It is pretty well written and there are plenty of memorable and distinct moments that make it more recognizable and original than the storyline itself would make it seem like it would. The bathroom scene the ferret and the basketball scene are a few of these moments. As far as acting goes Ben Stiller does what he usually does. He makes you laugh and believe his character but doesn't actually act wonderfully which doesn't seem to make sense. His performance is similar to that in There's Something About Mary. Jennifer Aniston also gives the same performance as almost everything she's done which isn't good but it works out fine all together. The best character and performance in the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He has a very strange role in comparison to most of his other work and he does it great. He was very hilarious and did really good he kept the film more watchable though he had a small role. Hank Azaria also had a very funny yet even smaller role that added more character to the otherwise average film. Any fan of Ben Stiller or Jennifer Aniston will most likely enjoy Along Came Polly. It's nothing extremely special and it's not the funniest movie but it has a good story and has many good laughs. Definitely worth watching if it's on TV or something but not really something you need to run out and rent unless like I said you are a big fan of Stiller or Aniston. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this socalled comedy that has no energy to speak of. Story is about nitpicky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer Ben Stiller who finds his new wife Lisa Debra Messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor Hank Azaria after only one day on their honeymoon. Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy Philip Seymour Hoffman go to a party and run into Polly Prince Jennifer Aniston whom they went to school with years earlier.SPOILER ALERT Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to remain married to Reuben but he really doesn't want to but Polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with.This film is the second directing effort by John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in Zoolander and Meet the Parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel. It's very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it's even easier to figure out why. This film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script. Hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as There's Something About Mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do your easy! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious. Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance.".

	schema:headline " One of the year's worst";
	schema:reviewBody "I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not quantity.I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in Along Came Polly. Stiller's Reuben is grating charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. He undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.There's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston which is a shame because she's a good smart actress with a promising career. As long as she keeps making more movies such as The Good Girl in which she's terrific and less like Along Came Polly she'll have a career of which she could be proud.Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working but it's a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin as Reuben's boss Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's best friend Sandy there's nothing funny in this awful film.

	onyx:emotionText "I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not quantity.I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in Along Came Polly. Stiller's Reuben is grating charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. He undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.There's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston which is a shame because she's a good smart actress with a promising career. As long as she keeps making more movies such as The Good Girl in which she's terrific and less like Along Came Polly she'll have a career of which she could be proud.Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working but it's a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin as Reuben's boss Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's best friend Sandy there's nothing funny in this awful film. Other supporting characters including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid it's terribly unfunny.The premise of Along Came Polly certainly showed promise.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why several people have criticised this film so severely. It does not have the fast pace of a nailbiting thriller but then it is not meant to be one. Despite the fact that the setting and activities of the characters are concerned with espionage in postwar Berlin this is not an espionage story but a tragic love story about people whose lives are ruined by what they do and have done. The screenplay is by Ian McEwan based upon his own novel. These days he is best known for writing the novel ATONEMENT filmed in 2007. The director was John Schlesinger near the end of his career for he would only make four more films of his total of 28 after this. Sometimes Schlesinger could go really wrong as in THE DAY OF THE LOCUST 1975 which I found unwatchable. But many of his films are classics and he was an immensely gifted director. It was obvious as long ago as 1962 that Schlesinger was going to be a major director and he did become one of Britain's finest. Campbell Scott is perfectly cast as Leonard a shy young Englishman who lives with his mother has never had a girlfriend and works for the G.P.O. For those too young to remember the GPO General Post Office had the monopoly in the past of all postal deliveries and telephone services in Britain. In the sixties you had to wait between six weeks and three months for the GPO to connect a new telephone if you moved house. They were so notoriously lazy complacent and incompetent that everyone was thrilled when competition was introduced to telephony and British Telecom and Mercury emerged as commercial rivals. But that is enough about the history of telephony in Britain. The mail is today divided into Royal Mail which is about to be privatised and Parcel Force which delivers or in many cases fails to deliver parcels. But that is enough also about postal services in Britain. Scott is one of the few really bright people at the GPO and he is indeed so clever that he is sent off to Berlin and seconded to the Yanks on a top secret surveillance project called 'Gold'. This is based upon real events. The Americans really did dig a tunnel 100 yards into the Soviet zone of Berlin and tap the East German and Soviet phone lines during the Cold War. Scott plays the bright boy who actually does the tapping. The story is rather unconvincing here for surely the Americans had their own such people and also surely a young nerd from the GPO was not the best that the Brits could supply? Well never mind it is a novel and a film not a history book though some history books are even 'less true than novels aren't they? I leave aside the question as to whether truth is absolute and so there is no such thing as being 'less true'. Now the film goes astray at this point because the man in charge of the American operation is a spook played by Anthony Hopkins. I believe he gives a magnificent and subtle performance but his American accent is simply not good enough and that has justly irritated many people. Hopkins is also an acquired taste in general. But the history of this production may explain Hopkins being cast in this lead role for he had at least some attraction to investors though whether he was 'fully bankable' in 1993 I cannot say. This film was produced by a very charming woman named Norma Hayman. But three weeks before shooting her distributors pulled the rug out from under her. I don't know how she saved the film but in the process it was entirely recast. I had a very uncomfortable experience about twenty years ago when I was with a close friend who was an executive producer who raised money for films. He got a call from Norma Hayman asking whether she could come to his home and see him urgently. He did not like being disturbed at home and was very grumpy about it and he also smelled a whiff of desperation in the air which destroys confidence. So she arrived and they closeted themselves in a room for ages but when they emerged my friend was treating her very badly indeed with contempt which greatly shocked me as I had never seen him behave like that. She was crestfallen. I needed to go and so she and I shared a cab into the centre of town London. It was a sad and gloomy experience she talked little and I thought it best to leave her to her unhappy thoughts rather than to irritate her with chatting. As this film was made about that time I wonder if this was the film she was trying to save on that day. Well in the story Scott falls in love with the irresistibly alluring Isabella Rossellini who plays a mysterious German woman and she introduces him to the carnal side of life. But he then discovers she is married to a drunken brute named Otto who beats her up and is refusing to sign her divorce papers. And lots of things begin to go seriously wrong. Scott wants to marry Rossellini and who wouldn't but then a terrible bloody event takes place just the sort of perverse thing that Ian McEwan seems to like inflicting on his readers and viewers though Schlesinger resists any temptation to 'do a Tarantino' with that material and is as discreet as it is possible to be about something so awful. I think if the story were a bit less extreme in that particular people would have liked the film more. However the film is otherwise very good in my opinion very sad and moving. It has an intriguing very emotional ending which I am not permitted by IMDb reviewing rules to reveal.".

Well in the story Scott falls in love with the irresistibly alluring Isabella Rossellini who plays a mysterious German woman and she introduces him to the carnal side of life. But he then discovers she is married to a drunken brute named Otto who beats her up and is refusing to sign her divorce papers. And lots of things begin to go seriously wrong. Scott wants to marry Rossellini and who wouldn't but then a terrible bloody event takes place just the sort of perverse thing that Ian McEwan seems to like inflicting on his readers and viewers though Schlesinger resists any temptation to 'do a Tarantino' with that material and is as discreet as it is possible to be about something so awful. I think if the story were a bit less extreme in that particular people would have liked the film more. However the film is otherwise very good in my opinion very sad and moving. It has an intriguing very emotional ending which I am not permitted by IMDb reviewing rules to reveal.";

Campbell Scott is great and really carries the whole film. I really enjoyed the way the film was held together the cinematography and the use of really bad American Music to get across the brashness and invasiveness of their culture even back then. If you've read books like Spycatcher you'll appreciate this film. On the other hand if you think Bond films are good you'll most likely hate it. I would have liked the sex scenes to be more shall we say 'fleshed out' they fade off all too quickly. It's very rare in popular film that you get good sex scenes that are filmed with warmth and tenderness. The use of lighting and angles is great. What got to me more than Hopkin's dodgy accent was the stupid female character. Can't we just forget reality for a bit and stop casting women as quivering idiots. Sure that's how they seem to behave in all important situations but it's so annoying to be put through it over and over again. Let's have an intelligent female lead who decides she's going to take responsibility for her dumb impulsive behaviour and make amends. As opposed to leaving everything up to the bloke and then running off with his friend. And did anyone notice that all the men around her drink heavily? I think this would be a good book and there's obviously stuff missing from the film but still I give it 810.".

A group of high school kids with their eternal business of first love classes leaders and dreamers is suddenly thrown out of peaceful existence. A father of the most likable girl is taken by KGB and she has to renounce him publicly. She can not betray him and so she invites all her true friends those who did not desert her for being a daughter of the enemy of the state for a picnic. She does not say so but t is a farewell. After that she takes an overdose of sleeping pills. In an unbelievable twist of fate KGB almost never released its victims her father is released in few days. The story runs about a week but boy how fast this kids  had to grow up. It is like the innocence of their existence was lost. One day they lived in the most perfect country where justice and equality ruled or so they were brought up to believe. And next they new that it all were lies and innocent people were destroyed by regime without mercy. There was also problem of loyalty. Who do you stay loyal to your friend or your country? The movie ends with few laconic lines of information what happened to the rest of the class during the war. Somebody was burned in a tank somebody was hanged for participation in resistance somebody became an ace pilot. It is a great movie see it if you have an opportunity. May be you would learn something you did not know about people from the USSR and about this period of history.".

	onyx:emotionText "That is a wonderful movie that breaks your heart. The story takes us in the last autumn before Germany invaded USSR. A group of high school kids with their eternal business of first love classes leaders and dreamers is suddenly thrown out of peaceful existence. A father of the most likable girl is taken by KGB and she has to renounce him publicly. She can not betray him and so she invites all her true friends those who did not desert her for being a daughter of the enemy of the state for a picnic. She does not say so but t is a farewell. After that she takes an overdose of sleeping pills. In an unbelievable twist of fate KGB almost never released its victims her father is released in few days. The story runs about a week but boy how fast this kids  had to grow up. It is like the innocence of their existence was lost. One day they lived in the most perfect country where justice and equality ruled or so they were brought up to believe. And next they new that it all were lies and innocent people were destroyed by regime without mercy. There was also problem of loyalty. Who do you stay loyal to your friend or your country? The movie ends with few laconic lines of information what happened to the rest of the class during the war. Somebody was burned in a tank somebody was hanged for participation in resistance somebody became an ace pilot. It is a great movie see it if you have an opportunity. May be you would learn something you did not know about people from the USSR and about this period of history.";

It describes the life of some young Sowjets before the break of the Nazi invasion where the Sowjet presence is depicted with the real touch of emotions. As a typical Sowjet Russian movie the feeling and the play of the actors dominates but because of the confrontation between young and old in between the young ones and the old ones there is no single cadre which gives me a second of time to relax and I jump form one personage into another. I think that it is amazing how this feeling drama succeed to overcome the tragedy of the situation of its fearful environment and to glorify the Human. Somehow there is no trail of judgment but the actors' play resolve it in the endless search for happiness of their personages. There many strong movies showing what human do to other human this movie shows us what one can do to it self. Just the end is a bit of pathetic but it is the true end unfortunately where the unification is matter of the death.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a touching and a subtle film. Made a few years before the end of the Soviet Union and set at the cresting height of Stalin's power and as the title suggests just before the looming World War it manages the trick of being at the same time both nostalgic for a bygone time and the youths who lives through it but also unflinching about the horrors that the political environment caused people to commit against each other. I don't know for sure and I haven't read the story that was the basis for the film but I get the strong feeling that it was at least semi autobiographical on the part of the author and everyone involved in the film does a strong job of communicating his mixed feelings of affection and horror for that time. The photography alternates between sepia monochrome usually at school and color at home or out in nature and it's the first time I've seen this trick used in a way that works not only well but also subtly  it underscores in an understated way the themes that the film raises of humanity freedom and choice versus duty to the state. While it raises these themes it scrupulously manages to avoid being didactic about them. We are allowed to draw our own conclusions on what the characters discuss which is pointedly what they themselves are not allowed to do. Touchingly it becomes clear that those who are drawn in to acting so in humanly do so because the ideals of the revolution that they fought for are so dear to them that they cannot bear to imagine it betrayed. In one touching moment we are reminded that it was Lenin himself who warned against a blackandwhite rightorwrong definition of what the truth is and it painfully obvious that that is not at all the philosophy that has been enacted in the state that pays him service.".

	schema:headline " The Doctor is In But He Won't Come Out";
	schema:reviewBody "Many have panned Robert Mitchum's performance in this film but I think that his lack of expression and emotion other than anger suits the character very well.Mitchum's Marsh is a completely selfabsorbed individual.  He's committed to medicine and can't understand human failings especially his own.  His character's cold demeanor perfectly reflects the fact that Marsh has no outer life.  If he often appears robotic it's largely because he's programmed himself to shut out everything human ironically in service to humanity.  Of course he's a great doctor but he's pure hell to work or live with. Bursting with pride insensitive to the point of cruelty Marsh is unreachable and in more than one sense of the term untouchable.  Mitchum conveys all of this very naturally perhaps because so much of his performance is rooted in the dark world of film noir where the actor first made his mark.  He's a physician from the neck up but he has the heart of a contract killer.  That he heals instead of kills is his patients' good fortune though of little solace to his friends or his wife.Although Mitchum's interpretation remains controversial many of the other performances in Not as a Stranger' are beyond criticism.  Olivia deHavilland as his suffering spouse is superb as always.  Charles Bickford an actor who deserves a much greater reputation is the epitome of a small town doctor.  And surprisingly Broderick Crawford is excellent as a gruff professor of pathology.On the other hand Frank Sinatra's pediatrician isn't as strong though he has some good scenes when he tries to help Mitchum see the error of his ways.  Gloria Grahame unfortunately is stuck with a seductress role that just as well could have been cut.    There are other weaknesses.  George Antheil's score by way of Wagner and Richard Strauss is pretty hard to take.  The script and direction are uneven.  Many scenes are compelling such as when Crawford literally throws the book at Sinatra or when deHavilland and Mitchum have one of their confrontations.  Others fall flat and there is a tendency typical in most of Stanley Kramer's work to keep making points at the expense of the story. For example the med school sequences with Whit Bissell's greedy and unethical Dr Dietrich interesting choice of name there cover a darker side of the profession very well.  There's really no need for Jesse White terribly miscast as a lawyer who cozies up to Grahame to bring up ethical issues much later in the film.   Recommended as an above average melodrama and as an interesting time capsule of mid50s medicine.  Though I found it hard to believe patients were allowed to smoke in the wards!".

Despertly wanting to continue his education in medical school Lucas Marsh Robert Mitchum goes so far as making a play for nurse Kristina Hedvigson Olivia De Haviland who he needs to pay for his tuition. Kristina a very sweet and caring young woman who's anything but the hot number that Lucas would normally go for is flattered by the attention that Lucus is giving her and in no time at all accepts his proposal for marriage. Kristine also without as much as saying a word pays for Lucas tuition which turns out to be a very good investment with him graduating at the top of his class.Al Broome Frank Sinatra a fellow med student and Lucas' best friend sees through his fake romancing of Kristine which has him almost knocked cold by an enraged Lucas. Throughout the movie Al is the one person who tries to keep the two from splitting up when Kristina finally senses that she's being taken for a ride by her new husband. It's when he's still in medical school that Lucas' arrogant and rebellious attitude toward his fellow doctors comes to the surface with him challenging Dr. Detrick Whit Bissell a teacher at the school about a medical procurer he's teaching the students which almost has him kicked out of the class and school. It takes a very painful apology by Lucas to keep him from having his medical career from ending before it ever began.Now a fullfledged doctor Lucas and Kristine moves into the sleepy little town of Greenville to start his practice. It's also at Greenville where he starts to have an affair with local dbutante Harriet Lange Gloria Grahame that leads to Kristina who was pregnant at the time walking out on him.Much more complicated then you would expect it to be the film Not as a Stranger shows human relations at their rawest and most painful. There's in the film Lucas' father Job Lon Chaney Jr drinking away his sons tuition money that his wife left him. We later have a very explosive confrontation between father and son where Job is left crawling into his bottle of booze and ending up later in the movie to Lucas' shock and horror under the wheels of a city bus crushed to death. There's also Lucus' friendship with the wisecracking and comical yet at the same time caring and understanding Al Broome. Lucus' hurts Al by bringing out right in front of his fellow doctors and nurses the fact that he operated on his patient not only without his permission but without checking that if she was suffering from melanoma which could have caused the cancer cells to spread all through her bloodstream. Lucas threatens to have him not only fired from his job as a doctor at the hospital but have his medical licenses revoked. It tuned out that the tumor that Al removed was benign.Lucas' Godlike belief in his ability as a man of medicine makes it almost impossible for anyone to work with him by demanding total perfection of the medical personal in Greenville Hospital like his does of himself. Where at the same time he's anything but the perfect husband to his wife the mentally and emotionally abused Kristina. It's when Al checked out Kristina and finds that she's pregnant and very upset about it that he realizes that his friend Lucas is slowly causing her to have a breakdown.

	schema:headline " There's Something Rotten in the Medical Profession";
	schema:reviewBody "Although a couple of the actors are too old for their parts or otherwise poorly cast Not as a Stranger has some good performances and an engrossing story. Based on a popular novel by Morton Thompson the film was producer Stanley Kramer's first directorial attempt. The plot follows a young medical student through his studies and internship and into the early years of his practice. If the nearly40year old Robert Mitchum can be accepted as a struggling student then possibly Olivia de Havilland can play a young Swedish nurse. De Havilland should have sued the film's hair stylist for the phony blonde dye job and the stiff 1950's hairdo. Olivia's hair and wardrobe make the actress who was actually a year younger than Mitchum look more like a matronly aunt than a young intern's romantic interest. Unfortunately her Swedish accent is about as convincing as her blonde roots.The rest of the starstudded cast which includes five Oscar winners is more appropriate. Broderick Crawford portrays a humorless professor Frank Sinatra is the rash student who pursues the money in medicine and Charles Bickford plays a dedicated smalltown doctor. Whenever slinky sultry Gloria Grahame appears on screen she always spells trouble for leading men and here she is the darkhaired bad girl to de Havilland's blonde angel of mercy. Situations between the characters play out expectedly. Only Mitchum whose character evidently learns from his mistakes grows and matures over the years. Despite his miscasting Mitchum's performance is effective and at any opportunity he rewards his fans by doffing his shirt and displaying his admirable pecs. Obviously Mitchum was not cast just for his acting skills.Kramer's heavyhanded direction avoids the social preaching that mar some of his other films which is not to say that Not as a Stranger lacks a message it would not be a Kramer film without one. With lines like doctors wear rubber gloves so they don't leave fingerprints and only in medicine can you get away with manslaughter Kramer's opinion of the medical profession is evident. The compromises forced on the initially idealistic Mitchum underline the corruption that Kramer evidently saw lurking under the white coats and stethoscopes.Kramer is also obvious in his imagery. A suggestive scene between Grahame and Mitchum that takes place outside a stable with two horses has to be the most blatant sexual symbolism since the fireworks in To Catch a Thief. Filmed in black and white by Franz Planer from a script by Edna and Edward Anhalt Not as a Stranger offers a literate story and professional performances for passable if dated entertainment. However viewers will have to overlook a few flaws and the controversial social message and focus on the star power and Mitchum's physical assets.".

The first is the emotional scene when Olivia de Havilland can take no more of Mitchum's treatment and tells him to get out. She was so powerful and poignant. The second was when Mitchum was trying to revive Bickford and couldn't.

Then Mitchum finds he's having troubles coming up with enough money to finance the tuition for his next year of education. Suddenly he meets and falls in love with a Swedish nurse who has plenty of money to help him through the hard times. So Mitchum then marries the lady. Mitchum's friend Sinatra thinks this is a bad thing to do and tells him so but life goes on.

Sleepyeyed Mitchum is the one big weakness of this dramahe rarely changes his expression even when he is angrily berating his longsuffering wife Olivia de Havilland or best pal Frank Sinatra. His expressionless demeanor was OK when playing tough hoods but doesn't serve him well here. Gloria Grahme plays her familiar siren role as though she has novocaine in her upper lip. But everyone else shinesBroderick Crawford as a Jewish doctor Charles Bickford as Mitchum's mentor and Frank Sinatra adding a much needed sense of humor to the proceedings as a materialistic doctor. Olivia de Havilland with blonde hair and Scandinavian accent has a couple of very strong scenes which she plays brilliantly. All of the smaller roles are well doneand particularly strong are the hospital scenes dealing with patients operations and interns. But the big drawback is Mitchumunable to get into his role and make his character more than a cardboard figure. Nevertheless the film itself is still compelling and well worth viewing.

Mitchum is nevertheless very effective as an arrogant but poor man desperate to become a doctor  so desperate in fact that when he finds out that nurse deHavilland has 4000 in the bank he romances and marries her. Once out of medical school he joins a country practice headed by Charles Bickford and meets sexy lonely Gloria Grahame  and you nearly can see the sparks. Both actors had hot presences both oozed sex appeal  I would have loved to have seen them in a star teaming instead of a subplot.This is a very good film  perhaps overly long  but it still holds interest because of the performances and the characters they play. It's very much the story of Mitchum's character and evolution and his marriage to deHavilland. In these days of special effects a characterdriven story is refreshing.All the performances are good Sinatra supplying the wisecracks as a loyal friend of Mitchum's and the only one who understands him. There have been comments that he was miscast. There is such a thing as a society doctor however and the Sinatra character was on the track so I didn't find his characterization that unrealistic.The towering performance of course comes from Olivia deHavilland as Kris a simple Swedish nurse who falls in love with Mitchum and marries him only to find it isn't much of a relationship. I say of course because in my opinion deHavilland was one of the great actresses of the classic era capable of playing a wide variety of roles and in different genres. Sweet and gentle as Melanie plain in love and bitter in The Heiress a petulant ingnue in It's Love I'm After a young beauty in The Adventures of Robin Hood elegant but tough in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte she's letterperfect as Kris. She is believable from the time she comes on camera with her unattractive blond hairdo her accent her plain ways and her shyness. As Sinatra points out she's not doctor's wife material  no parents who belong to a country club no class  She should marry a farmer he says. 38 when the film was made deHavilland is totally sympathetic as Mitchum criticizes her for not being smart and turns his back on her not realizing her value as a wife and as a woman.A very good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "With a cast including Robert Mitchum Frank Sinatra Broderick Crawford Lee Marvin and Gloria Grahame you'd expect hardboiled crime drama. If so you might want your money back after seeing NOT AS A STRANGER. One Hollywood wag remarked of the MitchumSinatraCrawfordMarvin lineup That's not a cast that's a brewery! and the actors lived up to their rowdy reputations turning the shooting into ten weeks of hell for director Stanley Kramer. Mitchum described Crawford swallowing Sinatra's hairpiece with a vodka chaser Of course you never know when Mitchum is putting you on. But I like to believe he did call up Sinatra in Palm Springs to say Guess what? The Crawdad just drank your wig. Sinatra took to calling Mitchum mother after he nursed Ol' Blue Eyes through a hangover. It's too bad Kramer didn't film these onset antics the footage would have been more entertaining than the plodding and earnest medical melodrama he did produce.The casting is spectacularly misguided for a start everyone is almost twenty years too old. The film opens with the 40ish Mitchum Sinatra and Marvin as medical students observing a dissection and right away credibility is strained. If I walked into a doctor's office and saw Lee Marvin in a white coat I would run. And whose idea was it to cast the famously jaded takeitorleaveit Mitchum as the rigid idealistic driven hero? Only topbilled Olivia de Havilland seems to belong in this type of movie and she suffers from a platinum dye job and a mediocre Garbo accent. I waited more than an hour for Gloria Grahame to show up and then she was wasted on a throwaway subplot that's over almost before it begins.No cast could have made the movie much good. It's overlong and the script is both obvious and underwritten a few minutes into every scene I could predict what was going to happen by the end and I foresaw the final plot twist about halfway through the film. The first half follows Lucas Marsh Robert Mitchum through medical school. For reasons never entirely clear he is obsessed with becoming a doctor though his father who drank up all the money his mother left to pay his tuition tells him I don't think you'll make it. It's not enough to have a brain you have to have a heart. Thus in the third scene we get the message of the movie and have a pretty good idea of everything that will follow. Desperate for money to stay in school Luke woos and marries Kristina Olivia de Havilland a frumpy Swedish nurse whofor reasons never entirely clearis madly in love with him. We know because she keeps telling him I love you SO MUCH! It's made abundantly clear that Luke is brilliant and noblemindedhe despises the other students who just want to make a lot of moneybut arrogant and intolerant of human frailty. In his first practice assisting a kindly and intelligent smalltown doctor Charles Bickford he does a wonderful job but his marriage disintegrates as he falls for a seductive wealthy widow and his wife can't bring herself to tell him she's pregnant. You just know that sooner or later he's going to falter at the operating table and be shattered by the realization that He Too is Only Human.To this oppressive script add heavyhanded direction that hammers each point home with obvious symbolism and simplistic montages and a fewbut not enoughmoments of unintentional hilarity like the whinnying stallion underscoring the first big MitchumGrahame clinch and the most relentlessly overwrought music I've ever heard. No one except Sinatra playing the only lighthearted role manages to crawl out from under the lead blanket of this movie. My admiration for Robert Mitchum knows no bounds and I wouldn't say he's bad here but he's certainly been better. It's not that he's incapable of playing characters who care deeply or zealously pursue a goal See HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON or NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. The problem is that Lucas Marsh is humorless uptight and selfrighteous devoid of that perceptive ironic compassionate distance that's essential to Mitchum. Marsh is hot tempered intolerant of others and blind to his own flawsin other words it's a Kirk Douglas part. Kirk would have been perfect but Mitchum never really connects with the character. Maybe it just didn't seem worthwhile Mitchum never gave more to a movie than it deserved. He does have some nice moments the encounter with his pathetic father gives some explanation for why he's so disgusted by weakness he plays well with Sinatra strikes some sparks with Gloria Grahame and excellently delineates Luke's feelings for his wife a mix of boredom admiration and guilt. He's pretty convincing in the doctoring scenes there are way too many of these at least for someone like me who gets woozy at the sight of a hypodermic needle. But he seems a little bored most of the time not that I blame him. Maybe I should have taken my cue from the actors and had a few drinks on hand.".

	onyx:emotionText "With a cast including Robert Mitchum Frank Sinatra Broderick Crawford Lee Marvin and Gloria Grahame you'd expect hardboiled crime drama. If so you might want your money back after seeing NOT AS A STRANGER. One Hollywood wag remarked of the MitchumSinatraCrawfordMarvin lineup That's not a cast that's a brewery! and the actors lived up to their rowdy reputations turning the shooting into ten weeks of hell for director Stanley Kramer. Mitchum described Crawford swallowing Sinatra's hairpiece with a vodka chaser Of course you never know when Mitchum is putting you on. But I like to believe he did call up Sinatra in Palm Springs to say Guess what? The Crawdad just drank your wig. Sinatra took to calling Mitchum mother after he nursed Ol' Blue Eyes through a hangover. It's too bad Kramer didn't film these onset antics the footage would have been more entertaining than the plodding and earnest medical melodrama he did produce.The casting is spectacularly misguided for a start everyone is almost twenty years too old. The film opens with the 40ish Mitchum Sinatra and Marvin as medical students observing a dissection and right away credibility is strained. If I walked into a doctor's office and saw Lee Marvin in a white coat I would run. And whose idea was it to cast the famously jaded takeitorleaveit Mitchum as the rigid idealistic driven hero? Only topbilled Olivia de Havilland seems to belong in this type of movie and she suffers from a platinum dye job and a mediocre Garbo accent. I waited more than an hour for Gloria Grahame to show up and then she was wasted on a throwaway subplot that's over almost before it begins.No cast could have made the movie much good. It's overlong and the script is both obvious and underwritten a few minutes into every scene I could predict what was going to happen by the end and I foresaw the final plot twist about halfway through the film. The first half follows Lucas Marsh Robert Mitchum through medical school. For reasons never entirely clear he is obsessed with becoming a doctor though his father who drank up all the money his mother left to pay his tuition tells him I don't think you'll make it. It's not enough to have a brain you have to have a heart. Thus in the third scene we get the message of the movie and have a pretty good idea of everything that will follow. Desperate for money to stay in school Luke woos and marries Kristina Olivia de Havilland a frumpy Swedish nurse whofor reasons never entirely clearis madly in love with him. We know because she keeps telling him I love you SO MUCH! It's made abundantly clear that Luke is brilliant and noblemindedhe despises the other students who just want to make a lot of moneybut arrogant and intolerant of human frailty. In his first practice assisting a kindly and intelligent smalltown doctor Charles Bickford he does a wonderful job but his marriage disintegrates as he falls for a seductive wealthy widow and his wife can't bring herself to tell him she's pregnant. You just know that sooner or later he's going to falter at the operating table and be shattered by the realization that He Too is Only Human.To this oppressive script add heavyhanded direction that hammers each point home with obvious symbolism and simplistic montages and a fewbut not enoughmoments of unintentional hilarity like the whinnying stallion underscoring the first big MitchumGrahame clinch and the most relentlessly overwrought music I've ever heard. No one except Sinatra playing the only lighthearted role manages to crawl out from under the lead blanket of this movie. My admiration for Robert Mitchum knows no bounds and I wouldn't say he's bad here but he's certainly been better. It's not that he's incapable of playing characters who care deeply or zealously pursue a goal See HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON or NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.

Despite the miscasting Mitchum does deliver a strong performance but I think Kirk Douglas would have done far more with the role of Lucas Marsh. Olivia DeHavilland has a very convincing Swedish accent in her role as the 30s something nurse who marries Mitchum for love when he's courting her for her money so he can finish medical school. And that's really where the story begins. Mitchum's Lucas Marsh wants that medical career so bad he'll do anything for it. He's arrogant selfcentered and when he falls away from the ideal that he sees himself as it's a come down. Whether having to apologize to Whit Bissell when he challenges him in class or giving way to passion when he's unfaithful to DeHavilland with Gloria Grahame he destroys himself bit by bit. When Mitchum makes a mistake in an operation that costs the life of his benefactor Charles Bickford he's close to suicidal. In the end we're really not sure he's going to live with himself.The rest of the cast is outstanding. Frank Sinatra in a role similar to Angelo Maggio in From Here to Eternity functions well as Mitchum's conscience. I also have to single out Lon Chaney Jr. who in his one scene in the movie as Mitchum's father delivers one of his best performances.In the recent biography of Robert Mitchum Baby I Don't Care the author says that Stanley Kramer unknowingly assembled one of the biggest group of booze hounds in Hollywood. Robert Mitchum Frank Sinatra Broderick Crawford Myron McCormick and Lon Chaney Jr. were all legendary in the drinking profession. But God Bless Stanley Kramer who managed to get them all working on a good piece of film making.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is proof that a good director and great actors can still make a dull movie. In Not As A Stranger Lucas Marsh Robert Mitchum is a university medical student who has plenty of talent and determination to be a doctor but very little heart. After his drunken father Lon Chaney spends his tuition money Marsh will do anything to stay in medical school. He marries Kristina Hedvigson Olivia De Havilland a Scandinavian nurse that he does not love but who can support his tuition. Marsh becomes a doctor then moves to a small town called Greenville to work in a local hospital.Part of the problem with the movie is that Mitchum and his fellow medical students  played by Frank Sinatra and Lee Marvin  are too old to be believable as medical students. These are men in their late thirties and early forties who look as if they should already be in medical practice if not teaching medical classes. I was amazed to see Sinatra in a supporting role since by this time he was one of the major leading stars of Hollywood.Also Olivia De Havilland is too old and too beautiful to be believable as an old maid nurse who has never married. Her Swedish accent isn't very believable either. Nor is it believable that Harry Morgan and Mae Clarke would be old enough to be her parents. The operating room scenes though dated are the best scenes in the movie. The rest of the movie is a bythenumbers soap opera that hits every last clich right on the nose. It's like General Hospital but with more characters who are actually doctors and nurses and not just hunks babes or femme fatales.There are some unintentionallyfunny scenes such as when Marsh has an affair with Harriet Lang Gloria Grahame a young heiress who trains horses. You can see this affair coming even before Grahame's character appears over an hour into the movie. After lustily staring at Lang in a few previous scenes Marsh encounters her outside a stable. In a nearby corral is a black mare in the stable stall is a lustcrazed white stallion who is bucking kicking whinnying desperate to join the mare in the corral. Marsh unleashes his passion for Harriet Lang by literally letting loose the wild horse. The movie has one really welldirected sequence the final sequence in which Marsh performs an emergency operation. Aside from that the rest of the movie is a forgettable bythenumbers melodrama. Even the title doesn't make any sense. And why did it get an Oscar nomination for Best Sound of all things?".

I did not always like some of his performances but he is a stand out here. As a kind of conscience for Mitchum. He actually becomes enraged when Mitchum cynically decides he will marry Kris so that he can pay his tuition for medical school. There is a cameo role with Lon Chaney Jr. as Mitchum's father who is a hopeless alcoholic. The scene is very effective as Mitchum conveys disgust and hatred for his father and his father with dark sad eyes says you are missing something you don't have the soul to help people.One amusing note is when Mitchum asks his professor of surgery for financial aid. The man does help him his salary is 9000.00. This was a princely sum in 1955 apparently. Wow how things have changed.The story continues as Mitchum graduates medical school and interns in the small fictional town of Greenville. All is well until he meets femme fatal Gloria Grahame who is wealthy and widowed. The type of woman a doctor should have according to 1955 stereotypes At any rate Charles Bickford is Dr. Runcklemann who is a country doctor and takes Mitchum under his wing. He runs the county hospital in Greenville with a big heart and concern for the community. Mitchum is affected by him and when Runcklemann dies on the table during surgery he suddenly realizes how he lost sight of what matters in life. Will Kris take him back?.This film is unusual and has several standout performances. Highly recommended. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "OK just said that to get your attention. Rarely have I seen a 50's movie with so many names. Probably the restrictive contracts actors had with the studios were responsible for that plus the drive the actors had to be first billed.But here we go...Olivia de Havilland Robert Mitchum Frank Sinatra Broderick Crawford Charles Bickford Gloria Grahame Lon Chaney Jr. Harry Morgan and Lee Marvin as well as many great character actors whose faces I know but have names I don't recall. except for Jerry Paris of Dick Van Dyke fame Every one of the names above are of actors who were top billed in one movie or another with the possible exception of Gloria who I remember most for Its A Wonderful Life. The interesting thing is that they are all mostly either at the end of their career or the beginning with the exception of Mitchum.Ones at the beginning are Frank Sinatra Lee Marvin and questionablyHarry Morgan M.A.S.H. came much later. The ones at the end are Charles Bickford Lon Chaney Jr. and Broderick Crawford at least as a leading man. Gloria kind of fizzled out at both ends of the scale.Olivia won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 3 others prior to this movie. At the age of 39 she was pretty much done at this point for great roles nevertheless she was as beautiful as ever notwithstanding her odd hair color and I think showed even better acting skills and diversity afterwards in movies such as Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte.Mitchum was probably at the top of his game at the time he did this movie with great performances on both sides of this role. Some reviewers here did not like him in this movie but personally I think he carried it.Some fun things to watch for in this movies are signs of the time. For example smoking cigarettes is predominant in every scene even in the classrooms of medical school by both teachers and students. Also Doctors making house calls with no thought of how it could be otherwise.I can't say I liked this movie a lot but there were things about it I did like. I liked the beginning and I liked parts toward the end but parts of it were too long like my review is going to be. I especially did not like the abrupt ending nor the lack of resolution to problems that were so long in the making.Of particular note is the odd accent that Olivia and Harry Morgan were forced to carry throughout the movie. Also I suspect that up and comers like Sinatra Lee Marvin and Harry Morgan learned much from being paired with veterans like Mitchum Crawford and Bickford.And yes I know Sinatra already had an Academy Award in 1954 for Here to Eternity but he was not yet known for acting like he would be later.The movie could have used better editing but the actors did their jobs. If nothing else the movie has the earmarks of being the end of one era and the beginning of another not only in the movie world but also within society.".

Probably the restrictive contracts actors had with the studios were responsible for that plus the drive the actors had to be first billed.But here we go...Olivia de Havilland Robert Mitchum Frank Sinatra Broderick Crawford Charles Bickford Gloria Grahame Lon Chaney Jr. Harry Morgan and Lee Marvin as well as many great character actors whose faces I know but have names I don't recall. except for Jerry Paris of Dick Van Dyke fame Every one of the names above are of actors who were top billed in one movie or another with the possible exception of Gloria who I remember most for Its A Wonderful Life. The interesting thing is that they are all mostly either at the end of their career or the beginning with the exception of Mitchum.Ones at the beginning are Frank Sinatra Lee Marvin and questionablyHarry Morgan M.A.S.H. came much later. The ones at the end are Charles Bickford Lon Chaney Jr. and Broderick Crawford at least as a leading man. Gloria kind of fizzled out at both ends of the scale.Olivia won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 3 others prior to this movie. At the age of 39 she was pretty much done at this point for great roles nevertheless she was as beautiful as ever notwithstanding her odd hair color and I think showed even better acting skills and diversity afterwards in movies such as Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte.Mitchum was probably at the top of his game at the time he did this movie with great performances on both sides of this role. Some reviewers here did not like him in this movie but personally I think he carried it.Some fun things to watch for in this movies are signs of the time. For example smoking cigarettes is predominant in every scene even in the classrooms of medical school by both teachers and students. Also Doctors making house calls with no thought of how it could be otherwise.I can't say I liked this movie a lot but there were things about it I did like. I liked the beginning and I liked parts toward the end but parts of it were too long like my review is going to be. I especially did not like the abrupt ending nor the lack of resolution to problems that were so long in the making.Of particular note is the odd accent that Olivia and Harry Morgan were forced to carry throughout the movie. Also I suspect that up and comers like Sinatra Lee Marvin and Harry Morgan learned much from being paired with veterans like Mitchum Crawford and Bickford.And yes I know Sinatra already had an Academy Award in 1954 for Here to Eternity but he was not yet known for acting like he would be later.The movie could have used better editing but the actors did their jobs. If nothing else the movie has the earmarks of being the end of one era and the beginning of another not only in the movie world but also within society.";

Mitchum Marvin and Sinatra play 40ish looking medical students studying under Crawford. To support himself Mitchum woos and marries de Havilland! After graduation Mitchum moves to a small town and practices under mentor Charles Bickford and is tempted by a lustful local widow Grahame. Ever the perfectionist who looks down on human failings Mitchum makes a tragic mistake that costs Bickford his life leading to a tearful reunion with de Havilland.I've always loved this movie but Mitchum Sinatra and Marvin are way too old for their roles. The casting of sleepyeyed Mitchum as a harddriving perfectionist doctor just doesn't seem quite right. The strangest casting is that of Harry Morgan and Virginia Christine as de Havilland's parentsMorgan is one year older than de Havilland and Christine was five years younger! Crawford as a curmudgeonly instructor who tells Mitchum to stop living your life like a Greek tragedy the great Whit Bissell as an imperious medical professor both excellent. Nancy Kulp even shows up briefly as a patient while Lon Chaney does his usual scenerychewing as Mitchum's drunk father.Great movie well acted and directed highly recommended.

	schema:reviewBody "Bonnie Bedelia delivers a fiery roughly textured outstanding performance in a rare substantial lead role as Shirley ChaCha Muldowney the gutsy sassy The only thing I do fast is drive willful supremely determined and selfsufficient reallife pioneering feminist professional race car driver who had to overcome lots of doubt discrimination and sexual prejudice during her arduous climb to bona fide race car champion status winning the muchcoveted NHRA Top Fuel World Championship an unprecedented three times in a row.Directed with customary acuity and facility by Jonathan Kaplan this sterling sports biopic stands out not so much for what it does but for what it doesn't do. For starters the film never glorifies its very appealing but still quite human and fallible heroine offering instead an evenly balanced fully rounded wartsandall portrait of Muldowney whose remarkable success on the racetrack is countered by her often shaky and unfulfilling personal life. Shirley's victories come at the cost of her marriage to decent but insecure automobile mechanic Jack skillfully etched by Leo Rossi who manages to create genuine sympathy for a potentially unlikeable character and thrust her into a tumultuous romantic relationship with arrogant sexist philandering rival driver Connie Kalitta an excellent Beau Bridges. Still Ken Friedman's astute daring and forthright script gives Shirley her just due for bravely breaking down restrictive sexual barriers refusing to buckle under often intimidating odds and triumphantly besting men in a largely maledominated sport. Secondly the film doesn't go overboard with either the racetrack action or evocation of previous decades Shirley began her professional drag racing career back in the mid 60's and kept on racing into the early 80's rightly emphasizing a most rewarding and uplifting tale of how sheer iron will and tenacity play a huge role in how successful one is in life.While Bedelia surely dominates the film with her exceptional characterization the rest of the cast definitely hold their own Anthony Edwards as Shirley's proud caring son Hoyt Axton as Shirley's supportive countryandwestern singer father Bill McKinney as a cocky drag racing superstar Dick Miller as an understanding family friend Paul Bartel as a pompous French TV show chef Michael Cavanaugh as a jerky NHRA boss and Jonathan Haze as a smooth racetrack announcer are all uniformly fine. Tak Fujimoto's crisp elegant proficient cinematography and Laurence Rosenthal's jaunty score add authentic flavor to the movie's meticulous recreation of past eras and equally minutely detailed depiction of the vibrant smoky harshly competitive racetrack milieu. The racing scenes are vivid thrilling and atmospheric the wipeout sequences are shockingly abrupt and harrowing. However it's the tremendous accomplishments of the extraordinary Shirley Muldowney she served as creative consultant on this movie and Bonnie Bedelia's superlative portrayal which make this film a true winner all the way.".

Heart Like A Wheel is by far her finest film and she deserved an Academy Award nomination. The bonus material on the 2006 DVD release is interesting enough. Muldowney's derogatory remarks on Bedelia were uncalled for especially in light of the critical praise she has received for her role. Jonathan Kaplan's comments painted a much different picture of Bedelia's work ethic. Make sure you watch the film at least once with Kaplan's commentary it is the best bonus feature and very entertaining.".

It's a bit of a slow movie some drama that may or may not have taken liberty with Shirley Muldowney's real story and overall a bit of a sleeper of a film. I don't recall it getting a lot of promotion on TV before it hit cable and to be honest I don't recall it ever playing in the local theatres. But it was a decent enough movie to see once or twice.The 60s and 70s was a time when the women's movement was trying to reassert female participation in what had become largely a male only world. The film shows some of the sexist barriers she faced and her interpersonal struggles with her own crew and competition. I can't say I was a big drag racing fan and I didn't know too much about her until I saw the movie. The film helped bring her to the fore front for a brief amount of time to nondrag racers though you did hear about her on occasion on the radio.The film itself has that midrange budget feel. It's a bit raw but still has a good professional gloss to it.Check it out.".

Instead it satisfies an audience with brains. This is a great movie about racing and also delivers some sharp social comment. It begins with a flashback to one of those exciting key moments in childhood and never lets up with keeping the story interesting to the end. Aside from gorgeously done racing scenes it wrestles real problems that women face to this day as I witnessed them growing up as the son of a divorced mother. Just reading some comments in other reviews right here shows that sexism is alive and well so there are lessons and thoughts to mull over for everybody. This is well worth watching!".

There was also an affair with another drag racing champion played by Beau Bridges.Bedelia is just wonderful in a role where she gradually ages almost 20 years and she's convincing at all stages of her life. She gets good support from her supporting cast. Special mention should go out to Leo Rossi who has a complex role as the husband who is never made a stereotypical alpha male. No trace of a Donald Trump like character is found in his performance.

Played by actress Bonnie Bedelia Muldowney's a female drag racer who finds herself belittled and berated by sexist drivers all of whom deem the racetrack to be no place for women. Muldowney stands her ground of course and kicks down doors of discrimination in her own little way.Fittingly Heart Like a Wheel opens with a father informing his daughter that he wishes for her to be selfreliant and not dependent on men. The rest of the film finds Muldowney locked in various power struggles both within her marriage and with others racers one of whom is infectiously played by actor Beau Bridges. As is typical of such films most men in the picture are portrayed as philanders drunks jealous types or irrational hotheads. Ironically racing movies prior to the eighties see 1969's Winning in particular had begun to critique macho obsessions with winning possessions and dominance. By the time Heart Like a Wheel came around the onscreen male driver had already been neutered. He would be rehabilitated come the late 1980s an insecure backlash against a perceived loss of male privilege. Muldowney incidentally was the first woman to receive a license from the National Hot Rod Association and would be dubbed The First Lady of drag racing.7.510  Worth one viewing.

I don't know what formula the cars belong to but it's easy to recognize the formula of the movie.If there's a formulaic moment that isn't included I must have blinked. Bedelia shows an early interest in getting into the seat of the queerlooking dragster her husband Leo Rossi has built as a kind of hobby. But she proves to be a pretty good driver and as she wins an increasing number of contests locally she begins to neglect what Rossi sees as her wifely duties.All the men at the race track seem to make fun of her as does the announcer over the PA system.Meanwhile there's another man Beau Bridges a fellow driver. He's a happygolucky affable fellow and I thought at first that he would become one of those saviors who shows up from time to time to rescue the damsel from some crisis before disappearing again until the next crisis but actually he plays a more important role as the lover she acquires after leaving her husband.And man does Leo Rossi deserve leaving. The script turns him into a Formula I masculine villain. Jealous of his wife's success jealous of her celebrity and talent he begins to drink excessively and pretty soon we have the drunken wifeabusing husband. So she leaves him and flees to the welcoming arms of the more understanding Bridges. When Bridges is suspended from driving she makes him her crew chief.Sadly Bridges is already married but that doesn't stop Bedelia from falling in love with him. The fact that she's not the only other woman in his life does manage to shake her a bit though it doesn't stop her from going on to the ultimate triumph.The men in her life are all weaklings and brutes but she prevails through the strength of her will and her love of driving cars at high speed. Well I suppose Bedelia's father is not a bad guy but he's there chiefly to provide the funeral that interrupts her rise to fame. You never know. Tragedy may lie just around the corner.The thought kept occurring to me How easy it would be to turn Shirley Cha Cha Muldowney into an exploitative and selfindulgent witch. It would still be based on a true story if she were to be possessed by hubris to the extent that she outgrew her schlub of a husband in New York and left him flat for a man Bridges who would be of more use to her. If it breaks up his marriage so what? She needs him for her crew chief and lover.But it's not that kind of movie. Not at all. It's the story of a woman who succeeds despite all the obstacles strewn in her path by an arrogant patriarchal society. She's propelled by her love of drag racing although there is curiously little attention paid to her feelings about driving. There IS plenty of footage about the drag races themselves. Engines are noisily gunned cars burn rubber and often crack up or burst into flaming comets without the bother of any noisome explanations. That presumably is to keep the men in the audience from falling asleep during the prolonged romantic conflicts. The races have little drama because after all drag races only last a few seconds.The musical score is mostly of the period and people who grew up in the 60s and 70s should enjoy the pop songs. Before during and after Bedelia's triumphs on the track the score turns airily inspirational lacking only a heavenly choir.I rather enjoyed it the first time I saw it but I was younger then and my heart may have been more like a wheel. Now it looks dated and in some ways irritatingly generic. It's one of those Firsts movies. Lindbergh was the first to fly the Atlantic solo so there's a movie about him. There's a June Allyson movie about one of the first women doctors. There's a movie about the first AfricanAmerican to graduate from West Point a movie about the first American astronauts about the first woman to win a Nobel Prize about Columbus about the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air about the first man to get the idea of the intermittent windshield wiper. This is about the first woman to achieve national recognition as a drag racer.No problem with Bonny Bedelia's performance though. She's more than good enough in a stereotyped role. Leo Rossi certainly looks right as the envious husband. Bill McKinney can be seen briefly as a more than usually easygoing King Of The Track. And Dick Miller he of the jutting chin is always welcome.".

She encountered chauvinistic men who were either outright opposed to her racing or were condescending many considering her nothing more than eye candy. One man Connie Kalitta played by Beau Bridges believed she could make it against the men. He became her sponsor and lover. The relationship was a tempestuous one and it didn't last but it got her started. Once she began to beat the men they began to respect her as a driver and a person. She went on to win many races and eventually 3 Top Fuel championships. She survived a horrible crash and fire but climbed right back into a car as soon as she could. Shirley has since mostly retired from racing and now runs only a few match races each year. But she left a legacy and inspiration for women drivers in various motorsports that endures today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly let me say this... in no time in the History of the Academy Awards has a major Film such as Heart Like a Wheel been so grossly overlooked. I don't know what happened with this one.. maybe there was no decent advertising maybe 20th Century got nervous because of the subject matter and tried to hide the Film upon release or maybe and more likely is that the Voters of the Academy did not hear of or screen this film. Its a rotten damn shame because Bonnie B. performance is unquestionably one of the greatest of all time! Tour de Force is not enough.. its simply taking a role and eating it alive! As important as Sally Field's Norma Rae was Heart Like a Wheel proves that women can dominate not only in American Society but on the Silver Screen. Bridges is outstanding as a aggressive violent and womanizing Connie Kalita. Even if you hate drag racing see this film. Back to Oscar the film did receive a Nomination for Best Costume Design so I will give credit where credit is due. Rosenthal's original mysterious synth score is intriguing and haunts you well after leaving the theater. There is some groundbreaking sound here.. hopefully somebody smart will come along and redigitize this soundtrack into a surround mix but the score is in Dolby. Jonathan Kaplan's Direction is quirky not the best ever but a fine job nevertheless. This is a subject matter that you have to have at least some knowledge of going into it and I think the Director did. I don't know if Shirley M. was actually onset didn't see a Tech Credit but I assume she may have been. Bonnie is sensational in this roller coaster quarter mile of burning rubber emotional ride of a reallife courageous and abused woman. Enter woman into man's sport issues for the first time and all hell break loose when track records fall. Shades of modernday racers such as Danica Patrick and Sarah Fisher are reminders that women continue to fight for their rights to not only have a chance to play the game but to win! Heart Like a Wheel wins in every single frame of film and is without question the Film that somehow Oscar missed!".

Losing to one more than twice his age Lionel Barrymore for A FREE SOUL MGM 1931 SKIPPY did earn other nominations Best Picture Best Screenplay Norman Taurog and Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Best Director Taurog who won the honor that year.The story opens in a small wholesome town where the camera sets focus on the Skinner household. There's Herbert Skinner Willard Robertson a town physician his wife Ellen Enid Bennett and their little boy they call Skippy Jackie Cooper. Getting ready for breakfast. Mr. Skinner calls for his son to get out of bed and dressed. As he is calling the camera then pans upstairs into Skippy's bedroom where the boy is still in bed pretending to be putting on his clothes lazily asking his parents downstairs which shirt to put on. After heading down for breakfast Skippy is visited by the neighborhood kids Sidney Jackie Searle an obnoxious tattletaler and his sister Eloise Mitzi Greene who takes the time to recite a poem In Memory of a Dead Dog. Later Skippy who spends his free time in a swell district known as Shantytown located on the opposite side of the tracks where poor people live meets and befriends another boy called Sooky Robert Coogan. At first Skippy wants to fight him but when Sooky stands his ground they become instant friends. Their day consists of innocent fun that lands them into trouble when they accidentally break the windshield of the mean Mr. Nubbins Jack Clifford car whose profession is dog catcher. Later Mr. Nubbins takes away Sooky's dog Penny for not having a license placing the animal in the pound. Sooky is able to retrieve the dog only if he comes up with a 3 fine for the license. With Skippy's help they do but Nubbins takes the money to replace his broken windshield forcing the boys to come up with an additional 3 by 3 p.m. in order to get Penny or else she'll have to be destroyed. The boys attempt to get that extra cash first by getting some money from Skippy's piggy bank collecting empty bottles doing errands selling lemonade and putting on a show for the neighborhood kids. While the boys successfully raise the money the unexpected occurs. Skippy soon finds himself resenting his father who not only warned him to stay away from Shantytown but has looked down towards those the people whom Skippy finds to be just plain ordinary folks as he and his parents are with the exception of having more money than they do. As with most family movies and later TV sitcoms there's a moral lesson here to be learned. In this instance rather than the children it's learned by the parents particularly Skippy's.Featured in the supporting cast are Guy Oliver as Dad Burkey Donald Haines as Harley Nubbins and Helen JeromeEddy as Sooky's widowed mother among others. Eddy a familiar face with sad expressions in many movies of the 1930s is quite believable and natural as Sooky's struggling poor mother.SKIPPY is a cute simple funny and heartwarming story focusing solely on children something quite rare for that time with the exception of comedy shorts featuring Hal Roach's Our Gang or The Little Rascals. To enjoy this sort of tale about the true loyalty and friendship between two boys is to really love and understand children. Movies such as SKIPPY could also be related by those who had grown up in such an bygone era. Director Norman Taurog presents the children not just its stars as normal every day innocent kids. SKIPPY could very well been set in any time frame any location whether during the Tom Sawyer era of the 1800s or pre or post World War I. In other words kids will always be kids.Aside from Jackie Cooper's fine performance ranging from conniving gentle and extremely tearful in that one climatic scene between him and his Dad there is Robert Bobby Coogan the younger brother of Jackie Coogan whose days as a top child star which began in the early 1920s were just about ending. Cute as he is natural little Bobby Coogan comes very close in upstaging Cooper. So successful was SKIPPY Paramount turned out an immediate sequel SOOKY 1931 with the majority of the cast minus Mitzi Green reprising their roles.Unseen for many years both SKIPPY and SOOKY were resurrected during the early years of cable television's U.S.A. cable network way past the midnight hours around 1987 before turning up again on Retroplex in August 2010 and Turner Classic Movies where it premiered February 22 2011.Regardless of its age SKIPPY is still timely thanks to a literate script. For comedy it delivers For serious moments it doesn't hold back. The crying scenes cannot actually be viewed without shedding at least one tear of emotion. As young as both Cooper and Coogan are or were they have presented themselves as real professional actors or in better terms common every day kids pretending to be somebody else that as Skippy and Sooky.

	onyx:emotionText "SKIPPY Paramount 1931 directed by Norman Taurog which has nothing to do with a development of the peanut butter product is a cute story based on the then popular comic strip character as portrayed by Jackie Cooper in a performance that earned this 10yearold child actor an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Losing to one more than twice his age Lionel Barrymore for A FREE SOUL MGM 1931 SKIPPY did earn other nominations Best Picture Best Screenplay Norman Taurog and Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Best Director Taurog who won the honor that year.The story opens in a small wholesome town where the camera sets focus on the Skinner household. There's Herbert Skinner Willard Robertson a town physician his wife Ellen Enid Bennett and their little boy they call Skippy Jackie Cooper. Getting ready for breakfast. Mr. Skinner calls for his son to get out of bed and dressed. As he is calling the camera then pans upstairs into Skippy's bedroom where the boy is still in bed pretending to be putting on his clothes lazily asking his parents downstairs which shirt to put on. After heading down for breakfast Skippy is visited by the neighborhood kids Sidney Jackie Searle an obnoxious tattletaler and his sister Eloise Mitzi Greene who takes the time to recite a poem In Memory of a Dead Dog. Later Skippy who spends his free time in a swell district known as Shantytown located on the opposite side of the tracks where poor people live meets and befriends another boy called Sooky Robert Coogan. At first Skippy wants to fight him but when Sooky stands his ground they become instant friends. Their day consists of innocent fun that lands them into trouble when they accidentally break the windshield of the mean Mr. Nubbins Jack Clifford car whose profession is dog catcher. Later Mr. Nubbins takes away Sooky's dog Penny for not having a license placing the animal in the pound. Sooky is able to retrieve the dog only if he comes up with a 3 fine for the license. With Skippy's help they do but Nubbins takes the money to replace his broken windshield forcing the boys to come up with an additional 3 by 3 p.m. in order to get Penny or else she'll have to be destroyed. The boys attempt to get that extra cash first by getting some money from Skippy's piggy bank collecting empty bottles doing errands selling lemonade and putting on a show for the neighborhood kids. While the boys successfully raise the money the unexpected occurs.

	schema:reviewBody "Percy Crosby's cartoon Skippy premiered in Life magazine in 1923 and became an instant success. It featured the doings of Skippy Skinner a little boy living in the city who was equally at home stealing apples playing baseball or just trying to understand the world of adults. At one point Crosby was earning over 2000 a week  the strip was a phenomenal success and there were Skippy dolls toys and comic books. Australia also had it's own version Fatty Finn which was turned into a movie that is still fascinating with it's glimpses of Australian suburban life in the 20s. MGM found an ideal Skippy in Jackie Cooper who claimed he only got the part because his uncle was the director. Regardless he was perfect in the role and even looked like the character.Skippy would rather hang around in Shantytown a beautiful place much to the disgust of his father  a pompous doctor who is head of the local council. With his friend snivelling Sidney  say I can get away with murder at my place because I'm nervous and strung high he makes the accquaintance of Sooky Robert Coogan a child so poor that even the Shantytown kids shun him. Gee it's elegant over here  alleys goats and dumps. Skippy meets Sooky's mother sad faced Helen Jerome Eddy and Penny his thoroughbred dog of mixed breeds. Their arch enemy is Harley Nubbins whose father is the local dog catcher  of course the inevitable happens and Penny is caught. Skippy and Sooky then have to find a way to raise the 3 needed for a dog license. From selling old bottles running errands to selling lemonade  nothing works finally they decide to put on a show. Ordinarily things would end happily but in this movie this is the time when you reach for the tissues. The movie ends on an extremely positive note and I really liked the way it explored the relationship between father and son how the father sheds his stuffiness and comes to an understanding about his son and his problems and instantly goes about trying to help him.Robert Coogan was Jackie's little brother but unfortunately he didn't inherit the talent  even though he was very cute as Sooky. He made a follow up Sooky in 1931 and a couple of others and then resurfaced in the 40s. Mitzi Green was mightily talented but you would have to seek out her other movies to see her at her best. In this one she was definitely a minor character Skippy's neighbour Eloise who recites poems at the drop of a hat Ode to a Dead Dog and has theatrical ambitions. Jackie Searl had more to do as Sidney Skippy's sidekick and did what he did best  playing an obnoxious little tattle tale. This is a beautiful little trip down memory lane to a time when children were allowed to be children.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't expect much from Skippy. How substantial could a Depressionera movie based on a comic strip be? But I found myself really into this film. I watched it with my kids and we all really enjoyed it.It's dated for sure and the precocious antics of the child actors will likely grate on some. But I liked some of the cultural subtleties in this movie that I found parallels for in our current world. Like the hypocrisy found in Skippy's parents affluent casually prejudiced people who think poor underprivileged folk are deserving of medical care he's a doctor but not of basic kindness and empathy when Skippy wants to go to the other side of the tracks his mom asks him if he wants to grow up to be like those people. Or the tendency of Skippy's parents to underestimate the complexity of a child's world and who dismiss a child's problems because they're deemed less important than those of adults not to a child they're not. Jackie Cooper is the rare child actor especially from that time period who's able to be truly winning instead of aggravating. He received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance I believe the youngest actor to ever achieve that feat. The film was also nominated for Outstanding Production and Best Writing Adaptation while Norman Taurog won that year's Oscar for Best Director. I've read that he got Jackie Cooper to cry at key moments in the film by threatening to shoot his dog. What a guy.Grade A".

	schema:headline " A good set of values";
	schema:reviewBody "Paramount Pictures was one step from receivership until Mae West and Bing Crosby signed with them during the Depression. But this film I'm sure kept the wolf from the door for a little while. Skippy which is based on a popular comic strip of the day was the career role for little Jackie Cooper while he was a child star.Cooper was one of the few child stars to have a real career in front of and behind the camera and it was a long one. He also played a wide range of characters. Yet when his name is mentioned today the first thing that comes to mind is the little kid with the knickers and somewhat pouty but with a good heart and a set of values that he did not get from home completely.Skippy is the child of town doctor Willard Robertson and Helen Bennett and he's a good kid at heart. But Robertson who's a fundamentally decent man doesn't want him playing with the kids on the other side of the railroad tracks. That's shantytown and there were plenty of them in America in 1931. Skippy is a film of its time although I'll bet that people who lived in those shantytowns did not part with the nickel needed to see Skippy it was needed for important things like food.Robertson as director of the board of health also wants to clean the place up. But with scant regard for the people who live there. So when Skippy makes friends with a slum kid who lives there played by Jackie Coogan's brother Robert and his mother Helen Jerome Eddy and their dog it turns out to be a turning point in everyone's lives.With his decent but thickheaded father and a mother oblivious to all except what's within the four walls of their home Skippy grows up with an intuitive sense set of good values. It's what makes Jackie Cooper's character such an appealing one to this day.Skippy brought home a Best Director Oscar for Norman Taurog and a few other nominations. Taurog gets it for some superb direction for a flock of kid players who are the ones carrying the film. It musn't have been easy but the results are great.Skippy is a film firmly within the Depression times it was made but it has a universal family appeal to this day.".

There's nothing like the zeal of the newly converted so this screenplay was written to show how God does move in mysterious ways for the believers.What's hard to believe is that the same author of The Women actually wrote Come to the Stable. But it's true and Luce is a skilled writer and she fashioned a very easy to take tale of two nuns over from France trying to build a children's hospital in memory of the kids they couldn't save in World War II.The two nuns are played by Loretta Young and Celeste Holm. There was no doubt that Young would be one of the three leads. Loretta Young Irene Dunne and Rosalind Russell were three of the leading female Catholic lay people in the country at that time. I'm sure all were approached with this film.Young and Holm were both recent Oscar winners for The Farmer's Daughter and Gentlemen's Agreement and both were nominated for Best Actress here. Both lost the big sweepstakes to Olivia DeHavilland who was also a recent winner for To Each His Own. Strange are the ways of the Academy voters. Elsa Lanchester was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the religious artist who offers the nuns shelter and lodging during their quest. Lanchester is her usual charming but off the wall self in her part.In today's audience some may find all the happy coincidences a bit much. But then again that is precisely the point of the film that God will help those who help themselves.One other thing. Some very rough and irreligious people contribute to the sister's endeavor and I think the message there is that on occasion man can rise above just looking out for himself and think of the human race at large.".

	schema:headline " And Then There Were Nuns";
	schema:reviewBody "COME TO THE STABLE 20th CenturyFox 1949 directed by Henry Koster from the story by Claire Booth Luce stars Loretta Young in her most perfect screen role. Not quite the retelling of the three Wise Men following the star in the Heavens as they locate the Baby Jesus born in the stable surrounded by Joseph and his Mother Mary but one about two nuns from the Order of Holy Endeavor on a mission of faith fulfilling their promise to God. With its opening parallel to the three wise men the film begins with two wise nuns Sister Margaret Loretta Young from Chicago and Sister Scholastica Celeste Holm of France having arrived in Connecticut by train walking miles through the snow with the twinkling star up above. Having spent and survived their war years in France helping underprivileged children their mission now is to build a children's hospital in the town of Bethlehem. Their journey leads them to the barn where they find Miss Amelia Potts sensitively played by Elsa Lanchester an artist who specializes in religious pictures and the Matthews family acting as models for her latest painting Come to the Stable. During the course of time the nuns take up residence with Miss Potts acquire the friendship and assistance of Anthony Dooley Wilson employed and living in the home of Robert Mason Hugh Marlowe a young composer and his great dane called Arson on the other side of the hill from Miss Potts. Finding the perfect location to build their hospital the nuns learn the land owner to be Luigi Rossi Thomas Gomez a bookie racketeer who conducts his business in midtown New York. Regardless of circumstances they intend on meeting with him with the hope he would be so kind and donate the land to them which doesn't seem possible. As much as the Bishop Basil Ruysdael and Monsignor Talbot Regis Toomey feel the nuns are fighting a lost cause the Bishop agrees on giving them along with the other assisting nuns three months to earn enough money to pay for property and adjoining building for their church much to the dismay of Mr. Mason who doesn't want the hospital placed in his own back yard.Filled with sentimental charm in the style of Leo McCarey's THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S RKO 1945 starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman COME TO THE STABLE is great on comedy as well with the sisters getting into the habit of unwittingly annoying Mr. Mason for special favors and their way of passing through some tough thugs one of them played by Mike Mazurki in order to visit with their head boss Gomez in excellent portrayal. Aside from Sister Margaret being a driver with a lead foot the scene worth mentioning is the one where the sisters come to Manhattan in Mr. Mason's borrowed jeep leaving it in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral to enter the church and light a special candle only to return to find a parking ticket placed on the windshield. What's done with the ticket comes as an element of surprise especially from the officer watching at a distance.

A delightful film from start to finish COME TO THE STABLE is worthy viewing not only around Christmas but any time of the year. While Loretta Young never portrayed a nun on screen again she would enact that particular role in an episode or two on television for her Loretta Young Show in the 1950s but none as memorable as her portrayal as Sister Margaret who's faith is stronger than herself.

	onyx:emotionText "COME TO THE STABLE 20th CenturyFox 1949 directed by Henry Koster from the story by Claire Booth Luce stars Loretta Young in her most perfect screen role. Not quite the retelling of the three Wise Men following the star in the Heavens as they locate the Baby Jesus born in the stable surrounded by Joseph and his Mother Mary but one about two nuns from the Order of Holy Endeavor on a mission of faith fulfilling their promise to God. With its opening parallel to the three wise men the film begins with two wise nuns Sister Margaret Loretta Young from Chicago and Sister Scholastica Celeste Holm of France having arrived in Connecticut by train walking miles through the snow with the twinkling star up above. Having spent and survived their war years in France helping underprivileged children their mission now is to build a children's hospital in the town of Bethlehem. Their journey leads them to the barn where they find Miss Amelia Potts sensitively played by Elsa Lanchester an artist who specializes in religious pictures and the Matthews family acting as models for her latest painting Come to the Stable. During the course of time the nuns take up residence with Miss Potts acquire the friendship and assistance of Anthony Dooley Wilson employed and living in the home of Robert Mason Hugh Marlowe a young composer and his great dane called Arson on the other side of the hill from Miss Potts. Finding the perfect location to build their hospital the nuns learn the land owner to be Luigi Rossi Thomas Gomez a bookie racketeer who conducts his business in midtown New York. Regardless of circumstances they intend on meeting with him with the hope he would be so kind and donate the land to them which doesn't seem possible. As much as the Bishop Basil Ruysdael and Monsignor Talbot Regis Toomey feel the nuns are fighting a lost cause the Bishop agrees on giving them along with the other assisting nuns three months to earn enough money to pay for property and adjoining building for their church much to the dismay of Mr. Mason who doesn't want the hospital placed in his own back yard.Filled with sentimental charm in the style of Leo McCarey's THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S RKO 1945 starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman COME TO THE STABLE is great on comedy as well with the sisters getting into the habit of unwittingly annoying Mr. Mason for special favors and their way of passing through some tough thugs one of them played by Mike Mazurki in order to visit with their head boss Gomez in excellent portrayal. Aside from Sister Margaret being a driver with a lead foot the scene worth mentioning is the one where the sisters come to Manhattan in Mr. Mason's borrowed jeep leaving it in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral to enter the church and light a special candle only to return to find a parking ticket placed on the windshield. What's done with the ticket comes as an element of surprise especially from the officer watching at a distance. Scenes such as these are played in a straightforward manner which performs much funnier for its viewers. While Loretta Young deservingly earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress Celeste Holm's secondary performance as the French nun who expertly plays a good game of tennis should not go unnoticed. Even though a native born French actress as Annabella could have been more accurate in the role Holm's French accent is so perfect and convincing one would think she was actually born and raised in France.

There's a lot more to be amused and entertained by of course and the behindthecamera artisans as well as the wellchosen actors especially Hugh Marlowe and Elsa Lanchester as well as Misses Young and Holm all contributed some very professional work.

	schema:headline " Excellent Performances Nice Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Come to the Stable 1949 out of 4Excellent performances and a touching story highlight this comedydrama about a pair of nuns Loretta Young Celeste Holm who travel from France to New England where they plan on building a children's hospital. Without any type of funds the nuns try to gather enough money for their dream to come true but they're going to have to depend on some characters who aren't all that thrilled about the hospital. This film was nominated for seven Oscars but it seems to have been forgotten which is a real shame because this is a pretty touching little gem that works on many levels. What really stands out are the terrific performances with Young and Holm both turning in strong work. There wasn't a single second that I ever looked at their characters and saw actors because the two were so good that you'll have no trouble believing that they are nuns. They're surrounding by some fine actors including Hugh Marlowe as a neighbor who doesn't want to church built. Elsa Lancaster plays an elderly lonely woman who first takes the nuns in and Thomas Gomez is terrific as a gambler who owns the property where the sisters are wanting to build the hospital. The movie tries walking a fine line between laughs and drama and for the most part it works. I think there are a few bits that push too hard for comedy and you'll see one such scene early one when the joke about the nuns driving too fast is played to the extreme. The main reason this movie works is due to its more dramatic and religious moments. The film is never preachy nor does it try to convert people instead it just makes you feel good. The sequence where the nuns go to the gambler to try and get him to give away the land ends is a very dramatic sequence that I won't ruin but it's incredibly touching. Another terrific scene is when the nuns try to get the local Bishop to buy into their ideas even though it seems impossible that they'll be able to pull them off. Apparently this drama was so successful when first released that a sequel was planned but never produced. It's easy to see why this movie would bring a crowd in but it deserves to be better known today.".

	schema:headline " Charity does not cover this multitude of sins.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that the greatest film about religion that I have ever seen bar none is The Passion of Joan of Arc the silent 1928 Carl Th. Dreyer classic that was based in large part on the actual transcripts of Jeanne d'Arc's trial at Rouen in 1431. It is stunningly unsentimental utterly believable brilliantly realized and the performance by Maria Falconetti as Joan is justifiably praised as among the best ever put on film. God is a positive presence in faithful Joan but the Catholic church is far from a positive presence in the film.In comparison movies like Come to the Stable along with Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's are commercial products period. Come to the Stable is the work of a distinguished Jewish producer Samuel Engel of My Darling Clementine and Daddy Long Legs so we can safely conclude that the studio's motives had less to do with religious belief than with big box office. That's not an insult it's just Hollywood which is also responsible for the movie's qualities  charming performances skilled writers journeyman direction. But it is religious propaganda simpleminded predictable and slick. At no point is there the slightest doubt that the ending will jerk the tears of the faithful and honor the Roman Catholic god with hymns and redeemed characters.The most remarkable aspect of this movie never seems to be mentioned by reviewers The French nuns Loretta Young Celeste Holm who arrive in America after World War II have a plan to build a children's hospital but they are not in the least concerned with where such a facility might actually be needed. Indeed the location they choose is a town that doesn't want or apparently need such a hospital. There's not one child in the whole movie ill or well. The nuns chose the New England town not for any epidemiological reasons but because it's called Bethlehem. Logically then we can assume that if there had been a contemporaneous outbreak of poliomyelitis among children in Sodom Ohio it exists Trumbull County these nuns would at most pray for the little Sodomites from the chapel of their empty hospital in Bethlehem.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me start by saying that the greatest film about religion that I have ever seen bar none is The Passion of Joan of Arc the silent 1928 Carl Th. Dreyer classic that was based in large part on the actual transcripts of Jeanne d'Arc's trial at Rouen in 1431. It is stunningly unsentimental utterly believable brilliantly realized and the performance by Maria Falconetti as Joan is justifiably praised as among the best ever put on film. God is a positive presence in faithful Joan but the Catholic church is far from a positive presence in the film.In comparison movies like Come to the Stable along with Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's are commercial products period.

I thought it would be sticky sentimental and slickand it was.Yet it's done in an entertaining manner with just the right amount of warmth and lightness of touch to make it a commercial hit. But in all honesty it's an unremarkable tale about two nuns who go about their mission of building a children's hospital on good faith that the Lord will provide a means of doing so. And of course He does exactly that in time for a happy ending.The actors are given very light material but the performances are first rate. Loretta Young and Celeste Holm are spirited and charming as the nuns Thomas Gomez is excellent as a racketeer with a heart of gold and Elsa Lanchester excels as a dotty painter. Hugh Marlowe displays a fine sense of humor as a man whose life in the country is turned upside down by an invasion of happy nuns intent on building a hospital near his grounds. He is the real surprise of the film much more animated than usual better than he was in All About Eve as a composer annoyed by the wellintentioned sisters who invade his privacy.It's a film of gentle humor and a few wellearned chuckles along the way directed in journeyman style by Henry Koster and well photographed by Joseph LaShelle. Not easy to understand is why Young and Holm were nominated for Oscars since their material is hardly substantial enough to warrant the prestigious award. On the other hand the supporting role Elsa Lanchester plays is a standout and Dooley Wilson is fine as Marlowe's multifaceted butler and driver.".

	schema:headline " Sublime film of faith trust and divine providence";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a delightful story of faith and trust in divine providence and of healing and conversions. Come to the Stable is from a Christmas story by Claire Boothe Luce who also cowrote the screenplay. While the plot is fiction it has close similarities to a real story in 1947 and some real people then living around Bethlehem CT. The plot also has connections to World War II which had recently ended. The setting is a rural area of NW Connecticut. The opening scene seems surrealistic stark. It's night time and bright stars fill the sky with some clouds ahead on the horizon. Two nuns are walking in the snow on a road that goes through a barren terrain. Gentle snowcovered hills  with no trees or buildings in sight until the end of the scene. They stop when they come to road signs Jordan Galilee Nazareth Bethlehem. The nuns have walked a few miles from the train station and have reached their destination. They hear Christmas carols as they near the stable studio of Amelia Potts played by Elsa Lanchester a wellknown painter of religious scenes. Sister Margaret played by Loretta Young is a native of Chicago who attended school in France. She then joined a religious order there the Sisters of Holy Endeavor. Sister Scholastica played by Celeste Holm is a native of France. They came from near Villers France. There are a few towns with the prefix Villers in the area of Normandy. The nuns ran a hospital for children. The Nazis used it as an observation point and when an American armored division was advancing the nuns evacuated the hospital  all but about 100 children who couldn't be moved. Sister Margaret asked for God's help and promised the Lord that if she could get through to the American general and the hospital would be spared she would return to her own country and build a children's hospital there. When the shelling was done the town all around was leveled but the hospital wasn't touched. So here they are now in America.Robert Masen played by Hugh Marlowe was among the American troops that stormed the beaches in Normandy. And the only son of Luigi Rossi played by Thomas Gomez was killed during the Normandy invasion near Villers. In the movie Sister Margaret is a snappy jeep driver. Sister Scholastica says During the war the GIs taught Sister Margaret all about the jeep. All of the acting is superb with Dooley Wilson in a wonderful role as Anthony James Masen's hired hand.How the nuns happened to come to Bethlehem was as Sister Margaret says by divine providence. In France they received a postcard from America. It showed the painting Come to the Stable and on the back it described the work of Amelia Potts in Bethlehem CT. So that's how these two nuns began their pilgrimage to find a place to build a children's hospital. They have a devotion to St. Jude the patron saint of the impossible and will name the hospital after him. The story is a wonderful tale of providence indeed guiding these sisters in their mission. To anyone else it would seem impossible. But the message of the movie is the great faith of these women and their trust in providence to achieve their goal. The bishop played by Basil Ruysdael says after he has met the nuns Something tells me that an irresistible force has been let loose in New England. Later Monsignor Talbot played by Regis Toomey says Excellency it is that irresistible force. Bishop Against which quite obviously there is no defense. There hasn't been for nearly 2000 years. In 1949 Connecticut had just one Catholic diocese. It's seat was at Hartford 40 miles away from Bethlehem. The drive to New York to find Luigi Rossi was just 100 miles. But there were no Interstate highways then. Luce no doubt got her idea for this story from some real events and people in 1947. That year two French nuns arrived in Bethlehem to found a contemplative Benedictine abbey. They were from an abbey northeast of Paris. They were taken in by artist Lauren Ford 18911973 a painter of Christian and children's themes. A prominent Protestant Robert Leather had a pinecovered hill in town which he cherished as a place of prayer. He wanted it to be preserved as a sacred place so he donated the land for the abbey.Regina Laudis flourishes today on 400 acres. It became known years later after Hollywood actress Delores Hart joined the order in 1963. She later served more than 10 years as prioress. As of the time of this writing Mother Delores Hart is still alive and a vibrant member of the Regina Laudis Abbey. The abbey has a gift shop that sells many of the things the nuns make  similar to what the movie shows. It sells many craft items food items religious goods and CDs of the nuns singing Gregorian chant. Come to the Stable is a warm inspiring film that the whole family will enjoy at Christmas or any time of year. As the bishop says toward the end of the film Sometimes the simple blind faith of such sisters is really  sublime magnificent.".

When we first meet Arthur he seems eager to help his clients. He soon realizes the legal system as it's practiced in the court room depends on who is judging the case as there appears to be jaded judges who are blind to the justice he is seeking for his clients.This 1979 directed by Norman Jewison and based on a screen play by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin offers another look at the way our legal system works.The young Arthur clearly gets his fill of what is wrong with the system early on as he sees an innocent man go to jail for something he didn't do. That same man plays a pivoting role in the story when he becomes so frustrated that he can't take it anymore. The same goes for the black cross dresser who puts his trust in Arthur only to feel betrayed when Arthur sends a colleague to defend him but obviously that lawyer couldn't care less what happens to the poor man.The film is engrossing because of the work of a young and eager Al Pacino who as Arthur Kirkland is basically the whole movie. Mr. Pacino under Mr. Jewison's guidance did a wonderful job in getting under Arthur Kirkland's skin. This was one of the best performances this talented actor gave early in his career.The rest of the cast shows some actors that went on to bigger and better things. Craig T. Nelson Christine Lahti Jeffrey Tambor Domnenic Chianeseand Larry Briggman made good contributions to the success of the film.

Sometimes satire works as a magnifying glass to expose and better criticize something. And I believe that's what happens in this movie with all those bizarre scenes and deranged characters.Even though Jewison focuses problems such as corruption criticizes the danger of powerful people in the wrong places and brings up moral dilemmas about the practice of law I believe And Justice for All is more of a satire than a serious alert to a possible decadence of the judicial system. The odd elements in the plot are one too many to see the movie strictly from its dramatic point of view a crossdresser client an evidenceeating defendant a suicidal judge a hysterical lawyer.In a certain way the message of this movie reminded me the one of Mike Nichols antiwar comedy Catch22 in order to cope with a crazy situation you have to become a little crazy. In a war scenario people fight for values like justice and order but they also fight for power and interests the same thing happens inside a courtroom. Some lawyers see Law as a business some see it as a way to promote their personal careers and some see it as the opportunity given to those who have nothing else to lose.The performances are just great specially the ones of Jack Warden and Jeffrey Tambor. Al Pacino unquestionably steals the movie with another overthetop performance as the lawyer willing to risk everything and delivers another memorable speech during his opening statement'.".

Director Norman Jewison doesn't know either and neither does the audience....And Justice For All according to many reviews is supposed to be some sort of Catch22ish satirical black comedy but if so then it fails miserably since it's never as funny or outrageous as that and the scenes that force the film's messages  and those are excruciatingly obvious  are melodramatic and heavyhanded.

But here no trace of subtlety can be found. And although the overthetop performance fits right in at the final scene and indeed makes for a very memorable and often quoted couple of minutes it makes every other scene  especially the ones Pacino's character shares with his grandfather or his dull unconvincing love interest  fall flat. Partially it's a good thing because it paved the way for his performance in Scarface  which is one of the best most glorious examples of complete shameless overacting ever. But here it just doesn't work. It's not Pacino's fault though or Jewison's It's just a poorly conceived story and with something like that all the talent in the world couldn't help.".

Partially it's a good thing because it paved the way for his performance in Scarface  which is one of the best most glorious examples of complete shameless overacting ever. But here it just doesn't work. It's not Pacino's fault though or Jewison's It's just a poorly conceived story and with something like that all the talent in the world couldn't help.";

An important subplot runs through all this  Arthur trying to hold his sanity and legal practice together while sparking up his love live  along with some of the tragedy he witnesses. He is after all a budgetpriced criminal defense lawyer in a large Eastern city so I wouldn't expect everything to be pretty and tidy even in a comedy. Contrary to some of the comments below this movie is highly pedigreed. Thought the script was weak? Barry Levinson cowrote it. And what's all this bellyaching about the music? This movie was released during the disco craze and the score was performed by a jailhouse ensemble. What did you expect the music to sound like Tangerine Dream? Porter Wagoner? Beethoven? It was written by Dave Grusin who has been nominated for seven Oscars he won in 1988 for The Milagro Beanfield War and also has collected seven Grammys over the years. Of course it was directed by Norman Jewison who has shown good if occasional aptitude for comedy The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming Moonstruck Other People's Money. Also if you look at Pacino's performance with a critical eye you may decide it was one of the best of his career  especially compared with some of the more contrived if popular portrayals subsequent to this movie Scarface Scent of a Woman. Try to remember the context in which a movie was released while watching with that critical eye and it's generally apparent if it stands the test of time. I'd say this one does  beautifully.".

The sheer wealth of incident so much happens in this movie! is improbable. And of course the finale with Pacino Telling It Like It Is is pure Hollywood histrionics.But after all it is Pacino chewing the scenery not some lesser actor. He makes you feel how much he cares about his clients and he makes you share his rage over the legal system. You feel his frustration with his beloved but addled grandfather who thinks his boy is still in school. His loyalty to the old man is touching.All in all an entertaining movie about a serious subject but not a movie to take too seriously.".

	schema:headline " Does justice really exist in the American judicial system?";
	schema:reviewBody "AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is getting to be a bit long in the tooth nowadays but unfortunately it still rings all too true in America today. Every day we see another example of the film's basic truth if you have enough money or influence you can do almost ANYTHING and walk away clean. Jewison's film is just one in a long line of protests against a system where justice is a two tiered affair from Bob Dylan's THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL through grousing newspaper editorials about corporate criminals walking away through grumbling in the Vox Populi and subsequent rioting about the handling of the O. J. Simpson case and the currently impending travesty that will probably allow those responsible for the Enron debacle to avoid responsibility for the lives they've destroyed.The ending of AND JUSTICE FOR ALL although fictional gives us all a bit of welcome relief from a sea of corruption that seems to be drowning us all... but is the film really an accurate reflection of what's going on in the legal system? I decided to find out.I have a friend who is an attorney who seldom watches movies of any sort he doesn't even own a television set. He's never seen AND JUSTICE FOR ALL so I sent him a cut rate DVD of it which he played on his PC's DVD drive. I asked him for comments from the point of view of a real working lawyer.He enjoyed the film but I found his comments fascinating... from a technical standpoint the film had a few flaws but also had some rather neat plot twists that for odd reasons ring true.First off... I was very surprised to hear that Arthur Kirkland's opening statement to the jury would be VERY UNLIKELY to get him disbarred! In fact given the circumstances it was about the only course open to him and if he HADN'T sunk Fleming Kirkland COULD have been disbarred! Under the canons of legal ethics once Kirkland knew FOR CERTAIN that Fleming was guilty of the accusations and he knew that from Fleming's own admission of guilt he had only two options. Failure to exercise one of both of them IS grounds for disbarment.1 He would have to go to the judge and request to be relieved as Fleming's defense attorney. If he were to defend Fleming KNOWING that he's guilty it would necessarily require him to LIE in open court a clear violation of legal ethics. In real practice a lawyer will often tell a prospective defendant FLAT OUT If you're guilty I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. Unfortunately for us all Kirkland's probing for the truth and Fleming's confession are totally unrealistic. As we know from the film's plot the option of walking away from the case was neatly cut off for him. Even if he had been able to exercise it he was still on shaky ethical ground and could possibly have been hauled before the Bar Association at a later date.2 Kirkland's other option in this situation involves his role as an Officer of the Court. Once he knew for certain that Fleming was guilty he was OBLIGATED to report that fact to the court. If he had dropped the case and it could be proved later that he knew about Fleming's guilt but hadn't taken this whistle blowing action he was disbarment bait. The failure to report Fleming's confession constitutes the deliberate withholding of evidence.In the end Kirkland fulfilled this requirement with his outburst thus covering his ass from an ethical standpoint. However due to the unconventional way he did it one of two things would probably happen in a real court.First Judge Rayford would reprimand him in open court for his unseemly performance and possibly find him in contempt.Second even tho it was a VERY touchy situation it's possible that the State Bar Association would probably also issue a reprimand falling short of disbarment proceedings again on the basis of unseemly conduct in court.My attorney friend was also critical of Kirkland's handling of the Jeff McCullough case. Repeatedly Kirkland tells Jeff I'll get you out.Lawyers may sometimes seem like all powerful miracle workers to the general public but they're not. With his I'll get you out statements KIRKLAND WAS MAKING A PROMISE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP and thus was lying to Jeff. The proper statement would have been I'll do everything that I can to get you out.Another criticism... when the charges were first filed against Fleming he should have been suspended from the bench IMMEDIATELY until such time as the charges were disposed of. If found eventually guilty EVERY case that Judge Fleming decided from the time of being charged had an almost automatic appeal loophole.These things seem like minor technicalities just the nitpicking of a few words and concepts. That may be true but the law itself IS nothing but a few words and concepts... words and concepts that we're supposed to be living by.One final thing the lawyer said and this is to me the most ominous comment of all.He doesn't deal with Kirkland's sort of practice... in his own words criminal law is far too sleazy for his tastes.The lies backroom deals corruption and as he put it Playing Penalty Poker with prosecutors are all too accurately portrayed in this film and he wants no part of it.".

If you have not seen And Justice for All you are in for a treat. Far and away this was Al Pacino's best film role and possibly one of the greatest film roles of all time.Too bad Hollywood was so engrossed in the morbidly depressing and cynical Kramer vs. Kramer in 1980.

	schema:headline " Much more than a comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a review 'And Justice for all' has been reviewed to death here below as comedy as a tourde force acting performance by Al Pacino as an entertainment and as a musical showcase. I was hugely entertained by this movie but in a different way.This is a personal evaluation of a landmark movie directed by Norman Jewison and written by Barry Levinson  Valarie Curtin. The film reflected the rage that many felt against the failed CriminalJustice system of 25yrs ago. Since then Judges have been reigned in somewhat and DNA technology has freed thousands many even from death row. What still persists is lawenforcement's inability to admit a mistake. Officialdom will move heaven and earth to stand firm on any previous decision as if to admit error would undermine the legal edifice and bring the law into disrespect. The opposite is true of course. The whole world knows that mistakes are made in adjudicating the relations between people and if law enforcement could admit this fact with grace the whole legal system would run more smoothly in fact an order of magnitude smoother and more efficiently. And thus the rage.I would like to start at the end. With titles running Arthur Kirkland Baltimore lawyer is sitting bewildered and despairing on the steps of the Baltimore Court House he has just blown the career he loved. His rage at the phony and corrupt criminaljustice system has led him to betray the client he was sworn to defend and he will surely be disbarred. The trial he has been ejected from will certainly be declared a mistrial and a vicious criminal may go free. The affair he was having with Gail Packer a thing of the past.The writers had no doubt about the story they were telling. It's a story about justice denied to all but those who can get the best legal representation and that means money. It is a story of a system where judges have become so arrogant and crazed by their own power of life or death that they have lost all contact with the world around them. Without a modicum of respect for the rights of those that come before them for justice sometimes carelessly and sometimes with malice they meddle heedlessly in peoples lives causing havoc and dismay.The pleabargaining system also comes in for its share of bashing. In the lobbies and antechambers of the CourtHouse we see lawyers and prosecutors haggling over the penalties to be meted out in exchange for a guilty plea. These are almost biblical scenes of temple desecration.Judge Henry T. Fleming played by John Forsyth is the metaphor for evil in this movie. His aloofness and arrogance and his repetition of the words 'I don't care' convey the awesomeness of his depravity. He really doesn't care about the people who come before him or their lawyers or the rest of the World for that matter. In this he is the distilled essence of evil. As the story evolves we realize that this man is more criminal than those who appear before him and all ironies are complete. In the penultimate scene the 'You are out of order' scene Judge Fleming accused rapist and Kirkland's client gazes sternly and coldly at Kirklands' helpless rage.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is not a review 'And Justice for all' has been reviewed to death here below as comedy as a tourde force acting performance by Al Pacino as an entertainment and as a musical showcase. I was hugely entertained by this movie but in a different way.This is a personal evaluation of a landmark movie directed by Norman Jewison and written by Barry Levinson  Valarie Curtin. The film reflected the rage that many felt against the failed CriminalJustice system of 25yrs ago. Since then Judges have been reigned in somewhat and DNA technology has freed thousands many even from death row. What still persists is lawenforcement's inability to admit a mistake. Officialdom will move heaven and earth to stand firm on any previous decision as if to admit error would undermine the legal edifice and bring the law into disrespect. The opposite is true of course. The whole world knows that mistakes are made in adjudicating the relations between people and if law enforcement could admit this fact with grace the whole legal system would run more smoothly in fact an order of magnitude smoother and more efficiently. And thus the rage.I would like to start at the end.

	schema:reviewBody "I doubt you will ever see as thorough an indictment of the American legal system as you are brought in the film And Justice For All. Too often the object of that legal system has been terribly lost in the process.This film has become my favorite Al Pacino role. I don't think he was ever better on the screen as Arthur Kirkland an attorney who cares maybe too much for his clients both for his career and his own mental health. During the course of And Justice For All Pacino has two clients who for reasons I won't go into here do not get their proper day in court and both stories end tragically. The clients are Robert Christian as the cross dressing Ralph Agee and Thomas G. Waites as Jeff McCullaugh and both players give stunning performances. The hardest audience heart out there will feel their pain.Their stories are mixed in with Pacino's running feud with a malevolent judge played by John Forsythe. John Forsythe in this film is not the John Forsythe of Dynasty or Bachelor Father or the disembodied employer of three shapely female private eyes. As it turns out this law and order judge thinks he's quite above the law. And he involves Pacino in his effort to prove his innocence after he's accused of rape.Life does have a funny way of imitating art and later on the New York State Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler was brought down in a similar scandal to what Forsythe is accused of here.Jack Warden is another judge operating out of that same Baltimore courthouse that Forsythe does. He's quite a whack job himself sitting on a window ledge eating his lunch wearing a concealed revolver under his judicial robes. It's a crime for the rest of us to do that but he's another judge who feels himself above the law.Pacino has some very tender scenes with Lee Strassberg who plays his grandfather and Sam Levene who is Strassberg's friend at the nursing home they reside it. They're all such good players that you don't even think while you're watching them that this is a reunion of Michael Corleone and Hyman Roth. His scenes with them are his link to a world beyond his chosen profession.The tragedy of And Justice For All is not so much the personal tragedies of Christian and Waites bad as they are. It is the arrogant abuse of the rules and procedures of our legal system by the very men who are a bound by it as Pacino is. Pacino finds himself so boxed in that the only way he can see justice done is blow up his own career in a now legendary courtroom climax scene.In the post Watergate Era And Justice For All found its audience. And its message is still a timely one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I like both actor Al Pacino and director Norman Jewison but in AND JUSTICE FOR ALL I like neither of them. They were assigned a stinker and they stink with it. The picture represents all the worst things in late 70s film particularly lame family aimed comedy or drama. This film tries to be satiric but takes itself too seriously in the drama department and fails miserably when it tries to be funny. It feels too much and thinks too little.SPOILERS BELOWPacino plays the best lawyer there is and tries to defend all the innocent people in Baltimore. Now he must defend a judge he doesn't like from a rape charge he knows he's guilty of. Meanwhile all of his innocent clients all of whom have weepy stories of poverty and hard luck are getting screwed in his absence. One of them tells Pacino horror stories of prison giving the worst delivery in the movie to the line they RAPED me! Too heighten the black comedy our hero is close friends with a suicidal judge played by Jack Warden. The moral strain weighs on our hero and we get scenes of Pacino lightheartedly running with joggers to the worst music ever put in a film. The climax contains the famous You're out of order! speech the crest of the actor's most overthetop performance. Courtroom drama never looked worse.The satire of this film is weak and obvious and it doesn't help that it's contained in a poorly acted poorly directed movie. The score by David Grusin is torturous. If you want a good film that exposes the justice system see THE TRIAL 1962 or BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ 1962. If want a good Pacino movie anything from SERPICO 1973 to SCARFACE 1983 should satisfy. If you want a good Jewison movie see ROLLERBALL 1975 or FIDDLER ON THE ROOF 1971. AND JUSTICE FOR ALL was a mistake. It's messages can be better served with anything from LE PROCES to NATURAL BORN KILLERS.Avoid this mess! See a real movie!".

Unfortunately it doesn't even fall in the it's so bad it's good category either.Please note that this review contains multiple spoilers.For instance as a 1979 picture studios wanted to be on the cutting edge of what was considered cool at the time and thus instead of a dramatic symphonic soundtrack we are greeted right from the getgo with disco grooves. Since this felt so out of place it would have made sense to see John Travolta in a cameo as the introductory credits rolled by. Keep in mind this is a drama about a case where a woman is severely beaten and raped so prompting the audience to snap its fingers and gyrate its hips to appease the brutality of the crime was a decision that the kindred spirit of Jeffrey Dahmer presiding over Columbia Pictures at the time reasonably took.There are countless moments of total absence of logic that should baffle the mind of anybody with an IQ of 60 or higher.For one Pacino's character Arthur is in jail overnight for trying to punch a judge in the face. There is no way that he would still be practicing law afterwards. However due to the infinitely spotless track record of 24h jail timeouts it makes sense to assume that Arthur has learned his lesson. Next a woman on a committee that antagonizes Arthur falls for the lamest sober pickup attempt in film history in spite of the fact that she's a foot taller and out of his league. I've witnessed fewer leaps of faith in Rambo. Then they proceed to have yelling matches sporadically throughout the movie but are magically able to separate their professional and personal lives. I have witnessed better chemistry between a Nazi officer and a concentration camp prisoner.Arthur's best friend is Jay who spends 2 scenes laughing exaggeratingly loud and long at an ironic element in the story. It had more weight and appeared more natural when Dr Evil did the same in Austin Powers. It is known later that a killer he freed on a technicality killed 2 children which upset him so that he took refuge at the end of a long hall with an endless stack of plates which he frisbeed at people who would approach him. This posed such a threat that 2 police officers unholstered their guns ready to shoot him. Later he shaves his head eat your heart out Brittany Spears.Arthur is blackmailed into to defending the judge he despises in spite of the fact that he's guilty because he could otherwise be disbarred on a technicality. Trying to hit a judge is bad but apparently not as bad as calling the cops because he thought a crazy client of his might kill people which is a conflict of interest. Makes sense.There is another judge in the story who is purely suicidal. He spend his lunches on the ledge of the 4thfloor pilots helicopters with limited fuel supplies and attempt to shoot his head off with a long rifle in his bathroom before court starts. Next to him the Joker is the picture child for mental stability.The climax of the movie is the courtroom scene where Arthur is making his opening statement. He stops midway and announces that he can't continue because his client's guilty. The presiding judge tells him he's out of order to which Arthur yells back No YOU'RE out of order! indicating to everybody that his comebacks have the wit of a 6year old. Incredibly the courtroom audience erupts in applause give him a standing ovation and the accused judge is seen with his head in his hands all telling us that the defendant will finally pay for his crimes. Unbelievable. I have seen more tactical argumentation from Creationists.Arthur is then seen sitting on the steps of the courthouse where Jay who is clearly wearing a wig is ready to come in. Jay salutes Arthur by lifting his wig off like you would a hat as a gesture of politeness. This surreal scene tops anything in the movie. Even in his drunken foolishness the director must have thought the same which is why the credits started rolling right after... complete with bland disco beats! I would rather pour a generous coating of sweet honey over my naked genitals and offer them buffetstyle to a hungry tribe of fire ants than ever watch this movie again. You have been warned.".

I would rather pour a generous coating of sweet honey over my naked genitals and offer them buffetstyle to a hungry tribe of fire ants than ever watch this movie again. You have been warned.";

Satire is easy to screw up and Jewison often perpetrates very heavyhanded pedantic films with overstated messages. The two don't mix. Too many scenes and lines of dialogue were just too hackneyed to be believed. A couple of less simmering subplots and this could have been effective. Pacino is great to watch but a bit more subtlety is really necessary to pull this stuff off.".

Albert is hard working and saves his money so that one day he will be able to eke out a better life for himself by owning his own business rather than work at the hotel. Beyond his work colleagues he is all alone in the world. One day a man named Hubert Page is hired by Mrs. Baker to paint one of the rooms in the hotel. She forces Hubert to share Albert's bed for the one night he is required to stay to complete the work much to Albert's horror. Hubert discovers the reason Albert did not want to share a room with him. But rather than the issue being a problem Hubert shows Albert that he can follow a slightly different life path than the one he envisioned for himself  one closer to the life that Hubert leads with his wife Cathleen  which includes getting married and having a wife to support him emotionally. ...";

	schema:reviewBody "At first glance Albert Nobbs could seem to be another dry and stuffy period piece that would follow in the tradition and be mostly about the acting. However once you delve into it the film ends up being a surprisingly dense character drama focused around one troubled courageous woman whose loneliness gets the better of her years of living in secrecy. The titular waiter is a delicate frail woman masquerading as a man and actress Glenn Close delves into the role with such complete detail that she truly does disappear.I'm always skeptical of performances that are claimed to be fully unrecognizable and at first I must admit that it just felt like Close playing a man but as the film continued I slowly lost sight of my cynicism and when a later scene portrays Nobbs wearing a dress for the first time I was blown away at the fact that I was seeing this woman be a real woman for the first time. I was amazed at how absorbed Close was in the role I genuinely forgot all about this woman playing a character and just believed the character's facade as well as Close's. Close has gotten attention for the role as a potential Oscar vehicle and some have lashed back against that due to the performance being quite restrained but I admire her delicacy in taking on the role. This is a woman who spent her entire life trying to blend in and be unseen and Close's ability to be this fly on the wall creature is remarkable.I was glad that there weren't any hysterics on her part and when the few scenes came where in isolation she broke down I was devastated by this woman fearing for her life to unravel. It's such a delicate and entirely human performance and as far as I'm concerned one of the best of Close's very strong career. The central narrative revolves around Nobbs' desire to woo a young maid named Helen played with an Irish tilt by the upandcoming Australian Mia Wasikowska again shining to leave their life of servitude and open up a tobacco shop together. Throughout the film I was bothered by this belief that Nobbs was supposed to be in love with Helen and that's why she wanted to open the shop with her but as the film reached it's final conclusion I came to the realization that it had nothing to do with love.Throughout her life Nobbs had put in all of her effort to having no one notice her that when she's introduced to a similar woman masquerading as a man played by the strong and unbelievably convincing Janet McTeer who has a happy life married to a woman Nobbs realizes the potential that maybe she doesn't have to live her life alone. It's not about loving Helen at all it's just about not wanting to be alone anymore and once that became apparent to me the film became quite devastating. Nobbs trapped herself in this prison and Close plays it with such restrained heartache that it truly hit a level with me. Even in writing this I am realizing that the film had a much stronger impact on me than I had previously thought. This is a devastating story of a woman trapped in circumstances of her own making portrayed with such genuine believability by Close that I forgot I was watching an actress pretend to be a man but instead just saw Nobbs.There's a line where McTeer's character asks Nobbs what her name is and she responds Albert. Then McTeer repeats the question clearly asking for her birthname instead of the one she is hiding behind and Nobbs again responds Albert. At the time I rolled my eyes at the exchange but now that the whole film has settled with me it speaks so much to this trapped wounded soul who was so lost in herself that she couldn't escape her own prison let alone the one that she had built for Nobbs. I found Albert Nobbs to be quite the moving hushed character piece led by a wrenching performance by Close and backed up by several other strong performances from McTeer Wasikowska and a grimy Aaron Johnson.".

	schema:reviewBody "Albert Nobbs is a labor of love. Glenn Close who stars in the titular role has been connected with this material for nearly 20 years playing the same role on stage in 1982. For years she tried to get the production to the big screen and after a long wait her efforts have put forth a brilliant film. Directed by Rodrigo Garcia In Treatment this film tells the story of Albert an Irish waiter at a hotel. The trouble is she has been portraying herself as a man for 30 years. She has become encased in her mindset of Albert Nobbs that she doesn't know her true self anymore. She must do whatever it takes to get by even if it means keeping her secret to the grave.She befriends a local painter Hubert Page Janet McTeer only Hubert isn't all that he says he is either. With Hubert's friendship Albert sees that what he needs is a wife. He attempts to court another maid at the hotel Helen by Mia Wasikowska only she has taken a shine to Joe Aaron Johnson the new handyman. It's sometimes painful to see the lengths that Albert goes to for Helen but Albert it so pure in his thinking and kind of heart that we want him to get the girl no matter what.What makes Albert Nobbs so special is Close's performance. Close truly fits the part. There is something in her eyes that makes you really believe that the woman in Albert is only what he keeps hidden under his clothes. All the rest is a man. Close makes us believe that Albert sees himself as a man only just a little different. We see a fragile man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants even if it means sucking up to the harsh and vulgar members of high society.The supporting cast around Close is fantastic as well. McTeer really shines as Albert's only true friend. I would look for both Close and McTeer to be in contention come this Oscar night. Wasikowska and Johnson look great for their respective parts playing them with honesty. Another accent to the cast is Brendan Gleeson as the local doctor. He adds a touch of sensibility to the entitled of the day. He likes a good stiff drink or three and finds himself comfortable in the company of those considered lower than him.Gleeson's character brings up a great quality to the film. I am astonished at how much of a commentary of 19th century life is put into the film. I would say most of the first act is setting up the world they live in and periodic references and characters enter the second and third acts to remind us of the time period this story is taking place. Albert Nobbs is in fact a reflection of what it was like to live back then. In order to make a decent living one had to be a man otherwise find someone to live off of.It's a heartbreaking story that will really hit home. Albert on the surface is a simple man but underneath lies a wealth of feeling confusion and love. The film ends with the beautiful song Lay Your Head Down with lyrics by Close herself music by Brian Byrne and sung by Sinead O'Connor. It reminded me of Into the West by Annie Lennox the Oscar winning song from Lord of the Rings Return of the King. This song from Albert is somber sweet and plays like a lullaby. I think it's safe to say that is exactly what it is a lullaby for Albert a character whose life has been so strenuous and tiresome.The more I think about it the more I love this film. Great performances great characters and a perfect time period to be placed in. The song is the icing on the cake and probably has the best shot at winning come Oscar night. It looks like Meryl Streep is all but a lock for Best Actress but we shall see what happens. Who knows maybe Albert will gain momentum coming down the homestretch. I hope it does.".

He likes a good stiff drink or three and finds himself comfortable in the company of those considered lower than him.Gleeson's character brings up a great quality to the film. I am astonished at how much of a commentary of 19th century life is put into the film. I would say most of the first act is setting up the world they live in and periodic references and characters enter the second and third acts to remind us of the time period this story is taking place. Albert Nobbs is in fact a reflection of what it was like to live back then. In order to make a decent living one had to be a man otherwise find someone to live off of.It's a heartbreaking story that will really hit home. Albert on the surface is a simple man but underneath lies a wealth of feeling confusion and love. The film ends with the beautiful song Lay Your Head Down with lyrics by Close herself music by Brian Byrne and sung by Sinead O'Connor. It reminded me of Into the West by Annie Lennox the Oscar winning song from Lord of the Rings Return of the King. This song from Albert is somber sweet and plays like a lullaby. I think it's safe to say that is exactly what it is a lullaby for Albert a character whose life has been so strenuous and tiresome.The more I think about it the more I love this film. Great performances great characters and a perfect time period to be placed in. The song is the icing on the cake and probably has the best shot at winning come Oscar night. It looks like Meryl Streep is all but a lock for Best Actress but we shall see what happens. Who knows maybe Albert will gain momentum coming down the homestretch. I hope it does.";

	schema:headline " Phenomenal performances by Glenn Close and Janet McTeer";
	schema:reviewBody "When an actor transforms he or she only lets you see the characters  they play and Glenn Close's transformation in ALBERT NOBBS is acting in  is purest form. Janet McTeer gives an equally incredible performance!  Close is a 5 time Oscar nominee and it's high time she gets her long  overdue appreciation. With a narrative that centers on unrequited love  identity and heartache ALBERT NOBBS is the most powerful emotional  drama about longing for acceptance and freedom of expression since  Brokeback Mountain   When I first saw the trailerpreview a few months back two things came  to mind the first one was that it had that Gosford Park vibe to it and  the second impression was that I couldn't believe that that was Glenn  Close who I was I watching. Close is an actress who not only surrenders  completely to her roles but she also has such strong convictions in  them you can't help but be amazed at every speech and every gesture  she makes. This transgender performance without a doubt is her best  work yet. Her costar Janet McTeer also a fellow Oscar nominee  doesn't have a problem keeping up with Close. McTeer meets the  challenge stares it right in the eye and steals the scenes any chance  she gets.  The story is heartbreaking and yet irresistible and wonderful very  wellwritten and welldirected. It's like an enchanting tale that  grounded a period piece with a relevant and timeless issue and it  speaks about society. All of the characters in this film contribute to  Albert Nobbs' story arc. I think you'll find Mia Wasikowska's and Aaron  Johnson's characters very interesting because their type of  relationship is no stranger to all of us. Mia plays a maid who's needy  and insecure and then comes along Johnson's character who sweeps her  off her feet only to eventually use her to his advantage. At times the  film moves gently and other times there's a tug of war going on that  heightens the conflict.  Albert Nobbs is both a tragic and inspiring character she's spent so  many years being what she's not she doesn't know how to be who she is  anymore. She has a dream but she can't find anyone who'd share that  dream with her even Mr. Page McTeer the one person who accepts her  the person whose life Nobbs desperately wants to live up to wouldn't  take the chance and so that forces her to go back to chasing a fool of  a woman who's head over heels for a drunkard. It's a story that offers  rude awakening as a way to get everyone around Nobbs to finally learn  their lesson for us the audience to be a bit more sympathetic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Glenn Close's portrayal of the title character was excellent! She was at her best in this picture. Perhaps the reason why other people who saw the movie felt that the movie is draggy and her portrayal is soso was because there wasn't any hysteria in it. There wasn't any grandstanding scene. There wasn't a shouting match. No loud confrontations. No slapping and hairpulling scenes. It's a quiet movie so unlike of Close's other known portrayals. But one can't simply ignore the greatness she has shown in her eyes. You can feel the sadness the pain the fears and the hope in her eyes. It was a quiet restrained performance that is quite haunting that stays in your mind even after watching it. And that's what happened to me. Hours after watching it the scenes and her story still lingers in my mind. Everyone in the movie gave worthy performances.... Mia Wasikowska Aaron Johnson Pauline Collins Brendan Gleeson Jonathan Rhys Myers even though he was in 34 scenes only and most especially Janet McTeer. McTeer's characterization was superb. Her body built helped a lot in her portrayal of Hubert Page. But i don't believe that she upstaged Close's here. Her character was quite different from the character that Glenn Close was portraying. And both did quite well in giving justice to the roles they played in the movie. The beach scene was excellent... quiet yet conveys so much feelings... How i wish that those who've seen the movie and saw it differently will watch it again and see the story from Albert Nobbs' point of view. See the expressions in 'his' eyes and feel the tragedy of the life 'he' has gone through. Glenn Close really deserves to win the Oscar's Best Actress plum with this movie.".

	schema:headline " Haunting bittersweet gender swap period piece proves illuminating";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen director Rodrigo Garcia's excellent 'Woman and Child' at last year's Spirit Award screenings I was surprised to see him tackling a period piece 'Albert Nobbs' which is based on a 1927 novella by the Irish novelist George Moore and later turned into a stage production in 1982 starring Glenn Close who now again tackles the title role this time playing the part decidedly as a middleaged character. Garcia is one of today's leading directors as he has a reputation for being sensitive to the needs of women and extremely competent in directing them.'Albert Nobbs' is set in the late nineteenth century in Dublin and focuses on Glenn Close as Albert a woman who works as a servant at the Morrison Hotel and who's been pretending to be a man since the age of 14. When Mrs. Baker the pretentious proprietress of the hotel brilliantly played by Pauline Collins known for her role in the famed TV series 'Upstairs Downstairs' orders Albert to put up house painter Hubert Page played by a fantastic Janet McTeer for the night in her room Albert can no longer hide her disguise when she's compelled to strip off her corset due to an infestation of fleas inside her clothes. It looks like Page is going to end up blackmailing Albert but in a great plot twist she reveals that she's a woman too by revealing her pendulous breasts.Albert who is extremely reserved is shocked at Page's revelation but nonetheless is impressed how Page conducts herself as a man. While Albert is deathly afraid of being found out Page is selfassured and cocky. She even is legally married to a woman and they have a loving relationship Albert seeks to learn if they're on intimate terms but Page refuses to tell.Albert dreams of opening up a tobacco shop and has been hoarding her money underneath a floorboard in her room. With Hubert as a model Albert becomes a infatuated with Helen a very pretty young servant girl. While Mia Wasikowska practically sleepwalked through her recent role as 'Jane Eyre' here director Garcia turns her into a powerhouse of vacillating feelings and emotions. Soon Mrs. Baker hires the young 'bad boy' boiler repairman Joe and Helen falls for him hook line and sinker.There are actually two antagonists in 'Albert Nobbs'. First is the Victorian society itself that forces women such as Albert and Hubert to deny their true selves in order to survive. It was all about economics as women were paid very little or weren't allowed to work at all. Often they were brutalized by alcoholic husbands and some or should I say a few chose to run away and hide their identities acting as men. The epitome of those men who put women in such a position is the ne'erdowell Joe who can't control his anger and refuses to accept the idea that he has a responsibility to act as a caring father.While 'Nobbs' is often sad director Garcia wisely inserts some humorous scenes to balance the tragedy. There's a great scene where Albert and Hubert take a stroll on the beach dressed as women. Ever so briefly Albert actually gets to experience feelings of joy as she runs down the shore for the first in women's clothes. They seem to revel in their awkwardness but Albert soon trips and falls. The joy is shortlived and we immediately cut back to the hotel where Albert must reassume his role as the stiffnecked servant.Tragedy is unavoidable when a typhoid epidemic claims the life of Hubert's wife Kathleen. And Joe in his anger knocks Albert against a wall after the two tussle for Helen's affection. The blow against the wall is the coup de grace as Albert does not survive.Garcia also depicts the brutal class differences in the late nineteenth century. The guests at the hotel are for the most part quite arrogant and treat the servants as inferiors. Not everybody back then was unkind though. Dr. Holloran orders Mrs. Baker not to throw Helen out on the streets after she becomes pregnant.'Albert Nobbs' ends on a bittersweet note. Dr. Holloran bemoans Albert's fate when he discovers that she's a woman on her deathbed. But Hubert plays the role of the redeeming angel. He learns from Helen that soon child welfare officials will come for the baby and Mrs. Baker will indeed throw her out on the streets. But Hubert assures her that it won't happenthat soon she will take Helen as a wife and protect her and the baby from any harm.There has been some criticism that the Albert character is underdeveloped and needs more of a back story. One critic writes Nobbs is so emotionally stunted by the very act of living as to almost cease to exist. There may be some truth in that opinion but by the same token we do learn about Albert's childhood and how she came to adopt her role as a man. You can probably appreciate Albert's character more if you place it in contrast to Hubert. They should be looked as a team reminiscent of 'Laurel and Hardy' sans the comedy. Albert's demeanor is both dour and precise he's a bit of a Chaplinesque character and although her pursuit of Helen is nave it's quite heartfelt. Hubert is always comfortable in her own skin and is much more confident than Albert. In a sense Albert lives on in Hubert who must be seen as a great 'protector' of all women.'Albert Nobbs' is a very impressive film with a topnotch cast. Close and McTeer work wonders in difficult roles and are supported by equally impressive supporting players. The cinematography evokes the bygone era of turnofthecentury Dublin with director Garcia most ably conveying what it was like living in such a repressed atmosphere. Maybe that's why James Joyce eventually left Dublin and never came back.".

However when the situation is reversed and the film concerns women dressing up as men the movie is habitually a drama bordering on tragedy Yentl 1983 Boys Don't Cry 1999 and Osama 2003. Perhaps men trying to pass themselves off as women are just funnier and more outlandish but the reasons behind it are usually not as urgent. In Albert Nobbs Albert Glenn Close is the head waiter at an upscale hotel in 19th century Ireland. He appears to be middleaged and has been passing himself off as a man since heshe was 14. His livelihood and future in the midst of immense unemployment and desperate surroundings depend on maintaining this deception.I use the pronouns 'he' and 'his' because nothing about Albert is female except for the some well hidden physiology. Albert is extremely adept at passing as a man. When he speaks at all his voice is low. His hair is short he is impeccably dressed his manners are irreproachable and he does nothing whatsoever to call any attention to himself. As any manservant should be he is invisible. Working in the hospitality industry is just a means to end for Albert though. He lives such a spartan lifestyle because he hoards his money underneath his floorboard to one day soon purchase a shop and become a respected tobacconist. He is close he has identified the vacant shop has planned its layout and can almost feel the escape which will come when he is his own boss.Albert knows something is missing in his grand scheme though he is lonely. In the beginning he does not recognize he is missing anything important until he is forced to share his room one night with a man Mr. Hubert Page Janet McTeer. Through a contrived sequence Albert is revealed as a female to Mr. Page and only later on learns Mr. Page is also a woman. Using what look like camera tricks and perspective shots Mr. Page is a towering and bulky workman. He is also married to a woman. This bit of news tremendously confuses poor Albert. How is it possible for two women to be married to one another? It is obvious that Mr. Page and his wife are in a lesbian relationship however Albert would not even know what that word means. Albert comes across as asexual. There has never been a chance in his life to conceive of intimacy so all feelings and aspects of that persona just atrophied away.Now that Albert's eyes are opened to the fact that there are women out in the world who are married to each other he sets his eyes on the lowly but young and desirable chambermaid Helen Mia Wasikowska. Helen knows just how pretty she is and becomes smitten by the newly employed handyman Joe Aaron Johnson. Not only is Albert stunted in the intimacy realm of life but his social skills are also not as fine tuned as the younger set who now aware of Albert's infatuation with Helen may try to use those feelings for their financial gain.While the story of Albert Nobbs is on the weaker side and not particularly engaging the acting specifically by Close and McTeer is fascinating. There is a scene where Albert and Mr. Page try on some dresses and take a walk outside. For Albert this is the first time he has worn a dress in probably 30 years. The immediate discomfort but growing acceptance and then utter joy on his face is a wonderful scene as he experiences some long repressed feelings while ecstatically running on the beach. McTeer's performance is equal to Close's in every way. Shehe looks 100 like a man dressed up as a woman when he puts on that dress. The makeup department for this film is spot on much better than J. Edgar and The Iron Lady. Even though they did not have to age the characters as those aforementioned films did transforming two women into men so effectively as they do is worth the price of admission alone.Director Rodrigo Garcia who happens to be the son of novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez is becoming known as the goto filmmaker for involved and complex stories about women. He also directed Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her 2000 Nine Lives 2005 and Mother and Child 2010 all recognized as thoughtful films with strong female leads. Glenn Close cowrote the screenplay and brought with her a long experience of understanding Albert since she played him in the 1982 stage production.I recommend Albert Nobbs to enjoy the performances and to witness the forceful presences of Glenn Close and Janet McTeer and their convincing portrayals of the opposite sex. The story is not as compelling as one would wish for a period piece such as this but it is nevertheless overshadowed by the acting.".

Even though they did not have to age the characters as those aforementioned films did transforming two women into men so effectively as they do is worth the price of admission alone.Director Rodrigo Garcia who happens to be the son of novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez is becoming known as the goto filmmaker for involved and complex stories about women. He also directed Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her 2000 Nine Lives 2005 and Mother and Child 2010 all recognized as thoughtful films with strong female leads. Glenn Close cowrote the screenplay and brought with her a long experience of understanding Albert since she played him in the 1982 stage production.I recommend Albert Nobbs to enjoy the performances and to witness the forceful presences of Glenn Close and Janet McTeer and their convincing portrayals of the opposite sex. The story is not as compelling as one would wish for a period piece such as this but it is nevertheless overshadowed by the acting.";

	schema:reviewBody "The three movies that I've seen that Rodrigo Garca son of Colombian author Gabriel Garca Mrquez directed deal with women's relationships Things You Can Tell Just By Looking at Her Mother and Child and now Albert Nobbs. In the latter Glenn Close plays a woman posing as a man in 19th century Dublin and working as a butler in a posh hotel. When the hotel owner hires a painter named Hubert Page Janet McTeer Albert soon finds out Hubert's secret. From there relationships with other staff members proliferate.The movie brings up several issues. Aside from Ireland's status as a British colony in the 19th century there's the social hierarchy in the hotel and the forbidden relationships. Albert's posing as a man is partially because of some haunting experiences but also because women didn't have as many opportunities open to them back then. As a result of his hiding in this male persona Albert has been hiding from himself one might say.All in all I thought that this is a very well done movie. Close looks eerily gaunt in the role easily passing as a man while Mia Wasikowska playing a maid has the perfection balance of strength and fragility. I recommend the movie. Also starring Aaron Johnson John Lennon in Nowhere Boy Pauline Collins Brendan Gleeson Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maria Doyle Kennedy.".

Janet McTeer is a bit more hammy as Hubert Page another woman living life as a man and she's not as convincing as Close is as a man but she still has her moments like the way she walks all manly on the beach even when wearing a dress. Mia Wasikowska also gives a supporting actress nomination worthy role as sort of what Ccile was to Liaisons. I really hated the ending of this film and would have preferred something a little less Remains of the Day and a little more uplifting and hopeful so as a film I don't think it is best picture material but Glenn Close certainly deserves her long overdue Oscar for this stunning performance.I do have to wonder how this got an R rating though. There is nothing R rated in it whatsoever the only nudity involves two very quick flashes of breasts only to establish that the characters are actually female and other than that there is no foul language or violence or anything. The MPPA should reconsider what I believe to be a biased rating that it came up with based only on the fact that the film hints at lesbianism.".

	schema:headline " McTeer sizzles while Close fizzles in this lavishly boring period piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Going into Albert Nobbs at the Toronto International Film Festival I think my anticipation for Glenn Close's performance was high. There was a lot of early Oscar buzz going for the film and it was the key reason I ventured into the packed final screening of the film. And now almost two weeks later I still feel a lot of regret for giving into the hype.Albert Nobbs Close leads a simple life as a butler at a fancy hotel in turn of the century Dublin. But he is hiding a secret he is actually a she staying lowkey while she raises enough money to start a tobacco shop. With the appearance of Hubert Page Janet McTeer a painter who hides a similar secret Nobbs realizes she needs to come out of her shell a bit more and start planning her future. I desperately wanted to adore Albert Nobbs but after the initial playlike introduction to all of the main players in one scene no less I found myself horrifically bored from start to finish. Remember the stuffy British period pieces you loathe the very existence of and were hoping were completely extinct? I am sorry to report they are alive and well. The film moves at a snail's pace going through Nobb's attempt at prepping to move on and stop hiding. It goes through a few incredibly odd subplots one namely involving a pretty house maid named Helen Mia Wasikowska but feels badly cobbled together. It is based on a critically acclaimed play that Close had previously starred in and feels like it is stuck within the confines of that pace and structure. I realize they wanted to stay true to the original source material but I am confident in saying that we have seen enough films based on musicals and plays to know that it is not hard to think outside the box and make something a bit different and more inclined to the medium. For all the early Oscar talk it disappoints me to say that Close's performance is good but nothing truly extraordinary. She is incredibly convincing as the titular character looking nearly unrecognizable for a good portion of the film. She plays Nobbs as a timid introvert who has an underlying fear that plagues her every move. She does want her true identity to be revealed and must constantly downplay everything. It may seem like an incredibly layered role but outside of some atypical glances there is really nothing special about Close. Her character wants to hide in plain sight and not do anything to draw attention to herself. But this affects Close's performance immensely because it never gives her the opportunity to make something of this character. Mere glances and passing references to something truly brilliant are apparent but I found myself really struggling to care about the character. Much like the film paying attention to Nobbs bordered on excruciatingly boring.McTeer as Page however the other woman playing a man in this grand play is the exact opposite. I had heard very little about her before the film but found myself unable to look away when she entered the frame. She has a sassy wit about her and truly enlivens the characters and every secondrate line that comes out of her mouth. She is the catalyst for change in Nobb's life but she too is doing her best not to draw attention to herself. Yet somehow she does not slog through the performance like Close does. She truly makes something of the character and carves out something interesting and fun to watch develop. It is not surprising at all surprising to find that she provides the most emotional scenes in the movie b both downright hilarious and incredibly sad. I just wish there was more focus on her character as she only appears in a handful of scenes. Fortunately they are the best scenes in the entire film but they come way too far and few between.Wasikowska and Aaron Johnson are the only other two actors who do not spend their screen time eliciting minor laughs from the crowd although Pauline Collins is an underplayed delight as Mrs. Baker the head of the hotel where most of the action takes place. While they have both given significantly better performances in other films they both deliver some fairly solid work here. They have to chisel through some absolutely obnoxious and dull character motivations and actions but they still shine through in most cases. I appreciated their work here more than I actually enjoyed it but I think it could have been improved if they were not stuck working within the confines of the script. Story and acting issues aside the art direction is simply marvelous. The look of Dublin is so rich and vivid that you can practically smell the putrid stench coming off of these streets. A lot of care was put into making these sets and costumes look as detailed as physically possible and it shows in how great they look. I sat in awe in more than one occasion ignoring the inane dialogue and just taking in the scenery.While I think the laughs that made The King's Speech such a crowdpleasing delight last year may have had a bit of an influence on at least a portion of Albert Nobbs I really wish they took more of a directional cue from the Best Picture winner. As it is Nobbs is the kind of stuffy pretentious period piece that most filmgoers love to hate. It is incredibly boring with a lot of useless side performances and only a few good performances that still manage to be dull. The only real saving grace here is a wildly enjoyable supporting turn from McTeer who will surely not see that enthusiasm go to waste when the awards time arrives. Maybe I should not have expected so much.610.".

	onyx:emotionText "Going into Albert Nobbs at the Toronto International Film Festival I think my anticipation for Glenn Close's performance was high. There was a lot of early Oscar buzz going for the film and it was the key reason I ventured into the packed final screening of the film. And now almost two weeks later I still feel a lot of regret for giving into the hype.Albert Nobbs Close leads a simple life as a butler at a fancy hotel in turn of the century Dublin. But he is hiding a secret he is actually a she staying lowkey while she raises enough money to start a tobacco shop. With the appearance of Hubert Page Janet McTeer a painter who hides a similar secret Nobbs realizes she needs to come out of her shell a bit more and start planning her future. I desperately wanted to adore Albert Nobbs but after the initial playlike introduction to all of the main players in one scene no less I found myself horrifically bored from start to finish. Remember the stuffy British period pieces you loathe the very existence of and were hoping were completely extinct? I am sorry to report they are alive and well. The film moves at a snail's pace going through Nobb's attempt at prepping to move on and stop hiding. It goes through a few incredibly odd subplots one namely involving a pretty house maid named Helen Mia Wasikowska but feels badly cobbled together. It is based on a critically acclaimed play that Close had previously starred in and feels like it is stuck within the confines of that pace and structure. I realize they wanted to stay true to the original source material but I am confident in saying that we have seen enough films based on musicals and plays to know that it is not hard to think outside the box and make something a bit different and more inclined to the medium. For all the early Oscar talk it disappoints me to say that Close's performance is good but nothing truly extraordinary. She is incredibly convincing as the titular character looking nearly unrecognizable for a good portion of the film. She plays Nobbs as a timid introvert who has an underlying fear that plagues her every move. She does want her true identity to be revealed and must constantly downplay everything. It may seem like an incredibly layered role but outside of some atypical glances there is really nothing special about Close. Her character wants to hide in plain sight and not do anything to draw attention to herself. But this affects Close's performance immensely because it never gives her the opportunity to make something of this character. Mere glances and passing references to something truly brilliant are apparent but I found myself really struggling to care about the character. Much like the film paying attention to Nobbs bordered on excruciatingly boring.McTeer as Page however the other woman playing a man in this grand play is the exact opposite. I had heard very little about her before the film but found myself unable to look away when she entered the frame. She has a sassy wit about her and truly enlivens the characters and every secondrate line that comes out of her mouth. She is the catalyst for change in Nobb's life but she too is doing her best not to draw attention to herself. Yet somehow she does not slog through the performance like Close does. She truly makes something of the character and carves out something interesting and fun to watch develop. It is not surprising at all surprising to find that she provides the most emotional scenes in the movie b both downright hilarious and incredibly sad. I just wish there was more focus on her character as she only appears in a handful of scenes. Fortunately they are the best scenes in the entire film but they come way too far and few between.Wasikowska and Aaron Johnson are the only other two actors who do not spend their screen time eliciting minor laughs from the crowd although Pauline Collins is an underplayed delight as Mrs. Baker the head of the hotel where most of the action takes place. While they have both given significantly better performances in other films they both deliver some fairly solid work here. They have to chisel through some absolutely obnoxious and dull character motivations and actions but they still shine through in most cases. I appreciated their work here more than I actually enjoyed it but I think it could have been improved if they were not stuck working within the confines of the script. Story and acting issues aside the art direction is simply marvelous. The look of Dublin is so rich and vivid that you can practically smell the putrid stench coming off of these streets. A lot of care was put into making these sets and costumes look as detailed as physically possible and it shows in how great they look. I sat in awe in more than one occasion ignoring the inane dialogue and just taking in the scenery.While I think the laughs that made The King's Speech such a crowdpleasing delight last year may have had a bit of an influence on at least a portion of Albert Nobbs I really wish they took more of a directional cue from the Best Picture winner. As it is Nobbs is the kind of stuffy pretentious period piece that most filmgoers love to hate. It is incredibly boring with a lot of useless side performances and only a few good performances that still manage to be dull. The only real saving grace here is a wildly enjoyable supporting turn from McTeer who will surely not see that enthusiasm go to waste when the awards time arrives. Maybe I should not have expected so much.610.";

	schema:reviewBody "This review gives away the ending which partly illustrates the movie's problem.Glenn Close plays a woman who has lived for thirty years as a man the head steward at an upmarket Dublin hotel at the turn of the century when you could lose your pathetic job for having a stain on your tie. In that climate having to disguise your gender is the least of your worries.Albert Nobbs was abandoned as a child then later gangraped. This seems to support the characterisation of Albert as a severely introverted individual terrified or unable to express any sort of feeling as she salts away her tip money under the floorboards in her room at the top of the stairs. Albert's dream is to buy a small shop and as her target of 600 slowly gets nearer she begins to fantasise about having a partner to share her new life with.There are two candidates Helen Mia Wasikowska the cute but flighty parlourmaid and Hubert Page Janet McTeer a jobbing painter who reveals herself thanks Janet! to Albert as a fellow? transvestite. Hubert however is comfortable in her sexuality and has a partner Mary Maria Doyle Kennedy an excellent portrayal. Hubert and Mary's life is exactly what Albert wants a small cottage business and a mantlepiece with a pretty clock on it.The UpstairsDownstairsDownton Abbey staging of the story is great and you also begin by feeling a little admiration for Albert who manages to both completely repress her misery and be extremely good at her job. Where her life  and the film  starts to unravel is when Albert is forced by the hotel proprietor Pauline Collins giving it the full TV soap star treatment to share her bed with Hubert when heshe has to stop overnight. When Hubert sees that Albert has breasts Albert goes to pieces begging Hubert not to give her away and this doesn't ring true because the jump from severely repressed to gibbering wreck is simply instantaneous. Thirty years of selfcontrol broken down by a flea in your corset? For whatever reason the feeling of a terrible secret about to be uncovered is not there  maybe it's because we already know Glenn Close isn't a man. There's not enough buildup or maybe it's because Albert's grovelsome job is so boring we feel she'd be better off  or more interesting  out of it.In a subplot which mistakenly becomes the main plot Helen the maid gets pregnant by Joe Aaron Johnson the dishy 'young man about the hotel' who finesses his way into the job by luckily sorting out the plumbing. As he turns out to be a boozing rotter he persuades Helen to 'walk out' with Albert in the hopes of getting expensive treats before he and Helen leave for America.But by this time in the movie Albert has completely stopped being interesting. What does the character want? Not to be lonely? This isn't shown well enough Albert continues to go about her job as normal and the story digresses into vignettes of all the other characters whose stories are actually a lot easier to empathise with.When Hubert's partner Mary dies in a typhoid outbreak Albert misguidedly proposes to move in with Hubert and live the dream. This shows that Albert has no understanding of a loving relationship only a longing for one. Hubert is kind and sympathetic and she and Albert wear a couple of Mary's handmade dresses to the beach for the day but a relationship is out of the question throwing Albert back on the twotiming Helen. SPOILER Fastforward to the ending. Albert attempts to remonstrate with Joe when he starts beating Helen. He pushes her away and when she then jumps on his back Albert is thrown hard against a wall obviously concussed. Albert conveniently fails to lock her bedroom door goes to bed and.... dies. Pauline Collins going through Albert's meagre belongings finds her account book in a scene worthy of a a bad pantomime. To wrap up  she uses the money to pay Hubert to redecorate the hotel and in the last scene Hubert looks like she's going to take Helen and her baby under her wing. The question of when she tells Helen she's not a man is the same one that kept nagging at Albert when he first met the lesbian couple.And that's the problem with the movie it's an axiom of mainstream storywriting that the story is about the character who makes the greatest sacrifice. Hubert loses the partner who 'was her world' redeems the cute misguided character and unknowingly benefits from Albert's death. Albert doesn't sacrifice anything or redeem anyone she just fails fails again and dies in a sad way. For Albert we feel sympathy but for Hubert we feel much much more. Albert is a supporting character in Hubert's movie and for most of the movie Hubert is absent. It's as though 'Casablanca' had been called 'Sam the Pianist'.The film is very good to look at and Close is very convincing accent drift notwithstanding but the screenplay falls into an elephant trap.".

For the most part they did not but bits and pieces of several reviews made me realize what about it bothered me so much. And that was notwithstanding the fine acting job by Glenn Close and the others the character of Albert Nobbs was not believable for several reasons. Perhaps the top reason is how stupid he was. I cannot give specific examples but just in general he was not only passive and impassive but just downright slow. I also found his little outburst when the character J. McTeer played was in his room also unbelievable and only believable if I blamed his stupidity. How could he not know to keep his voice down and not shriek and carry on freely as he did? And with regard to his interaction with Mia W.'s character I mean come on. Did he really think this pretty and flighty young woman would actually fall for him?At first I thought it was just his being pathetic that made me turn it off before the end. Now I realize that his being intellectually limited was inseparable from how pathetic he appeared.This combined with as another reviewer said his not really looking like a man being so slight with narrow waist and shoulders made it all really hard to swallow.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lovely sets and costumes and yes Glenn Close is very good at appearing to be nearly lifeless although to me it's more of an annoyance than a performance. And yes the abuses and humiliations visited upon Victorian servants are made clear 'Downton Abbey'is heaven by comparison. But face it this is one of those movies whose scriptwriters want to teach us about suffering and ennoble us by causing us to care. One way you can tell is by anachronistic scriptwriting as when Nobbs's painter friend who turns out to be a lesbian disguised as a man says You don't have to be anything but what you are. Oh please. That is utterly out of time. There are other problems. Nobbs wants to marry but is somehow totally unaware of the fact that an overwhelming majority of people want there to be two sexes involved in their marriages. Nobbs is at least 30 has she not eyes to see and ears to hear? Not noticed that ALL of the couples dining staying and fooling around at the hotel are twosex couples? That the painter and her wife are the only lesbian couple she's ever run into? He twice spends time pondering the weighty but ludicrous question Do I tell her that I'm a woman before the wedding or after? And even though he seems to realize that that could be something of a surprise if not shock to the intended bride and although aware that her painter pal could help out here she manages aided by the script's heavy hand not to ask despite numerous opportunities. How does Albert decided to marry anyway? It seems to be mainly because someone told him to and even fingered a convenient bride. It's not even clear that Nobbs knows the difference between a lesbian relationship and what used to be called a 'Boston marriage' which involved 2 women living as friends not lovers. Nor is it clear that Albert wants one or the other.

	onyx:emotionText "Lovely sets and costumes and yes Glenn Close is very good at appearing to be nearly lifeless although to me it's more of an annoyance than a performance. And yes the abuses and humiliations visited upon Victorian servants are made clear 'Downton Abbey'is heaven by comparison. But face it this is one of those movies whose scriptwriters want to teach us about suffering and ennoble us by causing us to care. One way you can tell is by anachronistic scriptwriting as when Nobbs's painter friend who turns out to be a lesbian disguised as a man says You don't have to be anything but what you are. Oh please. That is utterly out of time. There are other problems. Nobbs wants to marry but is somehow totally unaware of the fact that an overwhelming majority of people want there to be two sexes involved in their marriages. Nobbs is at least 30 has she not eyes to see and ears to hear? Not noticed that ALL of the couples dining staying and fooling around at the hotel are twosex couples? That the painter and her wife are the only lesbian couple she's ever run into? He twice spends time pondering the weighty but ludicrous question Do I tell her that I'm a woman before the wedding or after? And even though he seems to realize that that could be something of a surprise if not shock to the intended bride and although aware that her painter pal could help out here she manages aided by the script's heavy hand not to ask despite numerous opportunities. How does Albert decided to marry anyway? It seems to be mainly because someone told him to and even fingered a convenient bride. It's not even clear that Nobbs knows the difference between a lesbian relationship and what used to be called a 'Boston marriage' which involved 2 women living as friends not lovers. Nor is it clear that Albert wants one or the other. My favorite scene comes when the painter following up on his 'be who you are' baloney clads himself and Albert in his wife's dresses she has a little tooconveniently died just out of the blue and the two of the go for a walk on the beach.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Albert Nobbs";
	schema:reviewBody "Oscar buzz means Albert Nobbs gets a closer look with its leading lady Glenn Close in the title role and Janet McTeer getting herself nominated for a supporting actress award as well. And interesting enough both play gender bender roles in a film set in the posh hotel in period Ireland with an introduction that starkly laid out the social class divide of the time and the norms and expectations that exist between the haves and the have nots. Directed by Rodrigo Garcia whose last film was Mother and Child Albert Nobbs boasts a stellar cast including the likes of Mia Wasikowska Aaron Johnson and even Jonathan Rhys Meyers in a very bit role of an aristocrat and it is their fine performance all round that lifted the narrative that is steeped on the notion of secrets.This film will definitely appeal to the niche LGBT crowd given the subject matter where Albert Nobbs is Albert only to allow a woman brutally violated in the past to come out into society and earn an independent living all by herself. She cannot be who she is and has to be someone whom she is not but even then comes struggles of finding attractiveness in someone of the same gender that of a fellow colleague cum chambermaid Helen Mia Wasikowska whose flirty nature finds the attention not of a rich man to whisk her off her feet and into a palace of riches but by Aaron Johnson's Joe the handyman who knocks her up and complicates her employment status in the later act.The narrative by Istvan Szabo's story is based upon George Moore's short story and adapted into a screenplay with Glenn Close's involvement and is a story that's deeply weaved around the different relationships amongst the characters. There's the friendship forged between Albert and McTeer's painter character Hubert Page who got engaged by the hotel for a job and had to put up together with Albert in his room and for deeply buried secrets to be revealed one which in a way inspires Albert to be less inhibited when inadvertently seeking out someone with whom he can possibly spend the rest of his life with given his inching toward his goal to become a shopkeeper.Which brings us to the core love triangle of the story involving Albert's love for Helen who in turn is in a relationship with the roguish Joe. This provides some form of a contrast between the usual heterosexual romance between Joe and Helen and that of the same sex one between Albert and Helen though I would have thought the latter came across more like a sisterly bond being created especially since beneath Helen's tough happy go lucky exterior comes a certain vulnerability that can be exploited. Albert being Albert for so long assumes the very protective role of a guardian of sorts and with Helen we see shades of inhibitions being stripped away as he discovers some inner happiness which had eluded him for some time.Glenn Close may be getting a lot of accolades for her performance and it's true she disappears into her role straddling between that of a woman and a man whom she spends a lot more time under the guise complete with deep voice but I thought this naturalness was somewhat a given since Close had been playing this role on stage years before. Mia Wasikowska continues in her hot streak playing diverse roles in her career so far although I felt this one was probably the least challenging of the lot. But the one who stole the show was Janet McTeer's gruff portrayal of Hubert stealing the show from under everyone's nose even with her limited screen time and will probably put up quite the fight come awards season.Besides fine acting Albert Nobbs also has excellent production values that every self respecting period film will focus on having in order to recreate and bring to life the littlest of details to transport any audience back to the late 19th century. You may have to suspend disbelief if you suppose the two ladies in men's disguise should have easily been found out but like how the characters keep things under wraps it's exploration of various relationships that is the film's kept under very poignant drama.".

But as the film progresses you can't help but notice the same selfsacrificing and caring nature they both share  although Bardock's was kinda buried. They are both willing to die for the people and planet that they love. And Vegeta! Well he was beautiful. Very true to character  arrogant and proud. I'd like to take a moment here and point out how sorry I feel for Vegeta named after his father and his planet!. As was Frieza.  I couldn't help but find myself despising that coldhearted lizard all over again  and I must admit I had a great laugh when he was defeated by Goku on Namek albeit temporarily and permanently by Trunks on Earth.

But those that think MMBT sucks because it is not as exciting as The Road Warrior would be missing the point.  What makes MMBT a worthy sequel is its way of establishing a greater scope of the setting the series takes place in.  The dredges of civilization were what set the stage for the series in the original Mad Max.  The barren world of desert wastelands and sparse outposts take the idea of a postapocalyptic world one step further in The Road Warrior.  A squalid setting such as Bartertown and an oasis where the tribe of children lived in MMBT once again builds on the elaborate fantasy that makes the series as popular as it is.  The final chilling realization of just what became of civilization in the closing moments of the movie are more than enough explanation as to why the the world the viewer sees in the trilogy is the way it is.I was too young when I first saw MMBT to understand this.

The actors' performances are perfectly adequate for the action and the chase scenes bear all the hallmarks of Miller's craftsmanship which contemporary directors should seriously consider studying and revitalizing.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS The third movie in the trilogy Mad Max franchise and the weakest Mad Max film I ever saw. This movie is stupid! I never understood why this movie is so bad. Even the first Mad Max is better than Beyond Thunderdome. Why such a praise for this film? The only good thing in this film is Mel Gibson and Tina Turner and her songs but that's it. The rest of the film everything sucks so bad in here and it is rated PG13 and everything in this film is just wrong. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is awesome and the best of the trilogy this film just isn't. But it is a real let down and a true disappointment for a fan like me. Max without his car V8 is nothing but a peace of low life.I know a lot of people love this film and I respect that some people even think this is better then the original Mad Max Really? What is so good about this movie? Huh. This movie is boring less violent it is PG13 movie and Mel Gibson is at worst at his performance. This movie was a failure to me.Every time I watch it I just feel miserable oh and Mad Max the original film is way better flick then this one it really is.I apologize to all fans but in my opinion not yours this movie is the weakest one in the Mad Max franchise and if they would focus more on Bardertown and Thunderdome and got rid of the kids and make this movie rated R this could have been a great movie but right now in my opinion its a bad movie .This movie felt too rushed and it felt it just wasn't right.And also why this film is in the sand why the are no roads here? Why this is not a wasteland? Gosh I hate this film sue me! I also reviewed 2 years ago the first three Mad Max films and I didn't want to disrespect Mad Max franchise and I didn't want to get the hate on here.Mostly it was George Miller's fault when his friend and Producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash. He didn't care he made it less violent less apocalyptic and less action I really don't understand why people love this movie but the first one they don't? I don't know.We never found out more about Max or his fate the movie does not tell us anything.Shame on you George this movie destroyed the Mad Max trilogy I am glad that Mad Max Fury Road come out 20 years later and yes it is MILES way better action film then this one and I have reviewed all of them.Also I like Mel Gibson as a actor I always did I never said I hate him he is a really good actor and the Mad Max Trilogy alongside with Lethal Weapon franchise those movies made him in to a star that he is today so yea.Sadly the film is failure to me just my opinion.Tina Turner wasn't that terrible because she made two songs for this film and she performed her self. Songs One of the Living and We Don't Need Another Hero a great songs and I love to listening them. Tina Turner also at acting isn't that terrible. But this film is horrendous awful and it sucks I hate those kids. This Mad Max has no weapons by him self he has no car and Max doesn't kill anybody in this film.It feels to me like this Max is a pussy and he is afraid to kill people. I also have this movie on Bluray disc in my collection even tough is a boring stupid awful time waster I still have it in my video collection. I don't like this film I don't. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is my number 1 action film in this franchise which is the best one second best one to me is Mad Max Fury Road I love those two films to death they are great films. Mad Max the first one is a good action film but it has problems but is at least better action film then Thunderdome that is my opinion. 210".

The rest of the film everything sucks so bad in here and it is rated PG13 and everything in this film is just wrong. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is awesome and the best of the trilogy this film just isn't. But it is a real let down and a true disappointment for a fan like me. Max without his car V8 is nothing but a peace of low life.I know a lot of people love this film and I respect that some people even think this is better then the original Mad Max Really? What is so good about this movie? Huh. This movie is boring less violent it is PG13 movie and Mel Gibson is at worst at his performance. This movie was a failure to me.Every time I watch it I just feel miserable oh and Mad Max the original film is way better flick then this one it really is.I apologize to all fans but in my opinion not yours this movie is the weakest one in the Mad Max franchise and if they would focus more on Bardertown and Thunderdome and got rid of the kids and make this movie rated R this could have been a great movie but right now in my opinion its a bad movie .This movie felt too rushed and it felt it just wasn't right.And also why this film is in the sand why the are no roads here? Why this is not a wasteland? Gosh I hate this film sue me! I also reviewed 2 years ago the first three Mad Max films and I didn't want to disrespect Mad Max franchise and I didn't want to get the hate on here.Mostly it was George Miller's fault when his friend and Producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash. He didn't care he made it less violent less apocalyptic and less action I really don't understand why people love this movie but the first one they don't? I don't know.We never found out more about Max or his fate the movie does not tell us anything.Shame on you George this movie destroyed the Mad Max trilogy I am glad that Mad Max Fury Road come out 20 years later and yes it is MILES way better action film then this one and I have reviewed all of them.Also I like Mel Gibson as a actor I always did I never said I hate him he is a really good actor and the Mad Max Trilogy alongside with Lethal Weapon franchise those movies made him in to a star that he is today so yea.Sadly the film is failure to me just my opinion.Tina Turner wasn't that terrible because she made two songs for this film and she performed her self. Songs One of the Living and We Don't Need Another Hero a great songs and I love to listening them. Tina Turner also at acting isn't that terrible. But this film is horrendous awful and it sucks I hate those kids. This Mad Max has no weapons by him self he has no car and Max doesn't kill anybody in this film.It feels to me like this Max is a pussy and he is afraid to kill people. I also have this movie on Bluray disc in my collection even tough is a boring stupid awful time waster I still have it in my video collection. I don't like this film I don't. Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior is my number 1 action film in this franchise which is the best one second best one to me is Mad Max Fury Road I love those two films to death they are great films. Mad Max the first one is a good action film but it has problems but is at least better action film then Thunderdome that is my opinion. 210";

I understand that it's the third entry into an otherwise flawless series and that George Miller didn't put his whole heart into it suffering the loss of longtime friend and producer Byron Kennedy and that it had two directors but still...what the hell? This movie starts out topnotch and it seems like it's going to be a superb follow up to the brilliant Road Warrior and then about halfway through it turns into friggin' Peter Pan meets Lord of the Flies! Mel Gibson was great in this film and working as hard as he could to make it work. Tina Turner was adequate but not spectacular. I understand the film maker's intentions to try and take the series into a completely different direction and all but why would you pick this direction? And what was up with that Gyro Captain guy from Road Warrior being cast as a similar character? Why not just bring his character back? I don't know maybe it was the same character I really wasn't awake for most of this film. If you want to catch a topnotch Mad Max film pick up either the first or second both are far superior to this one.I give this one   12 out of     Oh yeah and what's up with that annoying Ironbar guy not dying? He gets hit by a train thrown off a bridge and has his car destroyed with him in it and yet he still doesn't die!".

Bartertown may be ruled above ground by Aunty Entity but the real owner is Master Blaster  a team of two men who control the power supply. In exchange for his goods Aunty offers Max a deal where he will challenge Blaster to a fight in the town's duelling arena and kill him thus removing the muscle and putting Master under Aunty's control. Max accepts although he rightly suspects that he will be the next to be betrayed.At least one reviewer on this site has said that the reason people dislike this film is because it is about the start of a new world whereas the other two Mad Max films were about the end of the world as we know it. Sadly I believe he is mistaken because I think the reason people dislike this film is because it is messy excessive unconvincing even within the apocalyptic situation it makes no sense and just isn't really any good. The plot swings between an excessive violent society at the start to a child colony in the middle to a big noisy chase scene right at the end. In terms of the narrative that connects this all don't worry about that because it doesn't really work and just feels very episodic throughout  making it messy and uninteresting. It is unconvincing and although I accept that the entire film is fantasy you gotta wonder where all the excesses and such came from and how we were supposed to buy into it hell a fuel blockade by lorry drivers brought the UK to its knees a few years ago but yet we're suppose to believe this? The apocalyptic here lacks imagination and just feels like the sort of thing that exists in an art director's mind rather than something that convinces.The episodic feel isn't helped by the rambling pointless dialogue associated with the children  it tries to have a mysticism that nothing else in the film has worked to deserve however it could be helped by developing Max better. If he was a strong lynch pin holding all these bits and pieces together then it would matter less but he isn't  he is just a grunting rock that doesn't really have a character to speak of and I had little or no interest in him at all  even when he becomes caring and sharing I didn't care because I had had nothing to work with up till that point. Turner is not terrible but she doesn't really act and just sort of swans around in an unconvincing manner. In that regard she is like the majority of the cast who don't really give the performances  whether it e the clunky child actors or the grunting brutes that are just stunt fodder. The stunts are OK and the final chase provides some distraction but without really caring about the plot or the characters I found it hard to get into any action.Overall a disappointing film whose core failing is the lack of a convincing new world. The film feels episodic and lacks anything to hold it together. Throwing a lot of cars around at the end does provide some distraction but by then it was too late for me and the whole thing was clunky pointless and surprisingly uninteresting.".

Many have bemoaned the lack of decent car chases in the same way as the previous two films which is understandable however it must be remembered that this is fifteen years after the fall of civilisation and oil is nonexistent practically.A chase between a train we will skip over the nicely maintained track myster! and various bespoke vehicles is a bit of a rehash of the excellent chase from Road Warrior but fills the bill.

Tina Turner lords it up for all she can get as Auntie the leader of Bartertown with the usual supporting cast of henchmen and loonies in weird outfits driving even weirder machines!Of the supporting characters Helen Buday was excellent as the young warrior princess Savannah Nix which makes it a shame she has not done more film work Robert Grubb as Pigkiller was a character I felt needed more explanation and development whilst Bruce Spence is back as a similar although apparently different! character to his Gyrocaptain from The Road Warrior.Nothing however compares with the quite simply stunning closing sequence with the ruins of Sydney Harbour Bridge Opera House etc that was achieved with amazing accuracy using real models  who needs CGI?This and the other Mad Max films do deserve decent DVD releases though with load of extras the full soundtrack and deleted scenes I feel if they are to bring any justice to them.  Hopefully with the new Fury Road on the way someone at Warner Bros DVD Dept might take the hint?So with Savannah closing with her 'tell' we see Max set off into the wasteland sunset hopefully to return in Mad Max 4  Fury Road.".

Sure the stunts are spot on to be expected by now and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. Yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since The Road Warrior's crowning glory of the Petrol Tanker pursuit is replicated here only he uses a train instead!!.It's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s but when viewing the three films together now Thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly in the context of this series anyway. I give the film 310 purely for one real good Thunderdome fight sequence while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least.

	schema:reviewBody "Mad Max 3 has shown me that this Australian film franchise is continuing to be big and successful. Part way through watching this movie I felt that Mel Gibson was born to play the role of Mad Max as he suits the character that was created. I was thinking that this film might have had a very 'Hollywood' feel to it. But to my surprise I was glad to see and hear a very Australian flavour continuing which has accompanied all the Mad Max movies to date.Two men enter. One man leaves. That is the law in Bartertown's Thunderdome arena. But lawmaker Aunty Entity will soon add another Do not get Max mad! Max is back as the hero who takes on the barbarians of the postnuclear future  and this time becomes the savior of a tribe of lost children. However the powermad Aunty Entity a dominatrix is determined to use Max to tighten her stranglehold on Bartertown.What was lacking in the second of the Mad Max movies was its script which seemed to be underdeveloped so I was hoping that the 'Beyond Thunderdome' would be better. Thankfully it was as there was a lot more dialogue some intriguing characters and an even better story which contained a lot of entertaining elements. I especially like the location of Bartertown as it still had an 'Australian feel' to it the idea of the Thunderdome was well explained and shown through the story. Then to have Max be the protector of all these children made the story just that much better. MM3 was written once again by George Miller and Terry Hayes.But George Miller also did so much more. He directed the third movie giving it all the necessary touches that have made Mad Max the movies they are today. Helping Miller in the director's chair is another George director George Ogilvie. Having two directors I think only enhances the movie all the more. I like the way we see the famous 'Thunderdome' fighting scene as Miller and Ogilvie focused very much on that event and the many elements within it. I also like the grand view of the open desert that we see numerous times through out the film as both directors certainly wanted us to see that the conditions surrounding Bartertown were pretty harsh to both humans and animals. Credit for this section of the movie has to also go to the cinematographer Dean Semler who shot some great camera angles of the deserts.MM3 also had some fine performers. Mad Max Mel Gibson shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with. His introduction to Aunty Entity Tina Turner was highly entertaining as Max takes an impossible situation to show that he is a person not to be taken lightly. Max for part of this movie has long hair which I believe gives Max an even more silent heroic darker edge to his character. However I was not a big fan of Tina Turner's performance in the film as she did not seem at all in her place as an actress but the look of her character was effective. Tina sings the song 'We don't need another hero' for the movie's soundtrack.I also liked the actors with minor roles in the film. Max is told to separate Masterblaster who is two identities. There is the very small and intelligent Master Angelo Rossitto and the very muscular Blaster Paul Larsson who Max has the huge encounter with in the Thunderdome. There was also a very Australian feel to this cast. Pigkiller Robert Grubb was a peculiar character that I immediately liked. He genuinely wants to help Max's cause in any way he can. Of the nastier looking guys you have Ironbar Angry Anderson who might not have much to say but has many lives in the film. In fact many incidents with him are humorous and breathtaking as well. Back in MM3 is Jedediah Bruce Spence who now has a son Jedediah Jnr. Adam Cockburn. Max and Jedediah have a very clear understanding which continues here. Another major component to the film is the use of pigs. I will not say why they are used here just that I liked their presence every time they were onscreen.There are some amazing scenes attached to MM3. I have to agree that the film contains one the best movie fight scenes ever as Max and gladiatorial Blaster face off with maces chainsaws and anything not nailed down inside Thunderdome. It is truly an exhilarating scene to see playing out although I cringed when I saw Max dropstart the chainsaw. However the customary car chase scene which MM is famous for was not as great here as in the previous two movies. But it did have the fun sequence showing Ironbar barely escaping with his life many times. I enjoyed the lead up scenes to the car chase as they had a lot of action and involvement of many people from the cast.While I like the characters we see in this movie I do not believe they are as well developed as the people created for the first movie as they were a lot easier to get to know love and understand. I guess the big question after this movie is 'which Mad Max is better one or three?' I am still a bigger fan of the original as it is a great film showing that a small budget filmmaking can be very successful. That does not mean I am not a fan of this film because I am. 'Beyond Thunderdome' had such a fine conclusion that perhaps they should have left the 'status quo'. But hearing that a 4th film in the series is being made as we speak says to me that Mel Gibson George Miller and his talented crew have more in store for Mad Max fans. I cannot wait!CMRS gives 'Mad Max  Beyond Thunderdome' 3.5 Good  Very Good Film".

	schema:reviewBody "I am going to keep this review of this film short and to the point. This film was a mess. Which is a shame because it had all of the makings of a good Mad Max film... For the first 5 seconds.We start off with Gibson's character Max in this latest incarnation of the trilogy. He plays a broken nomad the type of person to which he once scoffed at in his days in the Main Force Patrol Mad Max  1979. His family and his best friend are brutalised by gang members of a nomad biker clan making good of turning the highways of Australia into a living hell. All of which is portrayed onto film in a very violent fashion.We progress onto Mad Max 2 which sees our character roaming the 'wastelands' of Australia. These desolate and baron lands become Max's home as he has nothing left for him in civilisation. He comes across a populated Oil refinery which is being marauded by a viscous army of scavengers pillagers and murderers. He brings back a half dead member of the small tribe of people within the grounds of the fortified Refinery and cuts a deal with them a truck cab for as much Fuel as he can carry. The film progresses and again Mad Max saves the day albeit being left alone again.Then this brings us on to Mad Max 3 if you can even call it Mad Max. This could have been a good film had they have named it 'Peter Pan and the Quest for Tomorrowmorrow Land.' This film is completely out of sync with it's predecessors. In comparison this is a tame and softened film of a franchise to which violence is its main selling point. Mad Max with children humming all of the time is not only slightly cringe inducing to watch but it is not what Max is about. They call him 'Mad' Max for a reason in this he is more like a stressed out Babysitter. The most violence you are likely to see is Blaster being shot with a Speer and Max knocking Savannah Nix out with a single punch as well as a tribesman of Bartertown being knocked out with a frying pan a couple of times. That's it. No people being impaled with spears no kneecaps being shot out nothing. Even Aunty Entity escapes Max's wrath compared to her predeceasing kingpins in previous films being blown up ran over and blown up again.This film is nothing more than a joke to a brilliant franchise and not a particularly funny one at that. If I were you I would just watch the first two films and call it quits there. Pretend that Max is still wandering the Wastelands helping tribespeople out when they are needy etc etc. Although I cannot help but think that this way of thinking is only going to be made harder with a fourth member to the franchise with the pipeline. Lets hope that the directors have learnt from their mistakes made in this dog.110. There nothing for you here...".

Max ends up losing absolutely everything civilized in his life  everything. Not a drop of heart's blood is spared Max as he rips himself apart trying to free himself of the chains and bonds of civilization in order to take revenge on the men who stole his world away. When it's all done he wanders away from absolutely everything.Mel Gibson's Max character returns in Road Warrior where the remnant of civilization has been left behind in favor of complete anarchy in the middle of the desert where an oil well refinery is the stronglydefended holdout of some kind of corporate collective against growing bands of interested investors who would like to trade bullets and lives for the thinning lifeblood of petroleum. The leader of the wackos is absolutely cartoonish sort of a psychotic prowrestler genius while the leader of the recluses is dripping with ignorance and a desperate need to maintain his egotism. Every single person knows why they are in that desert fighting  because they can't get away from the the vehicles and the combustion. It's everything in their life. The distance between meals and drinks is dozens of miles. The distance to the nearest real civilization is not even survivable. Those who hold the vehicles hold the supreme power. Max delivers the oilbarons into salvation but at a heavy loss then once again wanders away from all that has come to pass.Finally Max come into his own with a welloutfitted gravy train is wandering the desert apparently finally convinced that he is the beacon of civilization not some building or crowd. His delusion is sorely broken right at the beginning of the movie and with nothing but his boots and a flute he's forced to rejoin humanity but why we aren't exactly sure. He's been through it before and he knows what will happen but still he saunters into Bartertown where he meets the sexy Auntie Entity Tina Turner who rules with elegance and ferocity and agrees to scratch her back if she'll rub his.Tina Turner's delivery as Aunty Entity is passionate. When she is stood off by the uppity MasterBlaster you can hear the hurt pride in her voice as she admits her humility. And when the real loser of Thunderdome is swiftly decided you can see the fear in her eyes as everything all the orders of civility she has cherished and sacrificed who knows what for falls apart right under her hands. As the chaos grows she looks above for guidance but sees only the mindless crowd just as desperate as she and even more powerless. Her delivery from the middle of thunderdome is moving but short compared to the brotherly storytelling of the very artful Dr. Dealgood Edwin Hodgeman. Nevertheless what small part Turner is given to play is played from the bottom of her heart and you are thoroughly convinced that she is who she portrays. Her chainmail suit could have been a little more transparent though. The rest of the characters in Bartertown some recognizable from the earlier films are real in a faerytale sort of way that seems to follow naturally behind the previous films in Mad Max the characters' selves were all dying like lights on their way to burning out in Road Warrior their selves were completely gone wasted with nothing but animal behaviors left in Thunderdome's Bartertown the desolation of the human inner being has proved to be merely a loss of luxury and comfort and we see that deep inside these layers of modern dross most man and women really are larger than life in their hopes and dreams and their achievements. Max unable to abandon life on his own this time around is forced out into the desert wilderness to die.We soon see the inherent human worth proved again in Thunderdome's Crack in the Earth where little people who never grew up with the bleak realities of technology and its apocalyptic inevitabilities as anything but faerytales are all as large of life as nature can provide for. The gorgeous Suzannah Helen Buday rhymes with boo tay drags Max back into life in a veritable Garden of Eden where children and children's' children who are absolutely hysterical spend every day of their lives in summercamp dreamland. Finally Max chooses not to abandon but to stay around and support  whether because he's too tired to fight any more or because he's learned to see a good thing when he's got it and not drop it for something better it's hard to say  maybe this is where he was on his way to in the first place. And yet none of this matters. Somehow once again humanity goes wrong over the same superstitions and arrogance as before and a schism in the valley dwellers leads to calamity and a reconciliation with the recent past. Max decides to abandon the valley after all proving finally that he really truly is MAD sacrificing everything to return one more time to the truth that he and every man carries his best civilization with him wherever he goes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersIn 1979 the first Mad Max came out Although the story goes it was actually filmed in 1977 as Director George Miller's Film School Project. At any rate it was a lowbudget film that achieved a cult status.Then came 1981's MM2 TRW. One of my alltime favorite movies largely because Miller combines a tortured minimalist performance by Gibson offset by almost cartoonlike violence comic relief by other characters along with some of the best cinematography in any 1980's film all so brilliantly that the result is much greater than the sum of its parts. In addition Brian May's brooding operatic score was so good  contributed so much to the overall feel of the film that I have pondered over the years that it must have influenced Danny Elfman's soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 ' Batman '.At any rate it was a great movie.But Miller could not just quit while he was aheadHe had to go for the ' HatTrick '.The result being 1985's MM BT A film that starts with Gibson' The Road Warrior ' looking more like ' Lawrence of Arabia ' as he trades his BadAss Black Ford Falcon Interceptor forA covered wagon pulled by Camels???WTF??? A film that trades May's score for pop tunes by Tina Turner. WTF??? A film that trades SOME plot in TRW for NO coherent plot at all! WTF???

	onyx:emotionText "Possible SpoilersIn 1979 the first Mad Max came out Although the story goes it was actually filmed in 1977 as Director George Miller's Film School Project. At any rate it was a lowbudget film that achieved a cult status.Then came 1981's MM2 TRW. One of my alltime favorite movies largely because Miller combines a tortured minimalist performance by Gibson offset by almost cartoonlike violence comic relief by other characters along with some of the best cinematography in any 1980's film all so brilliantly that the result is much greater than the sum of its parts. In addition Brian May's brooding operatic score was so good  contributed so much to the overall feel of the film that I have pondered over the years that it must have influenced Danny Elfman's soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 ' Batman '.At any rate it was a great movie.But Miller could not just quit while he was aheadHe had to go for the ' HatTrick '.The result being 1985's MM BT A film that starts with Gibson' The Road Warrior ' looking more like ' Lawrence of Arabia ' as he trades his BadAss Black Ford Falcon Interceptor forA covered wagon pulled by Camels???WTF??? A film that trades May's score for pop tunes by Tina Turner. WTF??? A film that trades SOME plot in TRW for NO coherent plot at all! WTF??? A film that is so absurdly campy that Turner herself looks like she is trying to be a drag queen! WTF??? A film where NONE of the action makes any sense least of all the ending.WTF??? So if this trilogy were a ThreeCourse Meal then MM would be the appetizer TRW would be the Filet Mignon Entree and BT would be Miller's big steaming dump in a dessert dish. Shame on you George. M";

	schema:reviewBody "A few weeks ago I picked up the Mad Max 2 and Mad Max 3 combo for ten bucks I figured since I was a fan of Mel Gibson why not see the movies that put him on the map? So when I saw the first Mad Max I was really impressed what they had to work with they created a good low budget action film. Mad Max 2 had nothing but awesome action sequences and a cool rebel that was charismatic strong handsome and just so awesome that could always be known to us as Mad Max. Now we have Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome I have to say while the action sequences are pretty good I know why not too many enjoy this sequel it definitely took a strange turn from the series. But it was still kind of an interesting story with Tina Turner that was a strange role for her to take on.Mad Max has changed a little bit since his day as the hero he comes to a land where all his possessions have been taken away from him. He is forced to join a group where they beat each other to the death in the Thunderdome. But when Mad Max doesn't like the rules and refuses to follow them he's in big trouble. He makes a run for it but the gang is now after him and will make sure that he pays for this love for humanity. He is pushed into the desert where he encounters these children he promises to take them to a land that they were heading for called Tomorrow Morrow Land clever title huh? But together they head to the world that seems better without being caught by Aunt Entity.Mad Max Thunderdome is over all entertaining I wouldn't say that this is a bad film. I think just compared to the other two Mad Max films this seemed a bit flawed. It was a little bit of a different story to take on but the one thing that is for sure is any action lover will be satisfied. Tina Turner was actually pretty decent as Aunt Entity it was very strange to see her take on the role especially with those earrings she had to wear lol. But Mel Gibson and she both were cool to watch I would recommend this if you are a fan of the original Mad Max films just to complete the series.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Mad Max is rough and tough and the previous movies were rough and tough too. This one is overproduced this one is trying to be a blockbuster it's all too pretty not enough real dirt it all looks too new nice and fake. Too many illogical jumpslike when they're in the tubetrying to rescue Master and Max punches one guy trough the fence of the tube and they shoot at him he pulls back in the tube and the guy that just shot at him goes up to look trough the tube and he just looks and goes away? I mean it's a straight tube why didn't he shoot trough it you'll always hit someone. Things like that occur throughout the movie. Mel Gibson looks too friendly in this movie Tina Turner doesn't quite convince but she isn't given much of a chance to convince either. Still compare her to Lord Humungus and his disciples and you have a good notion of all what is wrong with this movie. Actually it isn't so much wrong as it just isn't what Mad Max is about. It even reminded me of Spielbergs Hook and that is not a good thing for a Mad Max Movie. And the race at the end starts of promising when it starts I had this 'Yes finally'feeling but it just didn't deliver. It never got me yes yes yes yesing. Considering the brilliance of Mad Max 2 this was very disappointing. This was made only a couple years after the brilliant Mad Max 2 but somehow looks and feels as though it was made in the 90's 10 years later or something.".

Mel Gibson looks too friendly in this movie Tina Turner doesn't quite convince but she isn't given much of a chance to convince either. Still compare her to Lord Humungus and his disciples and you have a good notion of all what is wrong with this movie. Actually it isn't so much wrong as it just isn't what Mad Max is about. It even reminded me of Spielbergs Hook and that is not a good thing for a Mad Max Movie. And the race at the end starts of promising when it starts I had this 'Yes finally'feeling but it just didn't deliver. It never got me yes yes yes yesing. Considering the brilliance of Mad Max 2 this was very disappointing. This was made only a couple years after the brilliant Mad Max 2 but somehow looks and feels as though it was made in the 90's 10 years later or something.";

Nothing really even happens if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick can it even be called that? make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max or better yet both.

This movie played at Cannes in 1959 but since then pretty much disappeared at least in the English language world. It's a Venezuelan film made by a lady called Margot Benacerraf she made this and one other film before ceasing filmmaking entirely and entering into the cultural bureaucracy of Venezuela founding for example the Cinemateca Nacional.The film is shot on the peninsula of Araya which is basically dead land abutting onto a salt marsh and then the sea. The land doesn't support anything there's practically no rainfall most of the land is not much different from baked bones and dust. There is in one part of the peninsula what is described as a forest but is too puny too justify that term arid brittle branches primordially struggling to live. For the inhabitants of the peninsula this is their only supply of wood.So in Araya there are only really two professions you're either a fisherman or a salinero salt miner. The salineros cut mine from the salt marshes and bring it to the shore they get 50 cents for a 140 pound basket of salt which they have to crush to a powder and clean. They do all this without the aid of machinery. Because salt is toxic when handled day in day out they often get ulcers all down their exposed skin.It's a very simple monotonous life and whole families are involved in the human conveyor process of bringing the Arayan salt to where it can be loaded for delivery.It's shot very well and very poetically there's also a voiceover that follows the movie the whole way through. I think the voiceover occasionally became more sombre and poetical than the subject matter demanded. I think there's also an extent where it's a false documentary at least I was feeling suspicious about that it seems a lot of the scenes are being done for the camera. They film the entire movie almost without reference to machinery only to have it appear quite conspicuously at the end. So the movie well may have been shot as a time capsule to preserve the way of life that had gone before premachinery and was coming to an end. It would be better I think if they had maybe more conspicuously framed it like that at the start. That's a little unfair I mean the way they did it was good but it felt deceptive.Whilst some of the poetry is a little overwrought there was a great moment where this woman who was in charge of the scales had her eyes described as being hard and bright like the salt and then when she is back in the pueblo they are soft and bright. The poet got that spot on her eyes did look exactly like that.The way the cemetery is decorated in the movie is really poignant as well. So I think this film is well worth watching. It has recently been restored by Milestone and I think there is a fundraising effort going on in the US at the moment lead by Margot Benacerraf still alive!. It may well be released on DVD by Milestone in R1 over the next couple of years.".

Lack of socialculturalinfrastructural evolution for 450 years sun and sea and salt and fish barren landscape anachronistic idyllic utopian machine inhabitants fixed unchanging volitionless coefficients for 450 years until an external colonialistic entity introduces variation in the form of machineryindustrialization.Sea salt is what remains when water is spent when matter is spent when the body is spent when energy is spent a fusion of sunlight and water crystalized into a bright glowing white geometrical structure a cubic structure seemingly forged from liquid light energy dregs ashes dust classified as a mineral a mineral comprised of 80 essential chemical elements a mineral essential in sustaining human and animal and ocean life in addition to many plant lives. Salt is essential to amniotic fluid like the seas and oceans amniotic fluid is extremely salty and that salty environment is necessary to producing and fostering the growth of the human embryo.The human mechanics of salt milling parallel anatomical interactions of salt and water preprogrammed robotic factoryline clockwork precise balanced each gesture and and cellular process hereditary. Except sea salt mining necessitates dehydration of water from shallow water pockets in order to isolate and extract salt whereas the human body replete with oceans of water within the cells and throughout the body necessitates a perfect balance of salt and water to avoid the debilitating and lethal effects of dehydration.It's hard to lambast the exploitative machine of salt mining because salt is essential. Everybody needs salt and somebody has to extract it. The director muted the politicalsocial critique instead translating the labour into something that is part of the natural order of the universe of Araya the people a special species created for the sole purpose of salt extraction an approach that invites challenging questions. Isn't human labour part of the natural order of the universe? What is wrong with manual labour? Do we really want to introduce mechanical industrialization in such a purely natural environment? Do we really want to introduce into this environment all the socialpolitical mechanisms designed to protect workers and enhance their quality of life mechanisms that always do as much harm as good?

Lack of socialculturalinfrastructural evolution for 450 years sun and sea and salt and fish barren landscape anachronistic idyllic utopian machine inhabitants fixed unchanging volitionless coefficients for 450 years until an external colonialistic entity introduces variation in the form of machineryindustrialization.Sea salt is what remains when water is spent when matter is spent when the body is spent when energy is spent a fusion of sunlight and water crystalized into a bright glowing white geometrical structure a cubic structure seemingly forged from liquid light energy dregs ashes dust classified as a mineral a mineral comprised of 80 essential chemical elements a mineral essential in sustaining human and animal and ocean life in addition to many plant lives. Salt is essential to amniotic fluid like the seas and oceans amniotic fluid is extremely salty and that salty environment is necessary to producing and fostering the growth of the human embryo.The human mechanics of salt milling parallel anatomical interactions of salt and water preprogrammed robotic factoryline clockwork precise balanced each gesture and and cellular process hereditary. Except sea salt mining necessitates dehydration of water from shallow water pockets in order to isolate and extract salt whereas the human body replete with oceans of water within the cells and throughout the body necessitates a perfect balance of salt and water to avoid the debilitating and lethal effects of dehydration.It's hard to lambast the exploitative machine of salt mining because salt is essential. Everybody needs salt and somebody has to extract it. The director muted the politicalsocial critique instead translating the labour into something that is part of the natural order of the universe of Araya the people a special species created for the sole purpose of salt extraction an approach that invites challenging questions. Isn't human labour part of the natural order of the universe? What is wrong with manual labour? Do we really want to introduce mechanical industrialization in such a purely natural environment? Do we really want to introduce into this environment all the socialpolitical mechanisms designed to protect workers and enhance their quality of life mechanisms that always do as much harm as good? Why interrupt something that is not as bad as it appears to be?

	schema:reviewBody "Don't know what I was expecting  with a name like that maybe an eerie quirky thriller set in Dicken's London. Instead it concerned an eccentric antique dealer with a shady past who lives for his daughter's triumph as a concert violinist. The real star is Kenneth Griffith  I don't think I've ever seen him in a likable role and this part would have been a high water mark in his career of ne'er do wells and bad 'uns!! He played Archie Fellows an insolent assistant to Desius Heiss Oskar Homolka I remembered him from Sabotage1936 at his antique shop at Sly Corner. I can't really understand why Heiss puts up with him because at first Archie has no knowledge about his past. He soon finds out when he stays behind one night at the shop and overhears a conversation between Heiss and a cat burglar Corder Morris who have a connection over a stolen goods racket. He also overhears Heiss confession about his past and why he can't return to Paris.From then on  it is on!! Archie is suddenly in the money with a palatial flat a young nymphet complete with a fur coat hanging on his arm and walking around the antique shop as if he owns it!! Yes he is bleeding poor Heiss for everything he has but what he really coverts is Margaret Muriel Pavlow the old shop keeper's daughter. Archie is so repulsive in character but at least you feel some emotion no matter how negative. With Heiss it is hard to feel a lot of sympathy. He has already shown that he has a lucrative sideline as a fence even though he dissolves the partnership but when his accomplice who seems a nice enough guy is killed in a car chase Heiss doesn't give himself away with much emotion  he is a very inscrutable person. He can be very penetrating and unscrupulous but still manages to have compassion for an elderly lady who brings her beloved music box in to be pawned. Archie tries to short change her but Heiss ends up giving her more than she asked for.Muriel Pavlow made an unassuming leading lady she and leading man Derek Farr met on the set and it was love at first sight apparently. Gorgeous teenager Diana Dors didn't have much to do as Archie's newly acquired girl friend but gee I wish she had been featured more!!".

The title just did not garb me. This time I decided to give it a spin and boy was I surprised. It is a first class production with more than a few film noir touches throughout. Oscar Homolka headlines the film with excellent help from Kenneth Griffith Muriel Pavlow Derek Farr Manning Whiley and Gary Marsh. Homolka runs a successful antique shop with an interesting sideline. He is in partnership with cat burglar Manning Whiley. Whiley steals gold and jewels which Homokla breaks down. The gold is melted down and the jewels shipped offshore. All this is so Homolka can pay for his daughter Muriel Palow's education and training as a world class violin player.Of course this happy arrangement cannot continue forever. Homolka's shop assistant Kenneth Griffith is a crooked little rat who is not adverse to pocketing a few pounds by selling items for a bit more than priced. The swine is also infatuated with Homolka's daughter.One evening Griffith happens to overhears Homolka and Whiley taking about their arrangement. Homolka is telling Whiley that he has enough of the deal. He has enough cash saved to look after himself and see to his daughter. He also tells Whiley about his early life. He was from France and had once been a prisoner on Devil's Island. He had murdered a man and been sentenced to life. He had escaped and had been living under a false name in England since. Whiley is cool with the break up as he also feels it is time to cool his heels.After Whiley leaves Homolka is confronted by Griffith. The man is in the mood for a spot of blackmail. Pony up some cash or Griffith will spill the beans to John Law about Homolka's past. Several months later Derek Farr a navy doctor returns from the fareast. Farr is the fianc of Palow. The two are madly in love which makes Homolka very happy. Daughter Palow though has noticed a difference in her father over the last few months. He seems bothered by something. She has fianc Farr have a word with Homolka about it. Farr has also noticed that former shop assistant Griffith seems to be in the cash of late. He is always popping in to see Homolka and acts like he owns the place. Homolka just says he is feeling a bit under the weather. Griffith is have a grand time on Homolka's dime. He is dressed to the nines in fancy clothes has a great apartment and has just bought a flash car. Every time he needs a bit of loot he just puts the touch on Homolka.Homolka gets hold of his old partner Whiley for a talk about Griffith. Whiley is all for eliminating Griffith and knows a few heavy mob types who will make Griffith disappear. Homokla is not willing to go that far. He just wanted Whiley to know what was going on. Homolka has a plan that he hopes will end the matter. He will offer Griffith 20000 pounds to leave the country. Take it or leave type thing. If Griffith goes to the Police he will be ending his supply of cash. Several days later Griffith pays the shop a call to see Homolka. The future son in law Farr happens to be there waiting to pick up Palow. The oily Griffith makes some crack about Palow to which Farr responds with several solid punches to the head. He then picks up Griffith and tosses him out in the street. Griffith rather annoyed with the beating Farr gave him returns that evening with his answer to Homolka's offer. He wants the cash and he also intends to marry Palow himself. He wants Homolka to break up Farr and his daughter's planned marriage.Homolka has had enough and without really thinking is soon choking the life out of the bastard Griffith. Collecting himself Homolka calls Whiley over to the shop. Whiley has a look at the stiff and agrees to help Homolka dispose of the swine. They pop the body into Whiley's car and drop it off in an outlaying wooded area. It is pouring rain so they assume the water will wash any evidence away. Unfortunately for them there was a witness to them dumping the body. A woman spotted the men as they drove off from the woods. She gives the Police the car plate numbers. The body is quickly found and the wheels start rolling. Homolka is soon paid a visit from Police Inspector Gary Marsh about his former assistant. Marsh and Homolka are friends as Marsh is a collector who has bought items from the shop before. Needless to say the whole thing starts to come unglued as clues start to pop up for the Police. Whiley is tracked down from his car plates and is killed in a high speed chase trying to escape. A search of Griffith's flat finds a bit too many objects from Homolka's shop. The Police cannot find any bank records of where Griffith was getting his cash from. The leads all seem to head back to Homolka. Without giving away the ending suffice it to say it is a real cracker. Homolka is great in this film taking full advantage of one of the few times he had a leading role.Director George King hits all the marks spot on in this superb UK noir.".

Performances are mostly very good with the exception of Muriel Pavlow who is passable  however her representation of violin playing is so substandard as to be laughable. It can't have been so difficult to find a REAL violin player even a poor one! who could coordinate fingering and stroking much much better to the music played who could also perform the minimum acting required of this ingenue role. The casting director and producer should have shopped around music conservatories small orchestras etc. to find some pretty young girl who could actually play the violin and then her representational playing could have been dubbed by a better player as it was in this movie. Viewers of Mary Astor movies may remember her playing the piano in The Great Lie of 1941 and being dubbed by a superior piano player. That worked because Astor actually played the piano fairly well herself and could match finger moves well to the notes heard. The more difficult passages were simply off camera. Here long shots were frequently used but still didn't cure the blatant problem That was hole 1.Hole 2 is that we are asked to believe that Heiss throws in the towel when he is well in the clear of the murder he has not been identified as being one of the two men who dumped the body. The other man who dumped the body is dead. How Fellowes obtained the legacy money may be an open question but it does not incriminate Heiss directly as Fellowes may have been blackmailing someone else or had some other unsavory money source. Pavlow's doctorfianc tells Heiss that an item that was on the mantelpiece then in Fellowes' pocket proves Fellowes returned to the shop on the night of the murder. So what? All that coolcustomer Heiss needed to suggest was that Fellowes may well have returned unbeknownst to himself and just pocketed the item and then left without seeing Heiss. Fellowes could have entered the shop surreptitiously  an open window? did he still have a key? was the door unlocked?  no need for suicide here. That's hole 2.Otherwise a fine movie that kept the viewer rooting for the old man..".

Donnie himself is a basically sweettempered often courageous young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation.  His quest for meaning and selfdiscovery drives him to the fringes of our reality which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves.  The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl or unappreciated such as Karen the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.Of course this movie far from polarizes its characters indeed polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque Donnie's parents who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused the aforementioned selfhelper Jim Cunningham who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else and Donnie's sister struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child.  And then there's Frank.  All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.Probably the best thing about this movie though is its incredible emotional range.  It manages to inspire hope love dread laughter and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states.  The scenes with Frank especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie as they literally made my skin crawl.Finally the performances in this film are exquisite.  The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing.  That said though this film has a dismal future.  Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane  crashing into a building this has got to be the very definition of bad timing and it's pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground.

I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect especially the end. And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny and I catch more each time I watch it.

None of it was self congratulatory or gluttonous. The visuals were supported by a truly emotional score and its hard to find fault in the 80's pop tunes that found their way into some of the more impressive scenes.The story is very much thought provoking. Its the type that leaves you pondering the possibilities voiced by the characters. There is nothing condescending about this film. Answers arent simply handed out rather the viewer is left to draw many conclusions instead. The acting is also top notch. If i hadnt known beforehand that Patrick Swayze was in this film I would have been shocked. His character is amusing and interesting all at the same time. A great cameo for him. Drew Barrymore is forgetable though that in no way detracts from the film. Of course the star is Jake Gyllenhaal. There is nothing that can be said to properly praise his performance. The rest of the cast chosen fit their roles perfectly. All of these things combine to create a stunning film. One can only hope that filmgoers will give this little gem a shot and support a true wonder. This is the only film I have awarded a 1010 on the IMDB.".

It is also a film worthy of several viewings and at least as many varied interpretations. I can not honestly recommend this to anybody who attends films for the pure sake of entertainment. Nor can I recommend it to people who need straight answers or have limited attention spans. It's art and does not need to provide pat explanations for itself.

A streak of Heathers is mixed in as well with trenchant satirical observations of highschool life in the late '80s story set in Oct. 1988 involving a priggish teacher a selfhelp guru Patrick Swayze! and a putupon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally a whiff of Back to the Future in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.   A lot goes on here.  There's a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine.  There's a demonstration of why in the Bible angelic messengers if that's what Frank can be taken to be are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying Fear not. There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the ki or personal energy emanating from a person's midsection in the type of time travel depicted here the term ki is never used in the flick but the term path another word for Tao or Way is.  Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky in a way that's more pivotal and therefore more interesting than the gratuitous rain of frogs in Magnolia.     Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well.  One character no spoiler! whose life is saved by Donnie's ultimate trip back in time wouldn't have died in the first place if he hadn't dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole.  Another character again no spoiler! whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal since the arson now won't happen.  Surely that's no oversight on the part of the screenwriter it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and tradeoffs in life as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.     Somehow this pastiche works largely on the strength of good performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and also appropriately not always likeable in the title role.  Drew Barrymore who executive produced appears as a frustrated firstyear teacher.  The movie's often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography the subdued but effective special effects and the choice of the music on the soundtrack which includes '80's pop tunes of course and a haunting original song over the end credits titled Mad World.   Not for all tastes but better stranger and more complex than I expected.".

	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Darko. My Theory.At the beginning of the film there is a dinner table scene in which Donnie's sister mentions Donnie's medication. This scene lets us know that he is mentally unstable in some way. This is later described as paranoid schizophrenia.The night the plane crashes into Donnie's house is the 2nd Oct 1988.That night Donnie gets out of bed and takes a walk. This is where he meets Frank the giant bunny rabbit.This Frank the one we see in this scene is in fact a ghost of the Frank we later see shot by Donnie. This ghost has come back through time to give Donnie a choice. He shows Donnie the future right up until the moment he is sitting at the top of the cliff watching the tornado or portal.Everything you see from the point of Donnie meeting Frank on October 2nd to the day after halloween the cliff scene is in fact a vision that the ghost of Frank is showing him.At one point in the future in this vision Donnie is speaking to his science teacher about 'God's channel' and how you can not change the future events no matter what you do. Donnie realises on the night of 2nd October whilst Frank is showing him this vision that what he is seeing and what we assumed actually happens during the rest of the movie is 'God's channel'. The ghost of Frank shows him the plane crashing into his house which in fact happens roughly 6 hours after Donnie has taken his stroll to meet Frank Donnie meeting Gretchin the school flooding Donnie burning Jim Cunnigham's house down the halloween party Gretchin being run over and Donnie killing Frank in revenge. Donnie knows that he has 2 choices. He can go back to bed and prevent all the above from happening as he knows that there is no way to change what the future holds as it is a predecided event or he can take the path shown to him by Frank the ghostly apparition.Frank is the only character in this film who engages in any type of 'time travel'. What is shown in the movie from the moment Donnie first meets Frank to the cliff scene is something that actually happened in reality however what we are seeing as the viewers is in fact the vision Donnie is seeing that night 2nd October.Frank has gone back in time to prevent his own death. He knows that by going back in time as a ghost he can let Donnie know what will happen had he gone 'sleep golfing' that night thus preventing him from being in the house the night of the crash  thus taking the path Frank is showing him.The scene at the end of the film where Donnie is lying in bed is a replacement to where he goes 'sleep golfing' like an alternate ending.The night he dies in the film at the end the 2nd October is in fact the very same night you see him meet Frankat the beginning There is no time travel involved to take Donnie back to that night. The film leads us to believe that Donnie in fact followed 'God's channel' and flooded the school burnt the house down etc etc.Let's say that this is what happened before the film we saw started a kind of prologue. Donnie meets Frank the person as the film leads you to believe Donnie floods school burns house down has a halloween party Gretchin gets killed and Donnie shoots Frank. Frank as a ghost goes back in time Lets say that all the above happened in a part of the movie we did not see.the prologue  not included in the film This is where we see the film starting Frank the ghost lures Donnie to the place they first meet. He tells Donnie all about the things that have happenedas above. Donnie see's it as the future. These were the scenes we saw as actually happening. Donnie in fact does not go sleepgolfing that night. He goes back to bed.The scene we see at the end of the film with Donnie in bed laughing and being killed by the plane is in fact only 6 hours after we first see him meet Frank.This is what I think actually happened Donnie goes sleep walking and meets Frank. Frank shows him the future the flooding of the school etc etc Donnie prevents this all from happening by going back to bed thus preventing all the following events.The following events being the 'vision that Frank's ghost showed him that night right up until he's back in bed laughing The whole movie was set in one day. The dates flashing up on the screen lead us to believe that the movie was progressing in time.However these dates were just a reference point given to Donnie by Frank on the 2nd October.If any of this is unclear please let me know and I will do my best to clarify. Sorry for how long winded this theory is but it's a pretty hard movie to make sense of.Discuss.".

Most people will probably not understand the movie the first time they watch it because they don't know what to watch for but the 2nd time you watch the movie most will consider it a great and profound movie. Another way to understand Donnie Darko is to have someone that has already seen the movie to watch it with you and tell you which parts of the movie to remember towards the end of the movie. This is not a movie to watch if one does not like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is also not a movie for the lazy movie watcher to watch. I normally like the easy brained movies that require no thoughtprocess but this is one thought provoking movie that I give a 10 out of 10.".

Instead I'll comment on the differences between the two versions unfortunately most of the differences took away from the original film which I think is truly excellent. I traveled two hours roundtrip with several friends to see the Directors Cut since it was not playing in Milwaukee at the time and while I am glad that I saw it I feel that the original is the superior version. There were many superfluous scenes in the new cut which did not add to the film rather I almost felt that they made the pacing falter a bit. For example the new scene between Donnie's parents in the caf  a completely unnecessary scene which did not add anything relevant to the story. There were a handful of scenes like this as well as some added dialogue that indeed added to the development of some characters Drew Barrymore's character the teacher 'Karen' was enhanced a bit for some it just seemed silly One of Donnie's bus stop friends telling Cherita that he 'hopes she gets molested' turned him from just being an incidental character into being an incidental character who is a jackass. Another major difference between the two films was the addition of several special effects to the new cut. There were a lot of dreamlike sequences the file cabinets floating among the clouds ala Rene Magritte and all of the stuff focusing on Donnie's eyeball computerish codes etc that just did not work in my opinion. Also some of the most subtle changes soundtrack for example were disarming. The opening song was 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen in the original which provided a great backdrop in the introduction to Donnie his environment and his family. Kelly used 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS in his directors cut. Certainly a good song but after using a perfect song originally it is hard to get used to an inferior replacement.Which is how I sum up my feelings about Kelly's directors cut in general? Why mess with near perfection? 'Donnie Darko' is a fantastic film that was so thoughtprovoking it made some people run the other way. Only those who were interested in something beyond the ordinary stayed to ponder and theorize its meaning and still are to this day. Kelly's new cut does not enhance the film rather it made it plodding and a little dumbeddown  two adjectives I never thought I would ascribe to this film. See the directors cut to play 'spot the new stuff' but stick with the original.Shel".

Forget what others say about this movie as philosophical clever or trascendent. It's not. But my! how such a young director almost manages to make you believe it is... I don't know about you but I call that talent.Yes the movie is empty. The story goes nowhere there is no message no moral but the way it's all wrapped up keeps you salivating throughout. Don't think it's mere flashy fireworks though. This is not a case of style over substance. It's something more complex and that's where Donnie Darko distances from the rest. This movie is freaking special is full of personality. I wish more films had this character. The charm of this film relies on a lot of pieces that fit like a giant puzzle Chosen time 1988 is strangely proper you'll have to see this movie to understand it sorry.The movie is BLUE. Its photography is blue its characters are blue its story is blue. Everything is blue.Music is great.Emotions are overwhelming. They come from everywhere and at the same time. You don't know what's happening but what might be happening actually affects you.I can see some Lynch influences. The scene where the gym teacher talks to Donnie's mother at the doorstep is 100 Lynch.Some scenes are almost scary.This is one of the movies that present the idea of beyond in a most seductive way. You feel there's something more than this world. It never gets explained but heck I don't care.Finally and most important the main appeal of the movie is that it throws together unrelated concepts in such a way that they feel ghostly linked. The movie is a melting pot of vague ideas that thanks to a great direction get connected in the subconscious.Exactly because of this I understand this movie has so much appeal for some people and so little for others. If you fall in the trap it will touch you and this movie could mean the world to you. If you don't it won't and you won't see more than a bag of tricks. Whatever the category you fall in you have to recognize the skill of Richard Kelly. The execution of Donnie Darko is more than remarkable.I like to think of Donnie Darko not as a movie but as a niche some people feel comfortably unsafe inside that people being 2530 year olds with an affection for scifi and darkness. The more you fit in this role the more you'll get into this.RATING 8.3".

I am sorry to say that the new version falls well short of the original.Most of the deleted scenes that are available on the original DVD have been added into the new version. One of theseDonnie's last scene with his fatherworks very well but others fall flat and are not wellintegrated into the narrative. While these additions are minor missteps the addition of a repeated close up of an eye with computer data scrolling by and superimposed on the image is a major error. The images add nothing except cheese and are an anachronistic design element for a movie set in 1988. The movie has nothing to do with computers computers don't even appear as props except possibly in the background of a scene in the school office. These images have no place in the film's visual grammar.Kelly has also added in shots of pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel the book that guides Donnie through his journey. The audience is invited to read about 'the manipulated dead' 'the living receiver' and the like. Presumably the intent in adding these was to explain more of the theory of the events of the film. Some things though are better left unexplained. Putting in the equivalent of Cliff Notes deprives the moviegoer of the joy of trying to figure out the movie. The Director's Cut also shuffles the movie's great 80's soundtrack. Most of the time these changes are innocuous. SPOILER ALERTHowever by removing Under the Milky Way from the scene where on his last night on earth Donnie descends the stairs with Gretchen after they have make love for the first and last time Kelly has marred one of the most beautiful moments in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Upon awakening Donnie Darko Jake Gyllenhaal finds that he's been asleep in the middle of a secluded mountain road. It seems that Donnie regularly wanders out at night and sleeps in strange places. The night that he ends up on the neighborhood golf course a stray jet engine crashes through Donnie's bedroom. He's saved by his odd behavior. Shortly after we witness him hearing voices and having visions of an odd evillooking bipedal mansized bunny. The voice begins giving him unusual suggestions and Donnie slowly finds himself as the key player in a grand scheme.Donnie Darko is an unusual film. It spans a number of genres and leaves itself wide open to interpretation. Quite a cult of hardcore fans has developed around it and for those folks the film is essentially immune to criticism and reinterpretation.The biggest surprise to me was that the bulk of Donnie Darko is a realist drama. I had long heard about how strange the film was and heard it described as being partially scifi which it is and horror which it isn't if you ask me. It was supposedly a realitybender. I'm much more of a genre fan and I much prefer fantasy surrealism and absurdism to realism. My preconceptions were throwing me off of the film initially. The realist drama stuff seemed to drag on and it made much of the film a hard sell. I loved the touches of weirdness but they were too little too far betweenat least until I reached my personal interpretation of the film around the halfway mark.The film is also odd in that it's so retro. At one point I doublechecked the DVD box thinking that Donnie Darko had to be a late 1980s film. Nope 2001. Then I started thinking that writerdirector Richard Kelly must have had the script in storage for 15 years. But that can't be the case either as his bio says he was born in 1975 and it's unlikely that he would have written Donnie Darko when he was 10 or 11. The film is mired in late 1980s popculture references style and music. Realizing that Kelly was born in 1975 still makes this weird. He says on the new DVD commentary that he was following the clichd advice to write what you know and he knew school in the late 1980s. He wouldn't have even entered high school until 1989 so it seems odd that he would only know school in the late 1980s. The retro feel of the film was a bit artificial to me although I enjoyed the way the pop music was integrated.There were also some questionable performances for my tastes including Drew Barrymore's and some bizarre but not bizarre enough scenarios that I never quite figured out such as why a gym teacher was showing motivational videos to a class sitting in desks.But most fans of Donnie Darko tend to overlook the minutiae even though it takes up most of the screen time. The hinge tends to be on the overall arc and the meaning of the film. If minutiae are dwelt on it's usually concerning the Philosophy of Time Travel book or some bit of dialogue that is thought to be clever such as the Smurf discussion. The theme of the film is often said to be something like possibilities and the film is routinely interpreted as having a messianic subtext as well as often being interpreted more literally as a kind of scifi story. After I watched the film and it didn't quite pay off as I had been hoping I was anxious to listen to the commentary and watch the documentaries. Kelly seemed to intend more of the literal scifi interpretation of the film. That was disappointing because interpreted that way the most fascinating thing to me is that Kelly believes it even approaches coherency. The Philosophy of Time Travel material which is a core of this interpretation is arbitrary sounding gobbledy gook. It has nothing to do with time travel and even less to do with philosophy. It's more a nave attempt at something like a parallel universe ala the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics which tends to be nonsensical anyway.To make matters worse there is little attempt to integrate most of this material into the actual meat of the filmthe scifi interpretation seems very grafted on. Many of the actual scenes we witness aren't there to service the eventual interpretation of the film as a scifi story but are there because it's some snippet of actual life that Kelly remembers or has thought about or had conversations similar to in the past and he thinks it's clever or character developing. For me this material was neither.But my personal interpretation of the film made much more sense to me and under it I enjoyed it more. To me Donnie Darko is just a depiction of a kid with schizophrenia and this is even explicitly suggested although Kelly seems to be overlooking or not mentioning the interpretation. Even the smallest details of the film make sense in this context. Schizophrenics hear voices. They can have visual tactile and other sensory hallucinations. Some have delusions of grandeur such as messiahsuperhero complexes. They often feel alienated. Donnie mopes around mumbling fairly expressionless much of the time and has periodic emotional outbursts. He acts out in antisocial ways. He goes into semicatatonic states. Even the end of the film makes more sense under this interpretation as it can be seen as an intentional delusion that Donnie has created due to the relationshiporiented tragedy. He's fantasizing about things being different than they turned out. To me the film has much more depth under this interpretation.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko yet you owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter your final verdict it's an interesting quirky film and one that's sure to be talked about for a long time.".

He says on the new DVD commentary that he was following the clichd advice to write what you know and he knew school in the late 1980s. He wouldn't have even entered high school until 1989 so it seems odd that he would only know school in the late 1980s. The retro feel of the film was a bit artificial to me although I enjoyed the way the pop music was integrated.There were also some questionable performances for my tastes including Drew Barrymore's and some bizarre but not bizarre enough scenarios that I never quite figured out such as why a gym teacher was showing motivational videos to a class sitting in desks.But most fans of Donnie Darko tend to overlook the minutiae even though it takes up most of the screen time. The hinge tends to be on the overall arc and the meaning of the film. If minutiae are dwelt on it's usually concerning the Philosophy of Time Travel book or some bit of dialogue that is thought to be clever such as the Smurf discussion. The theme of the film is often said to be something like possibilities and the film is routinely interpreted as having a messianic subtext as well as often being interpreted more literally as a kind of scifi story. After I watched the film and it didn't quite pay off as I had been hoping I was anxious to listen to the commentary and watch the documentaries. Kelly seemed to intend more of the literal scifi interpretation of the film. That was disappointing because interpreted that way the most fascinating thing to me is that Kelly believes it even approaches coherency. The Philosophy of Time Travel material which is a core of this interpretation is arbitrary sounding gobbledy gook. It has nothing to do with time travel and even less to do with philosophy. It's more a nave attempt at something like a parallel universe ala the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics which tends to be nonsensical anyway.To make matters worse there is little attempt to integrate most of this material into the actual meat of the filmthe scifi interpretation seems very grafted on. Many of the actual scenes we witness aren't there to service the eventual interpretation of the film as a scifi story but are there because it's some snippet of actual life that Kelly remembers or has thought about or had conversations similar to in the past and he thinks it's clever or character developing. For me this material was neither.But my personal interpretation of the film made much more sense to me and under it I enjoyed it more. To me Donnie Darko is just a depiction of a kid with schizophrenia and this is even explicitly suggested although Kelly seems to be overlooking or not mentioning the interpretation. Even the smallest details of the film make sense in this context. Schizophrenics hear voices. They can have visual tactile and other sensory hallucinations. Some have delusions of grandeur such as messiahsuperhero complexes. They often feel alienated. Donnie mopes around mumbling fairly expressionless much of the time and has periodic emotional outbursts. He acts out in antisocial ways. He goes into semicatatonic states. Even the end of the film makes more sense under this interpretation as it can be seen as an intentional delusion that Donnie has created due to the relationshiporiented tragedy. He's fantasizing about things being different than they turned out. To me the film has much more depth under this interpretation.If you haven't seen Donnie Darko yet you owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter your final verdict it's an interesting quirky film and one that's sure to be talked about for a long time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Putting together a jigsaw puzzle can be fun. And make no mistake Donnie Darko is a puzzle of a film which asks the viewer to put the pieces together. But in the end there is frustration as you realize you were never going to be able to put it all together. There are pieces missing. So while the film which is certainly captivating and thoughtprovoking is often fascinating it ultimately is setting you up for a bit of disappointment. It's nice to have a film which makes you think which makes you work to understand it. It's also fine to have a film which is open to interpretation. But if in the end you don't have all the information necessary to make a reasonable interpretation that is a problem. And that is the case here. What just happened here? Hard to say. The untidy ending doesn't completely ruin the film this is still a film well worth seeing. But there's no denying that the ending is a bit of a letdown.So who is Donnie Darko? He's a high school kid a really smart guy. But he's got issues. Paranoid schizophrenia maybe at least that's what his therapist thinks. He suffers from hallucinations he sees things. And right now he's seeing a giant bunny rabbit named Frank. One night a jet engine crashes into Donnie's bedroom. But Donnie's not there because Frank has summoned him to a golf course where he tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days. What is Donnie meant to do with this information? Is this schizophrenic teen supposed to somehow save the world? Oh by the way that jet engine? The one that would have killed Donnie had a giant bunny rabbit not summoned him to a golf course in the middle of the night? Nobody knows where that engine came from. No airplane lost an engine. Well that's weird. Things are only going to get weirder but then again you probably already guessed that since the plot revolves around a giant bunny rabbit.So the clock ticks down toward the bunnyprophesied doomsday. Among other events Donnie gets himself a girlfriend rebels against life lessons taught by a ludicrous selfhelp guru and discusses time travel with one of his teachers. Time travel? Is that what this film is actually about? Who knows. The film never comes close to fully explaining itself. But the film certainly holds your attention. You can't help but be intrigued. You expect that all the weirdness will ultimately pay itself off with some sort of brilliant finish. Sadly that is not the case. The ending while admittedly powerful only adds to the confusion. There is a director's cut which makes things a little clearer but in the original version you're left to figure everything out for yourself. And you don't have near enough information to be able to do that. Donnie Darko is a very compelling film. And it is performed wonderfully. Jake Gyllenhaal hits all the right notes in his portrayal of Donnie a character who is just as confused as we are. And the supporting cast is by and large excellent as well. Whether it be big stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze or lesserknown performers who you've never heard of everyone fits their role very well contributing their solid piece to the puzzle. But that puzzle never does fully come together. And that ultimately makes Donnie Darko a somewhat frustrating film. There's so much good stuff here to recommend it. But there's also that little tinge of regret a wish that perhaps the giant bunny rabbit could have told Donnie and us what the heck was going on.".

Interestingly enough most of the rave reviews of DONNIE DARKO came via this very website which goes against the grain of other reviewers . Roger Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars while many other websites dedicated to film reviews claim this movie is confused and overrated . It should also be mentioned that if it's such a great  thought provoking piece of cinema then why did it miss out on so many nominations at the more prestigious film award ceremonies ? And don't say politics  an independent feature like IN THE BEDROOM didn't pick up any Oscars but that didn't stop it being nominated for severalDONNIE DARKO is by no means terrible but it is overrated . Dare I say it's a case of the emperors new clothes ? That is people are somewhat embarrassed upon seeing this film and not understanding it that they feel they must praise it in order to spare their supposed ignorance . Let me ask you this  What genre of film is this ? Everyone will give a slightly different answer I'm sure and if an audience is undecided about the genre then how can they decide what the ending is about ? And there is a quite serious plot hole involved in the story . Donnie sees a demonic rabbit called Frank throughout the movie who tells him at exactly what moment the world will end . Wormholes  time warps etc may actually exist in scientific reality as may the ending but the central plot does not since the whole movie rests on Frank or Donnie being able to see into the future and no scientist will claim there's any scientific basis for fortune telling . So you see it's not really about time travel  it's about mysticism  predestination and other superstitious mumbo jumbo which Richard Kelly is using to fool the audience . In effect this movie is one big cheat and most people have failed to notice this Having said that Richard Kelly does deserve some credit for making a movie that's not about car chases and explosions  this is a movie dealing with teen angst and the dark side of middle American small town values but Kelly has missed an opportunity to make the most of the potential . I know the film was released before the war on terror so there'd be little need to see news broadcasts on the fall out of the original Gulf war but from a pop culture point of view wouldn't this have been better set in the early 1990s when grunge culture was the rage instead of 1988 ? I mean what music best suits this movie's atmosphere ? Echo And The Bunnymen or Nirvana ? In fact if it had have set in the presidential elections of early 1990s this would have coincidentally tied in with what's going on in the world today with Saddam and Iraq getting a mention ! And wouldn't this movie be held up in superstitious awe now ? As it stands it's nowhere as clever as it thinks it is for the reasons outlined . Perhaps Mr Kelly started out on with two movies  one a high concept science fiction thriller and the other a low concept drama about a mentally ill teenager and decided to merge the two with not too successful results . Watching DOnnie Darko this was the gut feeling I got".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I do not recommend this film neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie.  Though I have not given away the ending or most of the plot twists this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko as there are many to deal with.  Richard Kelly in his first feature film seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage latenight stoner diatribes selfrighteous justifications and inoffensive banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenangst dramas then mashed them into a single two hour package with a scifi twist.  The result is deeply distressing for all the wrong reasons.  The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to make them sympathize with onedimensional characters and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot full of unreconciled loose ends by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neosurrealism. The main character Donnie Darko is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by his friends and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life.  We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs and Donnie counters with a theory of his own his friend complains about Donnie acting all smart.  Donnie's speech however is no smarter than that of his friend just angrier.  The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as intimidating' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements as shown in the FEARLOVE sequence this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film.  In fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost.  The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination is pushed into the background making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky.  The explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached uninformed rambling.  We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and can't quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film.  The scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved at one point a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject he'd be fired.  Apparently no further explanation is needed. Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions.  The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages his school but it's okay because his school doesn't treat him like a person.  His punishment of a creepy selfesteem advocate somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia results in the man's public humiliation.  But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel striking out against ignorance and debauchery?  He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws the film is riddled with flat uninteresting generalizations of humanity.  The story is set in 1988 just before the BushDukakis election and the director touches on this point during the film.  The focus however extends exactly this far Donnie's gruff blue collar father is voting for Bush while his freespirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis.  There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out.  Likewise Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film E.T. Stephen King the Smurfs Back to the Future.  At it's heart this film feels like the director's homage to himself a collection of his own experiences interests personal heroes and adversaries affirmations and disenchantments roughly stitched together by untrained hands.  Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions seemingly because the director likes the songs.  Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot including the archetypal bully fat girl and rightwing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow.  The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless cluttered meandering effort.My rating 110.".

Many reviewers have said well get the DVD because the notes from the book really explain it and I have to chuckle softly because I realize that perhaps a movie that requires crib notes... isn't really that cohesive of a movie.People are quick to slam hollywood movies and praise indie movies often simply because they are labeled indie movie.Some hollywood movies are bad some are brillant.

I finished watching the film with horror. It was that awful.Let me be frank I think it's totally the director's fault. The film's premise is interesting and the plot twists had the potential to be fun but the entire endeavor was marred by an inherent lack of intelligence.The director I have no doubt saw Donnie Darko as a superheroic Christlike figure who was doomed to sacrifice himself for the good of humanity. The film attempts to use magical realism to make its point. Your thinking Never Ending Story Star Wars Willow... If only. I didn't like those films much either but at least they weren't trying as hard as Donnie Darko to be internally consistent. Donnie Darko is very American very Christian and entirely too selfrighteous in its portrayal of truth. What's worse it's plot has holes large enough to pass elephants through so the filmmakers don't even have a right to act that way. In a nutshell the plot has NO LOGICAL CONSISTENCY. The characters are undeveloped and the acting is reminiscent of a high school play. Not to mention the whole premise of the movie centers around an acceptance of time travel that is entirely pedestrian. Yes modern physics speaks about time travel. No it looks NOTHING LIKE what is presented in Donnie Darko. I wouldn't care but they are attempting to actually present it like they are saying something along those lines. Like a BMovie Science Fiction Flick from the 50s the movie throws scientific and deductive ideas around without actually having researched them or patiently thinking about the consequences. I don't in principle mind when people get things wrong but this movie comes across as a selfrighteous attempt to be right. When you're trying to be right and the stuff you include can immediately be identified as eyerollingly incorrect that's when I begin to get stomach aches. Wolfgang Pauli summed up their premise well That's not right. That's not even wrong. Instead the filmmaker has spent research on figuring out what the smurfs were all about. Excuse me for rolling my eyes.The director could have gone with struggling with Darko's mental instability. No instead he tries to paint a hero in a world that's full of idiots who can't save themselves.It's a painful movie to watch. On more than one occasion I simply wanted to throttle everyone involved in the production. If you want to be annoyed then watch this movie.".

His other companion may not be a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank who is either a large purple bunny or man in a large purple bunny costume. Either way Donnie is the only one who can see him.Richard Kelly who wrote directed and created a webpage to explain everything in a tantalizingly opaque way seems to think he's being a lot deeper than he is.

The same everyday beginning that entails lots of unexpected turns the same play with identity and culpability the same insecure atmosphere where things happen to the characters that destroy their everyday world  even the music was Bernard Herrmannstyle! Of course directing and camerawork were not at all on the same level than in Hitchcock's films but the perfect screenplay was indeed. The actors were also great and seemed to like their roles. I didn't like Javier Bardem in Before Night Falls but here he was really cute... I would absolutely recommend this film to everyone who likes clever psychological thrillers and also to all people who love Hitchcock's films and are familiar with his work.".

Subtitles are adequate and a capacity for Spanish no necesita.PS The distasteful rape scene mentioned in one comment baffles me and must have been a figment to that reviewer. The character was actually suffering what could be called a post traumatic stress flashback. It rang true to that character and was necessary as the device to explain what really went on in the previous 0150 of screen time. Held me right to the end.".

	schema:headline " Despite valid criticism the movie is one of the best in its genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Following in dialogue with the comments of the previous reviewer I will start saying that most films convey the prejudices of the society where they come from. As Bishonen has already mentioned this film is quite homophobic but you don't notice this until the end. Actually it is difficult to put all the strings together until the end and still they don't all fit nicely. The tension of the drama is broken several times because the film appears to have been heavily edited thus missing a few important components.Yet probably because of the editing too the film presents just the best acted scenes. They are indeed very well done with a play of characters that is a pleasure to watch. The movie is sexy without taking too much time showing physical bodies engaged in sex the first scene is the longest one. The essence of the movie's sexuality is captured in the powerful sexual urges that the protagonists have trapped within themselves making them their slaves and the main appeal of the movie.The thriller side of the movie was only good when it was linked with the issue of sexuality. Otherwise it was ordinary probably because the scrip tried too hard to always hide the true identity of the killer thus giving little space for the observer to get deeply caught in the web of tensions.An interesting thing about the movie's narrative is that a storymaker I say maker because in addition to a storywriter he also made stories resulted smarter and more cunning than businessmen sharp detectives and even the evil people who were trying to hurt him. He even appears as too innocent throughout the film. In most other films when someone is having too much fun and trying to get away with it at the end such person pays with interests. In this film however the conclusion plays out differently.I also felt betrayed at the end when I noticed the strong homophobic sentiment of the movie. It just shows how the Spanish society continues being so conservative. Like the prejudices behind this movie the first negative reactions in Spain to the movie Bad Education where the main actors behave homosexually and bisexually just serves to prove that a large number of people in Spain are still trapped by the sexual mores of the Catholic Church.But besides the issue of homosexuality the smoking like chimneys and the fact that the thriller could have been made better the movie is one of the best in its genre. I specially liked Victoria Abril's performance. In Abril the movie took a thirtysomething women and made her the sexual object and the central sexual figure of the narrative. This contrasts with Hollywood's productions in which most females playing such roles are teenagers twentysomething or extremely glamorous. I think this movie illustrates by contrast how the U.S. society is so obsessed with youth to the detriment of older women in particular.".

I got from the film that Javier has already murdered the victim and stuffed him in the trunk and then goes to the support group to pick up an alibi as well as get lines for his scripts that he can no longer get from the phone sex encounters.Here is where the film lost me. What was up with the AIDS infected taxi driver? He is supposed to have taken a packet from somebody for a large sum of money. Could it be that the script and the scrap book that the victim had was being taken out to another country and that's why the police cannot find any script in their search of the house? The point of the police officer who killed his wife was inserted as a morality play I think so that in the end the husband let's the wife go away without harming her. Ipanema is probably the airlines suggesting that the couple ran off to Brazil to start a new life.The husband  policeman inadvertently drops the vial containing the pubic hair he finds in his bathroom. That whole vial with the pubic hair thing completely escapes me. How did the hair get into his bathroom and what would that have proved.A thriller alright but with a lot of loose ends that kept me guessing and confused.".

	schema:headline " Suspenseful thriller with great players  concerning a complex intrigue filled with twists and turns";
	schema:reviewBody "Thrilling film with a Spanishall starcast including intriguing situations  abstract incidents  female nudity and lots of loving scenes . It deals with Miranda Victoria Abril  a fortyyearsold woman who is a crew member of a nightly radio programme where she is an anchor girl in the radio talk show . But Miranda results to be also a real sexjunkie . She and her hubby Felix Carmelo Gomez  a police Inspector  are parents of a little girl a very young Dafne Fernandez . In order to deal with her sex addiction  she signs up for group therapy in a clinic run by Pepe Santander Adolfo Fernandez . Also in the therapy group is Javier Javier Bardem  a film producer and scriptwriter and sexaddicted  too . The two misfits hit off and a deep sexual relationship ensues . But things go awry when Javier finds out that his cell phone sex trysts have been secretly taped and being distributed all over city and subsequently blackmailed . Later on  issues get a little more complicated when Javier to be aware his exspouse is living with his business colleague Sergi Lopez . In addition  while investigating a killing case regarding a man in drag  Felix discovers his unfaithful wife has affair with Javier who is prime suspect of murder . Enjoyable thriller about sexual obsession and killings  plenty of emotion  rough sex  profanities  thrills  mayhem and surprise ending . In the beginning it displays a cool animated title sequence full of color and really brilliant .Entre Las Piernas or Between legs is Manuel Gomez Pereira's return to top form  with an intelligent and engaging script which uses moving situations to give us a good movie in a high suspense and complexity and that kept me entertained for the almost two hours of duration . Interesting screenplay from Yolanda Garca Serrano  Juan Luis Iborra  Manuel Gmez Pereira  based on a novel by Joaqun Oristrell  all of them are prestigious Spanish ScreenwritersFilmmakers . The flick develops a lot of steamy affairs among various characters  as there is random sex  oral sex  sex standing up  sex on couch  sex in car  among others . Rightly agreeable and funfilled  milestone thriller which neatly combines nailbiting set pieces  entertaining situations and amusement . Flawless story with a quartet of sensational protagonists  Javier Bardem  Victoria Abril  Carmelo Gomez and Sergi Lopez . As nice acting by Victoria Abril as a sexcrazed woman obsessed to pursue sexual encounters with men  she parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . Javier Bardem also gives a terrific performance as a successful scriptwriter and producer who is a sexphone obsessed  too . Pay attention as one couple of veteran actors very well played give portentous interpretations  as usual . The only flaw I can find is that some of the story lines are left unexplained and some character end up being implausible . Including an unforgettable plethora of secondaries such as  Javier Albal  Mara Adnez  Carmen Balagu  Roberto lvarez  Alberto San Juan  Manuel Manquia  and Adolfo Fernandez . And brief appearances from Blanca Portillo  Cristina Brondo  Gins Garca Milln and Antonio De La Torre  and several others . It was entertaining  great actors and a super soundtrack composed by recently deceased Bernando Bonezzi . Bonezzi composes an excellent score in HitchcockBernard Herrmann style . Furthermore  a colorful and evocative cinematography by Juan Amoros . Rating  Better than average Spanish thriller  you will be glad to saw it . The picture will appeal to Javier BardemVictoria Abril fans . The movie won several Prizes and Nominations such as  Berlin International Film Festival 1999 Nominated Golden Berlin Bear Manuel Gmez Pereira  Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival 1999  Won Citizen's Choice Award Manuel Gmez Pereira and Turia Awards  Won Turia Award  Best Actor Carmelo Gmez .The motion picture was well written and directed by Manuel Gomez Pereira . He usually writes his films and occasionally for other directors as What Makes Women Laugh? by Joaquin Oristell who in Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health is screenwriter and producer  both of them are ordinary collaborators . Pereira is an expert on comedies as Rose sauce Why do they call it love when they mean sex ? Mouth to mouth  All Men Are the Same  though he also has made some drama as The hanged man and this Between your legs . His latest projects however tanked as Off Key starred by an Americanall star cast but was a failure both economically and artistically or simply didn't deliver as Atrvete y Vers . Nowadays  he directs TV chapters as Gran Reserva and Cheers series .".

It kept me interested for almost two hours.  I may not have got it right but there were multiple plot layers that dovetailed without the insulting forecasting which is generally evident in American movies.  And like I hinted maybe my advantage was that I did a kind of speed listen instead of listening to every word. And the  male lead did an equally great job.Loved it tremendously.

What it is is nicely executed and confusing.It owes something to Hitchcock from the credits which resemble those of Saul Bass to the lush orchestral score which borrows heavily from Bernard Herrmann chiefly Vertigo and Taxi Driver. I was half hoping for a lot of the disgusting gratuitous nudity that everyone complains about an it opens promisingly enough  a group therapy meeting of sex addicts in which everyone has a different story. Among the group's member are Javier Bardem and Victoria Avril. Avril's story is that as a young girl she helped a butcher tie the knot in his tie just before his wedding. He became excited and balled her three times in the back of the butcher shop. Everything smelled of meat. Since then she's had one affair after another even though she's married to a police officer Carmelo Gomez. I forget what Bardem's story was but it couldn't have been as interesting.Then all sorts of tsuris follows. I frankly was lost. Bardem has a problem with some kind of illegal tapes  or something. The few clips we see don't look very illegal. One shows an ordinary boxing match. A dead body turns up in the trunk of an unused car in the front seat of which Bardem and Avril have been spontaneously coupling so we're told. We don't see anything. Avril's husband the cop is trying to track down the murderer and after discovering his wife's affair with Bardem does all he can to pin it on Bardem. It leads to some tense moments.I don't think I'll describe the resolution. At least I understood it I think. I still don't know exactly how or why it reaches the point it does but I'm sure of one thing  it does reach that point.Bardem is pretty good. I'd only seen him as the coldblooded hit man in No Country For Old Men. In that essay he spoke slowly with a slight gargle in his voice his face expressionless his hair combed slantwise over his forehead his big dark eyes dominating his features. Here he's a rather ordinary screenplay writer who speaks at a normal tempo and looks like anybody else. I was impressed by the difference in his approach to the two contrasting roles. It's what's meant by range in acting.Victoria Avril is now middle aged no longer the young lady of Tie Me Up Tie Me Down but she's still beautifully and unwittingly sexy. She wears a semistartled expression throughout as if she were a frightened bird in a cage. It suits the role.There are still several points some of them important that I'm unclear on but I've taken steps to correct this by enrolling in a therapy group that promises to promote viewer comprehension.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of this film is ultimately undecipherable. You'll have more luck figuring out Finnegan's Wake. Were I to see this film several more times I still would not be able to determine what is reality what is fantasy what is taking place in real time what is taking place in imaginative time. There are flashbacks within flashbacks until chaos reigns. Entire plot lines such as that of Jareo are unrelated to others. The opening sequence will certainly draw you into the film but it has virtually nothing to do with the main characters in the film. Both Javier and Felix could be described as the film's protagonist whose story is this? I can't imagine that many people would stay with the film more than twenty minutes thirty minutes at the most. I stayed with the film naively thinking that in the denouement all of the pieces of plot would come clear. Unfortunately this is not the case.The revelation made in the climax about the character Jacinto is something most viewers will probably be able to predict from the moment Jacinto first comes unto the screen. I agree with another commentator here watch the Adam's apple. This character transformation shall I say? has been used in a number of films. And the plot device of having someone get away with murder has become ordinary. Just as in Woody Allen's new film Match Point a coincidence here allows the real killer to go uncharged with the crime.The credits are a direct steal from Saul Bass's credits from Vertigo and the music is imitative of Bernard Herrmann's score for the same film which led me to expect something far more than this film delivers.Save yourself a rental fee and a headache as well.".

Were I to see this film several more times I still would not be able to determine what is reality what is fantasy what is taking place in real time what is taking place in imaginative time. There are flashbacks within flashbacks until chaos reigns. Entire plot lines such as that of Jareo are unrelated to others. The opening sequence will certainly draw you into the film but it has virtually nothing to do with the main characters in the film. Both Javier and Felix could be described as the film's protagonist whose story is this? I can't imagine that many people would stay with the film more than twenty minutes thirty minutes at the most. I stayed with the film naively thinking that in the denouement all of the pieces of plot would come clear. Unfortunately this is not the case.The revelation made in the climax about the character Jacinto is something most viewers will probably be able to predict from the moment Jacinto first comes unto the screen. I agree with another commentator here watch the Adam's apple. This character transformation shall I say? has been used in a number of films. And the plot device of having someone get away with murder has become ordinary. Just as in Woody Allen's new film Match Point a coincidence here allows the real killer to go uncharged with the crime.The credits are a direct steal from Saul Bass's credits from Vertigo and the music is imitative of Bernard Herrmann's score for the same film which led me to expect something far more than this film delivers.Save yourself a rental fee and a headache as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "I made the mistake of going to see this movie first show first day in the theater in 1997 when it was released. The first movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it was fun. I expected more with the 2nd. The only thing I knew about it going in was that James Remar was replacing Christopher Lambert as Rayden which I was upset about but I thought Remar would do a good job.Boy was I wrong. The whole cast even Robin Shou who was decent in the 1st and great in Beverly Hills Ninja can't seem to act his way out of a paper bag in this one. Mega Spoilers Cause You Shouldn't See This Movie Anyway The big mistake the writers made with this movie was trying to incorporate all of the characters even the hidden ones from not just Mortal Kombat 2 but Mortal Kombat 3 as well. The plot is taken from the MK3 video game. MK1 survived multiple heroes because there were only 3 a trio a team and their teacher Raiden. And only 2 bad guys Goro Shang Tsung. In MK2 we have a virtual plethora of heroes and baddies.Heroes 8 Liu KangRaydenKitanaSonyaJaxJohnny CageNightwolfSub ZeroBaddies 14 Shao Kahn Shinnok Sindel Motaro Jade Sheeva Cyrax Scorpion Noob Saibot Ermac Rain Baraka Smoke and Mileena.Yeah I thought that was a lot too. All of these characters have lines andor fight scenes too. This doesn't even include the characters from the games that are mentioned but not shown. A bunch of these baddies and even some heroes die or just leave never to return in about a minute after they appear. For instance here's the plot of some of the sub charactersRain Says hi gets thrown into a fiery pit.Sub Zero Shows up says hi fights and kills botty Smoke tells Liu Kang you are not ready then disappears never to be heard from again. Smoke Killed within a 2 minutes by aforementioned Sub Zero.Baraka er.. I think you see him.. once.Mileena Shows up attacks Sonya somehow dies from a bonk on the head.Scorpion Shows up fights SubZero kidnaps Kitana disappears.Johnny Cage Shows up says hi Shao Kahn breaks his neck a good minute into the movie. Sheeva Has a few lines early Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.Those are just some examples. On top of these character issues the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take. There are literally tons of continuity and placement errors. A few quick examples all from the same 10 minute stretchRayden leaves Sonya and tells her to find her buddy Jaz then to head to The Temple of the Elder Gods. Of course after she finds Jax she immediately knows where it is.When we first meet His Jaxness himself he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax. We pan away with his fist somehow stuck in a wall with a good inch of space around it. We pan back a few seconds later and his entire arm is stuck in the wall.Sonya gets into a muddy fanservice fight with Mileena. After a muddy battle and a split scene later all her clothes have somehow been drycleaned.During aforementioned Muddy FanService fight Sonya gets thrown into a rock. This big rock about 10 times the size of her waggles and moves a bit with her weight falling on it. Again those are just some examples but they're rampant in the movie. As for the plot well the idea and premise is interesting but they delve way too deep into it. It would have been better if they kept it superficial the way they did in the first movie. But no they had to try to explain everything life existence the tournament and why the toast always lands butter side down.The result of all this atrocity is a corny poorly directed aterribly written underbudgeted looks like most of the stuff I could have pulled off with my home computer nightmare that's worth buying solely to laugh at. 010".

	schema:headline " Oh I'll tell you how bad this movie is allright";
	schema:reviewBody "You know I really liked the original Mortal Kombat. Sure they ripped off the premise from another movie but at least it was good Enter the Dragon. I loved the games until the 4th one and was widely known as being one of its best and most devoted followers. So maybe all this is why my thengirlfriend's idiot stoner brother told me that he heard this movie was incredible and I excitedly went to see it.I'm a patient guy and I have almost never felt the urge to walk out of a movie due to boredom Tank Girl is the only other one I recall. But MKA here is a joke. If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.Here's one right off the bat. MKA isn't a sequel proper to the original Mortal Kombat. The original MK was reasonably based on the first game. A couple future characters made cameos but that's it. So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game the one most fans widely regard to be the best. But whereas the MK film was made at the time that part 2 was yielding to part 3 a lot changed in the extra couple years it took for this film sequel. As MK the movie was leaving theaters MK3 the game was getting kind of a lukewarm reception and people got sicker and sicker of it by the time MK4 came out. By now the games were in 3d and the storyline had gone from basic Enter the Dragon tournaments to all out apocalyptic robot wars and sorcerors controlling the fates of a bunch of new generic characters. Until its decent reinventing in 2002 the MK games had hit a rough and oversaturated spot and would take 5 years to bounce back.So here in this worst time comes MKA which skips the best chapter of the games entirely and jumps in at sort of a story junction between the 3rd and 4th games the worst.  So we have characters from all 4 games running around and interacting which is goofy as it is and things get worse when sense is tried to be made of it. For example spoiler in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage a main character and semihero of the first movie is summarily and unceremoniously killed off. My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.Soon after more spoilers. In fact there will be several so if you continue do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA robots from game 3 come in negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero a character killed in the first movie.  Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.Making things moe complicated is that elder God Raiden played by Christopher Lambert in the original is here played by someone else and seems to not want to fight at all as the character has gone from wizardly power god to short haired weasely Power Rangers nerd giving up his immortality in the process and teaching our heroes a thing or two about friendship and courage.  Huh?Sticking things out unfortunately for them are Robin Shou and Talisia Soto who play central characters Liu Kang and Kitana and who've returned from the original film. This time neither of them are allowed to do anything much more than look shocked at the stupid story developments and Liu Kang engages in a few fights that capture none of the magic or uniqueness of the original film. And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember. In the original the fights were well choreographed and showcased a good selection of acrobatic and martial arts skill. Action was conveyed through close combat good angles and lengthy tradeoffs. And at the very least there was a genuine moment or two where one might say wow that was a cool move!. This time a lot of the action is illusional with the camera making quick cuts and sudden moves to sort of convey that stuff is going on. There's nary an actual handto hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds and when you see what else was thrown in instead you'll want to kill someone yourself.For example remember the character Baraka with his beast face and bladed arms? He's here and in fact is joined by several identical others who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a highflying trapeze act straight out of the circus.  And what about Sheeva 4armed character that should have been the answer to decently done Goro 4armed creature of the original film? Well whereas he was conveyed through puppeteering and animatronics here Sheeva is played by a tall woman in generic spandex who tries to look menacing and does a couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms.Things don't pick up later on when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf who explains that Liu must harness his animality to succeed. Anyone familiar with the MK universe knows that the animality was a ridiculous player rumor which supposed that the MK games contained a method of killing one's opponent by turning into an animal and committing not a fatality but an animality. This dumb rumor was added to the 3rd game as fan service and apparently delighted the producers of this film enough that it was actually explained as a real feasible occurence. Feel your animality N.Wolf says to Liu urging him to harness the beast within. Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it and then askspretty cool huh?We who haven't left the room yet are saying no but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise. At the end of the film Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy er Shao Kahn and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant god awful stupid computergenerated beasts who do combat with each other. No I mean it.  They turn into giant computer animated beasts. And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here I mean big shiny plasticylooking we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eyestrainingly obvious effects. Liu Kang could reasonably have turned into a cool chinese dragon or something but instead winds up being this bignosed cross eyed dopey dragon thing. Shao Kahn turns into something equally ridiculous and less memorable and the two have it out. Then at the last minute Shao Kahn's sorceror dad decides he's gone too far disgraced the family name by becoming a crappy visual effect and makes him disappear or something. Then everyone hugs and more or less runs far far away.I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film because I actually haven't seen it in several years. I don't hate myself enough to watch it more than that. But if you want an actual review without the sarcasm just look at it this way It is an insult to the MK franchise and its fans it fails as a followup to the fun original MK film it fails TERRIBLY as a martial arts film and in general it just is a dumb waste of time an arbitrary throwntogether cashin sequel. Do yourself a favor and just watch the original and if you still crave more go play the games. And if you do insist on seeing this movie then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.".

For example spoiler in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage a main character and semihero of the first movie is summarily and unceremoniously killed off. My guess for this is because he wasn't in the 3rd game.Soon after more spoilers. In fact there will be several so if you continue do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA robots from game 3 come in negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero a character killed in the first movie.  Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.Making things moe complicated is that elder God Raiden played by Christopher Lambert in the original is here played by someone else and seems to not want to fight at all as the character has gone from wizardly power god to short haired weasely Power Rangers nerd giving up his immortality in the process and teaching our heroes a thing or two about friendship and courage.  Huh?Sticking things out unfortunately for them are Robin Shou and Talisia Soto who play central characters Liu Kang and Kitana and who've returned from the original film. This time neither of them are allowed to do anything much more than look shocked at the stupid story developments and Liu Kang engages in a few fights that capture none of the magic or uniqueness of the original film. And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember. In the original the fights were well choreographed and showcased a good selection of acrobatic and martial arts skill. Action was conveyed through close combat good angles and lengthy tradeoffs. And at the very least there was a genuine moment or two where one might say wow that was a cool move!. This time a lot of the action is illusional with the camera making quick cuts and sudden moves to sort of convey that stuff is going on. There's nary an actual handto hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds and when you see what else was thrown in instead you'll want to kill someone yourself.For example remember the character Baraka with his beast face and bladed arms? He's here and in fact is joined by several identical others who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a highflying trapeze act straight out of the circus.  And what about Sheeva 4armed character that should have been the answer to decently done Goro 4armed creature of the original film? Well whereas he was conveyed through puppeteering and animatronics here Sheeva is played by a tall woman in generic spandex who tries to look menacing and does a couple unthreatening hops with her cheesy extra special effect arms.Things don't pick up later on when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf who explains that Liu must harness his animality to succeed. Anyone familiar with the MK universe knows that the animality was a ridiculous player rumor which supposed that the MK games contained a method of killing one's opponent by turning into an animal and committing not a fatality but an animality. This dumb rumor was added to the 3rd game as fan service and apparently delighted the producers of this film enough that it was actually explained as a real feasible occurence. Feel your animality N.Wolf says to Liu urging him to harness the beast within. Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it and then askspretty cool huh?We who haven't left the room yet are saying no but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise. At the end of the film Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy er Shao Kahn and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant god awful stupid computergenerated beasts who do combat with each other. No I mean it.  They turn into giant computer animated beasts. And we're not talking about Gollum of the Lord of the Rings here I mean big shiny plasticylooking we know we want to make big magical creatures but don't yet have the technology to do anything but make them eyestrainingly obvious effects. Liu Kang could reasonably have turned into a cool chinese dragon or something but instead winds up being this bignosed cross eyed dopey dragon thing. Shao Kahn turns into something equally ridiculous and less memorable and the two have it out. Then at the last minute Shao Kahn's sorceror dad decides he's gone too far disgraced the family name by becoming a crappy visual effect and makes him disappear or something. Then everyone hugs and more or less runs far far away.I hope that this has been an accurate rendering of what my feelings are for this film because I actually haven't seen it in several years. I don't hate myself enough to watch it more than that. But if you want an actual review without the sarcasm just look at it this way It is an insult to the MK franchise and its fans it fails as a followup to the fun original MK film it fails TERRIBLY as a martial arts film and in general it just is a dumb waste of time an arbitrary throwntogether cashin sequel. Do yourself a favor and just watch the original and if you still crave more go play the games. And if you do insist on seeing this movie then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.";

Perhaps the worst thing is the fight at the end with the two really bad CG animalities a cheesy idea from the game that should have stayed in the game.

That is undebatably true of Annihilation but that was also true with the first Mortal Kombat movie and that was a great movie.  The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes.  MK had some terrific fight scenes such as the brilliant CageScorpion fight in the forest the great Liu KangSubZero fight and the cool finale with Shang Tsung.  Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three many of the fight scenes made no sense and the finale was horrible.  In addition some things in Annihilation I would really like an explanation forWhy did Raiden dress up like Aladdin half way through the movie?  Was looking like a complete dork part of becoming mortal?  And where was Christopher Lambert anyway?What was the third test?  Where did that Wolfguy go?  What happened to SubZero?Why did they do that stupid thing with Jax' bionic arms?  Stupid movies should admit they are stupid movies.  Stupid movies which try to have serious elemends become bad movies.Same deal with Katana's mother.What was point of that huge monster that came out of nowhere to attack Sonya then immediately went back to it's whole when Jax hit it on the head? Was it a whackamole?How is it that Sonya and Jade began to fight IN A DESERT and they immediately fell into a mud pit?Why did Smoke maticulously break every window in that random building before fighting Sonya and Jax?What was the point of having Liu Kang turn into a dragon?  He just turned into a human again without having done anything effective as a dragon.  How was that useful?Why didn't they spend more then 80 on the special effects for that dragon?  I could do better then that with miniatures and clay animation.How is it that this movie could have been made so badly with such bad cinematography and such pathetic martial arts effects after the first one was so good?".

The first Mortal Kombat was such a fun high action packed film that was just a great time. I still watch it like crazy today it's got so much energy and makes me want to play the game again and again. So since the first film was a success naturally they were going to make a sequel and they did manage to mess this one up badly. I'll start with the plot first and explain in a moment all the badness that is the mess.The evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld to the Earthrealm and has reclaimed his queen Sindel who is Kitana's longdead mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days a fate which Liu Kang and the others must fight to prevent. Sonya enlists the help of her old partner Jax  while Kitana and Liu Kang search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf  who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu Kang dispatch him with the aid of SubZero but Scorpion suddenly appears attacks SubZero and kidnaps Kitana. Now Liu must save her as well as Earth from Kahn who wishes to blend the realms together.I'm sure you've read and heard it before but in case you haven't and you're reading my comment first for some reason to find out what makes this a bad movie well read away. First off what bad replacements for the actors Sonja Johnny Cage Rayden. They don't look anything like the original actors it was just bad. The acting is horrible like really bad like they went to the Keanu Reeves school of acting bad. The special effects are something that could be easily done on an elementary school computer. The editing is too fast and gives you a massive headache.There's a mud wrestling match between Sonja and Mileena which I'm sure the director was telling them it was for the cool effect of the fight while I'm sure he was playing with his stick shift behind the camera while this was going on. There is no explanation for why Scorpion and Sub Zero are back except that Sub Zero is Sub Zero's brother yet they have the same names? Doesn't make much sense does it? The fight scenes are so badly put together there's a scene where the ninjas look like they're doing ballet not fighting. Rayden spends so much time talking to the group and finally when he has a chance to fight he bows out like a coward.Yeah that's just some of the film that I'm describing. Scary sounding isn't it? I don't know what they were thinking when they thought that this was OK to put in the theaters. The first film was a lot of fun it stuck true to the video games and is one of the best video game movies of all time. This just happened to have the characters in a crappy Mortal Kombat plot that made no sense. Just skip this movie it's just horrible.110".

	schema:reviewBody "I shan't start off by saying I used to be an MK fan because whenever I read those I want to fetch my violin and start playing. I enjoyed playing the games but was never that into them. Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat to be fairly entertaining. Mild stuff really verging on almost could be cool if... A real four stars out of ten fiasco but one that wouldn't offend.MKA however became a pastime for us at University when we were in that frame of mind to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film. It is tragic. Enough said. This film has nothing going for it. Everything has taken a step backwards.The special effects are woeful. Instead of three characters with mild indepth studies they jetisoned that for seven main characters each with their own personal demons to overcome. Riveting. The script is what I have the most problem with. Pour example1 A new Raiden. Lambert gave the role some credibility in the original and was responsible for giving MK a moderate turn over. Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second. So inevitably they had to bring in someone else. The audience knows this. The actors know this. The writers know this. But please don't have the character you created know this. He's supposed to be the same person so to have him say i've had a haircut rar rar is a tragic way of saying i know i'm not lambert so I did something different. 2 Robin Shao...Oh Robin. Many nights have been wiled away laughing at his demise from ewokian heights. A tragic actor only in for his mild kungfu knowledge on the premise he could act. Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun. In this one he's supposed to hold it all together...and fails miserably. To be fair again however he has no script with which to work. At one moment before the final confrontation it is claimed Lui Kang is the only one left who can defeat Shao Khan. So your characters mantra is i want to do it but i'm not ready and you layer over that with dialogue meanings symbolism action etc etc...you don't have your character say those words!!! Talk about a mickey mouse operation. The writers obviously fed up at this point that their obvious talents were wasted on this low budget tripe so just had the character say it so they could invariably fit in more action sequences. 3 Far too many to go into. The fact that everything is figured out so matter of factly. Raiden figures out the prophecy don't ask was a lie. Surely not??? So to explain this travesty of events he claims they must of lied to me. Bravo. Many nights burning the midnight oil for that one huh? It is all too it is so because it is soThe special effects truly are tragic. The only ones in the original were Sub Zero's Ice Blast which in fairness was quite tastefully done if you are a hardcore fan. Scorpions get over here which is always a crowd favourite. Reptile and Lui Kangs dragon punch goro was Plasticine. But here they've wanted to go over the top with not nearly enough money. Sindels spinning to escape is woeful. Scorpions get over here is a pitiful remake which also reminds me Sub and Scorp are back the two greatest characters ever and yet they're midgets. About half the size from the original looks as if they've been on three simultaneous atkins diets and everything else is shambolic.The action skips from one scene to the next but nothing grabs the eye. Raidens fight against three reptile is the closest thing to stylish or anyway near the premise of cool. But it is still a long way away. To dispense with the formalities. This film sucks Donkey Balls...and yet I know so much about it...oh the pain..".

As said before Raiden goes from the Thunder God to a weeping coward. The new Liu Kang is nowhere near as good as the one in the original movie. Not to mention the fact that half of the new actors such as the actor who portrayed Shao Kahn were nowhere near good enough to play a character in a franchise such as Mortal Kombat.Another problem I had with this movie is its inconsistency with the game. For instance it is revealed that Raiden and Shao Kahn are brothers and Shinnok is their father.There is also the issue that the movie seemed a bit rushed. The reason it was rushed as I can see is to cram as many characters as possible into the movie to properly represnt the game. Ermac served no purpose nor did Rain. Ermac is one of my favorite characters in the game and to see him in the movie as a 2 minute segment which ends with him being quickly killed off does not satisfy me.I would give this movie a 3 out of 10 simply because although it was lackluster was based on Mortal Kombat and I will grant it something for that.".

It's amazing that this piece of childish Saturdaymorningcartoon plotless nonsense could come out of that. I mean after all look at the first movie it wasn't so bad. Not GOOD but not BAD either. They utterly ignored the ScorpionSubZero feud they killed Kano off far too early the last scene was totally out of place and the Goro effects were awful but other than that it was okay.But MKA is an insult to every longstanding fan of the games. Hey Hollywood moviemakers take note gamers are not ALL illiterate bloodthirsty sexcrazed teens who are so stupid they'll love anything with loud noises people fighting chicks in tight clothes and lots of pretty colors.MKA loosely follows the backstory of the third MK game which saw Outworld emperor Shao Kahn take over Earth by using a cosmic loophole to reincarnate his queen Sindel. Not Oscarwinning stuff for sure but it could have been done with SOME class and style. And it wasn't. What we got was a little bald Shao Kahn about as menacing as Big Bird a bunch of insipid crap that had NOTHING to do with the games family crest tattoos anyone? and not even a halfway serious attempt at creating a plot or story.This isn't so much a movie as it is a long strungtogether series of arcade game matches played out by actors OTHER than the ones who were digitized into the actual games. Scorpion appears then Sub Zero. Subby beats Ol' Yellow Drawers off hastily explains that he is the younger brother of the original Sub Zero does some freezing tricks and then we see no more of him it's on to the next match. And on we go ... Characters are trotted in a pathetic completely unexciting fight ensues one character is promptly killed or removed in some way Repeat step 1. Play MK Trilogy for two hours straight sometime it's not only the exact same experience as MKA  it's BETTER.And it gets worse. It really does. I don't know how but it does. Which brings me to the Animalities. Most fans I've talked to agree and so do I that this was one of the lamest things ever introduced in the games and lo and behold the filmmakers fell on it and INCLUDED it in the movie making for some incredibly cheesy and badly animated monster battles. Liu Kang and Shao Kahn turning into Godzillastyle creatures? Come on. The mud wrestling match between Sonya and Mileena was better than that. And THAT was pretty pathetic too.Other wonderful features of the film include Sonya's miraculous ability to become squeakyclean  complete with a lush mane of blowdried hair  after suffering that mudbath. And while the filmmakers I use the term loosely mindlessly crammed in small story tidbits from the game with no attempt to make a story out of them they studiously ignored Kabal and Stryker  both of whom would have made for some GREAT material  by having somebody casually mention that they'd both been captured. Then its back to the mindless series of matches.And to those of you who may say chill out it's not meant to be taken seriously I say this even though that may be true you should still expect a certain level of intelligence in plot and story. This movie has not one shred of anything even approaching intelligent writing. Look at how good the XMen flick was  who'd have thought a story about a bunch of comicbook mutants could be pulled off so well? MKA could've been as good and it bugs me that it wasn't. I live in fear of the next MK movie...".

	schema:reviewBody "The Appaloosa is a superior lowkey western with a great performance by Marlon Brando and very good ones by John Saxon and Anjanette Comer. Brando plays a white man raised by Mexicans who returns from the Civil War tired of killing and ready to build a ranch around one Appaloosa stallion. Brando has the misfortune of becoming a tool for Comer to escape the clutches of Saxon. Saxon retaliates by stealing Brando's stallion and Brando follows Saxon into Mexico to reclaim it. Director Sidney J. Furie The Ipcress File Iron Eagle extensively uses extreme closeups of faces in the same manner as Sergio Leone but not for the same purpose. Furie uses these closeups to establish intimacy between the characters and the audience. This works beautifully in The Appaloosa particularly so since the story is so unremarkable and lowkey and Brando's character is by no means a superman. Most of the violence is of the G rated variety with the notable exception of a handwrestling contest played with the addition of scorpions.While the ending of The Appaloosa is as abrupt and unremarkable as everything that precedes intimate moments in the movie linger long after. As exampleso Brando's confessional o The little girl telling Brando he smells like a goat o The goat herder telling Brando about Saxon's gunmen killing his pet goat o Comer telling Brando her fate if he doesn't help her escape Saxon o The handwrestling contestThere are many more unremarkable but somehow memorable moments in the sublime Appaloosa. It is too insignificant to be great but it most certainly very good. I give The Appaloosa an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another film from Brando's lean years now I only have THE UGLY American 1963 also included in Universal's The Marlon Brando Franchise Collection to watch from this period  but all in all it's an underrated phase for the celebrated method actor. Incidentally it was nice to see such longterm Universal regulars as composer Frank Skinner SON OF FRANKENSTEIN 1939 editor Ted Kent BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 and makeup man Bud Westmore ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN 1948 still involved in high profile productions such as this one after all those years. Anyway Brando made only three Westerns in his career  the others being the selfdirected ONE EYED JACKS 1961 and Arthur Penn's THE MISSOURI BREAKS 1976  but they're among the more intriguing if pretentious from their respective eras having said that the film under review is easily the least rewarding of the three.The simple plot finds aspiring rancher Brando falling foul of smalltime Mexican tyrant John Saxon over the former's appaloosa stallion later on Saxon's girl Anjanette Comer  who does what she can with a basically underwritten role  becomes the object of contention between the two beaten up by Saxon's men and his prize horse stolen Brando follows in pursuit  ignoring the advise of friend Rafael Campos and a goat herder Frank Silvera he encounters on the way.

	onyx:emotionText "Yet another film from Brando's lean years now I only have THE UGLY American 1963 also included in Universal's The Marlon Brando Franchise Collection to watch from this period  but all in all it's an underrated phase for the celebrated method actor. Incidentally it was nice to see such longterm Universal regulars as composer Frank Skinner SON OF FRANKENSTEIN 1939 editor Ted Kent BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 and makeup man Bud Westmore ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN 1948 still involved in high profile productions such as this one after all those years. Anyway Brando made only three Westerns in his career  the others being the selfdirected ONE EYED JACKS 1961 and Arthur Penn's THE MISSOURI BREAKS 1976  but they're among the more intriguing if pretentious from their respective eras having said that the film under review is easily the least rewarding of the three.The simple plot finds aspiring rancher Brando falling foul of smalltime Mexican tyrant John Saxon over the former's appaloosa stallion later on Saxon's girl Anjanette Comer  who does what she can with a basically underwritten role  becomes the object of contention between the two beaten up by Saxon's men and his prize horse stolen Brando follows in pursuit  ignoring the advise of friend Rafael Campos and a goat herder Frank Silvera he encounters on the way. Reaching the town where Saxon lives with his band of cutthroats Brando tries to pass himself off as a local by affecting a silly Mexican accent whose inspiration seems to have been Speedy Gonzales! it doesn't take long for Saxon to discover his ruse and when he does challenges the star to a game of armwrestling with a sting in its tail!

These movies exists only around Brando and Hopkins explained well that they are iconic movies movies enlivened by Brando's iconic presence and whims and antics if you like  egotistical performances meant to startle and to amaze. The script is smashed and if Appaloosa is indeed powerfully dramatic it's because of Brando's guts. Acts of courage of egotism a narcissistic cinema unfortunately sabotaged or denied by the '60s Hollywood industry come to think of it Gabin Grant and others were accorded what Brando needed tooa celebratory cinema intended to exploit an actor's unusual energy and iconic glow. This is Brando exploitation. Movies like this one are designed as cultfilms and this seems their primary significance. On a large scale this was done in the generous era of cinemathe era of true stardom. Gabin Bogart Garboand before them the true stars of the silent cinema fully benefited from this. Brando like Newman came too late when the cult meant a rather small niche and such a strategy was possible only in the B cinema see the Bronson file or the Italian genre actors .Here as the gringo Brando is again largerthanlife the theme of the humiliated and wronged man can be superficially traced through some famous westerns like LARAMIE and that already mentioned above ONE EYED but is it any good?

In the final duel Brando uses with the same delighted nonchalance his obvious clumsinesshe used his hands in a bizarre way and this somehow boosts his character enhances if not the realism then the attractiveness of a scene.When we avidly watch Brando are we really in for realism performing credibly average unobtrusive people? Brando always strivesif he did it at allto play interesting dashing intriguing charactersnot pedestrians. First of all a realist performance presupposes a realist script and realist intentions. Brando naturally enjoys to fascinate and to startle. He offers highvoltage fancy. Of course his beautifully made characters are realbecause he created them not because they are realistic to a grand degree. Was he ever required realism? Whose realism or realism according to whom? In his westerns too he is not trying to give realistic performances the way Duvall Costner Eastwood Hackman Caan with the adequate scripts and parts triedand largely succeeded too. Dean Nicholson De Niro and maybe even Clift aimed sometimes at achieving realist performances not Brando not Pacino who characteristically subordinate the parts to their energies and personalities and even playfulness.Gabin was seldom realist in his performances and he was seldom solicited required to be realist.Some mistake a certain intensity for realism but first of all let us inquire if a certain movie or script requires or at least admits realism and to what degree.".

I leave it to your own judgment but personally I think Saxon won the prize.Not Brando at his finest by any means.";

While Brando was minding his business before being drawn into conflict the theft of his horse occurs while he is drunk and unable handle the situation and he seems to be inept. It is a long scene and one that ends in humiliation for Brando's character. Even if a 1950s hero was caught off guard while being drunk he wasn't humiliated. A 1950s hero would not appear inept just that he had made a mistake that allowed the bad guy to get the upper hand.There are other instances in the film where Brando's character doesn't act as a 1950s hero his ridiculous Mexican accent his initial plan at the gang's hideout to leave with his horse his armwrestling scene his reluctance to take revenge. Brando's character was more in style of the 60s maketheheromorerealistic and less largerthanlife. He doesn't win all the battles. There is nothing wrong with this as long as you interested in watching this.I was fine with it. I did like the final gun battle as it was different from the usual facetoface shootout.I had problems with Brando's mumbling. His character didn't seem laconic but someone who couldn't express himself. While he did have some good lines other times he seemed to ramble.The in disguise at the bar scene should have been cut. The conversation left me confused and the fake Mexican accent was irritating. This scene only served to introduce one of the outlaw gang members and could have been done another way.I enjoyed the scenery that Brando's character was a religious man without it being central to the movie his intelligence in the final gun battle and the motivations being believable for the conflict the bad guy's pride and standing before his gang and Brando's need for this horse in his future plans.".

Brando plays the Eastwoodtype lead so well that you start to wonder if he may well have made an even better Man with no Name than Clint had the role come his way. John Saxon works hard to make his evil Mexican work and does reasonably well. However the potential to develop the psychotic aspects of the character which is strongly indicated in the early part of the film isn't given sufficient attention by the director in succeeding reels. It needs to be made more clear that Chuy is crazy as well as bad.Saxon's character definitely deserves a very sticky end and by halfway through the film we really need to see this guy get it. However just being picked off from a distance with a rifle is somewhat disappointing for the audience and even Brando and the girl seem a little let down. Sergio Leone would no doubt have laid on something considerably more sanguine and theatrical.Banditto specialist Emilio Fernandez and Alex Montoya give really excellent villainy support and are both duly dispatched by Brando in the usual way. Anjanjette Comer is a little miscast in the difficult role of Chuy Medina's unwilling chattel. I really think she needed and the audience expects for her to be able to terminate a few pistoleros on her own account instead of just being a passive damsel in distress and leaving all the rough stuff to Marlon.The director makes good use of closeups of faces eyes and heaters but tends not to develop some of the scenes sufficiently. The exception to this would be the scorpionassisted armwrestle which was very effective. Come to think of it the whole film tended to go off the boil after this scene leading to a conclusion which was not really a stylistic match to the rest of the film. Would have worked better for me if Brando's character had returned home a with the horse but without the girlfriend b with the girl but minus the horse or c with both but dying from wounds received in the big gundown. Option b probably the best. That way he would have to spend the rest of his life raising a dozen kids and shooing bugs out of the cornfield instead of becoming an asshole rancher and making money. Not too bad but could have been much better. As it stands the film tends to be neither fish nor feather residing stylistically somewhere between the traditional western the interpretations of Leone and the continental directors and the classic mayhem in Mexico works of Sam Peckinpah.Emilio Fernandez went on to play the memorable badass Generalissimo Mapache in Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch for which his role in The Appaloosa  was no doubt a good preparation.R.

But Furie seems to think he is Orson Welles and you sense that Brando thinks the director is as well. Up close and personal camera work and angled shots are clearly meant to infuse picture with sweaty claustrophobia and psychological smarts but they just come off as being in the wrong film since story just isn't that interesting to begin with and many scenes just taper off into nothing.Metty's Technicolor photography is most appealing at what looks to me like Durango Mexico further adding irritants that the picture as a whole is not better. Rest of the cast are fine with the Latino actors holding their own with their parts of an uninspiring script and Saxon turns in a good one as a bandido bastard. An arm wrestling scene over a scorpion is genuine class and tension driven while the snow capped final shootout is not without merit.

Firstly the bad costume makeup jobs particularly Brando's face during the films first scenes is horrendous and amplified by the large number of closeups I had to endure. I understand that this has to do with the quality of makeup available when the film was made but its still startling and I wonder if this would have been noticed in 1966.

	schema:headline " Currently underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to go back to being somewhat of a contrarian on this one. The consensus is that Go West is passable at least but not one of the better Marx Brothers films. Tied up with that is the fact that Go West is a latecareer Marx Brothers film. It's in their MGM period which many fans consider not as good as their earlier Paramount period. They were all around 50 years old while shooting this one. The followup was The Big Store 1941 after which they announced that they were officially retiring as a comedy team. They ended up doing a couple more films together in the 1940sA Night in Casablanca 1946 and Love Happy 1949 but the conventional wisdom has it that those were provoked more by a need to pay for Chico's gambling debts than they were by a desire to make a film together which is not to say that they're not good films.For me however Go West is another excellent entry in a long string of Marx Brothers films that are primarily 10 out of 10s. Maybe it's that I'm also a big fan of westerns but this western spoof is sublimely enjoyable. Western parodies were big in 1940 the year of Go West's first release its wide release came in 1941 with W.C. Fields' My Little Chickadee premiering in February and Jack Benny's Buck Benny Rides Again opening in May. Perhaps because of that climate Go West did better critically and popularly when it opened than would be indicated by its current middling reputation. But as with anything there is a lot of crowd following in opinions on films. The consensus tends to evolve over time despite the fact that the films themselves do not change.Go West has Groucho Marx in his usual huckster mode as S. Quentin Quale. He's short 10 for his train fare to head to the western United States. He spots Joseph Chico Marx and Rusty Panello Harpo Marx takes them for a couple suckers and tries to bilk them of 10. But they're better con artists than he is and end up ripping him off instead.Somehow they all end up out west anyway. Joseph and Rusty come into possession of the deed to Dead Man's Gulch which Terry Turner John Carroll was hoping to sell his grandfather is the one who gave it to Joseph and Rusty to the railroad magnates back east so they can complete the first transcontinental line. Go West ends up being about a number of people attempting to con each other out of money and the deed in a race to see who can get it to New York first.Of course the plot is primarily an excuse for a series of gags. Like usual the comedy in the film is a balance between slapstick and intellectual humor. Appealing to my tastes the Marx Brothers are often surrealistic in their humor as well both verbally and visually. They continually play games with the conventions of film in general and the western in particular making this clear right off the batany pretense at holding the plot supreme is joyously sabotaged in the first 10 minutes when Go West becomes an extended gag instead as the brothers try to bilk each other out of the money needed for train fare. The gag could just as well be set on any stage in any context and work the same. The name of the game is irreverencetowards film towards the genre and towards various other conventions including those they have established for themselves in previous filmsand the Marxes do it as well or better than anyone else.The gags are pleasantly varied but the film has some wonderfully serious moments that work well too. Each brother gets a song and each song is at least semisincere. Chico shows off his skills at the piano eventually playing in the upper registers with a piece of fruit. During a scene where they have to spend the night with an Indian tribe Harpo transforms a loom into a harp and ends up performing a beautiful jazz tune. Groucho plays guitar and gives us slightly bizarre singing that resides somewhere between authentic blues and vaudeville goofiness. Although these moments might at first seem like unwelcome breaks from the otherwise madcap proceedings the songs are magnificent and temporarily become transcendent moments that one wishes wouldn't end.Go West is most famous perhaps for its climactic train sequence and rightfully so. The brothers channel the Keystone Cops and produce an extended series of increasingly outrageous surreal and hilarious stuntsgags. Buster Keaton's infamous film The General 1927 was an obvious influence and in fact Keaton was an uncredited writer for Go West as Keaton was employed as a gag writer for MGM at this time. I don't want to give any of the material away here but it's worth watching the film for the climax alone and in fact during the preVCR days when 8mm home projectors were all the rage the ending of Go West was siphoned off and marketed by itself.The Marx Brothers' performances are fine of course as are all of the technical elements but the rest of the cast is great too. Just watch the subtle range of attitudes that the two villains progress through while chasing the train in their relatively simple cart for example. And of course like always it doesn't hurt that there are beautiful women around even if there not in the film that much.While I agree that Go West is perhaps not the best Marx Brothers film that's only because they have so many 10s that it's too difficult to pick. Even if you end up thinking that it pales compared to their Paramountera work Go West is still worth seeing.".

They ended up doing a couple more films together in the 1940sA Night in Casablanca 1946 and Love Happy 1949 but the conventional wisdom has it that those were provoked more by a need to pay for Chico's gambling debts than they were by a desire to make a film together which is not to say that they're not good films.For me however Go West is another excellent entry in a long string of Marx Brothers films that are primarily 10 out of 10s. Maybe it's that I'm also a big fan of westerns but this western spoof is sublimely enjoyable. Western parodies were big in 1940 the year of Go West's first release its wide release came in 1941 with W.C. Fields' My Little Chickadee premiering in February and Jack Benny's Buck Benny Rides Again opening in May. Perhaps because of that climate Go West did better critically and popularly when it opened than would be indicated by its current middling reputation. But as with anything there is a lot of crowd following in opinions on films. The consensus tends to evolve over time despite the fact that the films themselves do not change.Go West has Groucho Marx in his usual huckster mode as S. Quentin Quale. He's short 10 for his train fare to head to the western United States. He spots Joseph Chico Marx and Rusty Panello Harpo Marx takes them for a couple suckers and tries to bilk them of 10. But they're better con artists than he is and end up ripping him off instead.Somehow they all end up out west anyway. Joseph and Rusty come into possession of the deed to Dead Man's Gulch which Terry Turner John Carroll was hoping to sell his grandfather is the one who gave it to Joseph and Rusty to the railroad magnates back east so they can complete the first transcontinental line. Go West ends up being about a number of people attempting to con each other out of money and the deed in a race to see who can get it to New York first.Of course the plot is primarily an excuse for a series of gags. Like usual the comedy in the film is a balance between slapstick and intellectual humor. Appealing to my tastes the Marx Brothers are often surrealistic in their humor as well both verbally and visually. They continually play games with the conventions of film in general and the western in particular making this clear right off the batany pretense at holding the plot supreme is joyously sabotaged in the first 10 minutes when Go West becomes an extended gag instead as the brothers try to bilk each other out of the money needed for train fare. The gag could just as well be set on any stage in any context and work the same. The name of the game is irreverencetowards film towards the genre and towards various other conventions including those they have established for themselves in previous filmsand the Marxes do it as well or better than anyone else.The gags are pleasantly varied but the film has some wonderfully serious moments that work well too. Each brother gets a song and each song is at least semisincere. Chico shows off his skills at the piano eventually playing in the upper registers with a piece of fruit. During a scene where they have to spend the night with an Indian tribe Harpo transforms a loom into a harp and ends up performing a beautiful jazz tune. Groucho plays guitar and gives us slightly bizarre singing that resides somewhere between authentic blues and vaudeville goofiness. Although these moments might at first seem like unwelcome breaks from the otherwise madcap proceedings the songs are magnificent and temporarily become transcendent moments that one wishes wouldn't end.Go West is most famous perhaps for its climactic train sequence and rightfully so. The brothers channel the Keystone Cops and produce an extended series of increasingly outrageous surreal and hilarious stuntsgags. Buster Keaton's infamous film The General 1927 was an obvious influence and in fact Keaton was an uncredited writer for Go West as Keaton was employed as a gag writer for MGM at this time. I don't want to give any of the material away here but it's worth watching the film for the climax alone and in fact during the preVCR days when 8mm home projectors were all the rage the ending of Go West was siphoned off and marketed by itself.The Marx Brothers' performances are fine of course as are all of the technical elements but the rest of the cast is great too. Just watch the subtle range of attitudes that the two villains progress through while chasing the train in their relatively simple cart for example. And of course like always it doesn't hurt that there are beautiful women around even if there not in the film that much.While I agree that Go West is perhaps not the best Marx Brothers film that's only because they have so many 10s that it's too difficult to pick. Even if you end up thinking that it pales compared to their Paramountera work Go West is still worth seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Brothers' Go West is a vastly underrated gem. Admist a few comparatively disappointing later years Marx movies it was certainly the strongest. I grew up on the Marx Brothers via my father even though most of them were made before he was born as well and ended up liking them so much I eventually bought every movie they made and most of the documentaries three single Groucho movies two sets of 'You Bet Your Life' episodes and even 'The Story of Mankind' featuring the three primary brothers though in small parts in separate segments...Many books by andor about them too. In any case I'm a huge fan. Even with all this I admit that there are a handful of pretty weak Marx films. Love Happy was pretty awful on most levels though little Harpo bits and one or two Groucho lines give it its only very brief redemption. The Big Store was also pretty fairly terrible with again the only worthwhile notes being a few Groucho quips and a few Harpo physical bits. Room Service and At The Circus as well suffered as all their movies after the big MGM ones Opera  races did due to the studios lack of interest and confidence in putting money and attention into the productions. Room Service and At the Circus both felt like they should've and could've been more though each had a handful or more of perfectly enjoyable moments. And rewatching A Night in Casablanca which at least a little more time and money was put into for what she really be considered their true final film rather than the slapped together for quick cash 'Love Happy' which was originally a Harpo solo project I've come to realize that Casablanca is stronger than I remembered but still felt stale for much of it compared to their classics. So I suppose I better get the reason for this review So in the middle of all these lesser like later years fare came Go West in 1940. And I have to say it has gotten an unfair rap from fans critics and Groucho himself though he was that way about much of their movies sadly. I think even with it's slapdash absurdity and overwrought gags that it holds up better and has better more solid comedy than any of they other movies after A Day at the Races. In fact and I know I'm essentially alone in saying this but I actually find it more entertaining than A Day at the Races I think. There are some brilliant momentslines for three brothers that felt more akin to there early madcap movies the best ones and I even enjoy the silly songs and western pastiche elements and the physical gags are stronger than the movies before and after as well. In any case fans and critics too should give it another watch and just let it try to entertain you it really is a lot of fun and hilarious.".

Quale offers a necklace to a beautiful Native American girl but she bluntly replies No like. Want Cadillac Sedan thus forcing Quale to conclude that she has not spent much time on a reservation he then introduces Rusty as the tribe's new totem pole to which Harpo incorporates his ever famous Gookie face.

During the rollicking stagecoach ride a woman complains about the jerks in the coach prompting the Panello brothers to react accordingly. Quale and Joe Panello are hilarious during their offcamera drunken banter while Rusty cracks a safe. Rusty performs a hilarious showdown with Red Baxter Barrat. And finally Nine dollars change please. Whew! I wrote a lot of details about Go West didn't I?

They are not three stooges here. Harpo uses the wheel of the train to sharpen an ax kerosene instead of water is used to douse an engine's fire resulting in it taking off at hyper speed Groucho is buried beneath an avalanche of popcorn put in the train's fire as fuel. Something like watching the train go off the track and then go into a circle as merrygoround music plays just seems like pure Keaton and pure Marx.Although not Duck Soup what is other than Duck Soup? the film to me is the best thing they did between A Night at the Opera and A Night in Casablanca. Groucho's character is more along the lines of his Paramount persona than his avuncular Day at the Races one. He finally seems totally unfettered again. Harpo too is unfettered although maybe it would be better to say unleashed. He's given a large number of bits where he's not depending on Chico or anyone else to bring off the gag.

It has some funny lines and the music is great. If you can not take a joke don't watch again my opinion. These brothers were sooo musically talented it still surprises me when I watch their movies.

That may be so but I found Go West to be hilarious all the same. Which is hardly surprising since nobody does mayhem like the Marx Bros.! As always Groucho has lots of great oneliners Chico plays a charming conman and Harpo gets up to all kinds of anarchic antics. Encountering Groucho for the first time in the train station Chico asks where the train is. Groucho replies It's out on the tracks it seldom comes in here. In previous films the Brothers' made fun of the circus and the opera in this film they play havoc with the conventions of the Old West. On observing a fatal shooting outside a saloon Chico tells Harpo I don't likea the West all the people do is kill each other. I'd likea the West better if it was in the East.In contrast to some of their other films especially At the Circus the musical numbers are delightful and catchy. That goes not only for the solos by Chico and Harpo but also for the duets sung by the starcrossed lovers. This latter feature of the MGM films was often tedious and forgettable happily that is not the case in Go West. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the madcap humour of the Marx Bros. The climactic train sequence alone makes the film a mustsee.".

I don't want to call the movie great but since everything was new to me I had a very good time.Groucho Marx is S. Quentin Quale and Chico and Harpo are the brothers Joe and Rusty Panello. The two brothers and Quale are heading west to find fortune. The movie starts with a very funny sequence where the two brothers steal some money from Quale. After this the movie has some slow sequences without very big laughs especially when the brothers and Quale are not yet working together. There is a nice scene with Chico playing the piano in a great and very funny way that gives the movie some spirit again. Everything leads up to the scenes on a train and I have to say that once they are on the thing every gag is good for a laugh. May be some of the events are inspired by Buster Keaton's 'The General' but they're funny anyway.Why the brothers and Quale have to work together what the story is is not really important. The story is just there to prepare a new joke. Because most of them work I think this is a very nice movie with a great start and finish and may be a part that is a little too slow in the middle. The Marx Brothers have a great talent for comedy and they do show that here although we know they can do better.".

The man who brought them back into the movie game has been Irving Thalberg who took them seriously as comic artists let them rehearse and hone their material on stage and gave them a percentage of the gross sales had died in 1937. Thalberg's rival Louis B. Mayer grabbed control of Thalberg's production unit. Mayer whose negative effects on careers from John Gilbert to Judy Garland are becoming more known as time passes hated comedians and he disliked people who got contracts that took profits away from his company. He was in fact a selfish individual who got his just deserts in the 1950s when he was thrown out of his job by his shareholders and found nobody in Hollywood wanted anything to do with him. Mayer had no great love for the Marxes and allowed RKO a loan out of them for ROOM SERVICE. I feel that film has a lot still going for it but many people don't like it as too confining for the antics of the Marxes. Then in 1939 MGM put them into AT THE CIRCUS even bringing back Margaret Dumont. But the results are generally mediocre although Groucho has one of his best songs Lydia the Tattooed Lady. It was symptomatic of Mayer's lack of interest in their film work  they were not sent out to test their material.Then in 1940 came GO WEST.The Marx Brothers had not been the first comedians that Mayer disliked. He had a negative view of silent film genius Buster Keaton. Keaton's masterpieces of the silent films had been successful for the most part but he had been produced by Joseph Schenck his brotherinlaw and a rival of Mayer. Joe Schenck died in the early 1930s. At that time Keaton's films were not doing as well as in his heyday mostly due to contracts with MGM that took away his independence in production matters. Also his wife Nathalie Talmadge was finding her movie stardom ending and their marriage was collapsing. Keaton took to heavy drinking which hurt his performances in the sound films he made. Jimmy Durante was costarred in several films with Keaton like THE PASSIONATE PLUMBER and WHAT NO BEER! but though the men became friends their styles of humor did not mesh. By 1935 Keaton was a hasbeen in Hollywood and by the end of the decade was only appearing in minor films as comedy relief or used as a gag writer.Possibly Mayer decided for some twisted reason to put Keaton on the writing staff for GO WEST. It certainly was not with any belief in the Great Stone Face as a gag man or a comedian. But it is also more than likely that he put him into it to damage the Marxes still more and to humiliate Keaton. Knowing Mayer I would not put it past him.Groucho Marx lived to become a national icon due to his movie radio and television career. In his later years before senility began to affect him he was invited on all the talk shows and would discuss his brothers and their films and comedy in general. He would also drop off his acid comments which made the audiences laugh it helped Groucho that he lived long enough to find less censorship of his lines than he faced in the 1930s and 1940s. But he was a disagreeable man in private life being thoroughly honest on one hand but thoroughly nasty on the other. With Keaton given his recovering alcoholic state in 1940 you had to be respectful and kindly.Keaton had a dream that never reached the screen. In 1933 he had seen GRAND HOTEL and liked the concept of interlocking stories involving sets of big name stars. He wanted to do a comic version called GRAND MILLS HOTEL with himself Laurel and Hardy Marie Dressler and other comedians Edward Everett Horton was another intermingling in a third rate hotel. The idea never came to fruition. No doubt in thinking of it Keaton might have considered having the Marxes in the film too. He was a genuine appreciator of comic genius.But here it was 1940 and Keaton was working on a film with the Marxes. Keaton went to a script meeting and outlined an idea for a scene. Groucho listened. His expression was bland. When it was finished apparently with a sneer Groucho said You really think that was funny? Keaton somewhat crestfallen replied I just thought it might work...you fellows are pretty funny by yourselves. There are Keatonian touches in the movie Harpo's showdown with the saloon keeper town boss where he pulls out a shaving brush that fires a shot into the floor. Also the wrecking of the train at the conclusion which reminds one of Keaton's love of trains OUR HOSPITALITY THE GENERAL. Possibly he had a hand in the great opening of the film where Groucho is the city slicker fleeced by Chico and Harpo when he tries to fleece them. It did not help GO WEST that only three years before Laurel and Hardy made one of their two best features WAY OUT WEST nor that W.C.Fields and Mae West did MY LITTLE CHICKADIE in 1939. Both of those films are way better than the slow going GO WEST.One wishes that Groucho had been more charitable to Keaton because the latter did finally find a comedian who listened and worked with him. That was Red Skelton who would work on several films with Keaton in the late 1940s and early 1950s one of which A SOUTHERN YANKEE is very funny indeed. But Keaton allowed Groucho precedence of being a successful comic in GO WEST with mediocre results. Perhaps Groucho deserved the failure that resulted. Hubris is it's own reward.".

	schema:reviewBody "GO WEST MGM 1940 directed by Edward Buzzell capitalizes on the recent popularity of the western genre that began in 193839 placing the three Marx Brothers in the old west circa 1870 shortly beforeDon Ameche's invention of the telephone. Although not in the classic western comedy sense as MY LITTLE CHICKADEE Universal 1940 featuring Mae West and W.C. Fields GO WEST no relation to the 1925 Buster Keaton silent has something going for it. No they didn't get to find out how the West was won nor do the Marx Brothers get to have their frequent foil Margaret Dumont sporting western attire and shooting up the town like Annie Oakley. It does however provide some fine comical moments that would keep the Marx Brothers and their gag writers from getting lynched by theater patrons.Forward In 1851 Horace Greeley uttered a phrase that did much to change the history of the United States.

Terry John Carroll Turner's grandson wants to marry Eve Diana Lewis Wilson's granddaughter and in order to put an end of the WilsonTurner feud and amend his grandfather's thievery he requests the executive board of the New York and Western Railroad Company to link Cripple Creek to the Pacific by ways of Dead Man's Gulch so that Wilson will get 50000 for his property. Because Wilson is in need for 10 to buy a grubstake his helpers the Panello brothers Joe Chico and Rusty Harpo who have come west digging for gold offer him the money. As security for the loan Wilson signs over his deed to them. While at the Crystal Palace Saloon in Birch City Rusty steals a keg of beer to quench his thirst. In order to pay for the 10 cent drink Joe signs an I.O.U. over to Red Baxter Robert Barrat the town boss unwittingly on the back of Wilson's deed. Baxter places the deed in his cash register so he and jointowner John Beecher Walter Wolfe King who's to arrive in town could sell it to the railroad company at their asking price. Beecher intends on buying the deed for 500 while S. Quenton Quale Groucho a representative and embezzler offers 10000. Realizing his error Joe has Rusty retrieve the deed from Baxter's cash register giving it to Quale for his asking price and offer the money to Wilson's granddaughter. Quale intentions on cheating the Panello brothers backfires when Baxter and Beecher join forces and cheat him instead. They get the deed with Baxter putting it in his safe. The method of how Quale Joe and Rusty retain the deed remains to be seen.On the musical program You Can't Argue With Love by Gus Kahn and Bronislau Kaper sung by deepvoiced June MacCloy The Woodpecker Song piano solo by Chico Beautiful Dreamer by Stephen Foster sung by Diana Lewis Ridin' the Range Together by Roger Edens and Gus Kahn sung by John Carroll and From the Land of the Sky Blue Water harp solo on loom by Harpo on Indian reservation by Charles Wakefield Cadman.Placing the Marx Brothers in a western setting is a welcome change of pace. Even Chico abandons his traditional pointy hat until the latter half of the story anyway. Although amusing the good guys vs. the bad guys over a deed was handled so much better when Laurel and Hardy did it WAY OUT WEST 1937. GO WEST is not a bad movie but should have been better. It shows great promise with its hilarious ten minute opening at the train station where wiseacre Groucho is outsmarted by Chico and Harpo for money Chico 9 change please and redeems itself from prior weakness near the finish with its 15minute Keystone comedy type locomotive race against time as the wild bunch take over command as engineers with Groucho yelling Timber to acquire more wood for the steam engine. There's a great bit with Harpo hanging on between two railroad cars and slowly stretching as the coaches grow further apart. Other comic supplements ranging from good to average include Groucho and Chico's flirtation with Baxter's saloon gals while Harpo that redhead is a demon quotes one of the floozies in the next room searches for the stolen deed before dynamiting Baxter's safe. One scene worth noting having Groucho getting slickered by Baxter and tripped down a flight of stairs as in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA thus making him the laughing stock of the town actually takes away from his traditional character who used to make fools of the villains. Unlike their earlier MGM efforts the romantic subplot enacted by John Carroll and Diana Lewis doesn't take too much time away from the brothers to make this 80 minute comedy drag. Aside from the Marx Brothers assisting a young couple in need and showing the tender side of their nature by comforting Wilson's granddaughter after learning the outcome of her grandfather's deed GO WEST might have misfired altogether had it not been for the aforementioned opening and closing segments. What a shame that the notsomemorable moments prevented GO WEST from becoming the greatest western satire of all time.Distributed on video cassette in the late 1980s by Turner Home Entertainment GO WEST currently available on DVD can be seen on Turner Classic Movies so saddle up partners and have a rootin tootin' time with those three dudes the Marx Brothers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Basically  a highly farcical treatment of one chapter in the building of the first transcontinental railroad. This is confirmed by the parting scene which is a farcical recreation of the pounding of the golden spike at Promontory Point UT. The choosing of this topic for a plot may have been influenced by De Mille's epic Union Pacific  released the previous year. It also appears to have been influenced by Keaton's The General. Especially for Marx Brothers fans this is certainly worth a look. Initially Chico and Harpo are going Westspecifically the gold rush center of Cripple Creek CO to find gold or perhaps fleece those who have found it. Simultaneously embezzler and all around con man Groucho is heading west to practice his vocation. Chico and Harpo's cheating of Groucho during the exchange of money for items is a riot. When Groucho goes to the train ticket window he quips That's highway robbery. No wonder you're behind bars. Later when taking a stagecoach the 3 jerks create havoc among the male and female passengers. The plot is mainly about the disposition of the deed to a plot of land Dead Man's Gulch considered worthless because no gold has been found on that land. However it has suddenly become very valuable as the railroad has decided it is the key to the most practical route over the Rockies. This deed gets passed around as collateral for IOUs or is stolen. The boys attempt to foil an attempt by crooks to cash in on the deed. There are a number of musical interludes. Lulubelle sings You Can't Argue with Love on stage. Eve sings Beautiful Dreamer alone in her house.. While leisurely riding horses John Carrollas Terry Turner leads the singing of Riding the Range. Harpo plays the harp and Chico plays the piano in the saloon. I think the segment involving a visit to an Indian reservation could have been deleted as irrelevant to the plot. Besides there are too many erroneous Hollywood Indian clichs. Ugh. However Harpo does improvise a harp out of a loom and the chief accompanies him with a flute.The climactic last segment involving the great locomotive chasewith apologies to Fess Parker and Disney is what most people remember about this film. I can see that the whole thing would probably be hilarious to children. It could be almost as effective in a silent film.In being totally silentexcept for his horn Harpo mimics the traditional circus clown and some clowns of silent films. But unlike the latter and often the former he has distinctive charismatic talking companions and others to greatly expand the possibilities of the total comedy experience. As in this film we can complement the comedy with singing instrumental music and dance only possible to a rudimentary level in silent films. Unfortunately many reviewers seem to see the musical interludes as wasted time between comedy which they may be in some instances but not all.".

A top gallery of support players led by heavy Robert Barrat making an excellent straight man saloon belle June MacCloy a dazzling siren and scheming Walter Woolf King admirably aid Eddie Buzzell's deft direction. And for once the musical numbers are a real joy in themselves. Harpo of course does a solo turn. So does Chico. But Carroll has the breeziest number Ridin' the Range the best tune Roger Edens ever wrote. Production values are MGM grand though Leonard Smith's attractive photography does highlight the fact that Groucho's makeup is patently false. Some viewers might regard this as a disadvantage.

	schema:reviewBody "'I was going to thrash them within an inch of their lives but I didn't have a tape measure.' Groucho This is another hilarious Marx Brothers picture starring the three not the four brothers. It followed AT THE CIRCUS of the previous year 1939. Both films were directed by Edward Buzzell and written by Irving Brecher. It is interesting that Buzzell directed one Thin Man film SONG OF THE THIN MAN 1947 and Brecher wrote another SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN 1941 his next film after this Marx Brothers one. Brecher is best known however for writing the famous film MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS 1944. In this film the Marx Brothers truly go wild. They destroy an entire train a saloon various rooms and cause utter mayhem. But then they are in 'the Wild West' aren't they? There are plenty of gags as usual. At one point two engine drivers of a train are tied up and gagged by the Marx Brothers. Groucho goes up to one of them removes the gag from his mouth and then puts it back and says to the camera 'This is the best gag in the whole film.' Sitting in a stagecoach with a woman and a baby Groucho says 'We need to get to the bottom of this' and touches the baby's bottom. The stage coach is going over many bumps so the woman complains that she doesn't like the jerks in the coach. On cue Harpo and Chico get up open the door and are about to jump out when Groucho says 'Not you two' and pulls them back to their seats. The film opens with a lengthy standup confrontation between the three brothers in a railway station. Harpo wishing to steal money from Groucho's pocket but unable to get his hand into it produces some scissors and cuts away the side of Groucho's trousers snips open the bottom of his pocket and takes the money. Groucho drolly comments 'It getting rather cool in here' as we see his bare leg. There is one gag after another. Harpo gets to play the harmonica and then a harp disguised as an Indian weaving frame an Indian chief in full feather headdress accompanies him on a flute and Chico plays the piano in a saloon adding a new touch by knocking on the wood of the piano for some rhythm at one point and grabbing an apple from Harpo's hands which he was just about to eat rubbing it along the keyboard to produce some more music. Groucho strums on a guitar and seems to know how to play it. He also sings wonderfully dotty nonsense. But most of the action is riotous anarchy wanton destruction and hilarious and outrageous insults to stern and threatening crooks tomfoolery and chaos. But as we now know from modern science chaos conceals hidden structure. If only the kind of humour practiced by the Marx Brothers could still be done today. But no one seems to have a sense of humour anymore. Those of us who still know how to laugh however can always watch the Marx Brothers and escape the horrors of the news. When the apostles of political correctness and the thought monitors start destroying film comedies in the interest of 'keeping us safe' let us hope that Groucho Harpo and Chico find some way to outwit them. Wouldn't it be nice if we could find a way for all the stern and humourless people to laugh themselves to death? What if we tied the men who pulled the man off the plane the other day into chairs and forced them to watch this film? Or are such people entirely impervious to jokes? In life I hold to the view that the only thing that is not a joke is the people who cannot get a joke and who have never laughed in their lives. As a certain president might say in a tweet 'Sad.'".

One day while at the park they let the dog run without a leash and when he does not return or respond to their calls they frantically search for him. They eventually find him being held by three men who want a reward. When David refuses they start to molest Erica and David intervenes. Two of the men assault the couple while the third uses a camcorder to film this incident. Erica is knocked unconscious and regains her senses several days later in a hospital. She is told the shocking news that David was killed and the dog is missing. A traumatized Erica returns home to try and regain her life. She also visits the police station but does not get much help.

	schema:headline " Jodi Foster serves up a dish best served cold in revenge thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Brave One is a revenge film that is different then most revenge films. What director Neil Jordan does to separate this film from others is that he immerses the audience through the psychology and consequences when one decides to take the law into their own hands rather then focusing on the killing spree and violence of other similar pictures. In The Brave One Foster plays a radio talk show host Erica in New York City and is caught up in the illusion of a safe happy life. She's engaged to a handsome doctor and carries a distinguished radio show but all this crumbles into pieces after a fateful run in with punks in a park assault Erica and her fiance leaving Foster battered and bloody and her fiance dead.After Erica is in a coma for three weeks the scars from the experience paralyze her emotions. Foster's raw emotion comes through in her acting with great strength as we see this tidal wave of tragedy ruin her entire life. The city that she once loved now is seen as a dark hostile soulless environment as she sees the repressive pry on the weak and the law seems powerless to stop it. After failing at reaching detectives to help find her husbands killer and her own fear for her safety she decides to pick up a gun to protect herself.Erica's own morality is changed forever after she witnesses a man gunning down his wife at a connivance store. She begins to wallow and cry in fear but her pain of her past causes her to act in anger as she guns the man down. The experience causes Erica to feel dignified and unafraid. She does not want to be an innocent vulnerable bystander to the repressive anymore and does not want to shy away from the repressive when they come across her. The process of her road down to becoming an avenging angel is a slow digression and witnessing her developing resistance towards injustice is very moving to watch. Most thrillers such as this one have plots that seem strained but The Brave One's storyline gives much time for the viewer to understand Erica's emotions and the motives she chooses to signify them. When Erica meets the detective investigating her case she becomes fascinated with him as she realizes that he is trying to put away a ruthless criminal who has escaped the law. To cover for her crimes she displays interest in him through her work as a DJ and interviews the detective played by Terrance Howard. This makes for another interesting storyline in the film. She asks him is there anything you can do to bring this man to justice? His reply is yes but it wouldn't be legal Erica now decides to take the stance as a vigilante as she decides to bring this ruthless criminal to justice herself. Erica now becomes ensnared in the endless battle between law and justice through trying to realize where they actually diverge. Foster carries vulnerability in the film but also strength and diligence. Emotional resonance from characters that are real and relatable are hardly seen in film giving most films a dry and unauthentic look. But Foster engrosses us in Erica's soul. Few actresses can pull off a role like Erica in film today but Foster stands alone as one of the best character actors's working today. The film poses controversial questions to the soul rightness of conducting vengeance on those who impart their control and power on others. How can justice prevail when the good do nothing? This question as well as many more is raised and the audience is left to discover their own answers on morality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think someone should just take this city and just... just flush it down the fin' toilet says Travis Bickle Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. He wants to protect the young prostitute Iris Jodie Foster from some pigs and give her a better future. 31 years later Iris is a popular radio host whose fianc Naveen Andrews is killed in a random attack. She decides to avenge him and other helpless people with her own hands.If not for Jodie Foster's presence I probably wouldn't bother watching The Brave One even though I admire most of Neil Jordan's films. It's easy to call this a morally sick movie because that's what is... but it's not sicker than any other bloody action thriller out there. Watching a fragile woman like Foster becoming Charles Bronson in skirts is both entertaining and questionably gratifying. Who's never fantasized what if I could just kill all the scum around me? Like Falling Down and so many other flicks The Brave One appeals to our lower instincts and  mildly  makes us imagine what would we do in Jodie's shoes and how simple and satisfying it'd be just to kill them all. That'd be the easiest quickest 'solution' to our nightmares and on a second look that's not as sick as we'd think... just desperate and cathartic.Far from being a great movie or intellectually instigating as say Dogville The Brave One is worth seeing for Jodie's performance and for its unapologetic badassery in times of false excessive morality. 6.510.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think someone should just take this city and just... just flush it down the fin' toilet says Travis Bickle Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. He wants to protect the young prostitute Iris Jodie Foster from some pigs and give her a better future. 31 years later Iris is a popular radio host whose fianc Naveen Andrews is killed in a random attack. She decides to avenge him and other helpless people with her own hands.If not for Jodie Foster's presence I probably wouldn't bother watching The Brave One even though I admire most of Neil Jordan's films. It's easy to call this a morally sick movie because that's what is... but it's not sicker than any other bloody action thriller out there. Watching a fragile woman like Foster becoming Charles Bronson in skirts is both entertaining and questionably gratifying. Who's never fantasized what if I could just kill all the scum around me? Like Falling Down and so many other flicks The Brave One appeals to our lower instincts and  mildly  makes us imagine what would we do in Jodie's shoes and how simple and satisfying it'd be just to kill them all. That'd be the easiest quickest 'solution' to our nightmares and on a second look that's not as sick as we'd think... just desperate and cathartic.Far from being a great movie or intellectually instigating as say Dogville The Brave One is worth seeing for Jodie's performance and for its unapologetic badassery in times of false excessive morality. 6.510.";

The story is a standard revengemovie. But with Jodies amazing acting and a good director the standard story becomes interesting. It's like experience the whole thing through Jodies character. The bad guys gets a little bit stereotyped and shows almost no personalty other than violent temper. Well it's easier to kill them then I guess. The sensmoral of the film is kill the bad guys. Yes feels good on the white screen but it would be the end of society if everybody did like these characters did. Jodie gets 10 and the story 5 so average is 7 which is my vote. Definitely worth watching.".

No it's not Death Wish but it ain't far from it storywise. It's different enough to keep us guessing what Erica will do next so in that regard it's good value for your entertainment dollar particularly if you enjoy film noirs. This would be labeled a neo noir today.I was a little skeptical about Jodie Foster playing a Charles Bronsontype shooter but she pulled it off convincingly. The difference in Erica Bain and Bronson's Paul Kersey was minimal except she seemed to be more depressed over who she had become once she started killing. Foster by the way shows no signs of slowing down as an actress and this was a juicy role for her.But don't be misled by this film's screenplay or by Hollywood standards of morality as they have very little. The fact is as shown in this film this woman quickly turns into a killer a murderer if even if it was scumbags she was killing it doesn't justify her actions and deep inside she knew it. It sure is satisfying though in a real base sense! The ending a little UNsatisfying to a number of reviewers both here and in national publications. That's all I will say on that as I don't want to spoil anything for readers who haven't seen the movie. You make up your own mind what you think of it and the message it conveys.Suffice to say if you're looking for an entertaining neo noir one that serves up your thirst for vengeance a la Death Wish this is one to check out at your local rental store.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK probably on first glance everyone will see the similarity with previous male dominated vigilante films. But that's a quick superficial response. I have to say that everyone at the preview here in Miami on 91007 was knocked out by what this film truly does. It takes us on an uncharted ride through the eyes of an intelligent NY woman who's pretty much got her life by the tail. She's got good work a fianc with whom she is in love friends who are supportive and a future that seems bright. Her life works maybe even constitutes a charmed life. Then life in the safest big city in the world grinds her up like just so much meat going through a Cuisinart on high. A senseless attack in Central Park and her life her love and even her dog are gone... in a matter of seconds. She can never go back to who she was but the world she lives in postattack seems to have no room for her as she is. It is after this prologue that the essential story really begins. This is a film about the way violence strips you of your identity and changes you irrevocably. It explores in detail how you can become someone even you can't recognize in the bathroom mirror when loss grief anxiety terror and depression take over. And what makes this interesting  screenworthy is the journey the character takes is very different from that of others before her in this genre. First because it is experienced totally through her eyes ears and sensibilities. Second because for the first time I can recall after a lifetime of sitting in the dark and watching films the character I gladly identify with is a woman. Yes it appears Ms. Foster has made some definite changes in her selection of material  she's gone from victim to vigilante over the course of a couple of decades. I admit that I have enjoyed all of her work but if she doesn't get an Oscar nomination for her work in this film everyone in Hollywood needs to be institutionalized. She carries the film is on screen for 97 of the time has changed her look and style to become a believable New Yorker... the nononsense hair clothes and stride of a woman who earns her living via the sounds and rhythms of Manhattan. She shows a wide range in this part... at once sarcastic then nurturing smokyvoice seductive yet warm  vulnerable and finally a shellshocked survivor who appears coldblooded but is really suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome of the highest order. She does not strike one false note. Her supporting cast is strong and the relationship that evolves between her character and the Detective is edgy and in the end fulfilling. I hope that the audiences see what I  the rest of the preview audience saw in this film... a character study that's dead on in its dramatic arc. From what I understand Ms. Foster often takes on roles that were originally written for men. She will only entertain work that offers dimensionality. Therefore this may have been the logical conclusion of that cycle. As a final note... it's about time the studios realized that women can have a dark side too. The police comments in the film regarding the nature of women who kill are very interesting  provocative.I am looking forward to the DVD release and its extras. I am hoping she will be an active voice on the commentary. I would love to know what she created as her character's back story and future story. Beyond her talent as an actor her authenticity as an artist and her outstanding mind... she has a charisma that underscores all of her work.This one's a film that will effect you not only during its screen time but afterward during the postmortem you  your friends will most surely have. Don't miss this film!".

Foster tellingly admits You become someone else Jodie Foster is powerful in Neil Jordan's The Brave One. Jordan's The Brave One could have easily slipped into a feminist version of say perhaps Death Wish. Foster's heart felt performance and fierce intelligence compel and enroll. Her distinct gift is that she always plays as smart as her character. She inspires with authenticity humanity and sheer will. Terrance Howard is an awesome screen partner and foil. He is stunning. The Brave One falters a little in its forced resolution however the screenplay and story by Roderick Taylor Bruce Taylor and Cynthia Mort is the tale of a woman's stand in the face of fear. I say that in the most apolitical way. The Brave One may be criticized for possibly glorifying vigilante justice masked as vengeance. I believe for the smart and talented Jordan and Foster that was not what attracted them to the project. There is a poignant and moving scene as Erica Foster returns to her job as New York Public Radio talk show host. After a squirming lapse of silence Erica bares her naked soul as she talks about her path back to normalcy acknowledging she is now one of the people who live in fear. It is hard to dismiss The Brave One as populist exploitation. I think that for Foster's Erica she simply draws her line in the sand. I think that resonates with a lot of people. When I saw The Brave One last night the audience was applauding at the movie's conclusion. I have not heard that in a long while. The Brave One strikes an emotional and cultural chord.Jodie Foster plays Erica Bain who is a Public Radio talk show host. Erica records the sounds of New York City and comments upon them on her show. Therein lays her affinity to the city. Erica is engaged to David Kirmani charming Naveen Andrews a star physician. They have a great life and are preparing for their wedding. Then one evening while taking their dog for a walk in Central Park they are viciously attacked by 3 thugs who actually record the malicious beating. Note the attack is visually savage and ruthless. Erica awakes in the hospital weeks later to discover that David is dead and buried. Devastated and her life profoundly altered Erica returns home to begin her recovery. Here Jordan and Foster touchingly illustrate Erica's haunting memories of David in the context of the attack. Jordan's claustrophobic camera angles punctuate Erica's isolation. Eventually able to muster the courage to leave her apartment Erica is paralyzed in fear. In an act of desperation she illegally buys an automatic handgun. The guy selling her the gun even says to her What happened to you? Soon thereafter Erica kills a vicious killer at a liquor store. She must now fly under the legal system radar. She chooses this dark path of vigilante justice which can not end well. Terrance Howard plays Detective Mercer who is vehemently frustrated by the legal system he defends investigates the series of vigilante style murders. The charismatic and sharp Mercer eventually hypothesizes the killer may be a woman with a grudge. Turns out that Mercer had met Erica before. They also form a touching bond out of both compassion and shared loneliness.Granted here Jordan and Screenwriter Mort are manipulative. Possessed by anger and vengeance Erica kills the vilest of human beings. However Foster never plays Erica as an avenging superhero. She is fearful angry and poignantly acknowledges that she may be becoming no better than the criminals she kills. She is clumsy surviving on her smarts and all heart. On paper what she is doing is wrong. However as an audience there is an element of muted admiration and redemption in seeing Foster's Erica emerge from helpless victim. Foster brilliantly captures Erica's transformation and quiet loss of humanity. Like in all great tragedy the hero must come to terms with that he or she eventually becomes that which they despise. It is all about how the hero reconciles that. To that end Terrance Howard is amazing as Erica's voice of consciencehe commands an understated and quiet power.Jordan's twist at the end may be contrived however I don't think that it dilutes or undermines The Brave One's power. We are all for Erica's redemption and reconciliation of her very soul. Jodie Foster is so powerful and compelling as hero Erica. This is one of her best performances and award worthy. Her performance resonates with us the worst and best in humanity. Neil Jordan's storytelling is edgy and brilliant. The Brave One is uncompromising filmmaking and well worth view and thought.".

Jodie Foster does an excellent job as always but there is just too much selfconscious narrative to save this.Furthermore I really don't understand why the protagonist was labeled as a vigilante. She was nothing of a kind. Everything she did was in pure self defence. First she kills a guy who is hunting her down with a gun in a grocery store then she kills 2 guys in the subway who put a gun and a knife to her throat and try to rape her and so on. What's vigilante about that? The only thing she did wrong was to get an unlicensed weapon other than that she was completely justified in doing all the killings  if somebody points a gun in your direction with an intent to kill you have to protect yourself. Even in New York.May be the movie would be better if it had a better social commentary on how women are in constant danger of violence in our society regular and sexual and how they are criminalized if they try to use force to protect themselves but the movie never got that deep".

First she kills a guy who is hunting her down with a gun in a grocery store then she kills 2 guys in the subway who put a gun and a knife to her throat and try to rape her and so on. What's vigilante about that? The only thing she did wrong was to get an unlicensed weapon other than that she was completely justified in doing all the killings  if somebody points a gun in your direction with an intent to kill you have to protect yourself. Even in New York.May be the movie would be better if it had a better social commentary on how women are in constant danger of violence in our society regular and sexual and how they are criminalized if they try to use force to protect themselves but the movie never got that deep";

How about being attacked and brutally beaten in Central Park by a gang of thugs then waking up in hospital only to find out that the love of your life has been buried while you were in a three week long coma.The Brave One takes you on a journey of what it means to loose everything to become a shadow of yourself propelled by a very strong performance by Jodi Foster as Erica Bain. We watch as she finds herself crippled by fear unable to step over the threshold between her home and the city she once felt safe in now turned against her. When she does find the strength to leave she's caught up in a convenience store shooting and surprises herself by killing the attacker. And so begins her mission to take the law into her own hands killing those who abuse taunt and betray yet always remaining the victim of violence On the way she catches the attention of NYPD Detective Mercer Terrence Howard the lead investigator in what becomes known as the vigilante killings. They form a close bond though the basis of it is not always clear. It's a pity that so much of the film's focus is on the murders preventing the audience from exploring Erica's character deeper. You wonder why she has no friends and what her logic is for not seeking help when she is clearly loosing her mind. However what the narrative may lack depth and dimension is balanced out by the cinematography most notably the artful juxtaposition of tender love making and gory violence to signify her pain. And while the ending may feel like somewhat of an anticlimax after spending the past two hours jumping out of your seat it never the less brings the journey satisfyingly fullcircle.The Fan Carpet  www.thefancarpet.com".

	schema:reviewBody "My Synopsis Radio host Erica Bain Jodie Foster is working and living a wonderful life in New York City without a care in the world. One night she and her fianc David Naveen Andrews are brutally attacked by three thugs in the park. David is killed and Erica is beaten within an inch of her life. Erica is traumatized to a point where she can not sleep and will not leave her apartment. To cope and work past this tragic event Erica becomes someone else. She buys a gun and begins to roam the streets at night looking to take her revenge on the men who were responsible for killing her one true love. One late night Erica is in the back of a convenience store about to purchase a soft drink when a man comes in and kills the woman clerk. She is a witness and he comes after her. Erica protects herself and finds that it is very easy to shoot a gun. Days later Erica is on the subway when she is about to be raped by two men and again she protects herself. The City of New York is fascinated with the exploits of this vigilante killer and NYPD Detective Mercer Terrence Howard is trying to catch this person before he kills again. Erica gets a lead of where she can find the three men in the park so they will be next.My Comment Jodie Foster is brilliant playing the part of a victim when she is hit by a random act of violence. We get to experience the whole tragedy through the eyes of Erica. Her first thoughts were she was lucky to be alive then she wants justice and if she can't get justice she wants revenge. Erica is a calm radio show host who starts out as an ordinary woman who becomes a victim and finds the courage to fight back by turning into a Charles Bronson Death Wish character. Erica decides to walk the streets of New York shooting anyone who does her wrong. Jodie is excellent in transitioning from good to evil and in the process still wanting justice. Warner Bros.

When the exploration of societys reaction to these crimes is about to head into thought provoking areas and the ramifications of these acts are all dropped for acts of revenge. The final act is what unfolds what was so tightly constructed beforehand. The tuff and hard hitting ending Jordan was heading for never eventuates for an ending more cheap and selling out the audience. Jodie Foster gives and powerhouse performance over shadowing the rest of the cast and is the strongest element of The Brave One. Terrence Howard is solid without being very memorable. The Brave One has an intriguing premise true this isn't Deathwish or Taxi Driver again its a disappointment it could have risen above what it actually finished as.".

Recovering from temporary agorrophobia she ventures out illegally buys a gun for protection and though a couple of chance encounters that are semidefence she soon graduates to using it for revenge.Erica's monologue about her newfound fear and heartbreak at the loss of her beloved city was powerful and Jodie has a splendid voice think Terry Gross on NPR for radio  and she'd still cut quite a figure arriving for work in Birkenstocks and pyjamas with scarecrow hair. Unfortunately that monologue was the only highlight of the film for me. Foster's acting was outstanding but we expect that from her.The film took many silly shortcuts some of which helped to gloss over the horrific realities others insulted the viewer's intelligence. Erica's exponentially increasing skill with the Kahr K9  which isn't nice or easy to shoot even with experience. The liquor store and subway incidents were too Hollywood easy. No screaming twisting agony from the victims to draw attention to the situation just clean kills to avoid complexities of subsequent identification if they survived. Her fourth to eighth ever shots all hits and at least two on major organs in a stressful situation? Shooting the pimp through a speeding car windscreen? A 5'3 110pound woman with an injured arm headbutting and beating a 6'0 psychopath to death with a tyre lever? Nope.In Erica's hearttoheart talks with Mercer she gives some very glaring hints about herself in perhaps a semiconfessional way as though looking for understanding if not reassurance. Mercer either takes a surprisingly long time to connect the dots else struggles uncomfortably long with his conscience before he drops the hint that he knows what she's up to. There's a very stupid comment by Mercer that his hands didn't shake after he shot someone because he was on the right side of the law. Were we supposed to draw from that the same conclusion about Erica's steady hands after her murderous behaviour? Insulting and pernicious and perhaps only in America.The fact that Erica was a radio host added a useful device to allow her to do the phonein feature with some very badly screened calls so that the people who weren't already insulted could then be spoon fed basic examples of stupidity and morality. It was largely unnecessary since anyone knows instinctively she was heading for hell and she duly arrived.Finally her redemption is that the good cop gives her a way to beat the rap which means she'll never be caught and there could therefore be even more copycats. Smart move Serpico.It's an old idea that has been rehashed many times principally because pretty much everything that can be said about it has already been said.The first two encounters were unfortunate circumstances but then she begins to go looking for trouble perhaps more selfassured by packing heat and that's where my sympathy for the character dies. In essence she betrays herself and all the good that is a core part of who she is.I found that unutterably sad.".

Same thing with Terence Howard. Times must be hard for actors nowadays or maybe they just need the money for their kids' college tuition. All the talk from Jodi Foster's character about becoming a stranger who isn't the person she used to be is lost in a movie designed to make the audience scream yeah! kill that fck! The movie is very wellacted welldirected photographed and so on but you can't disguise the fact that it's an exploitation movie trying to pass itself off as a thoughtful essay on human nature. For anyone who's ever been beaten up or a victim of a violent crime this movie is just a revenge fantasy with no redeeming characteristics other than some wellacted wellwritten scenes that lead up to a lowestcommon denominator ending. God what a disappointment.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's a shame to see Jodi Foster bringing her thoughtfulness and sensitivity to a movie that is audience pandering of the most pretentious selfimportant sort. Same thing with Terence Howard. Times must be hard for actors nowadays or maybe they just need the money for their kids' college tuition. All the talk from Jodi Foster's character about becoming a stranger who isn't the person she used to be is lost in a movie designed to make the audience scream yeah! kill that fck! The movie is very wellacted welldirected photographed and so on but you can't disguise the fact that it's an exploitation movie trying to pass itself off as a thoughtful essay on human nature. For anyone who's ever been beaten up or a victim of a violent crime this movie is just a revenge fantasy with no redeeming characteristics other than some wellacted wellwritten scenes that lead up to a lowestcommon denominator ending. God what a disappointment.";

	schema:reviewBody "While watching The Brave One you can tell the folks who made this movie were very pleased with themselves. They were thrilled with their own cleverness in making an urban vigilante film with a woman as their vengeanceseeking hero. They clearly thought they were striking some sort of feminist blow against The Patriarchy by doing so. Apparently they missed out on the whole Buffy The Vampire SlayerXena the Warrior Princess thing on TV that made women kicking ass rather clich. Their selfsatisfaction blinded them to the fact that their whole idea ends up being only half a movie.Erica Bain Jodie Foster is a public radio monologist. She records the sounds of New York City and then weaves stories around that audio for her listeners. She's in love with a man named David Naveen Andrews and they seem made for each other right up until they are both brutally attacked in a city park. David is killed and Erica is put into a coma. When she revives Erica is consumed by fear and buys a gun to protect herself. It's unclear if anything else would have happened if Erica had been left alone in her pain and sorrow but she gets caught in the middle of a convenience store robbery and shoots the robber dead. Then she shoots a couple of thugs on the subway saves a whore from her violent trick beats a criminal mastermind to death with a tire iron before eventually tracking down the men responsible for the attack on her and David. As Erica is doing a rather halting Charles Bronson impersonation Detective Sean Mercer Terrence Howard is trying to track down New York's newest vigilante gunman. If you can believe it the ding of a closing elevator door puts him on Erica's trail. Mercer engages in one of the most lackadaisical investigations in the history of crime cinema before finally rushing in but whether it's to stop Erica or help her isn't quite clear.Let me get a couple of things out of the way. First Erica has one of those Magic Negro friends who dispenses world weary wisdom and guidance. I appreciate that in the limited time available in a film it can be very hard to avoid using these types of characters. It allows you to make the points you want to make very quickly and clearly. But if you've got to use such a character stop making them black people! Make them French or Chinese or Hasidic Jews or anything else but the whole black person opens the white hero's eyes to the essential truth they're missing is not only played out it's almost become a form of racial profiling. Stop it.The scene I mentioned where Erica beats a vicious criminal to death with a tire iron is also beyond ridiculous. Jodie Foster is not a big girl and in the scene one of Erica's arms is severely injured. Small slim women with only one good arm cannot beat fully grown men to death especially if those men are violent killers themselves. I mean if you want to be taken seriously as a drama you can't let overly melodramatic stuff like that ruin the tone of the film.Putting those two glaring flaws to the side The Brave One only tells half a story. It's all about Erica being so conflicted and angsty about killing the bad guys. It never bothers with the social and ethical questions raised by the vigilante. The story also never bothers to focus on Eric's transformation into a vigilante. The first time she shoots a bad guy it's selfdefense in a random situation. The second time is just as random but it's not really selfdefense and Erica has obviously become a much more proficient killer. But we're never shown or even told about Erica practicing her marksmanship or training her body and mind for deadly situations. The movie dwells too much on Erica's anguish over what she's doing without balancing the scales by showing us the emotions driving her and the extreme effort she has to make to do it. Without that balance you're left to wonder Well if it bothers you that much Erica why don't you just stop?The Brave One also has an ending that could have come straight out of a Lethal Weapon sequel but with Foster and Howard instead of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. It doesn't sync up at all with the tone and style of the rest of the movie and I'd bet it was somebody's idea of a happy ending that got snuck in during the rewrite process.Jodie Foster also gets briefly naked in this film another example of Producer SelfNudity. Be warned however her nakedness is thoroughly desexualized by mixing memories of Erica having sex with David with memories of the brutal attack on them. If you get aroused by nudity in that context you should probably seek out a mental health expert.The Brave One isn't all bad though. Foster and Howard both do fine jobs and when they're on screen together they're very entertaining. But unless watching two great actors give merely good performance is all you want or need out of a film you'd probably be better off renting one of the Death Wish movie instead of this one. Even one of those hugely sucky later Death Wish films where it looks like Bronson needs a walker more than a gun.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Brave One seems to indicate that the main character of course is brave. I'd disagree. The more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her getting brutally beaten along with her fiance who doesn't live another day from it is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character Erica is a radio personality who's niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on. We're given no real depth aside from 'she had someone she loved he died the police don't pursue it she gets a gun yadayadayada she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective' into the character and so were left with something leftover from past movies the vigilante code of justice where taking the power in one's own hands is all there is. But we're never too sure if Erica is sane or not if the filmmakers take a position one way or another that is until the end which is such a stupid message to take anyway dog included as overbearing metaphor while making the New York City of today which has become significantly safer than say twenty years ago look like you'll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car.There could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with Terence Howard's detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn't his and a woman who he's not linked to and a stepfather who I don't know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude but we're left to a script that's both hamfisted and disjointed with logic. It becomes laughable for example to see that at first the logical side of Erica unable to really shoot properly as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband and then giving way to the illogical of her crackshot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over. It doesn't help that Jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable it's called a stedicam for a reason not because it can weave in and out.Ironically the script and direction become very good or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge caught between a videotaped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting. And when Erica first comes back on the air to her radio show and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick and speaks out a 'fromtheheart' about how afraid she is this scene from Foster's performance to the clear direction and script is the best scene in the film. But aside from that there's just a lot of posturing into a psychology that's flimsy is she a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her narration over scenes some of it doesn't have to do at all with her radio show observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night nothing to do but her selfimposed task of cleaning up the streets. But unlike Death Wish a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario the path of endless violence just heeds to a message one that won't be news to anyone who's seen a second of Lifetime movieoftheweek melodrama.The actors make do with what's given and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated the hackneyed plot turns and the plain old inexplicable plus the unintentionally hilarious like a few expletives shouted by Howard after getting shot in one scene and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger. It's a very problematic picture with only a few moments of genuine interest and clearheaded conventionbending.".

The Brave One focuses on a middle aged woman EricaJodie Foster who's life is torn apart by a random act of violence. After her recovery she returns with fear to the streets she once loved. Driven to madness by her fear she purchases a gun and finds herself a witness to a murder. The plot revolves around her vigilante killings and her relationship with the detective Terrence Howard who is trying to solve them. I found the movie for the most part emotionally engaging though a poorly edited scene directly after the attack on Erica detracts from much of the previous scene's impact. The movie definitely gripped me though I was ready for it to end when it did and it ended well but the runtime may have been to long. The screening I saw may have been a work print. If so the problems with a few poorly edited scenes and the length may not be issues by the time it hits theaters. I certainly anticipate seeing it again in September!".

	schema:reviewBody "I do believe that critics are not the say all of movie quality and have always professed the need to make ones own opinion. A few times I have very much liked films that the critics despised. In this particular case of the Brave one I can't for the life of me understand why the critics liked this movie. It is a revenge flick for sure. Jody Foster gets beat up bad and her much younger then she I might add boyfriend is killed in a Central park mugging. She comes out of a coma is depressed fearful and then after picking up a gun full of revenge. Lets forget about the fact that the character age for this story should have been about 10 years younger then Foster like the boyfriend. Once she gets out of the coma Foster who is praised by critics for her performance acts throughout the rest of this film in a constant frown. I mean in every scene. Foster here looks like a butch army babe. The script does not explain how she became that way. Is her body naturally thin and muscular? Maybe. Also after the mugging she is met by her boyfriends Mother once for wake up comfort and then the Lady disappears from her life. We do not meet any other relative. Is she an orphan? Maybe. Who knows. On top of all this in one revenge scene she does not shoot the large mean male bad guy. No our petite heroine beats him to death with a bar and then picks him up and throws him off of the balcony. Come on. Foster may be in good shape but she is way to small to have a chance of doing this. Near the end of the pic the cop who is following the case has enough evidence to stop her and take her in for questioning and knows beyond a doubt that she will go after the perps who beat her up after she sees them in the police station yet lets her not only walk but does not even follow her. Oh boy. When she calls him during the act that same night he is actually surprised.OK. This film is not boring and I was entertained by its badness.I just wrote this because I do not understand the critics who liked it. It just does not make sense. Anyway make up your own minds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jodie Foster is one of the best actresses in movies today. But sometimes her choices are questionable. And sad to say THE BRAVE ONE falls into this category.A New York radio host is brutally assaulted and left for dead along with her fianc after a walk in a park. He dies as a result of his injuries. As Erica Foster recovers from her injuries her fear of what happened makes her buy a gun for protection but while in a small store a man enters killing a woman. In her fear Erica pulls her gun and kills him. From there she begins a vigilante killing spree while at the same time drawing closer to Detective Mercer Terence Howard as he begins to investigate the killings....Foster dominates the movie as you'd expect. On screen for almost the entire movie she carries it easily convincing as a terrified victim of crime not wanting to go outside to guntoting killer. Howard gives strong support as Mercer showing a cop dedicated to his job yet at times frustrated by the law. Sadly the rest of the cast don't really register.Neil Jordan directs well handling the action comfortably. However the fault with this movie lies with the script.The script fails to make Erica a convincing character despite Foster's best efforts. As a victim of crime the character works but her conversion to vigilante happens too easily to convince. For example in one scene we see her buying a gun. The next she's a crack shot. Course it could be something that was edited out but as I said it could be bad writing.The bond that develops between Mercer and Erica does convince but then a character development lifted indirectly from Eastwoods' Dirty Harry movie SUDDEN IMPACT spoils the movie. Mercer has been portrayed throughout as a good honest cop doing his best so for him to then aid Erica at the movie climax disappoints.The other problem and it is a major flaw is the mood of the piece.The film tries to keep the audience sympathy with Erica throughout but it never really shows Erica feeling guilt or haunted by what she's doing resulting in a lack of sympathy instead. Her turn to killer especially at the movie climax with a couple of oneliners that would have suited Arnie and co seem lifted from another movie. A less action packed ending would have worked better.The movie also tries to elevate itself away from the likes of Death Wish and come over as a more worthy piece but it has all the hallmarks of those movies despite Foster Howard and Jordan trying their best. It's not a bad movie. Simply a badly written one.".

I think it magnificent and I've seen it 3 or 4 times. The last viewing was last fall at the Film Forum in New York City and once again I was knocked out by it. The plot is simple a poor family headed by the mother moves to the big city to try to make a better life for her and her sons. Katina Paxinou plays the mama mia in a larger than life performance that at times knocks you out of your seat. The film is divided into sections with each one devoted to one of the  brothers but the thrust and heart of the narrative concerns two of the brothers Rocco played by a never better nor more beautiful Alain Delon  his intense lovehate relationship with his brother played by Renato Salvatori who also gives a superb performance. The other great performance in the film is from Annie Girardot as a prostitute with a semiheart of gold. Girardot first has a vivid  difficult relationship with Salvatori who is a brutal  simple prize fighter but then she drops him when she falls in love with Delon. Needless to say trouble and high operatic drama follows that finally ends in tragedy that never fails to leave me in tears. Both soapy  operatic this is one of the great films of the 60's  one of Visconti's best. Also look for a young Claudia Cardinale in an early film role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I understand why Visconti regards this classic as his personal favorite!!Overwhelmingly Terrific!  The acting design music cinematography and especially direction are superb.This epic grand personal and highly dramatic tale of five brothers and their mother who move from Southern Italy to Milan to change their station in life is filled with wonderful vignettes and powerful set pieces.The fight between two of the brothers in the slums of the city is one of the most harrowing and touching scenes ever in cinema history.  This is the kind of fight which actually means something.  When they hit each other you feel it down to the core of your being not just watching mindless brutality like you would in some brainless movie.The cast is uniformly good with standouts from Katina Paxinou as the long suffering mother Annie Girardot as the doomed prostitute who is the catalyst of the story and especially Alain Delon who is blessed with a cinematic beauty which adds poetry to everyone of his closeups.  The one actor who really surprised me was Renato Salvatori as the violent brother Simone. His gradual and completely believable change from sweet young man to violent brute is incredible to watch.This film satisfies every true movie lovers dream.  To visit a place you don't know with characters who fascinate you and are  framed in a true CINEMATIC style that succeeds on every level.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!  I will add my voice to those who cry out for the DVD release of this true classic.".

I was seeing Foreign films at that time I remember seeing La Dolce Vita The Virgin Spring and Hiroshima Mon Amour at our local foreign movie theatre in Essex County  The Ormont in East Orange.. long gone.. but missed this.  Well thanks to TCM Ive had another sleepless night  have just seen a truly great Italian movie or great movie period!!..What a saga ! what passion what emotion !! The story of a southern Italian peasant family's journey and relocation to the big city... is just superb film making..The deterioration of the brothers relationship is  almost pure GreeK Tragedy there is a glimmer of hope with the youngest brother...superbly acted especially by Renato Salvatori as Simon the most troubled of all the fratelli and  young beautiful Alain Delon as the younger brother Rocco who desperately tries to save his brother from destruction and Annie Giradot as Nadia the prostitute who adds to this families woes is just sensational in a role that should have won her all kinds of trophies. It was no mistake that Visconti used  Greek Oscar winning actress Katina Paxinou in the role of an Italian mother instead of say Anna Magnani ? her performance brings to mind all the heroines of Sophocles  Aesculus... yes tragedy and emotion of epic proportions..played to the nth degree... beautiful cast  excellently directed... by Viscont1... thanks to TCM Im catching up on his great movies SENSO a few months back and now Rocco  this is a treat.. also in cast a very young beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Ginetta..

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian master Luchino Visconti's 1960 melodrama Rocco e i Suoi Fratelli is the best film I've seen in a long long time and it deserves to be up there among European cinema's finest achievements along with Visconti's other masterpiece Il Gattopardo 1963.Aristocrat turned communist Visconti draws a beautiful but horrible picture of Milan in the 1960s when the immigration from the South was at its peek and the social problems in Northern Italy exploded. The differences between north and south in Italy are enormous and were perhaps even greater back when Visconti and his scriptwriting crew decided to make a contemporary film about a family moving northwards. Visconti wanted to make a film about a mother and her five sons like the five fingers on her hand like the mother herself exclaimes at the end of the film. This is not an agitational film though just a superbly acted study of a society in disorder and a portrait of a family trying to make ends meet in a harsh world they do not know. Like another Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini noted the South of Italy stayed an undeveloped land even after the North became industrialized and that didn't happen before after WWII. This is the grim truth and the person who thought this film was depressing should just stay on his or her pills and turn his or her eyes towards the real world because the world IS a depressing place. You just cannot blame directors with a social conscience for trying to tell a story which lies close to their hearts then you should stay away from film criticism and criticize the world instead. I am so tired of that.Renato Salvatori makes a performance of a lifetime as the troubled brother Simone while Alain Delon stays calm and controlled as Rocco the protagonist if there is one. Boxing is used as a metaphor for the anger the young men feel but when Simone fails Rocco succeeds by fueling his fighting with the contempt for his brother's actions. The two brothers are torn between the beautiful prostitute Nadia whom they both love passionately but she only loves Rocco and that almost breaks the family. The other brothers are more supporting characters and even though the film is long it should have been even longer the second youngest brother Ciro is an interesting and morally strong character that I would have loved to see developed further. The pride ignorance hatred loyalty and love of these people are held together by a perfect script by Visconti and his four collaborators and cinema's finest cinematographer Guiseppe Rotunno moves his camera magnificently through the streets houses and locales of a growing but morally decaying Milan.This is cinematic perfection.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to catch this extraordinary film late last night on a cable channel. It's about a widow from southern Italy who moves to Milan with her five sons. Gradually they become embroiled in the big city some becoming corrupted by its ways others profiting. Rocco played by Alain Delon is an innocent looking at his brothers and life in general with saintly patience. When his beneficent attitude comes under pressure he doesn't give in to selfinterest choosing to sacrifice his own happiness and that of the woman he loves for his family. Family is really what 'Rocco and his Brothers' is all about. I've never got into Visconti but seeing this film has made me want to see more of his work. Also this move has one of the most powerful images I've ever seen as the maddened Simone advances towards the doomed prostitute Nadia. It's an image so remarkable I actually shouted aloud when I saw it. I urge you to see this film. It's a remarkable passionate beautifully photographed drama that will stay with you for a long time.".

Exploitation and xenophobia is the common destiny for those who came from south of the country. This film is a perfect sequel to La Terra Tembla one of the earliest Visconti's looks on Marxism. The hopes and lives of this five brother's family sink onto a pit at the same time as they destroy themselves. Rocco and ... is intensely played by the entire cast including a young and delicate Alain Delon as the idealistic Rocco an exquisite Annie Girardot as a prostitute trying to survive to her own hell and a terrific Renato Salvatori. But is the figure of the peasant mother played superbly by Katina Paxinou the most remarkable piece of this operatic story. Claudia Cardinale made some kind of Italian debut in this film. Nino Rota composes his most pitiful score and the black and white photography is stunning. The scene at the rooftop of Milan's Duomo is one of my alltime favorites.

The chapter about the youngest brother contains remarks about about their attitude towards life and the philosophy for the future.

But the most important element throughout the film are the bonds between the members of the family which you guessed from the title ofcourse.  Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno Amarcord Regarding Henry Il Gattopardo  all three not comparable BTW and the other makers of this film where not ambitious or pretentious while making this masterpiece that would really have been besides the point they were making and unnecessary too because the story and the pace don't need it and the cast is brilliant.Some more references.  The score was done by Nino Rota Godfather Amarcord Il Gattopardo the tune that helped making Godfather famous was already more or less completed here in 'Rocco'.  The film might have been inspired by Ladri di biciclette 1948 and may in turn have been the inspiration for Raging Bull 1980 the Outsiders Coppola 1983 and even the Godfather although 'Rocco' has nothing to do with neither mafia nor with America.  In 1963 Delon Cardinale who has a very small role in 'Rocco' and Visconti would work together on Il Gattopardo.  But 'Rocco' has to be Visconti's greatest! besides Morte a Venezia which is a TOTALLY different film BTW. Also see Hotel New Hampshire 1984.10 points out of 10 ".

It is a wonderful Italian family epic explaining in Marxist terms the effect on a southern rural family of a move to the big northern city of Milan. The contrast between a violent brother Simone and his saintly counterpart Rocco gives rise to the tragedy which everybody else must pay for. The film has a great theme great direction great acting and a truly memorable and heartrending score by Nino Rota. It reaches the heights of Shakespearean drama and of course outdoes it in realism. But what I discovered by seeing this film so late is that it is also partly responsible for the seedier aspects of the careers of Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola who naturally tried to emulate their hero Visconti by adapting his themes to American reality. This has unfortunately had the sideeffect of creating a monster of a melodrama called The Godfather which became an ode to violence and organized crime and a boxingthemed film like Raging Bull which further contributed to lower the bar of graphic violence on the screen. Hell Coppola even borrowed the services of Nino Rota for the film and its sequel... I admire Rocco but I still think the world would have been better off without The Godfather and Raging Bull among other violent films of the second part of the last century. Rocco is available on DVD in America in its cut 168 minute Italian version in nonanamorphic widescreen 1.661 with English subtitles which is unfortunate for us Francophones as the French version is just as legitimate as the Italian one and features Delon's Girardot's Salvatori's and Hanin's real voices. It deserves an uncut edition and the full Criterion treatment.".

	schema:headline " Excellent acting but tale of misguided filial obligation doesn't ring true";
	schema:reviewBody "'Rocco and his Brothers' begins as the Parondi clan move from their rustic life in Lucania in the southern part of Italy to the bustling northern metropolis of Milan. Head of the clan is the mother Rosaria a loud obnoxious woman who can be best described as a worry wart. She brings her four sons Rocco and Simone in their early 20s Ciro a teenager and Luca about eight to visit Vincenzo the older brother who is engaged to Ginetta played by Claudia Cardinale before she became famous. The expectation is that Vincenzo has arranged for his inlaws to put his mother and siblings up until they can obtain permanent lodging. Unfortunately Rosaria and Ginetta's mother don't get along and Vincenzo is forced to find other quarters for them. Vincenzo consults a maintenance man who advises him that the family can move into an expensive apartment stop paying the rent after a month and have the City of Milan then put them into decent housing since anyone who has officially been evicted must be provided with social services by the City.'Rocco' is divided into five segments focusing on each of the brothers. The first segment involves Vincenzo whose character appears in stark contrast to his younger siblings. Whereas the newly arrived Parondis are very unsophisticated they've never seen snow before and regarded as country bumpkins by the residents of Milan Vincenzo is a virtual cosmopolitan. While he has a small part in the film Vincenzo serves two important purposes 1 He is held up as less stable than the the younger and more together domestic pillar Ciro in that he is never able to facilitate a reconciliation between his mother and inlaws and ends up marrying Ginetta more out of obligation than complete love after she accidentally becomes pregnant and 2 He ends up bumping into Nadia the prostitute in the hallway of the family's apartment building introducing her to his other brothers.The next segment focuses on Simone who is the film's evil antagonist. All good melodramas need a good villain and Simone fits the bill to a tee. He dates Nadia for only a short time before she becomes sick of him despite dumping him in Simone's mind Nadia has become his possession. Despite his professed love for Nadia Simone has no guilt feelings about seducing the cleaning store manager where Rocco works. This is after he borrows without permission an expensive shirt from the cleaners to go on his date with Nadia. What's more he steals a broach from the store manager and gives it to Nadia as a gift only to have it returned by Nadia to Rocco with a message to Simone that she doesn't want to see him ever again. For a short time Simone has some success as a local boxer but soon falls from grace.The next segment focuses on Rocco who can best be described as an 'enabler'. At the end of the film Ciro describes Rocco as a 'saint' but criticizes him for forgiving everyone for their transgressions. Rocco's character is the linchpin of the film and he's not a convincing character at all. At first he wants nothing to do with boxing as he regards it as sleazy. Rocco eventually wants to return to the South where his kindhearted nature might flourish. After joining the Army he runs into Nadia and they develop a hot and heavy relationship. This leads to the most dramatic moment in the film when Simone rapes Nadia in front of Rocco out of jealousy and Rocco in turn orders Nadia to 'go back' to Simone out of some kind of misguided filial obligation. If you believe anyone would have been so attached to his brother after spending so much time trying to show a downtrodden prostitute a new life and actually ending up transforming her then perhaps I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. I know it's supposed to be an example of a 'family tragedy' but I just don't believe anyone would have done such a thing especially after he's a direct witness to his girlfriend being raped. Equally unbelievable is the subsequent scene where Nadia is about to spit in Simone's face and tells him she'll never go back to himand then ends up kissing him and agrees to be his concubine.The next to last segment focuses on Ciro who is held up as the only welladjusted brother in the clan. He is in effect Rocco's better half. After Simone steals thousands of dollars from his former manager Rocco now a successful boxer himself has his manager guarantee money to pay Simone's debts in exchange for a contract which will obligate him to fight for another 10 years. After Simone kills Nadia Rocco keeps playing the part of the enabler by insisting that everyone in the family keep quiet. But Ciro wisely informs the police who pick Simone up for Nadia's murder. Ciro serves to restore order to the out of kilter Parondi clan. It's Ciro who also wisely tells Luca in the concluding final segment that even returning to the south the supposed fount of innocence is not a panacea to life's problems since things are constantly changing and no one can predict the outcome of what life has in store for us.'Rocco and his Brothers' is very wellacted coupled with excellent cinematography. It should have all the ingredients of a masterpiece but doesn't. That's because its main character is not believable. Sure there are plenty of people like Rocco who would bail their brothers out financially even with the knowledge they had done something wrong but to order their true love back into a destructive relationship with their brother after he just raped her that's something I couldn't believe.One sad addendum Annie Giardot Nadia who was married to Renato Salvatori Simone in real life is still alive but has Alzheimers and has no memory of her former life.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Rocco and his Brothers' begins as the Parondi clan move from their rustic life in Lucania in the southern part of Italy to the bustling northern metropolis of Milan. Head of the clan is the mother Rosaria a loud obnoxious woman who can be best described as a worry wart. She brings her four sons Rocco and Simone in their early 20s Ciro a teenager and Luca about eight to visit Vincenzo the older brother who is engaged to Ginetta played by Claudia Cardinale before she became famous. The expectation is that Vincenzo has arranged for his inlaws to put his mother and siblings up until they can obtain permanent lodging. Unfortunately Rosaria and Ginetta's mother don't get along and Vincenzo is forced to find other quarters for them. Vincenzo consults a maintenance man who advises him that the family can move into an expensive apartment stop paying the rent after a month and have the City of Milan then put them into decent housing since anyone who has officially been evicted must be provided with social services by the City.'Rocco' is divided into five segments focusing on each of the brothers. The first segment involves Vincenzo whose character appears in stark contrast to his younger siblings. Whereas the newly arrived Parondis are very unsophisticated they've never seen snow before and regarded as country bumpkins by the residents of Milan Vincenzo is a virtual cosmopolitan. While he has a small part in the film Vincenzo serves two important purposes 1 He is held up as less stable than the the younger and more together domestic pillar Ciro in that he is never able to facilitate a reconciliation between his mother and inlaws and ends up marrying Ginetta more out of obligation than complete love after she accidentally becomes pregnant and 2 He ends up bumping into Nadia the prostitute in the hallway of the family's apartment building introducing her to his other brothers.The next segment focuses on Simone who is the film's evil antagonist. All good melodramas need a good villain and Simone fits the bill to a tee. He dates Nadia for only a short time before she becomes sick of him despite dumping him in Simone's mind Nadia has become his possession. Despite his professed love for Nadia Simone has no guilt feelings about seducing the cleaning store manager where Rocco works. This is after he borrows without permission an expensive shirt from the cleaners to go on his date with Nadia. What's more he steals a broach from the store manager and gives it to Nadia as a gift only to have it returned by Nadia to Rocco with a message to Simone that she doesn't want to see him ever again. For a short time Simone has some success as a local boxer but soon falls from grace.The next segment focuses on Rocco who can best be described as an 'enabler'. At the end of the film Ciro describes Rocco as a 'saint' but criticizes him for forgiving everyone for their transgressions. Rocco's character is the linchpin of the film and he's not a convincing character at all. At first he wants nothing to do with boxing as he regards it as sleazy. Rocco eventually wants to return to the South where his kindhearted nature might flourish. After joining the Army he runs into Nadia and they develop a hot and heavy relationship. This leads to the most dramatic moment in the film when Simone rapes Nadia in front of Rocco out of jealousy and Rocco in turn orders Nadia to 'go back' to Simone out of some kind of misguided filial obligation.

	schema:reviewBody "It is quite widespread to evaluate a movie after forty or more years in terms of time test. In many cases we may claim that some movies are like wine the older they are the better they occur to be. Yet not many movies are great in the intensity of being captivating on multiple levels. This can be said about ROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI by Count Visconti a film considered not only by its director to be his best one but still appreciated by lots of viewers worldwide. Let me consider some of its strongest points that I noticed while seeing the film.The most important thing that drew my attention in ROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI was the wide range of life situations themes and feelings which one can enumerate endlessly. The viewer is truly given an insight into profound development of charming affection bitter humiliation outrageous mockery sweet desire wretched rivalry Utopian idealism cruel vengeance sad disappointment intense sorrow indefatigable disillusion upsetting despair directing themselves towards final hope. By analyzing the content and trying to identify with the characters note that it is not observing the characters but identifying with them like in classic Greek tragedies the viewers dive into life situations which at the same time can be present in their own experiences family ties unemployment social status honor social pressure plotting crimes...are they not all up to date now as they were in 1960? But this aspect cannot be separated from the characters.CHARACTER ANALYSIS. Rocco Alain Delon is an idealist a very good person but too noble to succeed in this world. He appears to be a sort of biblical king David whose pardoning and love lead him to omit the teaching example and forget those who really care for him. His brother Ciro Max Cartier however is a good realist who knows what the family means how it matters yet who does not ignore the purifying punishment for wickedness. He seems to be as good hearted as Rocco however his mind is indeed more earthly. He heads for goodness filled with honest intentions but keeping both feet firmly on the ground. Vincenzo is most individual and thanks to getting married most separated from the family. The villain brother is Simone Renato Salvatori who becomes a successful boxer but gradually turns to declining psychological strength poisoned by desire jealousy and vengeance. In between comes a poor mother Rosaria Parondi Katina Paxinou who copes with true psychological suffering of lost hope and humiliation. An interesting character is a fallen woman Nadia Annie Girardot who is as changeable and as romantic as a classical tragic female in her dreams but down to earth and desperate in her acts. When it seems possible for her to fulfill the dreams of a better life it is too late... There is so much profoundity and complexity in the movie that one could dwell in the themes for long. However let me focus on the ARTISTIC FEATURES of the movie too.Visconti's movie is a very valuable cinematic work with truly stunning cinematography perfect direction excellent script wonderful moments. Anyone who decides to see this film should not ignore three moments that appear to be the milestone of film's harmony. The first one is Rocco and Nadia on the top of Milanese cathedral where she opens her psyche to him and at the same time his reaction is like a great blow of individual reality affecting the mutual one We'll never meet again The second moment is the scene when all the family except for Simone celebrate Rocco's championship in boxing. The two bells that ring the first one being a mysterious visit the second one being Simone's entrance leave critical thoughts and conclusions. The third is the final moment when Ciro talks to their youngest brother Luca about life future and errors that should never be made again. However that is not all. There is something more that makes Visconti's film an artistic pearl PERFORMANCES.All cast do excellent jobs portraying their characters in a genuine way with a necessary invitation for viewers to identify. Alain Delon is unforgettable as Rocco gentle kind hearted sometimes weak sometimes very straightforward in personal decisions. The opposite counterpart appears to be Renato Salvatori who perfectly portrays Simone  so wild so tremendously unstable so easily led to fear addiction and tragic despair. Another performance that deserves appreciation is Katina Paxinou's in the role of mother Rosaria religious with a bit of superstition so dominant over her sons and generally so good hearted. A mention should be made of a minor role of Claudia Cardinale who plays Ginetta Vincenzo's wife.ROCCO E I SUOI FRATELLI is a must see a movie that everyone should watch profoundly addressing three levels of attention first a sole interest in Visconti being one of Neorealist directors aside DeSica Rossellini and others second the artistic side including cinematography direction charm performances third insight into both content and characters their realistic complexity humanity of life. Then these three hours of watching will not occur in vain.".

As much merit as there may have been in La Terra Trema it quickly became repetitive neorealism the family is poor they are staying poor and there is nothing they can do about it. That could have been a very interesting setting for a story but that film dragged on ad nauseam without saying anything. To boot Visconti himself provided a very pretentious and degrading narration telling the audience how horrible life can be and such. Then there was Senso. How much can I really say about Senso? Not much since I fell asleep for a significant portion of it. For one thing I despise costume dramas well any film where there is more attention paid to the costumes than to anything else I cannot stand. I had liked Valli and Farley Granger in other films but they both seemed profoundly out of place in that film. Plus I have a slight aversion to color films. Call me a snob. They just make me tired at least the older ones ca 1930s to the early 1960s maybe it's just the way the films were colored is this what Technicolor is? I just feel that the color seems so unrealistic. So to see that I was going to be forced to sit through another three hours of Luchino Visconti initially felt like a death sentence. But I tried to have an open mind. Luckily this film was quite great. Sure it is a melodrama and it never aspires to be more than a melodrama and thus succeeds in avoiding pretensions but it is a particular masterful one. For a melodrama to be successful it must involve me and Rocco and His Brothers does that. And for a three hour film to be good it must make me feel as if I have spent time with the characters on screen that I have lived a part of their lives and that I care what is happening to them. Rocco covers these bases and then some. Its characters are very fleshedout. After the first act I knew all the characters well and understood their motives. After the three hours I felt sad that I had to leave them. Not many films can do this. It is one of the greatest compliments I can think to give a film. Luchino Visconti for me has been redeemed. 910".

It struck me that by far the most sympathetic character in the film was Annie Girardot as the prostitute who has the extreme bad luck to become involved with both of the brothers played by Alain Delon and Renato Salvatore.  She rejects the bad brother Salvatore because he doesn't respect her and gives her stolen jewelry. She then begins a new and more fulfilling relationship with the good one Delon and they fall genuinely in love.  When Salvatore finds out he rapes her in a fit of jealousy and beats his brother for taking up with her. Now get this  Delon dumps her and tells her that she must go back to Salvatore because his reprehensible actions prove that he's the one who really needs her the most!  Now some have interpreted Delon's sacrifice as a saintly one but personally I thought it was just as cruel to her in its own way as anything his loathsome brother did.  Incredibly Girardot does attempt to begin another relationship with Salvatore but it is of course doomed to failure and predictable tragedy.  If she had any sense she would have left both of them!  Ultimately my impatience with the increasingly irrational and unbelievable actions of these three characters overrode my enjoyment of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am delighted to find that decades later this has lost NONE of its sweeping power and operatic splendor. Renato Salvatori should have received a shelf of acting prizes for this role  it is one of the most intense and beautiful acting jobs since Marlon Brando filmed 'Streetcar'. Close behind is the legendary role of Annie Girardot's doomed 'Nadia'. Alain Delon is heartbreaking and overwhelmed by love life all that is demanded of him by family everything.A great movie carries all before it. Claudia Cardinale is given a 'neorealist' simplicity that actually accents her beauty far better than the over made up and stylized version of herself we came to know. Katina Paxinou is a force of nature and though Magnani would have been magnificent in the role she would have been 'too Magnani'. Paxinou vanishes into the role of the mother with perfect understanding of every gesture word and shade of feeling asked of her. Even small roles  take for instance the owner of the laundry  are fabulous! SO much good acting it is almost TOO much good acting. I could describe a dozen more small roles played to perfection. Don't watch any great film for awhile till your mind and heart are good and hungry and rediscover this masterpiece.".

It was a great evening of cinema for all of us that night.Now Rocco has arrived and my feelings are mixed. I admired the romanticism of the treatment of this workingclass family even while deploring the awful acting of some characters Katina Paxinou as the mother earns my wretched earth mother award formerly held by Jane Darwell of The Grapes of Wrath Paolo Stoppa as the boxing club manager just scowls his way through the part. Alain Delon's Christlike passivity comes from the character of Myshkin in The Idiot by Dostoievsky he must be a sexual icon for Visconti as Helmut Berger would be later. Annie Girardot as Nadia gives rapidfire line readings that are no fun at all to hear she sounds like she'd taken uppers. This must be the director's faultas she's a very fine actress.That leaves Renato Salvatori. His Simone is wonderful to watch as he turns from hero to thug and homosexual prostitute far more interesting than bland Rocco or cypherlike Ciro. The scene with Roger Hanin who plays the gay fight promoter Moroni as Hanin tries to tell him he's finished is the most emotional most erotic most felt scene of the film.".

Beyond some nice black and white photography and adequate camera work I didn't see much else that even remotely justifies all the fuss. I hear Visconti was a great theatre director but directing movies is a different matter. I had to check the IMDb.com site to verify the date this movie was made. Such overacting on the part of practically all the cast made me think of silent movies that were shot back in the twenties when the actors had to compensate for the absence of sound. I watched this movie with my wife and after two rather depressing hours we both broke into a fit of giggles when right near the end 'la mamma' opens her apartment's door and there is this closeup on Simone's face. I'm OK with stereotypes but laying it on this thick is just ridiculous. I find it hard to believe anyone would come up with a film like this in... 1960 the same year Michelangelo Antonioni was filming l'Avventura  not to mention all the dazzling inventions of the French Nouvelle Vague. The only thing that I truly enjoyed about 'Rocco' was Annie Girardot's performance. I had seen her in a couple of mediocre commercial French movies such as 'Elle fume pas..' and I felt she was a natural one of these rare actors that command respect the minute they appear but I certainly never imagined that given the chance she could have been one of the greatest celluloid tragedians of all times. You may think that I am a little harsh with my four stars out of a possible ten but if not for Annie Girardot's performance I would have gone much lower.".

Their unexpected arrival instantly enkindles a wrangle with the family of Ginetta Cardinale Vincenzo's fiance. In the opening gambit Visconti manifests how he is wellversed in orchestrating a huge cast simultaneously and effectively expediting the scenes from a festive gettogether to a classic Italian verbal battle with utter precision. Milan in the eyes of the poor folks from hinterland is a city beckons with opportunities but initially the Parondis can only rent a crammed basement with all four grownup sons sleeping in the same room snowfall is their blessing as they can all earn some dough by shoveling snow. Being sturdy youngsters Vincenzo Simone and Ricco all subsequently partake in boxing an opportunistic venture and each is much abler than his elder brothers. And each brother symbolises a different situation during their disintegration of the city Vincenzo eventually manages to marry Ginetta and he is the lucky ones who is able to lead a normal life and can get out of mamma's grip Rocco is nostalgic but saintly keeps faith in family and bloodlines to the extent of foolish blindness Ciro is the upstanding youngster chooses justice before fraternity and Luca is the youngest one day he might bring the glory back to their hometown. Every family has a black sheep Simone is the second son robustly built but with the rawness of a simpleton and when the prostitute Nadia Girardot comes on the scene he falls head over heels for her and get corrupted by the allure of the cityscape and its dangerous trappings. But Nadia does not simply represent all the adverse sides of the booming city she is also granted a chance of redemption when she meets Rocco she realises she has found her guiding light but again there is no good arising from coming between two brothers Visconti's misogynous proclivity let her bear the stigma of a victim in the game when clearly audience has been invested too much in Nadia's awakening and the heartrending abandoning herself to despair where Simone's benighted jealousy is the original sin here. Annie Girardot is the MVP among a multinational cast Italian French and Greek with most of the dialogs dubbed in production who excels in reining a transcendent shift from a flighty coquette to a pathosarousing tragedy past any hope her final struggle is one of the most appalling sequences ever Visconti doesn't intend it as a twist instead he stages the scenes with imminent maliciousness and Nadia is embracing it in hope for a final settlement until the basic instinct of survival overtakes her in the futile struggle during her last breath. It is possibly Alain Delon's finest performance at the peak of his youth when his noted charming but glacial onscreen image hasn't fully come into shape his Rocco is timorous at first a mamma's boy who can do no harm to anyone until his talent in boxing surfaces he supplants Simone as the family's pillar a national hero yet his ostensible noble sacrifice in fact reveals that he is the most tragic character in the story sometimes a saintly heart can not always outdo latent selfishness. Renato Salvatori courageously takes on this unwelcome role of Simone and exudes great onscreen chemistry and tension with Girardot which turns out not just an act they became a couple in real life too additionally he is also the stimulus of a wellsuggested homoerotic vignette.An Oscarwinner FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS 1943 the veteran Greek stage thespian Katina Paxinou cannot be overlooked without mentioning as we all know parenting is a crucial factor influences children's character building being the mother of these five boys her presence is the most morally ambiguous part of the film she knows perfectly maybe unconsciously how to blackmail her sons with the overriding family value which is the keystone of her parochial beliefs Paxinou makes for a flawless Italian mamma in spite of the language barrier. Structurally ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS anticipates Visconti's another threehour epic tale THE LEOPARD 1963 810 and from any respect it is a masterpiece well deserving all the fame and admiration even though the storyline is overtly scheming on the notion nothing is more compelling like a Greek tragedy to say the least it genuinely concerns about important social issues of mass migration and a textbook paradigm of expounding on family values the Italian style.".

The story is a cracker barrel melodrama the type that would be elevated a few years later by Philip Stong in his A VILLAGE TALE also filmed by RKO in 1934. The acting in WAY BACK HOME is sincere and quaint. Stanley Fields is the perfect villain even without a moustache to twirl. The hilarious opening scene between Seth Parker and the tax man Wade Boteler was perhaps an inspiration for MGM's THE MATING GAME. Little Frankie Darro is terrific as Robbie. But the big prize goes to Bette Davis. Even amidst the triedandtrue showboat dramatics she pulls off a 100 believable emotional performance. There was no question that this girl was going places and a lot farther than Jonesport! The community sing sequences in the Parkers' parlor are perhaps the most reminiscent of a bygone era. The harmonies are wonderful and they brought a great big smile to this audience member. Finally a mention of the character Cephus. I suspect Edgar Bergen was one of the listeners of SETH PARKER and might have based his Mortimer Snerd characterization on Bennett Kilpack's Cephus. This was Kilpack's only apparent film appearance yet he became a titan in radio creating and starring in MR. KEEN TRACER OF LOST PERSONS. If WAY BACK HOME should come your way give it a chance. But put yourself in the proper mood. It must be viewed in context and without a jaded mind or stony heart!".

Fortunately by 1932 enough talking pictures had already been made for everyone to realize that sound was not necessarily a device of audience torture. This is a borderline musical with some of the worst singing you will hear this side of my shower. By the last number you will be envious of those with a serious hearing loss. Most of the viewers who stumble across this film are Bette Davis fans seeking out some of her early performances. Davis has a supporting role as the female half of the film's romantic interest. She is paired with Frank Albertson who plays a farm laborer whose mother is an outcast and whose father is a bachelor. She looks beautiful and fresh but nothing about portraying the character is challenging. It is arguably the worst early film in which she appeared.It is based on an early radio character named Seth Parker played by Phillips Lord in the film whose family are simple country folks. Sort of Ma and Pa Kettle without any comedy. The principle subject of the film is Seth's unofficially adopted son Robbie after ten years Robbie's biological father Rufus Turner is back to claim him. The theme is that a community can rise above its prejudices regarding illegitimacy and genetic parentage if it has a good example to follow. Because everyone is a caricature and the acting is so uneven this worthwhile theme is turned into a sappy and silly embarrassment.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

That just goes on way too long. Audiences of the day would have been familiar with radio personality Seth Parker kind of a Pa Kettle kind of guy. Bette Davis is Mary his daughter who is trying to figure a way to get to the barn dance. This was only Davis' fourth role and she plays it very straight forward... at twentythree she hadn't yet developed her sophisticated scheming style. Effie Palmer is Ma Parker  in one of the two films she made and both in 1931. One of the characters talks about going to Bangor Bangah presumably Maine but the only new england accent we hear is one very badlydone one. The actress playing Lizzie Sophia Lord... Phillips' actual wife was actually BORN in Connecticut so you'd think she would be more familiar with a new england accent! I guess that explains why she only overacted in this one film. Oscar Apfel from Shop around the Corner and SO many others is a minor character here but he doesn't have his usual giant twitchy mustache so you almost don't recognize him. Not at all coherent the main story seems to be Mary and David sneaking around to try to spend time together alone but Mary's father is determined to keep them apart. There's also the side story of Rufe Turner Stanley Fields trying to take his son back from the man who raised him. Again Fields' own story is quite interesting Fields had been a boxer moved into vaudeville then into films. Everyone's real life story is much more interesting than the story we are watching here. Seth and his cronies sit around and sing a beautiful version of Love's Old Sweet Song at one point but other than that there isn't much going on here. Some of the other songs used are more from the south  several Stephen Foster songs Turkey in the Straw which isn't really appropriate for a film taking place in Maine. Directed by William Seiter who worked with the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy later in his career. This wasn't one of his better films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Way Back Home and for contemporary fans the only reason it is at all memorable is that Bette Davis has a supporting role might make one wonder what people saw in it. Thinking about it you must remember in the height of the Roaring Twenties the American people elected Calvin Coolidge as president who had just such a cultural background as did the folks in Sundays At Seth Parker's. I'll bet Coolidge was a devoted listener.Phillips Lord's Seth Parker is a local community leader and preacher of sorts in a rural Maine community. In this era of no mass media things like a Sunday gathering at the preacher with some community singing was not uncommon. By the way check out Joel McCrea's Stars In My Crown also about a rural preacher in a bit earlier an era in a different part of the country. Note the community singing there among the young people.The main story in the film is that Lord and his wife Effie Palmer took in young Frankie Darro after his mom died and raised him as their own. Darro's real dad Stanley Fields has been in and out of trouble for years but now he wants to lay claim to his kid. Another subplot involves Bette Davis as a good girl being courted by Frank Albertson who as they said back in the day was born on the left side of the blanket. Mom never married dad and Davis's mom Sophie Lord won't have her daughter going out with him. Dorothy Peterson is Albertson's mom and she is shunned by a lot of the puritanical types in the town. Let's say the two strands of the plot come together and it all works out for all except Fields.I think I can safely say Way Back Home will not see a remake any time soon. As it is it's picture of a bygone era or one rustic curiosity you take your choice.".

I'll bet Coolidge was a devoted listener.Phillips Lord's Seth Parker is a local community leader and preacher of sorts in a rural Maine community. In this era of no mass media things like a Sunday gathering at the preacher with some community singing was not uncommon. By the way check out Joel McCrea's Stars In My Crown also about a rural preacher in a bit earlier an era in a different part of the country. Note the community singing there among the young people.The main story in the film is that Lord and his wife Effie Palmer took in young Frankie Darro after his mom died and raised him as their own. Darro's real dad Stanley Fields has been in and out of trouble for years but now he wants to lay claim to his kid. Another subplot involves Bette Davis as a good girl being courted by Frank Albertson who as they said back in the day was born on the left side of the blanket. Mom never married dad and Davis's mom Sophie Lord won't have her daughter going out with him. Dorothy Peterson is Albertson's mom and she is shunned by a lot of the puritanical types in the town. Let's say the two strands of the plot come together and it all works out for all except Fields.I think I can safely say Way Back Home will not see a remake any time soon. As it is it's picture of a bygone era or one rustic curiosity you take your choice.";

I can only take so much of this homespun humor and atmosphere until I am about ready to scream! Not only does the story seem exceptionally dated even for 1932 but the film is supposedly set in Maine and hardly anyone in the film speaks with the appropriate accent. In fact much of the film looks more like it was filmed in the Ozarks! The story has to do with acceptanceof an adult bastard and of a young boy who is the son of a drunk. Neither story is especially memorable but at least the story involving the drunk gets a little diverting when the old sot returns to town and demands custody of his kid. The other story involves this man and his love interest a very young Bette Daviswho gets very little to say and do that would make you think she had a sparkling career ahead.An interesting historical curio but dull and dusty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Insufferably boring this is one of those deadly dull Perils of Pauline style melodramas that were dead weight even at the end of the silent era. Every decent character seems to be a handwringing worrier and every villain is of the Snidely Whiplash variety. The lead character is a preacher Phillips Lord who takes an interest in his congregation and community so much that it is surprising that he has time to write his sermons. Juvenile Frankie Darro is the focus of his help here with the young Bette Davis in an early role as the kindly neighbor who helps him and becomes the target of Darro's evil father Stanley Fields. This shows its radio origins throughout with its creaky soap opera like structure that might have worked on radio with ironing wives listening but had no purpose being put on film other than to cash in on its radio success. At times Lord is so over the top in his purpose that he seems more like the original conception of what a few years later would become the longtime radio and television soap opera The Guiding Light. The dullness of this script indicates that the bulb needs to be changed.".
