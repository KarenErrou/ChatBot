There are allround excellent performances by all from the main characters to the supporting actors and sidekicks. The songs are classics in their own right. It leaves you with a wholesome feeling and you are likely to recommend it to others. A more catchy title would have perhaps made this movie better known that it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always thought Mr  Mrs '55 was a terrible title and surely there were better possibilities  it makes it sound pretty ordinary. Whereas it was a nice little romantic musical comedy and better than most of its contemporaries with some memorable upbeat music from O.P.Nayaar.Anita played by the gorgeous Madhubala is forced to marry Preetam played by dashing Guru Dutt purely on her aunts orders but falls in love with him  much to her aunts disgust and opposition. It's engrossing enough a story but the jaunty yet earnest songs sung by Rafi and Geeta Dutt are the thing especially Thandi Hawa my alltime favourite Madhubala moment at the lido Johnny Walker's infuriatingly catchy Jaane Kahan Mera and the RafiDutt duet Chal Diya Banda Nawaaz  beautifully sung beautiful lyrics always make me wish it had gone on another 10 minutes. Favourite bit the amazingly heartrending scene where Anita realises how much in love she is just before Udhar Tum. As a counterpoint to the overall optimism of this film it's sad to remember 9 years afterwards Dutt committed suicide at 39 and in 1969 Madhubala died of heart disease at only 36.Overall great stuff wish I had a cleaner copy and don't let the title put you off.".

	schema:headline " Timeless comedydrama from cinematic genius Guru Dutt";
	schema:reviewBody "Without giving away any of the surprises of this landmark Hindi film this movie was clearly ahead of its time in its social commentary and its subtle satirical approach of the transitioning East Indian society post independence from the British Raj. It has a delightful blend of the effects of British influence upon Indian society and traditional Indian cultural  social values. This was very well balanced by Guru Dutt. Guruji proved his versatility in handling comedy as articulately as he did melodrama. With the assistance of the ensemble of Hindi cinema greats like Abrar Alvi O. P. Nayyar Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. this movie is a another gem of the golden age of Hindi cinema. Madhubala real name Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi whose screen presence begs description delivers a performance which captures all the emotions that could ever be desired in a film heroine. After Veena 19262004 Madhubala was the most beautiful actress ever to grace the silver screen of Hindi cinema. She was one of 2 of the all time greatest heroines in the history of Hindi cinema The other was Meena Kumari real name Mahjabeen Bano.Almost as beautiful as Madhubala is the Guru Dutt protg Yasmin born Vinita Bhatt in Lahore. Breathtakingly beautiful it is incredible that Yasmin's screen career never took off. She reportedly married film technician Englishman Jimmy Vinning. Yasmin appeared in a famous song sequence in RUSTOM SOHRAB 1963 starring Prithviraj Kapoor Suraiya Premnath and Mumtaz. As terrific a natural actor Guru Dutt was he was better off behind the camera rather than in front of it. Guru Dutt was incomparable as a character actor which he proved in his own film SAHIB BIBI AUR GHULAM. With all due respect to his cinematic genius Guruji should have cast either Dilip Kumar or Dev Anand in the role of Preetam. As for the comic sidekick instead of Johny Walker Shammi Kapoor should have been cast to match the beauty of Yasmin. It almost chokes the viewer to see breathtakingly gorgeous ladies like Madhubala and Yasmin paired off with fellows like Guru Dutt and Johny Walker. JW is inimitable as a comic sidekick but in this particular film Guruji should have gone with a 5 star casting Madhubala Dilip Kumar Shammi Kapoor Yasmin. Dilip Kumar and Shammi Kapoor were a long overdue screen pairing which proved spectacular in VIDHAATA 1982. The incomparable Lalita Pawar has to be mentioned. A truly stunning beauty in her youth this veteran actress of Hindi cinema had a screen presence which elevated any film in which she appeared. And of course there is the inimitable comedienne Tun Tun. Last but not least there is the special guest appearance by the dashing Hindi film hero Al Nasir parodying a tennis superstar.Having already been cited in other reviews of this film the title of this movie could have been different. Overall this is a timeless classic from the cinematic genius of Guru Dutt.".

	schema:headline " Guru Dutt presents a hilarious comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Guru Dutt is mainly known for his thoughtprovoking profound classic movies like Pyaasa Kaagaz Ke Phool and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam. However he had directed one hilarious comedy also prior to them. Since the movie had been made in the year 1955 it was titled as Mr.  Mrs. 55. It's a classic comedy in fact a satire on the pseudowomanlib movement gaining momentum in India in the postindependence era and represents the hurt Indian malepsyche wrapped in comedy.It's based on a play  'Modern Marriage' penned by Guru Dutt's close associate Abrar Alvi. The plot is based on a malehater stern lady Seeta Devi Lalita Pawar who leads her niece  Anita Madhubala to enter into a marriage of convenience with an unemployed and impoverished cartoonist  Preetam Guru Dutt so that she can legally occupy the inherited estate left by her father under a condition in the will that she will have to marry. A staunch feminist Seeta Devi is strictly against the institution of marriage and makes a deal with Preetam to divorce Anita after the purpose of hers becoming the legal heiress of the estate is served and never try to behave like a husband with her during the intermittent period. However the simplicity and ideals of Preetam alongwith a view of the happy wedded life of his sister Kum Kum who is a housewife make Anita fall in love with him. But Seeta Devi tells her that Preetam has married her only for money to be paid to him under the contract she gets distanced with him. Finally the story reaches its happy ending with the union of the married couple on the airport when disheartened Preetam is about to leave Mumbai then Bombay forever.The script of Abrar Alvi is full of laughtergenerating sequences and Guru Dutt has directed them so ably that it is hard to believe that the same director later directed movies like Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool. Guru Dutt's sense of humour proves to be just amazing. There is not a single boring moment in the movie and this comedycumsatire keeps the audience hooked throughout. The viewer just keeps on flowing with the twists and turns of the story quite like a rudderless vessel going alongwith the drifting tides. And when the story reaches its happy climax the viewer gets the feeling of the vessel's touching the shore.The story and its treatment subtly caters to the Indian malechauvinism which was dominant those days no less even today. However the brighter side is that it exposes the hollowness of the socalled womanlib movement. Woman's liberation does not mean dilution of the importance of man in her life. After all the world runs through the eternal love of male and female only. Who of these two is complete without the other one ? None definitely. And the taunting at the halfbaked womanlib philosophy is not at all a direct hit. It is enveloped in a laughriot. Guru Dutt has directed the story with so much finesse that nowhere it is felt that it's an attempt to establish the superiority of man over woman. The cartoon made by Preetam showing Seeta Devi clad in a Roman toga and riding a Roman chariot with a whip in her hand is an example of the height of Guru Dutt's creativity.O.P. Nayyar's music is a treat to listen for the music lovers. The songs include melodies like Thandi Hawa Kaali Ghata Jaane Kahaan Mera Jigar Gaya Jee Chal Diye Banda Nawaaz Udhar Tum Haseen Ho Idhar Ham Jawaan Hain Aye Ji Dil Pe Hua Aisa Jadoo and likewise sung by Geeta Dutt Shamshaad Begum and Mohammed Rafi. My favourite song is a Qawwaali sung by Manna Dey and others  Meri Duniya Lutt Rahi Thi Aur Main Khamosh Tha whose lyric is able to move any sensitive heart. The beautiful words of the songs have been written by Majrooh Sultaanpuri.V.K. Moorthy's cinematography is great like always. This black and white movie is a visual treat also showing the life of Bombay of the fifties in a realistic yet aesthetic way. Editing is also quite good and the production value is definitely according to the prestige of Guru Dutt's banner.Guru Dutt proves once again that he's not only a director and narrator par excellence but also an outstanding actor. He has infused life into the role of the poor cartoonist who has been in love with the rich heiress without any greed for her wealth. Lalita Pawar's role is definitely tailormade for her. Johnny Walker was an integral part of Guru Dutt's movies and he has generated sufficient laughters for the audience in collaboration with Yasmen starring opposite him. However this is Madhubala's movie by all means. Her transformation from an ultramodern girl to a traditional Indian girl is heartwarming and she has underscored the fact that other than being one of the most beautiful women of India in fact the world she's a brilliant actress too.I recommend this movie to one and all because it provides wholesome entertainment. However Guru Dutt's mocking of the womanlib movement may be felt as offensive by the educated ladies in the contemporary context. This movie had been made as the name clarifies more than five and a half decades back. Since then enough water has flown in the river of time. Now we cannot mock womanlib philosophy in that way and it's not desirable too.".

Nayyarhelmed songs that you will always cherish. What I took away is one particular scene. Keep in mind I was a school kid then. There is this serious monologue by Gurudutt. He speaks of the sad fate of people and that they don't have roti to eat. Madhubala listens too all this and then adds her two cents  If people don't have roti to eat why don't they eat bread.

The first thing i noticed about the film is the photography. If this were a Hollywood movie i would expect to see it in a Gothic movie perhaps directed by Orson Welles and photographed by Greg Toland. So imagine if you will a Gothic musical at least in appearance. But this isn't a depressing movie. Although I did wonder if it might turn out that way. The songs are terrific. The lead actor has a suavity about him  that had elements of people of Ronald Colman or William Powell. My favorite character was the large lady.".

The plot line and acting by all the main characters keeps one engrossed and entertained. The hero Guru Dutt displays the combination of vulnerability and cynicism a mix of Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart that is perfect for his character. The heroine Madhubala is breathtakingly beautiful and carries the role of the spoilt heiress with effortless ease. The lady who plays her aunt is quite convincing and does not go overboard in her histrionics. Overall a movie that seamlessly combines witty comedy breezy romance and natural acting. The BW cinematography is stunning especially in the duet song where the heroine is upstairs and the hero is in the garden.".

A still very young Heinz Rhmann Germany's Jack Lemmon is starring.SPOILER ALERT Contrary to what I read somewhere this movie is not a premake' of D.O.A. The story has however a certain similarity with Aki Kaurismki's I Hired a Contract Killer. The movie is fast very fast. Others would have made a two hour feature with the story this one takes 56 minutes in all. It starts straight away with our young hero trying to shoot a bullet into his head. No explanation whatsoever is given as to his motives  moviegoers in the Germany of 1931 obviously did not need any. He is disturbed by a burglar and puts a contract on himself so to speak. The burglar tells him that he will hit him in the near future and dutifully makes a cross on his back with a piece of chalk  not unlike the M' in Fritz Lang's movie of the same year. With the cross on his back the young hero goes to a nightclub  and falls in love with a young girl. Of course he tries to rescind from the contract and desperately looks for the burglar only to learn that he had passed on the job to a subcontractor! Not just any subcontractor but the very same Jim the man with the scar as he solemnly declares.In this movie German Expressionism meets American slapstick. The result is a very entertaining picture with dark humor that verges on the abyss of desperation. You feel that its makers had great fun doing it. The sound effects are hilarious. The wind sounds like the wind machine in a movie studio and you have the impression that it is done that way on purpose. Watch for a hilarious ride in an ambulance with its grotesquely accelerated sequences. The Berlin of the early 30ies flits past in quirky angles.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a story that is not in the least original. It had been one before 1931 and it has done many times since  the man who wants to commit suicide hires someone to kill him and then changes his mind. The first occurrence I know of is in the Jules Verne story Les Tribulations d'un chinois en Chine in 1879 which appears to have been the inspiration for Ernst Neubach who provided the idea for the script whether he actually wrote a play on the subject seems uncertain. Much the same idea had already been used in a US film Douglas Fairbanks' Flirting with Fate in 1916. The strength of this film is not therefore in its story nor in the writing in itself which is relatively not very special so much as in the general organization of the film mise en scne sound scenery acting style which is absolutely outstanding.To appreciate how good it is just look at a version for the same story that Neubach himself directed in 1952 Man lebt nur einmal. Despite the fact that Neubach employed set designer Emil Hasler who had worked on some classics of the Weimar period inc. M and The Blue Angel and on the excellent 1943 film Mnchhausen it is a very very ordinary and uninteresting farce and frankly painfully unfunny. It was simply impossible in fifties Germany to create the style of the brilliant prewar years as Fritz Lang would also discover on his return. Neubach had actually made the film in exile in France too in 1949 as On demande un assassin with Fernandel but this I have not seen.This is not a silent film but belongs to a special category of film for which as far as I know we have no name  films made in the thirties that employed sound often as here in very interesting and inventive ways not primarily for the purpose of dialogue which is often minimal or as incidental score but as an element of mise en scne a part simply of the general ambiance of the film while still retaining the visual values of silent films. Apart from the entirely exceptional case of Chaplin Modern Times this was a style unknown in the US  Von Sternberg is to some extent an exception  and US films that hesitate involuntarily between silent and sound are simply badly made films poor sound quality stilted overenunciated dialogue too much dialogue etc. But there are some very fine and important examples pf this mixed style both in France Clair's 1931  nous la libert is a perfect example as well as being an influence on Chaplin and in Germany. The style is associated to some extent with the great directors of the silent era Jean Epstein for instance but also more surprisingly with a younger generation who had only just started making films at the end of that era like the Siodmak or Clair or Machaty in Czechoslovakia and in some cases with filmmakers who had never made a silent film Jean Vigo for instance in France. It can also be observed less markedly but to some extent in the great classics of these years M The Blue Angel La Chienne. It is a style in other words that produced some of the greatest masterpieces of cinema.Robert and Curt Siodmak and Billy Wilder as a team until their enforced departure for the US proved unsurprisingly real artists in the genre having also produced the wonderful silent masterpiece Menschen am Sonntag the year before this.Even if we are missing the beginning of the film explaining why the central character wishes to kill himself this film still stands as a fine example of this mixed style of the early thirties. Beautiful expressionistic sets something of a revival by this time in Germany mildly stylized acting in fact more accurately a typical mix of the stylized and the naturalistic superbly ironic use of sound.Had the rise of Hitler not destroyed he German film industry the style might have survived as a natural bridge between the golden age of European film in the late twenties and the new wave of the sixties. It does to a certain extent in French poetic realism early Renoir Carn etc and in the films of Sacha Guitry but in Germany it died the death while the Germans Austrians and Hungarians fleeing to the US had no choice but to accept the more banal strictures of US realist style.As is also the case with silent films later illadvised sound remakes of mixed style films are nearly always inferior and often vastly inferior to the originals.".

The director is Robert Siodmak also only around the age of 30 who went on to become one of Germanys most influential filmmakers in the decades afterward. The story here is about a young man who wants to die but does not have the guts to commit suicide. As a consequence he makes a contract with a criminal according to which he has to kill him in the next 12 hours. However unluckily for Rhmann's character or luckily? he falls in love and makes some great new friends at the same time so he and the new people in his life try their best to find the killer before he can commit his horrible deed. But right when they do they realize another criminal has entered the picture. This film runs originally 90 minutes but sadly only 50 minutes of this movie still exist. Quite a pity as I would have liked to see the rest as well. Anyway even at 50 minutes it felt like an entertaining watch. Despite the somewhat serious background this is a 100 comedy movie as with pretty much all of Rhmann's early work. I recommend the watch. Go check it out.".

With a title like that you've already made up your mind about if you want to see it. But keep this in mind...Snakes On A Plane isn't a comedy movie. It isn't a horribly cheesy or bad intentionally or not movie either or one that's so bad it's good which is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in SOAP discussions. Also the movie's not all about Samuel L. Jackson being a badass or swearing a lot although it happens. Snakes On A Plane is a entertaining midgrade thriller movie that pretty much delivers what you'd expect from a Hollywood movie about snakes on an airplane. No more no less.Don't see this movie if you're expecting to constantly laugh at Samuel L. Jackson showing off how cool he is. There are plenty of moments where Sam kicks ass and gives some great oneliners and does amusing things but he is offscreen just as often as he is on it.Snakes On A Plane isn't the best movie of the year. It's not the funniest movie of the year or the scariest but it is a good movie if you're looking for mindless fun involving a lot of snakes on an airplane some gratuitous gore and nudity and a few great Samuel L. Jackson moments check it out.".

But I think any more sensible member of the general public will tell you that SOAP is nothing more than a mildly competent action movie. It's not hysterically funny. It's not scary. It's occasionally exciting. And it sure ain't a 10 on the IMDb scale.Don't misunderstand me I had fun watching the movie. I was even willing to be generous until I saw the outrageously high rating on this site and all the strangely gushing reviews. Frankly I'm a bit astonished. Why heap such praise on this particular film? If you love camp overthetop action movies then why not worship a camp action film that's actually good? Wrath of Khan springs to mind  also Batman. The truth is that parts of SOAP are pretty lame. Samuel L. Jackson is good but his role is weirdly small. And aside from his one power catchphrase most of his dialog is banal and dull. The rest of the actors aren't even worth commenting on since they're stuck with stock and boring funny characters.Speaking of dull how many different ways can snakes really kill someone? They hiss...they lunge...they bite...over and over and over again. It's not particularly cinematic. And most of them are fake CGI anyway so they're not even remotely frightening.Face it the only reason to see this is because it's camp and bad. It's part of the whole culture of worshiping lame junk that's prevalent right now. It's hip to like terrible garage bands and lame movies because people are either too impatient or too unsophisticated to take the time to absorb entertainment that's actually artistic. So we watch and listen to junk and imagine that we're superior to it and that makes us feel good. Apparently. Is there anything wrong with liking junk? Not really  I review and praise junk on this site all the time. But putting junk on a pedestal? That's very very wrong.Sermon over.".

If you enjoy any of the following then this movie is for you gruesome deaths breasts cheesy physical humor Samuel L. Jackson or venomous reptiles. If not then you clearly have a vagina but may still manage to enjoy SoaP.Plot is pretty thin something generic about a kid Nathan Phillips who witnessed a mob murder and has to be transported to L.A. to testify in court but I doubt anyone will mind. We know the basic story. There is a plane in the air that has both venomous snakes and Samuel L. Jackson on board. Samuel L. Jackson defeat snakes in a number of thoroughly awesome ways which I will not reveal as to not diminish their awesomeness and simultaneously deals with whiny stereotypical frightened passengers. Trust me though seeing the snakes rampaging through the plane and wreaking havoc on said stereotypical passengers is indeed sweet.The acting is as solid as one could hope for from this cast.

Keenan Thompson actually doesn't suck Nathan Phillips was solid enough and Julianna Margulies did a fine job.Honestly I can think of no reason not to see Snakes on a Plane. Sure the critics will lambaste it left and right. There's no doubt about that. However coming from someone who is ready to accept the film for what it is I can honestly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate its nostalgic cheeseball appeal.All things considered Snakes on a Plane will undoubtedly be the most enjoyable and the most unlikely blockbuster of the summer.

Snakes some gore and Sam Jackson. The plot is simple enough. A man is witness to a murder by a crime lord and Sam Jackson is an FBI agent protecting the witness until he can get to LA from Hawaii to testify. Snakes are released on the plane in midflight and chaos ensues. I would recommend this film. It's fun funny and extremely entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my god. I think I might still be a little excited since I just got back from the advance screening of Snakes on a Plane. I want to preface this review by saying that IT'S NOT SERIOUS. DO NOT go to this film expecting to see some great dramatic film because you'll be let down. However if you want to go and see Samuel L. Jackson kick the holy sht out of snakes on a plane then this is the film for you. It's dumb Bmovie summer fun and it delivered it by the truckload. It knows it isn't serious with that title how could it be and honestly the whole time everyone involved is just having FUN with it. So go sit back have fun and see some snakes on a plane.The plot on this badboy is razor thin with a pathetic throwaway villain. After witnessing a murder Sean Nathan Phillips is taken into protective custody by the FBI and more specifically Jackson's Neville Flynn. He has to be flown from Hawaii to LA to testify and blah blah blah. Who cares right? No one seriously NO ONE. Our villain Eddie Kim is worthless. We get two minutes or so of screen time from him. He's not the villain the SNAKES are the villains!!!!! The real fireworks start when we GET ON THAT PLANE. You all know what's going to happen so they don't waste much time building up to it. Eventually the snakes on the plane are released. People are bitten in hilarious and very painful fashion. Samuel L. Jackson has to control the situation in that badass way that only he can and he disposes of the snakes in downright hilarious ways which I won't spoil you have to see it to believe it. Most of your characters are generally stereotypes and some of the acting is wooden. Most of the characters are very clichd and stupid as well and they don't do the most logical things in the situations they are presented. But that's not what you care about. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT! What is important is the fact that there are SNAKES... ON A PLANE! It's cheesy Bmovie fun and don't let anyone tell you any different. You want to see snakes on a plane you're going to see snakes on a plane. Period. It also plays homage to some Jackson flicks of old I'll let you decide which ones since the scenes are obviously set up in that way. Try to think of other films Jackson has been in with reptiles.The special effects were PRETTY good it was obvious when you were looking at a CGI snake or a real snake that much I can tell you. But it didn't matter. It doesn't take you out of the movie at all. The action is as good as you can expect from people whooping snakes and viceversa. It was a good thriller they kept it moving and didn't slow down and they kept the tension riding high throughout the film. And it's FUNNY. It's funny if you expect it to be cheesy fun and it is and I was constantly laughing throughout. Even as snakes on a plane are killing people you're laughing at it. It was just that good.I don't know what else I can say about this except that if you have the chance SEE THIS FILM OPENING WEEKEND. Get a crowd in there that wants to have good dumb popcornmovie fun and you will have a blast. My theater was off the hook and it's seriously the most fun I've had at the movies in longer than I can remember. Go into this film knowing what it is and watch it with exactly that in mind and you'll have a GREAT time. Expect nothing from it and just let yourself have fun for a couple of hours. This film won't be the darling of the critics it wasn't prescreened because the makers KNOW what this film is and what they expect from it. I can't think of another instance where a film drew this kind of buzz on its title alone and where everyone who went to see it completely knew it was going to be so bad it's good. And it really is. Kudos to the studio that ordered reshoots after all the buzz on the internet kicked in it really shines. And thanks for the line which is quoted at the head of the review. Everyone in my theater said it with him and EVERYONE was cheering.Snakes on a Plane has landed. And it's good summer fun. With snakes. On a plane. Eight out of ten stars.Sgt. Fluffy".

It's the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it. Yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness. We got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles. It doesn't even qualify as a sobadit'sgood movie. It's just plain bad. Very very bad. Here's why look away if you're spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. OK I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but I think I grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene. Oh and a guy witnesses it. So we already have our ultraevil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy. Cue Hero. Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish i.e. Hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily. Cue first plot hole. How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was or that he'd watched the murder. Perhaps this and the answers to all my plothole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema but I doubt it. In fact I'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese. So the 'plot' a very generous word to use. Good guy must get to LA evil guy would rather he didn't Hero Sam stands between the two. Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane. As I said no more poking at plot holes I'll just leave it there. Passenger plane. Next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is  Snakes. Yay! Oh pause. First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. Hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits eh? cute kids and Jo Brand. For all you Americans that's an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. Now that we've met the cast let's watch all of them die except of course the cute kids. Don't expect anything original it's just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body. Use your imagination since the filmmakers obviously didn't use theirs.So that's most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending. As expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face. Yep Icecool Sammy included. But wait we're not all off the plane yet! The last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things. Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr. Jackson's hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to. So Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop. At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort. But no. In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest. How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the film.Actually we're not quite done yet. After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress good guy with Tiffany token Black guy with token White girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia it's time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!! Nope it wasn't at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll. Yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times. That's it. This is the first time I've ever posted a movie review but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography. If you like planes snakes Samuel L.Jackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or English people then please please don't see this movie. It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again. Go see United 93 instead. THAT was good.".

There may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audience's friend giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them.

The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.Isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach?

Well thank god for us because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.So yes I had fun at the movie  a midnight showing fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere. Like Christmas everyone seemed determined that they would have fun no matter what. There was laughter but I don't know if it was with the film or at the film. With a film as calculated as this one is that even a meaningful distinction? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film. Samuel L. Jackson gives a welljudged performance pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure. Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.The stock characters are to be expected but the total lack of suspense isn't. What's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace? There are several snakejumpsout moments but they're incredibly badly staged. Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat. The demise of the honeymoon couple for instance is shamefully botched. Most of the actors fail to make an impression it's a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far short.There are worse movies but there are many many better another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'Lake Placid' and it's as apt a contrast as any I can think of. That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent the jokes were funny the suspense sequences were scary and it wasn't devised by committee. That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus. I don't need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.This film will in time fade to become a mere footnote in film history. If it sets a precedent however I'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time. In all probability nothing much will come of it. Perennial popcorn favourites  'Raiders of the Lost Ark' 'Alien' 'Halloween' and of course 'Star Wars'  just aren't produced by groupthink.In the mean time I'll tell you what  I haven't half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.".

In fact I spent most of the movie working on my handheld PC while my family watched. Of coarse the kids liked it hellthey would like anything. I have recently made myself sit down with the DVD and watch it thoroughly and I have to go with original feelings on this. Did the producers in some odd way want this to be funny? There are so many stupid things in this movie that would never happen. Oh and the acting is HORRIBLE. Sam is usually the man but not in this one. This movie sucked from the awful acting of the prosecutor's killer in the beginning to the fake as hell landing of the airplane in the end. And why would someone intentionally shoot out the windows of an airplane? All od the other negative comments which I have read in the SOAP comments area are true!! I sit through movies that I don't like with my kids all the time but can still find the humor in them but nothing even remotely in any way shape or form of this movie was any good at all. This movie is horrific....Awful awful awful!!!!!!!!".

Five stars out of ten sounds about right and is perhaps a bit generous.But I came out of the movie with a smile on my face because it was fun. The audience was really really into it. When the title of the movie appeared everyone cheered I haven't seen that happen in a movie theater since Episode 1. Every overthetop death by snake was cheered and applauded. The people who were going to die were fairly easily identified and people eagerly awaited their death scenes. In a nod to the movie writers I expected one character to die for being a complete jerk and they surprised me by having that character survive. And as could be expected when SLJ delivers his muchdiscussed line towards the end of the film the audience cheered throughout its entire delivery. I laughed it was just fun to listen to the audience.This is not a movie you download via BitTorrent. This is not a movie you watch on cable or rent via DVD. This is a movie you watch in a crowded movie theater. Because only then will it be fun only then will the energy of the movie and the audience make the experience worthwhile.".

He just made the film seem more out of place. I would expect an unknown lead in a film of this poor quality. The only good thing about the film was the special effects but the fact that they involved unbelievable killer snakes took away any enjoyment of this. To top it all off the pathetic attempt at shock factor the snakes attacking rude or bizarre body parts was laughable and I honestly couldn't care a less whether anyone survived.I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this was given such a high score  I imagine it must be the same people who voted for the film Gerry!".

I was blown away by the twisted tale that unraveled in front of me. After seeing a 3D horror movie featuring a stuffed white rabbit siblings Kiriko and Daigo begin seeing it in a lifesized form. The giant creature stalks them and seems to be trying to tell them something. What is the rabbit attempting to communicate to them and what sort of psychological doorways will it open?Director Shimizu told me Tormented 3D was a companion piece to his film The Shock Labyrinth 3D. I never realized how much it relied on The Shock Labyrinth 3D until I saw it again. It's basically the trigger for all the misery Daigo and Kiriko suffer through in this movie. It's the proverbial key that unlocks the dark recesses of their minds.I know the idea of a giant white bunny rabbit running around grabbing people and stalking them might sound absurd. Trust me when I tell you Shimizu takes the seemingly goofy concept and twists it around in your psyche to the extent that you'll never want to participate in an Easter Egg Hunt or read the story of Peter Cottontail ever again.If you love Asian cinema Tormented 3D is an essential addition to your collection. It's not likely you'll only watch the film once as it takes several viewings to truly take everything in that it offers visually. This is so much more than a typical horror film and offers an emotional journey as well as a thrill ride.".

His latest Tormented is actually a direct sequel to Shock Labyrinth although there is very little talk of the two films being connected. While Labyrinth was fine it was a bit all over the place and was received mixed reviews.

With his father lingering on the brink of insanity and his sister struggling between life and death the boy sinks ever deeper into the bizarre relationship leading to a shocking series of events. While this works fine as a standalone film it will make more sense if you see Shock Labyrinth. In this film the main characters see the previous film in the theater and have supernatural consequences in regards to the rabbit aspect. From there this film pretty much goes its own path using the rabbit symbolism to an even bigger scale. This film is better structured than its predecessor which may be why they tried to create an all new film experience and succeeded. The imagery of human sized stuffed rabbit is really disturbing creating an unnerving film experience if you really see what is going on. There are some really cool uses of the rabbit to create some strange moments that builds the bizarre nature of this film.Takashi has once again delivered a thought provoking film that works even if it is a bit confusing and out there. That is most likely the reason it does work and is way better than the previous film. If you've enjoyed his previous films then you will be sure to enjoy this bizarre tale. While not all that scary there are some strange moments that come off a bit creepy making it work well. It's recommended you check out the Shock Labyrinth prior to watching this but if not you will not have any issues following it but it will create a broader understanding of what is happening.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have resisted watching this film for a long time I remember cringing when watching Steve Martin in the remake of 'Father of the Bride' and did not wish to see an actor I enjoy suffering so again. Well this also was not a patch on the original but that said there was nothing wrong with Steve Martin's performance he does well with the material as indeed do all the performers. In fact this is well directed and a fine film technically it is just that the script is unbelievably awful warning there may be slight spoilers This is a film about family values yet it has been written by people who clearly don't understand family values. There is no family spirit no feeling that with the exception of the parents any of the family members cares about anyone but themselves. Of course children can be selfish of course families have offdays but at the end of it all they pull together that's what it means to be part of a family. This family didn't pull together it was self destructive to an absurd degree. I come from a big family I have a big family and one thing I know as does anyone who is or has been part of a big family is that big families need discipline. When you have more children than you have hands you have to know that your children will do what they are told when it matters this is fundamental it is simple survival. The major calamities the scenes of complete mayhem these at least rang true but where was the aftermath the parents seemed to accept it as there lot to be the butt of their children's nasty pranks. I don't mean to be overtly moral but for this film to have worked it needed to have a moral backbone there needed to be a demonstrable upside to helping each other and a realisation that when hurt was done that this was bad unfortunately this was missing even to the point that we the audience were meant to think it funny that one of the children was nicknamed Fed Ex to signify that he did not fit in. The first time it was sort of funny but when it kept happening and was not challenged it became unpleasant. At least here there was a consequence but there was no acceptance of guilt on the part of the main perpetrator and there was no evident remorse.If you watch this film I am sure there are odd moments of high comedy that will appeal but unfortunately that is probably all. There is no pathos no feelgood emotional payoff. The ending is deeply disappointing. The parents give up. All they needed was for the children to help for two weeks but that was too much for this loveless family so the parents give up their dreams and accept the easy course. What sort of lesson is this? If threatened with difficulty if the right thing to do is too hard  Give up! This film does not have a nice message. I find it deeply worrying that there are so many favourable reviews. On reading some of these I am relieved to find that their authors clearly took other things from this film who knows they may be right perhaps I have misinterpreted the content. There are others however who seem to have read the same message as I but see no wrong in it this I find disturbing!".

When Tom a football coach gets a job offer to coach a college football team just outside of Chicago and Kate's book about raising 12 children finally gets a publishing offer they see bright things for their future. The only problem is that their 12 children do not want to move from their rural Illinois home and things become nearly disastrous when Kate has to leave for a couple weeks to promote her book.While I didn't enjoy Cheaper By The Dozen as much as the original version of the film from 1950 the 2003 reimagining is still a 9 out of 10 for me the original was a 10 out of 10 for me. It's a reimagining rather than a remake because although the overall plot arc has some similarities these are two very different films with very different messages and very different kinds of families. Both are rather cartoonish which works for meI don't require much realism in my films. For anyone who is looking for something primarily believable Cheaper By The Dozen may not fit the bill.The major change from the original to the new film is a change from control to nearchaos. In the Baker's case it doesn't take long to realize that the chaos arises from their lack of disciplining their children. While this may not be realistic surely anyone planning to have a family this large would realize that discipline and control would be necessary to not have one's home destroyed it does lead to a lot of comic situations and that's really the point here. Yes there is a message in the end about putting family first but what director Shawn Levy really wants you to do is laugh. My wife and I laughed quite a bit while watching the film so Levy accomplished his goal with us. My only slight complaint on this end was that some of the funniest material involved the eldest Baker daughter's boyfriend Hank Ashton Kutcher and he just wasn't in the film enough. The material about the Shenk's neighbors of the Baker's was also funny and a bit underused. This was the reason for lowering my score 1 point.The rest of the cast is good although like the original Cheaper By The Dozen we barely get to know some of the children but that's understandable when we have to deal with 14 characters as well as ancillary characters. Steve Martin was excellent as always I enjoy his work in even his less popularly appreciated films and although Hilary Duff as daughter Lorraine Baker seemed a bit odd in the context of the family I enjoyed her performance a lot also. There's something about her that I like and it's not just her looks.".

	schema:headline " 'Name Only' Remake of 1950 Classic is Warm Funny Film...";
	schema:reviewBody "While the CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN opening titles credit the authors of the bestselling book the original 1950 film was based on Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey don't expect to see a remake of the charming early20th century comedy about two efficiency experts Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy running a complex but happy family...and this is not a BAD thing!While the 1950 production is a minor classic the thrust of the earlier film was with the parents and oldest daughter the late Jeanne Crain. Clifton Webb was a gifted acerbic actor best known previously as 'child hating' author Lynn Belvedere who proved he was as adept at raising children as he was at EVERYTHING he attempted in the 1948 hit SITTING PRETTY. The film was such a success that two sequels were made and Webb would do several more 'family' comedies before his death in 1966. Playing Frank Bunker Gilbreth the father of twelve was a 'natural' for the actor and the 61year old Webb 'stole' the film with his selfeffacing 'scientific' approach to child rearing. As his wife Lillian Myrna Loy who had graduated from being 'Nora Charles' in the Thin Man series to being Hollywood's favorite wifemom shared Bonnie Hunt's sweetness sense of organization and dry humor but lacked a sexual chemistry with Webb that would have actually produced twelve children perhaps because of the less 'permissive' time the film was made or perhaps because of Webb's screen persona. Jeanne Crain one of 20th Century Fox's favorite ingnues for over six years had a large fan base which the studio capitalized on She was actually secondbilled in the film behind Webb. Her scene at a 1920's prom with Webb as her 'date' is a film highlight. While the eleven other children were given 'moments' in the film they barely registered individually.Would 2003 audiences have gone to see Martin in a period comedy set eighty years earlier? I doubt it. And had the original story had been simply 'updated' would it have been truly faithful to the source even in spirit? Unlikely as so much has changed over the years. Ultimately the film makers erred I believe in using the title of the earlier film but not in the approach of making a 'familyfriendly' comedy about a household of massive proportions.With Steve Martin who has become Hollywood's quintessential 'Dad' as a loving unconventional fatherfootball coach given an opportunity to head his alma mater's team he displays the same kind of sensitivity that made PARENTHOOD such a wonderful film. Bonnie Hunt as his wife is completely believable as a successful author who could handle her large family and stillfrisky husband equally well. She is as always a treasure!The children are really the stars of the film though and each is special and individual from the eldest daughter Piper Perabo who at 22 wants the family to accept the guy she's living with Ashton Kutcher in a funny brief role to the youngest pair of twins Brent and Shane Kinsman who make an art out of wreaking havoc. Tom Welling is quite likable and proves that he is more than just 'Clark Kent' For you trivia fans Kutcher almost got the part of 'Superman' in an upcoming film which would have put two 'Men of Steel' in the cast. The only discordant note is Hillary Duff's annoyingly brittle second daughter she may be a 'teen idol' but she is more grating than endearing.Director Shawn Levy's previous film JUST MARRIED was a loud unpleasant clichd bore in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN he redeems himself with a more enjoyable richer film.While the movie will never earn the 'classic' status the earlier film achieved it stands very well on it's own merits!".

Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey don't expect to see a remake of the charming early20th century comedy about two efficiency experts Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy running a complex but happy family...and this is not a BAD thing!While the 1950 production is a minor classic the thrust of the earlier film was with the parents and oldest daughter the late Jeanne Crain. Clifton Webb was a gifted acerbic actor best known previously as 'child hating' author Lynn Belvedere who proved he was as adept at raising children as he was at EVERYTHING he attempted in the 1948 hit SITTING PRETTY. The film was such a success that two sequels were made and Webb would do several more 'family' comedies before his death in 1966.

Although not faithful to the original this movie keeps the spirit of the original in that it shows family as the most important thing while still laughing at the humor of everyday life.The supporting cast is excellent! All of the actors playing the Baker kids deliver excellent performances. Most notable are Hilary Duff The Lizzie McGuire Show and Tom Welling Smallville. Hilary is great as always and gets to show that she has true potential as a dramatic actress. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher but I must admit that he delivers an absolutely hilarious uncredited supporting part.This movie is a treat for any family. Most parents will find it acceptable for their kids. The only really offensive portion is some thematic elements involving the oldest 20something daughter's living with a guy. This however is portrayed as an improper thing by her parents. Overall an excellent and surprisingly clean movie. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone!".

	schema:reviewBody "Steve Martin the former wild and crazy guy stars in yet another remake of a classic comedy. This was exactly why the movie didn't do as well in the theaters and that's a shame. There are movies that should not be remade and yet are remade anyway. You would think that an old family movie which inspired The Brady Bunch nearly 20 years later would be one of them. Surprisingly this is a superior remake unlike the 1999 version of The OutofTowners.Bonnie Hunt No matter how good she is in anything everything she touches turns to rust. Would somebody please give me a reason why? The whole movie seems to revolve around the success of Tom  Kate BakerMartin and Hunt as Kate finishes writing her book about that huge family of theirs and Tom is offered a job to coach football at his alma mater the latter of which means they need to move out. Just as the original did the remake works because of the antics of the kids. And here they arePiper Perabo as the oldest daughter Nora who doesn't have to suffer from the overcrowding of her family but does have to suffer with Hank a vain actor boyfriend played by Ashton Kutcher. Hilary Duff tries to break her typecasting as Lizzie McGuire but it's going to be quite difficult. Still it should be noted that Lorraine is far more vain than Lizzie although not as bitchy as Ashlie Brillault's Kate.Tom Welling as the oldest son Charlie hates his father as much as he hates being in a big family and being moved to a new school where all the snotnosed kids insult and harass him  Lorraine make things much worse.Forrest Landis is Markaka FedEx the nerdy outcast of the family who when the family moves is left to sleep in his own room...and it's a COOL room. I was happy when I got my own bedroom at five years old but with a secret escape andor disposal hatch like that who wouldn't be jealous?Alyson Stoner. I MUST repeat that name  ALYSON STONER! If you liked her in Missy Elliot's music video's you'll lover her as Sarah Baker. Whether it's plotting against babysitters dipping Hank's underwear in meat or defending her siblings from bullies this girl is the coolest of the 12 Baker kids. Not even Mara Wilson compares to this girl and she was one hell of a child actress. An unfortunately deleted scene featuring Eileen Brennan as an ailing nanny who boasts 12 years with the FBI. It was actually good enough that they should've left it in. And how about the closing theme What Christmas Should Be by Miss Duff? A decent message even if totally impossible.All in all it's still worth seeing despite the family sappiness and lack of an original storyline. Don't be ashamed to give it a try.".

	schema:headline " Another PGrated family comedy that forgets about the laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie just yesterday knowing that Steve Martin was in it but not knowing that it was a remake of a movie from 1950 and both films were adapted from a book of the same name until after I came home from the video store and looked it up. So I obviously can't say I've ever read the book or seen the original film adaptation but I'm thinking they're both better liked than this remake. Before watching this 2003 version I knew that it certainly didn't have the worst reputation a comedy film can have but also knew that it generally wasn't considered that great so I didn't have very high expectations. Still I thought it could turn out to be a mixed blessing with some really funny parts and some unfunny ones but I didn't even get that.Tom and Kate Baker both wanted eight kids when they got married but due to several factors they have ended up with twelve! They now live in a large rural home in Midland Indiana with their offspring. When Tom gets an offer to coach the Stallions meaning he will get to fulfill his old dream of being a head football coach he happily takes it but this means the family will have to move to Chicago which none of the twelve siblings are happy about. Nonetheless the family does move into another large house in a Chicago suburb and this causes some dysfunction. Kate's dream also comes true when she is informed that the book she has written will be published. She has to go to New York to promote her book leaving Tom to look after all the kids on his own and he soon finds that it is VERY difficult trying to keep them under control! It also looks like Kate will be gone longer than originally expected for a book tour! Showing Tom Baker Steve Martin's character jogging home the film is off to a mediocre start. It doesn't improve with Bonnie Hunt's opening narration as Kate Baker. It's certainly not very funny at this point and the part about Tom getting a vasectomy is awkward in what's supposed to be a family movie. Maybe that part would have been slightly funnier if the movie hadn't been billed as family. One memorably lame joke is one of the Baker kids being told that body parts don't count for showandtell. In fact this part is perhaps a little disturbing! There are some occasional mildly amusing moments in this version of Cheaper by the Dozen but for the most part it's very unfunny and boring with the pranks the kids pull such as soaking Hank's Nora Baker's boyfriend underwear in meat to attract dogs other trouble the kids cause etc. Another lame part I can't forget is the athletic cup covered in sauce which one of the kids sees and thinks the sauce is blood causing him to throw up! This remake of Cheaper by the Dozen is basically just another unfunny PGrated family comedy and like some of the others some parts might really make viewers wonder if it should have been marketed as a family movie. For the most part this movie is cheesy and fairly forgettable and it reminded me a lot of Daddy Day Care another no more than mediocre PGrated family film which was released the same year. Apart from an occasional mildly amusing scene and Steve Martin's charm he's not that funny here but definitely better than he is in Looney Tunes Back in Action there aren't many positive things I can say about 2003's Cheaper by the Dozen. I'm not even sure if my 510 rating is low enough. I do intend to watch the 1950 version at some point knowing it's obviously a lot different because of the era it's from. I will also be expecting the original to be better than this disappointing 2003 version.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cheaper By The Dozen is a great family fun movie. It is about a large family The Bakers' who have twelve children and they have to juggle their careers and being a parent.

The comedy is very fun and exciting as the children like to plot against their eldest sister's Perabo boyfriend Hank Kutcher and his money making face.Hank is a very funny character and he brightens up this funfilled comedy with his witty comments and his selfish attitude.In the end the family realise that having money doesn't necessarily make you happier.This movie was good and would have been even better if Hank was in it more as he brightens this light  hearted comedy.".

Its the sort of movie that when you see it its exactly how you imagined it. You feel like you may as well not have watched it because you could imagine it exactly without seeing it. No surprises in other words  too many cliches. Father trying to cope with 12 kids while mum's away on a book tour  of course the kiddies are gonna misbehave. No matter that this doesn't really fit with the kids' characters  who don't seem to be misbehavers. They just misbehave when it suits the comedic situation to have them do so.The comedy is quite lowbrow  perhaps because the director is the guy who made Just Married. Thus the predominance of cheap slapstick bad slapstick is Funniest Home Video style laugh when people get injured stuff. And Steve Martin is probably the third thing that lets it down. He's just going through the motions here. He looks tired and distracted.There are some genuinely interesting things in it but the juxtaposition between the multisibling family and the various onlychild families which abound in the film and the children's book author whose kids call while she's doing a radio interview and beg her to come home and take care of them.And I never thought i'd say it but Ashton Kutcher is one of the comedic highlights of this movie. He shows a willingness to poke fun at himself and play the bad guy but we already knew that and he steals those scenes he's in. The other highlight is the trio of annoying neighbours Tim Dylan and Bill Shenk. 610. Syruppy music and cliche situations make for an alternatively corny and nauseating movie. Its still okay for the family on a friday night though. Reasons to see it are Ashton Kutcher the trio of neighbours and skinny Wayne Knight Seinfeld's Newman is about a quarter the man he used to be! Its a thing to see!".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Dreamers' is Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre and fascinating if not altogether successful distillation of the radical '60's mentality. Since the film is set in Paris in 1968 the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia. Leave it to the French to be exploring l'amour in all its myriad possibilities!In terms of plotting 'The Dreamers' is much like an incestuous version of Truffaut's menage a trois classic 'Jules and Jim' with the new film's subject matter as shocking today as was the earlier film's in its own time. Time and culture sure do march on and it always seems to be the French leading the way. In 'The Dreamers' Isabelle Eva Green and Theo Louis Garrel are twins who have developed a rather 'unnatural' attraction to one another becoming 'one' in virtually every way imaginable  physically spiritually psychically. Matthew Michael Pitt who looks for all the world like Leonardo Di Caprio is the young American in Paris whom they pull into their strange little world of sexual intrigue and emotional games. Matthew is a product of his time a young man who is not very experienced in the ways of the world but who is willing to partake in the moral relativism that is permeating the culture. Thus he becomes the perfect candidate for Isabelle and Theo to work their magic on. Their power of attraction proves overwhelming and irresistible for Matthew for they are both exotically beautiful creatures seemingly in tune with the trendy radicalism swirling around them. Yet Mathew eventually discovers that they are really only passive observers paying little but lip service to the cause too obsessed with their own twisted relationship to actually step out and participate in those grand social movements they talk so freely about. Isabelle and Theo are 'radicals' to be sure yet their radicalism seems to be channeled in a selfdestructive ultimately futile direction. Only over time does Matthew awaken to this realization.Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject matter Bertolucci often seems more interested in shocking than enlightening us. Isabelle Theo and Matthew are so insulated and cut off from the outside world that the points Bertolucci seemingly wants to make about the times  as reflected in protesters marching in the streets the references to Vietnam Mao and Jimmy Hendrix  feel tacked on and superfluous not particularly integral to the film as a whole. He is never quite able to bring these background elements and the foreground story together in any meaningful way. What Bertolucci does capture well is the obsessive love the French have always had for the cinema as both entertainment and art form. His characters live breathe and think films often acting out favorite scenes while the director intercuts snippets from the movies themselves. The beautiful thing about the French is that they have always had such an eclectic taste in film embracing both American studio and French New Wave products with equal passion. And this artistic openmindedness Bertolucci captures with gleeful abandon. The film in many ways becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton Astaire and Rogers Samuel Fuller Truffaut Godard Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history.'The Dreamers' doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole. Still the acting is excellent and Bertolucci has lost none of his skills as a director making each beautifully composed shot stand for something  a real treat for audiences bored to tears by the kind of bythenumbers filmmaking we get so often today. Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera like a master painter working wonders with his canvas.As for the muchvaunted sexual content of the film it is rated NC17 certainly those who are easily offended by nudity and provocative sexual themes had best avoid subjecting themselves to this film. Those however with a more open mind will find little that is overtly offensive about what is shown here. In fact if Isabelle and Theo weren't brother and sister there would be little controversy at all generated by the film. My suspicion is that Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair made their film about incest because an ordinary love triangle would have seemed just too commonplace in this day and age to serve as a successful plot device for a film whose very theme centers around radicalism. They really needed to shake the audience up and this was as effective a way as any to do that. Whether it repels more people than it compels is something only time will tell.As it is 'The Dreamers' is not an entirely successful film but those impressed by fine filmmaking had best not pass it up.".

The beautiful thing about the French is that they have always had such an eclectic taste in film embracing both American studio and French New Wave products with equal passion. And this artistic openmindedness Bertolucci captures with gleeful abandon. The film in many ways becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton Astaire and Rogers Samuel Fuller Truffaut Godard Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history.'The Dreamers' doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole. Still the acting is excellent and Bertolucci has lost none of his skills as a director making each beautifully composed shot stand for something  a real treat for audiences bored to tears by the kind of bythenumbers filmmaking we get so often today. Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera like a master painter working wonders with his canvas.As for the muchvaunted sexual content of the film it is rated NC17 certainly those who are easily offended by nudity and provocative sexual themes had best avoid subjecting themselves to this film. Those however with a more open mind will find little that is overtly offensive about what is shown here. In fact if Isabelle and Theo weren't brother and sister there would be little controversy at all generated by the film. My suspicion is that Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair made their film about incest because an ordinary love triangle would have seemed just too commonplace in this day and age to serve as a successful plot device for a film whose very theme centers around radicalism. They really needed to shake the audience up and this was as effective a way as any to do that. Whether it repels more people than it compels is something only time will tell.As it is 'The Dreamers' is not an entirely successful film but those impressed by fine filmmaking had best not pass it up.";

	schema:reviewBody "The decor for The Dreamers Bertolucci's sensual and narcotic film is represented by effervescent moments that took place in Paris in 1968. In the same manner in which the house inhabited by the three main protagonists represents a character so do the Parisian streets with their trepidation and demonstrations. Contrary to other films directed by this director  who has promised much and delivered even more throughout his career  The Dreamers opens in a fastpaced and provocative manner. The director establishes the cinematic convention precisely eloquently and elegantly. It becomes clear that the film deals with furious and beautiful young people who live through the films they devour. In the first five minutes the heroine of the picture played impeccably by Eva Green a theatre actress reminiscent of Isabella Rossellini announces that she was born in 1959. Logically it is impossible seeing that the year is 1968 and she seems to be at least 19 years old. Therefore she explains further 1959 ChampsElysee where she yelled New York Herald Tribune! Suddenly the film cuts to a scene from the classic Breathless A bout de souffl by Godard where Belmondo's feminine partner sells American newspapers on ChampsElysee. Consequently Bertolucci's feminine character believes that she has not been alive until seeing the aforementioned film considered by many the beginning of the New Wave. The idea of interposing images and references to classic films is augmented in The Dreamers. It becomes a means of communication between the characters and in fact it ignites the entire action of the film.As in The Last Tango in Paris or Stealing Beauty sex and sensuality also represent means of expression on which the director relies heavily. Yet The Dreamers rejects the desperation of The Last Tango through a seductive irreverence that indeed characterizes the socalled enfants terrible of 1968 Paris. It should be noted that The Dreamers contains various sexual and nude scenes but that these are by no means as shocking as the sex scenes in The Last Tango were when that film was released in the 1960s. Since then video and Internet pornography have occurred and shocking audiences through nudity has become something of a moot point. It is only the MPAA that hasn't grown up. It gave The Dreamers basically the same rating that The Last Tango got 30 years ago.Undoubtedly the angles of the shots in The Dreamers are what impresses the most. As in other films by Bertolucci practically every shot could be cut out and studied hours at an end for its elegance. The three main characters all played beyond reproach live their menageatrois through concrete gestures and attitudes as well as through emotions that are suggested by the sublime cinematography.The ending of the film considered by some critics a weak point is in fact quite accomplished. American viewers including some critics are used to American films in which the buildup leading to the climax is essentially dynamic suspenseful or tragic. But the European cinema is different. It often shows how feelings are condensed in a quiet but explosive mixture. This description fits The Dreamers like a glove.Finally a note for film buffs. In the initial scenes at the demonstration in front of the Cinematheque Bertolucci used news reel footage from the '60s with JeanPierre Leaud si JeanPierre Kalfon known actors of the New Wave. They are seen giving speeches and throwing paper leaflets to the crowd. In 2003 when shooting the film Bertolucci got Leaud and Kalfon now aged to reenact the images from the news reels. The end result is a mixture of new and old images the former in color the latter black and white. It is such tricks that Bertolucci uses throughout this nostalgic film that celebrates a certain period during which the young generation had more meaningful things to fight than computersimulated monsters.".

	schema:reviewBody "My rating  610There are two types of dreamers in The Dreamers'  the three main characters who create their own interior world and prefer to view the outside world by watching classic 1930s cinema and the socialist street revolutionaries of riottorn 1968 Paris who attempt to overthrow the political and economic power structure.  The Dreamers' focuses more on the former than the latter and Bernardo Bertolucci is careful to leave his film open to interpretation but ultimately the dream world of the three main characters is shattered by the realities of life.  The film ends before resolving the outcome of the second set of dreamers but we all know our history.  Some may think it a shame that the dreamers fail but others like myself will view it as something that has to happen if the dream is unrealistic and unsustainable.The relationship between the three main characters is unlike anything that I've ever seen portrayed on film.  The twins Isabelle and Theo are almost as close to each other in young adulthood as they were during the nine months they spent together in their mother's womb.  Matthew a U.S. student studying abroad in Paris inserts himself into the middle and when he receives early indications that portend the depth of the relationship between the twins he does not run away.  To me this required too much suspension of disbelief but I'm certainly aware that others have different proclivities.  If Bertolucci's intent was to show a high degree of separation between his three dreamers and the rest of society he certainly succeeded.The three dreamers have some but ultimately too little awareness of their separation from reality and the unsustainable nature of the world they create.  While sympathizing with the revolutionaries in the street they actually are the ultimate materialistic consumers  they produce nothing that they consume neither food nor art and when the money their parents provide runs out and they've drained most of the wine cellar the harsh realities of life set in.  Rooting through trash heaps isn't the answer and the choices that they leave themselves in the end selfannihilation or nihilism I believe show just how flawed their ideal world is.  My interpretation is that this lesson also applies to the other set of dreamers the street revolutionaries but those who even today sympathize with the views of those revolutionaries will reject this interpretation.The Dreamers' is very voyeuristic and Bertolucci puts his three leads through some incredibly intimate moments.  All three leads are quite good with Eva Green in particular deserving special notice for a completely uninhibited performance at least the two male leads had each other's example to follow.  It's hard to come up with an accurate overall rating for this film because I think there will be a widespread variance in how different people react to both the storyline and the images.  Read the reviews carefully and if it sounds like something that interests and won't shock you then give it a try.  My middleoftheroad rating is mainly due to my not being terribly interested in the type of relationship formed by the three main characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some people think Bernardo Bertolucci could be placed among Italy's other great directors such as Fellini Leone or DeSica. But there are still people out there who never forgave him from LITTLE BUDDHA or that thought LAST TANGO IN Paris was overrated softcore porn. His latest film THE DREAMERS might be misunderstood as a film about the 1968 student riots in Paris. It's not. Instead it uses 1968 Paris as a backdrop for the triangular relationship of a nave American with a pair of incestuous French twins. Young and innocent Matthew Michael Pitt just arrived in Paris from San Diego in order to study the French language but finds himself attending to the Cinematheque Francais instead. 'Only the French would build a movie theater in a palace' he states in his narration. As he spends his vacation inside screening room with chainsmoking New Wave pioneers the student riots start breaking out and he ends up meeting twins Isabelle Eva Green and Theo Louis Garrel who both are very similar to Matthew except that they are hmmm very French. After engaging interesting conversations that range from Nicholas Roeg to rock n' roll they all start bounding up as friends and the twins invite him over to their apartment for dinner.Theo and Isabelle's apartment consists of the stereotypical French family They all smoke like chimneys and mom and dad Anna Chancellor and Robin Renucci are poets who love to talk about art and philosophy. When Matthew learns the parents are leaving for a month and that he can stay with the twins in the apartment for all this time he finds himself in heaven. But things are far from heaven. He soon sees Isabelle and Theo have an unhealthy closure They bathe together sleep together and masturbate in front of each other. Is there something going on or are they just too European?At first Matthew is disgusted by their behavior but the sexual tension between him and Isabelle and to some extent Theo soon wins over. This is Bertolucci we're talking about after all! The apartment eventually becomes one filthy inhabitable place and the kids can barely survive. They run out of food money and are close enough to fall asleep in a bathtub and wake up dipped in menstrual blood. You would expect the story could take a LORD OF THE FLIES approach of turning the twins into psychopath savages but screenwriter Gilbert Adair who based the movie upon his novel gives us a much more interesting story to watch. These kids are like many of us movie buffs and spend their time challenging each other on identifying film references. The punishment for not knowing how the famous assassination scene in SCARFACE turns out to be sexual interplay between the characters. Is that a punishment? The discussions in the apartment cover sex cinema music and politics. So you have the kids discussing who is funnier Keaton of Chaplin? Who plays the guitar better Hendrix or Clapton? Is the Vietnam War right? But my favorite is weather or not Maoism is the way to go. Theo describes Maoism as an epic movie with thousands of idealistic thinkers carrying their little red books and revolting. But Matthew adds that it would not be a very engaging epic since everyone carrying the little red book would speak the same dialogue wear the same clothes have the same characteristics. They wouldn't be characters they would be extras. It's in moments like these where the actors really shine. Eva Green in particular is a true charming revelation and it's a shame Fernando Meirelles wasn't able to cast her in THE CONSTANT GARDENER like he wanted to.Bertolucci isolates the characters from the events happening in the streets as much as he can keeping the camera for most of the time inside the apartment. It's not enough to call the film a Dogma 95 sellout but it's really engaging and quite different from what you would expect from the director of THE LAST EMPEROR. The movie is called THE DREAMERS because the kids live inside their little mystical cocoon isolated from life and not doing anything about the problems they discuss. Matthew is the only one who seems to realize how immature it all is and how sick the incestuous relation between Theo and Isabelle makes him feel unlike the usual 'Europeans are way cooler than Americans' stereotype you would expect from these cultural clash topics. Once the violent revolts start kicking in and the kids' orgy cocoon is shattered by the stone breaking the window they eventually join the riots. But that is when Matthew finally realizes he will never convince the twins to change their nature. The film was rated NC17 in America by the MPAA. So it's okay to show Jesus Christ being slowly killed for twohours but a gasp a penis is truly outrageous! The NC17 rating truly killed the film from getting any kind of attention it deserved since Americans still confuse it with pornographic material. We all know that rating systems across the world are different. In America sex is seen as a more serious taboo than violence while 14 year olds can see this film in Italy and the French gave it a 12 rating. It's not only sex however the French slasher film HAUTE TENSION was recently given the NC17 tag also and for violence. While I know the MPAA will never change their ways I really think it's time they grew up and decide to create a new rating inbetween R and NC17 showing the this film is intended for adults only. Similar to what they did when RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK came out. America really needs a complete ratings makeover and the MPAA should really think of replacing their team with people who actually know right from wrong. Otherwise brilliant films like these will keep getting overlooked in the future. 55".

	schema:reviewBody "The characters of The Dreamers love movies. They pass their time quoting them reenacting scenes from them and debating ageold questions such as the merits of Chaplin versus Keaton. When at the cinema they make sure to sit in the rows closest to the screen. Why? So the images will reach them before anyone else while still fresh. If this strikes you as illogical perhaps The Dreamers isn't the movie for you. This is a film about film lovers and will likely be most appreciated by lovers of film in return. The basic narrative follows Matthew a young American the boyish Michael Pitt who is studying in Paris during the late 60s the time of the student riots. The film does a good job of setting up the loneliness which engulfs him in this foreign place so we are quick to understand why he so eagerly accepts the offer to stay with French twins Isabelle and Theo Eva Green and Louis Garrel he has met at where else? the cinema. As the three take up life in their spacious Parisian flat vacated by the twins' parents while abroad Matthew senses that something about these two is a bit off. It isn't long before he is aware of the incestuous undertones constantly present in the twins' interactions with one another. In attempting to confirm that their relationship does have some degree of limitations Matthew questions Isabelle receiving the chilling response He is always inside of me. It may be reassuring to Matthew as well as many audience members that no these characters never sleep together in the literal sense. What is at work here is something much more difficult to explain. The film handles it well. Eventually in an attempt to break Isabelle out of her selfinflicted dependency on her brother Matthew asks her on a date which proves to be the most joyfully innocent moment of the film. From here things turn slightly ambiguous and the film opts to relinquish the personal in favor of a more political ending. It is interesting to note the closing credits run over chanteuse Edith Piaf's Non Je Ne Regrette Rien No I Regret Nothing. If we knew whether or not this was chosen in irony a lot would be explained. One can't help compare The Dreamers to Bertolucci's other Parisianset exploration of erotica Last Tango in Paris. That film contained two lovers who were very much dead inside. The Dreamers contains three who are filled with youthful exuberance and have seemingly endless passion for things such as politics and the arts. Both films are frank and graphic in how they depict sex. As a matter of course both stirred much controversy. I suspect many people will watch The Dreamers already expecting to be incensed by it. That is their loss. For those who are willing The Dreamers can be a changing experience. What exactly it changes however is certainly bound to vary from person to person. Perhaps it will force you to reconsider your political outlook. Possibly it will alter how you view societally unacceptable relationships. Conceivably it could lead you to the realization of just how great an impact the films have on some people and their existence. Or maybe it will change your stance on who really was better Chaplin or Keaton? Side note I found it endlessly refreshing to find a film where characters spoke in their native language when appropriate and the audience was forced to makedo with subtitles.".

In attempting to confirm that their relationship does have some degree of limitations Matthew questions Isabelle receiving the chilling response He is always inside of me. It may be reassuring to Matthew as well as many audience members that no these characters never sleep together in the literal sense. What is at work here is something much more difficult to explain. The film handles it well. Eventually in an attempt to break Isabelle out of her selfinflicted dependency on her brother Matthew asks her on a date which proves to be the most joyfully innocent moment of the film. From here things turn slightly ambiguous and the film opts to relinquish the personal in favor of a more political ending. It is interesting to note the closing credits run over chanteuse Edith Piaf's Non Je Ne Regrette Rien No I Regret Nothing. If we knew whether or not this was chosen in irony a lot would be explained. One can't help compare The Dreamers to Bertolucci's other Parisianset exploration of erotica Last Tango in Paris. That film contained two lovers who were very much dead inside. The Dreamers contains three who are filled with youthful exuberance and have seemingly endless passion for things such as politics and the arts. Both films are frank and graphic in how they depict sex. As a matter of course both stirred much controversy. I suspect many people will watch The Dreamers already expecting to be incensed by it. That is their loss. For those who are willing The Dreamers can be a changing experience. What exactly it changes however is certainly bound to vary from person to person. Perhaps it will force you to reconsider your political outlook. Possibly it will alter how you view societally unacceptable relationships. Conceivably it could lead you to the realization of just how great an impact the films have on some people and their existence. Or maybe it will change your stance on who really was better Chaplin or Keaton? Side note I found it endlessly refreshing to find a film where characters spoke in their native language when appropriate and the audience was forced to makedo with subtitles.";

Through the main body of the plot that background's completely irrelevant except that sporadically one of the main characters will read out a few lines of political philosophy to each other.The main plot is an awkward three's a crowd sexual comingofage story where the wideeyed American Matthew naive to the point of selfparody inserts himself into the incestuous relationship between two Parisians. Isabelle as is typically the case in this sort of setup isn't really a protagonist but gets pulled between the two men who act as poles. The thing that offends me about the whole incest story is not like most people who disliked the film that I've got a moral objection but the fact that it fails to develop in any way. We've got Theo straight out of a nineteenth century opium den being withdrawn and arrogant and when he can't get his way through intimidation occasionally tries to strangle people. Then we've got Matthew who is distressingly earnest and comes up with sickening things all the time along the lines of we're all connected love is the greatest force but apparently has no objection to sitting in the bath with Theo having smug illinformed political debates and throwing menstrual blood around.None of it makes any sense. Isabelle and Theo are testing the boundaries of sexual norms in their corrupt bohemian boudoir and they choose to involve the completely incongruous Matthew. Why?  because he likes films you see and they need someone to run around the Louvre with them. Predictably Matthew who thinks this is all larks for a while soon enough tries to persuade Isabelle that sleeping with your brother is well pretty wrong you see and girls your age should be going out with a boy to the cinema drinking cherryade and paying for it by putting out a bit in the back row. But Theo who's read about Mao Tse Tung don't you know isn't to keen on this injection of capitalist bourgeois morality separating him from his bigbreasted sister.So what does the film turn into  it's basically Matthew trying to make a 2hour porn film with Isabelle but having to appease Theo by occasionally getting into the bath with him and making arguments so desperately crass that Theo looks like an intellectual. Really this is an appalling hatchet job of a film I've seen pornos with better characterisation and more subtle sociopolitical debates than this. Each of the three stars I've given belong to a part of Eva Green's Isabelle's anatomy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Matthew is a young american student in france his passion for movies leads him into Theo and Isabelle two twins that shares his passion they quickly build a deep friendship and Matthew gets invited to stay with them while their parents are gone. However once he gets settled with them he discovers sides of both that he had not expected. While they spend their time talking and playing the riots of Paris 1968 goes on in the real world.This is a very brave film in the way it has been build but it is also a complicated movie that will leave you both confused and thinking it's beautiful and it can almost be described as cinematic poetry however this poetry also makes it a difficult one to relate too.After seeing this film i am confused in what i feel about it the movie feels very divided and some times it is an extraordinary brave and experimental film other times it is confuing and at some times boring too. It's really a hard movie to understand because of the poetic feeling it gives it's like reading a poem where some of the lines doesn't make sense but i guess that could be an advantage as it can be seen more than once. I feel the strength of the movie is the way it challenges and explores like no american or typical mainstream movie would do the often use of nudity and raw sex scenes would never be seen elsewhere and even though it may annoy many people Bertolucci portrays the scenes very beautiful and they never seem like dirty scenes the most impressive scene is the one where Matthew and Isabelle have sex never have a full sex scene been portrayed in such a beautiful and realistic way on screen. And there are many examples of this.What brings the movie is first of all the very slow storyline it barely moves at all the whole 2 hours are pretty much circulating around one thing which is the way these 3 youngsters spend their sparetime it's an mysterious movie that really brings up interesting situations a lot of times but other times it simply gets too slow and gets a little boring. Another partly negative thing is the understanding of the movie as I earlier mentioned the movie is like a poem if you have problems with a few lines the whole deeper meaning may fall apart. I wouldn't say i did not understand the fully deeper meaning of the movie but i think each individual will understand this movie differently due to the complex way it has been made. But i honestly think Bertolucci wanted it to be like that a movie that will leave you thinking about many things but i think what it really is about is finding yourself in a world where there are 6 billion people looking like you on the outside.The movie is very well directed a solid directing and you can clearly see the trademarks of the director one thing i noticed was the floating camera. The floating camera gives a feeling of being there it is mostly used in the first part of the movie where Matthew learns more about his mysterious new friends it gives us a feeling of curiousity towards these two new persons. Two persons whom we soon discover have more to them than showing on the outside.The acting in the movie is solid. I usually don't expect much from new and coming actors and actresses that i have not heard about before this was also the case for this movie. But the acting is really good Michael Pitt and Louis Garrel really gives an above average performance great to see that there are still new actors who can take over when the old ones will be gone. But the star of this movie is Eva Green what a mysteriously and unique performance and what a brilliant casting she is unique beautiful and most importantly interesting erotic and challenging. Also i give props to all the three main characters for their brave and realistic portray of nudity and the complications of sex among unexperienced youngsters.As i said earlier this movie is very complex it's hard to understand and i could probably talk about it forever but i got to stop somewhere. I think the movie is definetely worth watching it's very artistic and does indeed stand on its own feet it takes chances you don't see many movies take and it's all done very well. On the negative side i think the movie sometimes get too complex and slow but overall i don't regret seeing it and i think that i will be seeing it again due to the complex story it will probably bring me new thoughts when i see it next time.610".

Isabelle and Theo the twins has a very intimate relationship for brothers that I don't understand very well and Matthew their new American friend and lover starts to accept the way they are and fall in love with both of them. One thing I need to complain about the movie is the hypocrisy that I read in the trivia section saying that if they show Matthew's and Theo's relationship it might have been too much'' for the public but Theo and Isabelle that are brother and sister can sleep together and have the most unusual behavior of all. I don't agree with that and if I needed to choose something that would ''shock'' someone an ambiguous relationship between brothers would be much more shocking then a gay relationship.Anyway Matthew is a young American exchange student that came to Paris in order to study French. The year is 1968 and he easily become friend of the twins Isabelle and Theo since they three love to watch movies. As their friendship grows Matthew learns of the extreme intimacy shared by Isabelle and Theo and enters into their world. First he falls for Isabelle for later also love Theo and the three seclude themselves from the world falling further and further from the reality of the 1968 student riots.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even by today's standards Bertolucci's films of the early 70's The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris are powerful mixes of seductive Italian movie making with a fiery if pessimistic brand of Marx's Freudian politics.  Now three decades later Bernardo returns to scene of his great triumphs to see if he can't turn one more cinematic trick.  His new film The Dreamers shouldhave had a lot going for it. What couldn't you do with a three way sexualencounter staged in Paris in the midst of May '68?  And the fact the story's three young dreamers' are also cinema buffs should provide for an interesting twist or two plot or otherwise.  But my God what on Earth was the great Italiandirector thinking?  This movie is singularly awful.  Two hours of pointlesspretentious masturbatory literally drivel!  The film's underlying problem is not technical it's not the acting staging or even the directing.  Some of the sets like the kids' tent are actually quite beautiful.  The problem of the movie isconceptual!  Bertolucci thirty years along has absolutely nothing original to say about people or politics music or art sex or life. Which is ironic given that the historical setting of The Dreamers is May '68 probably the greatest revolutionary moment of the past fifty years.

	onyx:emotionText "Even by today's standards Bertolucci's films of the early 70's The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris are powerful mixes of seductive Italian movie making with a fiery if pessimistic brand of Marx's Freudian politics.  Now three decades later Bernardo returns to scene of his great triumphs to see if he can't turn one more cinematic trick.  His new film The Dreamers shouldhave had a lot going for it. What couldn't you do with a three way sexualencounter staged in Paris in the midst of May '68?  And the fact the story's three young dreamers' are also cinema buffs should provide for an interesting twist or two plot or otherwise.  But my God what on Earth was the great Italiandirector thinking?  This movie is singularly awful.  Two hours of pointlesspretentious masturbatory literally drivel!  The film's underlying problem is not technical it's not the acting staging or even the directing.  Some of the sets like the kids' tent are actually quite beautiful.  The problem of the movie isconceptual!  Bertolucci thirty years along has absolutely nothing original to say about people or politics music or art sex or life. Which is ironic given that the historical setting of The Dreamers is May '68 probably the greatest revolutionary moment of the past fifty years.

With this one I couldn't not from the first frames.That's not true. I did enjoy the opening titles the way the names appeared and disappeared like dancers within the steel lattice of the Eiffel Tower. But right after that as soon as Matthew started telling us this fake memoir of what he supposedly did in Paris in 1968 my internal bulls meter spoke up like a rude child. You're not Matthew you're some actor in a French movie directed by some guy with a big ego and a whooptodo reputation and the year is 2003 not 1968. Naturally I waited for story to get involving so as to shut up my internal little kid but it didn't and he didn't either.Moving ahead now let me just say that the lead actress is pretty. Very pretty. Embarrassingly so. And when she says of her brother Theo he is always inside me well that pretty much speaks for all of us. Like one of John and Bo Derek's classics two hours spent watching Isabelle prancing around in and out of her negligee would probably be both terrible yet...very worthwhile. Spoiler warning to future husbands there's not much in the way of secrets left to tell.But the rest of this crap is crap. I've never seen a French movie try to look French before but this one does. I've never seen a poet look more like hapless clerk from a hardware store but their father does. And I've never seen two actors playing brother and sister who are so clearly pretending. You can feel it. The two sisters in In America FELT like sisters not just because in real life they are. To me the relationship between Isabelle and Theo just doesn't ring true.None of this rings true. And now I've spent more time writing this bad review than I did watching the stupid film. A movie with sex is probably wonderful but atleast put a decent movie around it.".

Longing for the fame and notoriety that came with Last Tango he chooses to return to Paris and to prove just how daring he still is in dealing with sexual taboos and on screen teenage nudity. It's genuinely pathetic. He is an artist gone bankrupt.Bertolucci was once capable of creating complex and compelling movies such as The Conformist and intense melodramas La Luna  my personal favorite. It's inconceivable that he could turn out a film so completely bogus. There is not one frame that rings true. The screenplay is filled with the most appalling lines. It would take three far better young actors to make any sense of this garbage. That Michael Pitt almost gets by is in itself a miracle. Louis Garrell and Eva Green are totally inept. But the fault is hardly theirs.So much is wrong with The Dreamers that one hardly knows where to begin. The ridiculously spruced up Parisian streets look more like MGM back lot and even the costumes look silly. As far as characterization goes well it simply non existent. There's not much acting either just endless posturing.There is something very disturbing in the on screen nudity of the three young actors. The question of nudity or on screen sex is totally dependant on context. While a film like Ken Park is no example of fine cinema one cannot argue that the sex and nudity is out of context. In the context of this non story peopled with non characters watching the nudity one feels tainted in being coerced to participate in a dirty old man type of voyeurism.There is no redeeming feature to The Dreamers. It's like the very first effort of an inexperienced young ambitious and most definitely untalented director.A stinker if there ever was one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite an odd film but pleasant throughout due to the likeable actors and some laugh out loud moments.  There are musings throughout about dating and love none of which really hit the mark.  The ending was somewhat unsatisfying and loose ends weren't really tied up.  In addition Bruce McCullough from Kids in the Hall who directed and wrote the film somewhat underutilized himself in the movie.  He could have added some more hilarious moments for himself but his Kids In the Hall partner Mark McKinney gets most of the laughs as a dog psychiatrist.  I appreciated that it seemed to be trying something new in the field of romantic comedy and was less predictable than many similar films.  Overall I did enjoy it and would say it is worth a rental but I can't really justify giving it more than 610.".

Whether or not this movie represents real life or not I cannot say. Whether or not a movie any movie even SHOULD represent real lifewho knows that either? But if art good or bad is designed to evoke a certain feeling and certain vibes then this movie does that very well.

	schema:headline " My Favorite Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "My initial reaction to Dog Park was that it was a deeply personal film from a writer intent on conveying his own sense of loneliness and cynicism towards life and relationships  accompanied by a glimmer of hope conceded in a subtle connecting glance across a crowded park by the film's two protagonists. Dog Park is a very smart film with a real albeit subtle depth which is missed by most  as evidenced in the majority of the user comments. Close examination brings to mind another film Medem's Los Amantes del Circulo Polar and the provocative ideas it evoked about the circle of life the role that coincidences play in that life about fate and pain loneliness and the desire ultimately to find and be loved by that one special person.A chance meeting in a bar by two lonely people on the rebound establishes what will constitute the film's love story. Their meeting is awkward and uncomfortable and at least one of them is sure that they've seen the other before somewhere maybe ...at the dog park. They take some personal jabs at each other before the two settle into an introductory conversation and quickly realize that there is something surprisingly beautiful about that person sitting across from them. They segue to an apartment only to wind up in a bathroom where one of them is getting sick while the other gracefully consoles them. Shot from high above the bathroom window we watch as the two embrace each other taking note that this is the last time they will grace the screen together for the good majority of the film.The guy is Andy played by Luke Wilson an endearing serial monogamist who has been stranded in one romantic relationship after another since the eighth grade engaged in a sortof quest for that one special person to share his life with. He slowly discerns that his most recent 'bad date' might actually be that special person he has been seeking all his life confiding to a friend about her Have you seen somebody in a certain light and you felt like you knew everything about them? His corresponding love interest is Lorna played by Natasha Henstridge an equally endearing person who is so emotionally dented by one too many ugly breakups that she can't even conceive of getting into another one. She wants true love and realizes early on that she might actually find it with Andy but is just unable to gamble being hurt again best articulated in their postdate phone conversation where she shoots down his offer of a followup date. Her facial expression says everything pointing out the divergence between what she really wants and what she is able to do. She is clearly caught in a personal struggle between her protective instincts and her desire to be loved  and stranded in her own loneliness.Along for the ride are several other characters both human and canine including Kathleen Robertson Andy's ex who has dumped him for a sexobsessed loser Gordon Currie who just happened to be the fellow who dumped Lorna. There's also Janeane Garofalo and Bruce McCullough the seemingly perfect couple representing at least for Andy the ideal relationship he desperately longs for  that is until it begins unraveling in front of him. There's also several interesting background characters namely Lorna's bestfriend Rachel Carey Andy's blustery girlfriend Kieran Lehman and Lorna's Mr. Wrong Callum played Harland Williams a contradictory sort whose wildeyed goofball antics are only offset by his extraordinary insightfulness. With the film's progression it becomes apparent that these characters are inexplicably linked together by chance romance and an unwavering devotion to their dogs.Speaking of dogs everybody in the film has one or at least shares one and all of them are seeking counsel from the local animal psychologist Dr. Cavan played by Mark McKinney who plays the straight man to all the craziness going on around him. In a way he represents the audience understanding partially the cyclical nature of what is happening the dogs are showing signs of stress because they are reacting to their owners' stress. McKinney's straightlaced pseudoanalytical antics and inability to relate to other human beings including his own children provide some of the more hilarious moments.Cinematically Dog Park walks the line between dark and quirky and completely hilarious. It also seems to be pushing some kind of bizarre cosmic diagram. McCullough seemed to have designed the plot around this weird 'lifeiscyclical' idea mentioned before and evidenced numerous times throughout the film. Actually I lost count how many times situations or elements are twice repeated in the film each with a differing outcome. A pickup story 'exchanging phone numbers after an automobile accident' is utilized twice in the film each time with a much different tone. Locations lines of dialogue dating habits and minor characters appear or are stated twice with their relevance becoming much clearer on the second go around. Even a number specifically onehundred appears twice in the film the first time it is used as a means to bring together a couple the second to keep apart. There's even a 'dating chain' which is elaborated upon by one of the characters a sortof celestial ecosystem that mathematically determines who does or doesn't find love.Bruce McCullough is a very talented director who had a lot to say with this his first film and in my opinion he hit every note perfectly. He understands the romantic comedy in ways that most directors don't or ever will conceding that audiences don't need to see the heroes engage in an endless kiss or stagger into a bedroom hell bent on a physical consummation. He understands that sometimes really all that is needed is that subtle adoring look across a park or a nervous smile exchanged in a crowded bar by two people who know they are meant for each other. Sometimes that all it takes.I love this film!".

And so are their owners.And you know.... movies are filmed all the time in Canada American movies even! For the sake of wide roaming space and less cost. There are Canadian movies... made in Canada. But so very very few.... But... this does.Garofolo's pretty much just phones in the stocktype Garofolo role knowledgeable about relationships and life with the usual sardonic wit. Except her usual genuine humor here is gone thanks to her uncharacter and lines due to the script courtesy of McCulloch. She might have been better cast in the Lorna role. But no Janeane has too much of a pulse.Bruce actually gives himself a substantial supporting role as the his of a pathologically married His and Hers couple with Garofolo. She still seems almost human almost possible. She seems to persevere through this incompetence.He's always been a bad actor but in skits it's easier to forgive. And with this unfinished first draft of a script and monotone direction all the actors more or less sink. These actors can act. But his movie manages to convince you they can't. So Bruce's horrible thespian attempts fit right in.Every ounce of blame goes to the man who halfconceived this big ball of halfconsidered unfunny awkwardness McCulloch. The characters duller than dullest. Nearly every single line of dialogue and scene feels awkward and mishandled.Not one person in this whole damn thing... comes off as believable. Or really all that insightful.All throughout McCulloch seems to lack the ability to write a decent romantic scene a fullfledged written character or a line of dialouge that hears well. When it comes to writing personally he should well stick to skits. Or maybe just checksif any of them are any good. Better than this.Dog Park has no mood. Every scene is badly staged. It was so bad I damn near expected this thing to have a laugh track.While many of these types exist out there in the world the sadsack jilted lover the cynical sage advisors the seemingly perfect couple the superficial couple the weird oddball the nypho and the lovescorn pessimist the movie takes these stocktypes and injects no humanity into them whatsoever. No one feels authentic or even interesting.Other Canadian folk like Harland Williams nothing special and especially awful. He plays the Neoweirdo Lorna goes out with after she reaches that point when a woman gets so lonely and dying from cabinfever she rushes to go out with the first guy she sees. But after the date... he calls her back with a message she desperately desperately needs.But yes Bruce and co. I agree wholly that Andy 'n' Lorna are made for each one another. These two so boringwithout any personality or interestthat you'd have to go the morgue to find people who are less alive. These two were made for each other. Two big empty nonexistent zeroes.Over the years McCulloch has developed one tin cauliflower ear for dialogue. As been said by pretty much every other on the planet who saw this the only performance character and scene of fellow Kids In The Hall brethren Mark McKinney as Dr. Cavan an insightful and bizarre dog psychiatrist. There's just not much about the movie overall. Just no real effort. No special insights about dating relationships naturehuman or canine. No interesting people philosophies about relationships or anything resembling a good moviegoing experience.Now if you'll excuse me as I write this it's 730 on the dot. The dogs are at the door with Christmas morning anticipation. Tails wagging eyes fixated on the door. It's time for our evening constitutional the high point of our day. As dog owners know the local dog park is a treat. They're like latenight singles night clubs up in the city after hours. Anything goes and often does...A LongTime LongTerm LifeLong DogLover Dane Youssef".

Two big empty nonexistent zeroes.Over the years McCulloch has developed one tin cauliflower ear for dialogue. As been said by pretty much every other on the planet who saw this the only performance character and scene of fellow Kids In The Hall brethren Mark McKinney as Dr. Cavan an insightful and bizarre dog psychiatrist. There's just not much about the movie overall. Just no real effort. No special insights about dating relationships naturehuman or canine. No interesting people philosophies about relationships or anything resembling a good moviegoing experience.Now if you'll excuse me as I write this it's 730 on the dot. The dogs are at the door with Christmas morning anticipation. Tails wagging eyes fixated on the door. It's time for our evening constitutional the high point of our day. As dog owners know the local dog park is a treat. They're like latenight singles night clubs up in the city after hours.

All three principals  Lauren Holly very attractive Steve Bacic and Luke Perry were decent.However one should be aware that this is not a slam bang action flick with all sorts of special effects battles etc. There is none of that in this movie. The movie is about a small family living in a rural area against the backdrop of something cataclysmic having occurred but the hows and whats of that are never really delved into  rather the focal point of the story is how they are coping the mysteries surrounding a stranger who has wandered onto their property etc.I would deem the movie to be more of a suspensethriller against a quasi scifi backdrop.On a plus note it did keep our attention start to finish and we were not hooting and hollering at grade F special effects and cheesy acting.On a negative note the ending was somewhat of a mystery to us. We have some theories but you are better off to watch the movie and come up with your own.I think overall this is the sort of movie actors do to keep paying the bills but at least they gave it a decent go and made the 90 minutes of the movie respectable rather then terrible.".

Family dog disappeared doesn't come back during storm. Power is out house is cold. After several days food is low forcing trip to semi deserted local town for food  allowing for evidence of disappearance to be seen and for ruffians to attack. Storyline family and Luke Perry flee town after Luke helps defend husband from ruffians.4 Luke Perry originally showed up at the storyline family's farm during the storm and gets invited mostly by wife to stay with our storyline family after it's over.5 The husband of the family Steve Bacic may or may not be the best husband some rude drinking.7 Lauren Holly the wife may or may not be a semibored randy farm wife who's flattered by the attention from Luke at more than one point.8 In the TV version I saw we get to see some cleavage and she's in her panties in the bathroom with Luke at one point. And while refilling the tub for Luke his junk may have been visible to her but she's not shy about staying there to talk.9 If you search online you'll find out that a sideview of her breast was in the DVD version while Lauren and hubby were doing it in one scene.10 Luke has a Bible verse tattoo on his arm and mumbles Bible talk from time to time.11 Later on we find out that Luke killed people at that farmhouse 20 years before his father being one  at the time it was his family's house.12 We get a few clues during the movie that this might be the end of the world.13 Luke desires Holly and makes a violent play for her  just as the husband comes back from a trip to town injured and in a weakened state.14 Family son rescues father from Luke's attempted hanging which sets in motion final battle scene where Luke is killed.15 Stars vanish from night sky  world ends.OK here's my synthesized storyline for you Luke is The Prodigal Son who comes home. The family is his symbolic family and he's got Oedipal lust for the wife. The wife is sort of randy and might be unfaithful in her heart just like mankind is unfaithful in our hearts to God so too might she be to her husband.So then Luke is the sin of man let loose in real form to illustrate that at the end of the world only those whose hearts are right with God get raptured.The Rapture is why most people disappeared leaving ruffians in town and a sintinged farm family for the plot.The husband has sin because of booze and attitude the kid because he's a mouthoff the wife because she accepts intimate flattery from Luke.Luke is sin personified and when the family overcomes him by resisting and fighting back the world ends for them because they too are raptured.The movie is better than sleeping pills because it's nonchemical. But the effect is the same you sleep well afterward.There are no hidden plot messages or twists to think about after it's over so your mind switches right to sleep mode and you get a nice rest.For late night TV fare I'd give it a 5 of 10".

Fortunately Boll gets it out of the way in the first five minutes. You can go on watching the rest of the movie with confidence that you won't see anything nearly as exciting again.As we're all tired of pointing out there are fresh new directors out there who could use a little money to get a start on films with imagination.

You can go on watching the rest of the movie with confidence that you won't see anything nearly as exciting again.As we're all tired of pointing out there are fresh new directors out there who could use a little money to get a start on films with imagination. It's a sin and a shame that Boll still gets backers for turkeys like this.Not recommended.";

Small hometown cast and location and a kooky story to keep things going.Luke Perry departs a bit from his Dylan persona to bring out his southern baptist evil bible thumping character that he's toyed with on occasion. He does it believably that's a testament no pun intended to his superb and experienced acting skills. The other main characters were all played well too. The story didn't blow me away like a big budgeter would. Though you can't expect that it should I don't look at the movie's production price before watching so I treat all movies equally and they usually cost the consumer equal amounts so it would be fair to stack this movie against Batman The Godfather Men in Black whatever. So up against those guys this movie is cheap and is not as much of a thrilling 90 minutes. But for what it is it's fun it keeps you guessing and it has you rooting at the right moments. I almost stopped watching after the first minute because Luke Perry's been in so many movies about storms I thought this must have been one I'd already seen. Turns out nope here came yet another storm film from the former heartthrob.Lots of question remain unanswered after the film's ending which is annoying most movies wrap 99 of their story up at Fin time but the conclusion is satisfactory enough to say Cool that was fun and of course it leaves you wanting more especially more answers!If you could watch any movie in the world I wouldn't tell you to bother with this one. But if for some reason you had it in your hand and were wondering if it should be played I wouldn't be compelled to stop you. Grab some popcorn and enjoy especially on a stormy night!".

The film has a nice amateur feel to it and it sticks to what it is filming most of the conteOK the movie. A mysterious but hospitable stranger looking for a little Shelter from the storm is taken in by a family. The hospitable charismatic stranger starts make the family a little unnerved with his pushy belief system. The movie starts off a slow burn but builds. You don't have to agree with anyone's view points in the movie. If you ignore the message you feel the film is giving you can really enjoy it. I never hated a movie over subliminal film messages be it political  religious or whatever. I just let myself be entertained because after all Its just a movie. ATHIEST ALERTIf your a crabby athiest who looks down on and can't live with the fact that there are other people with other belief systems you probably won't like this because it requires you to turn your beliefs off for an hour and half and have an open mind. I am an athiest but tolerant of these kind of movies because there almost like SciFi to meI love SciFi Oh that and the fact that its a movie only not a politicalreligious ideology. I gave it 610 and it deserves it. I wouldn't run out and buy it for 15 but if you catch it on cable late one night or in the 3.99 or under bargain bin give it a shot.

This leaves the viewer with a third question Huh?Here are the spoilersFirst Silas the mysterious stranger turns out to be a homicidal maniac. Second the world ends. Poof! Given the end of the world the true nature of the Silas subplot is revealed it's 50 minutes of filler. The Silas subplot casts no light on why the world is ending or on how people can or should reconcile themselves to the end or to death. In other words this movie is a complete waste of time.Question I am guessing that everybody except Silas the family and the thugs in town disappeared because they were vacuumed up to heaven in the Rapture.

Married couple Tom and Gillian Grady and their son Graham live on an isolated farm. Gillian and Graham are watching the news on television which is filled with images of riots and chaos due to freak storms and the breakdown of order due to global upheaval. During the night in the middle of a vicious storm a stranger turns up on their doorstep hurt and seemingly disorientated. Okay so what went wrong. It started off quite promising bleak atmospheric and with a sense of impending doom. The isolated settings worked and the music really helped set the mood. Luke Perry was quite good as Silas and Steve Bacic as Tom and Lauren Holly as Gillian where just fine. But it was the actual storyline that I had problems with. First of all the story didn't seem to know whether it was a thriller a supernatural or an end of the world movie. It started off with a eco end of the world scenario then became a biblical end of the world story then became a psychological thriller. Then back to end of the world story again. Uwe Boll should have picked one theme and stuck to it. The trouble was that none of the themes were truly explored. Not the thriller or the end of world. There were some good moments the trip to their neighbours to discover that they had disappeared and the deserted town people only with a few crazies. Once again it was never explained why everyone was gone except for a handful of men. If the town had been evacuated why did they stay? Why where the Gradys not evacuated as well if that was the case. There are too many plot points left dangling and the story could have been better without the predictable dangerous stranger storyline. It should have concentrated more on the apocalyptic aspects of the movie. It was a okay film that if handled differently could have been great.".

Much of her early life was spent as an outspoken academic. There according to the movie she feuded with Joseph Heller a fellow professor with right wing beliefs. In 1933 after Jews were no longer allowed to teach she became a nun in the Spartanlike Carmelite order. But when World War II heated up Heller who had become an important Nazi official took his revenge. He had her deported to Auschwitz.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Seventh Chamber is one of those rare tiny indie films that you run into by accident and because its modest budget or unique subject matter never really gets the recognition it deserves. I came to know it because I've been an avid admirer of Edith Stein or as she was known in religious life and the Catholic Church St. Benedicta of the Cross. It was made via Italy and Hungary and is dubbed in Italian a minor flaw. It tells the later part of this famous German Jewish philosopher's life. It concentrates particularly on her conversion to Catholicism and her consequent entrance into the Carmel a strict cloistered convent of the Carmelite nuns. These incredibly important decisions made some monumental changes in her life such as her lifelong rift from her beloved mother and the rest of her very traditional Jewish family. Where she shined as a philosopher teacher and lecturer she was failing in her humble duties as a new nun. She was already in her forties when she entered the convent and had to carry on various domestic physically demanding duties normally intended for young girls usually entering the order. Feeling isolated tired old lonely and heartbroken over losing her mother she persevered in her calling. What initially started as a background story in the second part of the film is masterfully pushed into the foreground the Hitler party taking over the Germany and the eventual persecution of the Jews. Edith now in the convent is still very much aware and terrified of this growing hatred and the rising atrocities that will forever change her life. Maia Morgenstern Mary from Gibson's Passion of the Christ plays Edith in a bravura tour De force performance that you'll never forget. But the real strength of this film is its vision. It was filmed in a slightly abstract way not necessary following linear storytelling. Also while historically accurate it chose to develop its own style by a 'free interpretation' of Edith's experience. Sometimes this can hurt the film on account of 'artistic license'. Not here. It respects the facts but by zeroing in on Stein's possible interpretations some of them coming from her own writings and some not. This gives the story a considerable edge and is simply staggering in emotions. It is not an easy experience to watch and it is not entertaining in a traditional sense. It was not meant to be however. The story of this individual similar in fate to all Jews in WWII Europe is a heavy heartbreaking account no matter what the circumstances. That in fact is the story of the film more than being a narrative biography of a person. Once you see it that way it will take a life of its own and you will be completely immersed in it and not likely to forget it soon. The films this bold and unique are not being often made. It was never picked up by the Hollywood for its difficult subject matter the protagonist is a nun and that's good because it retained its originality and vision. The Seventh Chamber Room will touch the deep corners of your heart and psyche making it a truly powerful important and simply unforgettable viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "PLOTA young female journalist Vivian comes to the Cemetery to get an interview from its keeper  a creepy looking guy named Frederick. Frederick tells her two strange stories that lead to an unspeakable and mystery secret.COMMENTSA few options I would like to comment  1. Acting. Acting is actually poor except for a few people that can actually act so you can believe them. The Director Olaf Ittenbach has a cameo appearance in the beginning of the movie. Among actors  Darren Shahlavi looks really solid and shows good martial art skills. Those of you who seen 'Bad Moon' with Gary Daniels and Shahlavi  will probably agree with me. Another martial art specialist  Matthias Hues appears in the end of the movie as one of the bad guys. Other actors look really poor  and almost all of them have an accent no clean English  whatsoever. But in this kind of movie you don't expect great acting at all. 2. Gore. Ittenbach does a great job here with all the SFX  gore effects. As usual  in Ittenbach's movies there's a lot of gore tons of blood  people get slaughtered  cut into pieces  and tortured in very disturbing manner. Everything looks real  what is a big plus for this kind of movie. Its not as gory as Ittenbach's earlier movies Premutos 1997 and Burning Moon 1992 but there's enough of it to satisfy a gore fan believe me. Also with all the gore the movie is extremely violent.3. Plot. I started getting the plot with about 34 minutes left till the end. First story told by Frederick is about a bunch of guys who get involved in to this usual 'moneydrugs' thing  and in the end they all get slaughtered like animals  in very violent ways. Second story takes place  probably in medieval Europe. A demented inquisitor is searching ancient writings which can make him eternal and give unrestricted power.By searching he tortures and kills people who don't obey him in very gruesome ways. Both stories lead to Fredericks's own secret. But when Vivian realizes that  it's just too late..OVERALLRecommended to Olaf Ittenbach's fans only. Fans of gory movies will be satisfied as well. For those of you expecting acting  plot or anything else except gore..keep searching. Would I recommend this movie ? Watch for yourself people I did like the violence and gore....everything else in this movie just doesn't worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gee where to begin? This movie is very bizarre and unique it's not the plot that makes it unique however because the plot is quite simple. On one side of equation there is a misterious... well item and on another side there are people who get tortured and killed right and left in different and quite imaginative ways because somebody wants this item very very much.So like I said the plot is simple but the execution is quite sophisticated. The movie consists of 2 barely connected parts and takes us through modern and Medievil times and then there is someone who combines the whole story and tells it to you guessed it a beautiful female reporter.So how bizarre is it? Here is my take on this very unusual movie1. Beyond the Limits  is one of the most violent gory films I've ever seen in my entire life and I've seen quite a few!!2. It's also THE MOST CREATIVE and professionally done gorefest I've ever seen.3. Notwithstanding the previous comment acting and dialogs in the first vignette are atrocious and overthetop  totally Bmovie material. At this point you will get confused since you've been told this is not a Bmovie stay assured it isn't just wait for the second part. Besides murders and tortures are so well done you will forgive the filmmakers for this acting fiasco guaranteed.4. Since they didn't have enough money to hire professional actors for entire duration of the movie just guessing here the second vignette is where the director makes it up to you in this department. I think it's flawless. Acting is terrific and fight scenes will take your breath away.5. The outline plot is subtle and the end scene albeit very strong doesn't make too much of a sense which I must say is perfect for this movie. The ending somehow reminded me of the ending of Ronin with Robert De Niro.6. The film had to have a fairly good budget if only for all those special effects having been made so well but obviously not enough money went into marketing which can explain why no one on this side of Atlantic ever heard of this movie which is sad sad sad...Final Thoughts.The only reason I don't call this movie a horror masterpiece is because of the laughable acting in the 1st part. Overall I'll say if you like the genre and have a strong stomach find and see this movie you'll be glad you did! 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A gore marathon";
	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Limits was a big surprise for me since I am very disappointed in the latest movies concerning the special effects because I hate those cartoonlike computer effects. Olaf Ittenbach is absolutely fabulous as the gore master from Germany because he likes to do the FX the classic way without the help of computer animation.The movie is composed of two Tales from the Cryptlike stories and the main subject is the trip of the eternal heart through time from the alchemistic Middle Age to present days causing a gore marathon on its way.The main characters are sadistic psychos who really enjoy to torture and kill their victims in the most gory way someone could imagine. The acting is quite good and impressive for this kind of movie because it makes you really feel the terror and pain of the victims.This is not a scary movie it's just a very well done splatter horror from Europe much better then many Hollywood movies of the genre.I give it a 10 out of 10 because Olaf Ittenbach rules!".

	schema:reviewBody "German director Olaf Ittenbach is widely known for his gory films and Beyond The Limits sure is a gorefest. Unfortunately the excessive violence and gore as well as a tiny bit of macabre humor are the the only values this movie is recommendable for. Granted there are a few shock moments i'll give it that. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and most of the performances are ridiculously terrible. Furthermore it has recently become popular among lowbudget horror directors to accompany their movie with recurring and extremely annoying computergenerated soundtracks and the 'eerie' score of this movie is no exception. Still this movie is worth your time in case you want nothing but gore. The gore is excessive on the one hand but in no way shocking or disturbing. In case its a brainless gorefest you're looking for Beyond The Limits is your kind of movie allthough there are plenty of brainless gorefests that I would recommend a hundred times before this one. But in case you have any expectations regarding suspense or eeriness whatsoever I recommend to switch this one. The film is divided into two main parts one of which plays in present times the other one in the 15th century. Even though I am a fan of medieval Horror I liked the first part slightly better since it doesn't even bother to fake a plot and simply concentrates on being gory. Over all Beyond The Limits is not a total disaster if you're just looking for gore but if you're looking for a plot avoid this. Not even recommendable to hardcore gorehounds.".

Good production values excellent SFX and a coherent if a little sparse story to keep things interesting or two if you want to split hairs. The movie tells two tales as told by the caretaker of a cemetery about two of his most notorious acquisitions. The first is a story of cross loyalties based around 500000 a case of coke and a laughable sadist with a facial tattoo. The second is a trip back in time to learn the story of the 'Eternal Heart' an ancient relic used to resurrect Belial. Both stories contain adequate amounts of gore and sadism which is colourfully and imaginatively displayed. A good solid splatterfest for those who have the stomach for it.".

The character Mortimer ranks as one of the most sadistic I've ever seen depicted on screen.The acting is pretty bad but this isn't the kind of movie you watch for the acting.  I did like the storyline.  It starts off in Present Day and jumps back to the 15th Century to explain what the present day shindig was really about.I highly recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of goresplatter movies.  It's pretty offensive and someone who is squeamish won't appreciate it too much but it's definitely worth watching.".

The powerful gangster Jimmie Levinson James MatthewPyecha accuses his former partner Paul Pattuchi Joe Cook of stealing a load of cocaine and orders to kill his beloved girlfriend Clarice Xenia Seeberg. Paul is found dead later in a cottage and Jimmie and his friends and girlfriends are visited during a dinner party by Robert Downing Daryl Jackson first and then by the sadistic Mortimer Simon Newby and his partner Rick Thomas Reitmair seeking the truth about Paul and a suitcase with a mysterious relic. The second story takes place in the Middle Ages where the cruel David Deming David Creedon and his minion Tom Brewster Russell Friendenberg chase the renegade priest James Flynn Hank Stone in the name of the Inquisition but actually trying to force him to reveal the secret of the Eternal Heart to grant immortality.The lowbudget Beyond the Limits is extremely gore but is not a bad movie. Most of the performances are only reasonable the choreography of the fights with sword is terrible but I liked the plot. There is an enormous exploitation of violence but the special effects are very impressive and realistic. The only work of director Olaf Ittenbach that I have had the chance to see is the awful Legion of the Dead and Beyond the Limits is better and better showing a great improvement in his career. The characters Mortimer mainly and Brewster are among the most sadistic I have ever seen. The torture at the dinner table and in the castle chamber the massacre in the church and the trip to Hell are extremely impressive and strong and of course not recommended to sensitive persons. My vote is six.Title Brazil Alm dos Limites Beyond the LimitsNote On 30 May 2013 I saw this movie again.".

The middle age episode is the one which contains the most splatter effects  not that disturbing brutality as the modern episode. Here you see what can be done with swords an axes. Lots of blood and gore of course. The modern episode  as mentioned  is like a kick or some more in the teeth. Painful to watch  hard to believe. Of course  splatter at its best  but there is absolute nothing funny in this movie  as splatter usually has. So if you are prepared to see one of the hardest sadistic most violent kills ever  this one is the right thing for you. If you are about to watch a funny splatter movie  you better think twice. This movie is definitely beyond the limits.".

Of course  splatter at its best  but there is absolute nothing funny in this movie  as splatter usually has. So if you are prepared to see one of the hardest sadistic most violent kills ever  this one is the right thing for you. If you are about to watch a funny splatter movie  you better think twice. This movie is definitely beyond the limits.";

	schema:headline " Good solid gore flick";
	schema:reviewBody "I first bought this as a blind buy and I'm glad I did. Ittenbach went all out on this one. For those of you not familiar with Olaf Ittenbach he specialises in lowbudget gore films that actually are semiprofessional in looks if not acting and the effects are impressive enough to BE professional. Anyway Beyond the Limits is basically divided into 3 sections 2 of them are set in present day and one back in medieval times. Two of them are accounts of a story told to a reporter by a guy who looks after a graveyard. He begins to talk about the recent death of a local gangster and gradually recounts the story of why he died.First episode a gangster is having a party at a house and basically has double crossed some people or something. Things really spin out of control however when the party gets crashed by a sadistic murderer and his partner. Use your imagination for what happens next. All manner of dismemberments explodings of heads throat slittings shotgun blasts to the chest at point blank and loads more with various implements  not forgetting the machete. Ittenbach didn't hold back here this is all out carnage.The second episode takes you back to medieval times where some guy who lives in a castle has a vendetta against some religious villagers. Plus he's also after something. There's a bloody massacre in a church  men women and children in various gruesome ways and is done with brutality and delight by the knights. This second episode centres around a knight who is hard pressed to protect his pretty wife and also to try and protect the villagers from the unyielding castle lord. Things take a sinister turn for the worse when he's discovered as a traitor and has to battle against the this madman who will stop at nothing  rape torture and murder to get what he's looking for. You'll see by the way  that the 2 stories are linked. At the end of this second episode we get an extremely graphic portrayal of Ittenbach's vision of hell. At the end the film cuts back to the present day when the reporter discovers that the evil that drove these men is still alive today.As summaries go that was longer than anticipated but I think the story is better than some of his other films. In terms of gore well....we've got the whole bundle. Torture rape and brutal massacre's are the order of the day and everything is done in a convincing and professional way. The acting could be better sometimes but again the emphasis is not on that. To put it simply it does the job. And that should be enough for anyone who would watch a film like this. Amongst the carnage are some fairly nice settings  the nicest being the knight and his wife in a snowladen wood. Its nice to have these little scenes interrupting the bloodshed gives the film a whole other angle. Make no mistake it's primarily a gore film but variety adds to the mix.I don't want to spoil the whole film for you I think I've made my point. Watch it and appreciate the professionalism and effort that have gone into it. I recommend Ittenbach's other stuff Legion of the Dead Garden of Love if you like things like this. Make sure you get the uncut version though!".

I don't believe Ittenbach's films will ever win an Oscar for the best script but on the other hand I have had to endure much worse during my search for halfway decent splatter flicks. BTW the English track is IMHO superior to the German dubbed version. Splatter effects are pretty good andfor the most parteffective provided you catch the uncut version 106 minutes although not quite as numerous as in Premutos. Beware of German rental version it is cut by approx. 5 minutes. Recommended to Ittenbach and splatter fans. All others proceed at your own risk.".

	schema:reviewBody "First understand this movie is a slasher gore fest. Blood for the sake of blood. made to be very camp badly dialogued and really bloody. But the movie redeems itself in a several important ways. It keeps the attention the story is kind of fun and the effects are great as well as original. The film is not linear which is refreshing as well and credit must be given to the director Directed by Olaf Ittenbach and writer Thomas Reitmair A feel of the Dark Ages permeates the entirety of the film's course showing the savagery of the times without a lot of recourse for the feint at heart.Yes the acting in this movie is by far the worst acting I've ever seen in my entire life. Lines read with out inflection tone feeling or believability of character. The editing is very bad and sadly rushed.The effects are terrific though and the plausibility of the storyline is kind of fun leaving just enough mystery to keep the attention of the viewer. See in movies like these generally they give too much away right at the start which shows bad scripting and bad directing thankfully this movie manages to circumvent those two major obstacles.This movie verges on the realm of extreme Japanese horror without being Japanese. Reminiscent of Movies like Flowers of Flesh and Blood Ichi the Killer. Although Ichi the Killer has something this movie does not and that is the charisma of good acting.The ending is pretty good and I found my interest kept right until the end simply because the actors who are decent draw you in and the effects are really cool in the end. Overall I rate it a 6.5 It could have been better what with the acting and editing and some cohesion problems but thats okay. There is much worse. This movie is not for the feint of heart.".

For this purpose he kidnaps the only one left with The Voice a beautiful singer but a TV repairman witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old TV antenna in the mountains in order to halt Mr. TV's evil plans.The production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery. Although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema Esteban Sapir also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own like a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks with each other through text balloons usually floating near their mouths the louder they talk the larger the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. In the opening sequence we see a book titled La Antena that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages. There are hardly any references to Argentina. It's constantly snowing which gives the film a very unArgeninian feel while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the Northen hemisphere with only some of the songs revealing the film's Argentinian background.The pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen it's hard to keep track of the film's surreal narrative. Not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at we're also given a few messages about media monopolies corruption and totalitarianism but they are breezily packaged.

As a silent cinema fan I'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yesteryear cinema. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it the movie references directly Lang's Metropolis and the allegoricalparabolic character of his plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. There's a more obvious Melieshomage though the Moon with a here cigarsmoking human face and the papermade painted mountains and citylandscapes. I enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals and in the meantime I found very interesting the story on muteness and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city. From this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the muteness of the silent cinema because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters. In this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form or there's an intention to play upon the muteness of the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflexion I found in Guy Maddin's Carefulwhere the inhabitants of a mountainvillage have restrictions in using their voices. I intend to write a paper on it if you know movies related to this topic please let me know!!! I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to every moviegoer one of the critics called it the jewel of the festival.PS Winners were announced and the film won the award for best cinematography!".

Aside from this the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice perception and opinion. In truth it's not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows.

La Antena melds the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology making it the ultimate exercise in postmodern filmmaking.The film is set in the timeless The City Without a Voice so called because the citizens have been rendered speechless by Mr. TV a dictatormedia mogul with his hair painted on. The City resembles the titular one in Fritz Lang's seminal Metropolis 1927 perhaps 100 years before that film. It is all expressionist skyscrapers TV aerials and animated billboards.The citizens of the City are mollified by La Voz The Voice the only person with the gift of speech. Her face perpetually shrouded by a hood kept on even when she is naked La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television network. But when Mr. TV concocts a plan to steal the written word as well La Voz and her eyeless son join forces with a renegade family in an attempt to return the freedom of speech to the people.La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Burdening himself with the conventions of the silent film Sapir has to rely upon images to tell his story. There is sound most notably in the almost continuous score by Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent movie music as well as ingenuously working itself into the film's diegesis such as the beeping of car horns or the rhythmic ratatattat of gunfire. And underlying the whole film is a familiar whirring as if it were being shown on an ancient projector.There is a fair amount of dialogue as well. But instead of using intertitles Sapir has the characters' words appear in the frame. They are larger or smaller filling the screen or hovering meekly in the air depending on what is being said. Think a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch 2004.Thankfully the words don't distract from the images. Which is very fortunate indeed because La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time all captured by Cristian Cottet's sumptuous blackandwhite photography. There are the expressionist cityscapes. The hooded singer and her eyeless son. There is the city's abandoned aerial which looks like the decayed remains of some colossal spider. And there's the sinister Dr. Y whose jabbering mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face.La Antena has been criticised for relying too much on its imagery while skimping on the allegorical depth. But again I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mindcontrol machine shaped like a swastika or the eyeless boy seemingly crucified on a Star of David feels out of place a tad over the top in what is otherwise merely a wellcrafted fairy tale.But the lack of overt symbols the two previous examples aside works in the film's favour. It allows us to make up our own minds to decide whether to infer political meaning to see La Antena as an allegory for fascism the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media or to just take the film at face value as a visually stunning adventure through a world simultaneously unique and familiar.The sacrifice of explicit depth in favour of unique imagery may seem like a compromise. But really when a film looks as good as this it's hard to care. There is more imagination and artistry in every frame of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derivative stick at. Evoking films almost 100 years old might be futile but in doing so Sapir may be showing us what is lacking in the films of today. He may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.".

	schema:headline " A reinvention of the silent movie and a powerful cautionary tale";
	schema:reviewBody "La Antena an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale. The setting is a city in thrall to mindless television its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as The Voice. In a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends. It is up to a young family and The Voice's nameless eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing.This is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve the overt references to silent movie greats such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge.La Antena mines the clichd plot devices and theatrical overacting common to so many silent films albeit in a very knowing and humorous way. It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a Studio Ghibli animation  and all this using real actors and handmade sets.Moreover though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical this is still an unsettling provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the TV Empire and the waning power of words. At the same time many of the most powerful images are original ones including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish TV food factory.I hate to end this review on a sour note but I feel that the Englishlanguage release of La Antena is let down by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect with much playing around with words on screen. However the Englishlanguage subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves. La Antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale.".

Something about its premise put me off from watching it for so long foolish considering that no premise could accurately sell La Antena.In a big city of voiceless denizens in a time unspecified television has a unique control over the masses the soothing singing of the uniquely gifted La Voz The Voice fascinating them. The behooded singer does so under the employ of the evil Seor TV in order to earn eyes for her blind son whothrough a mistaken addressbefriends Anna the daughter of a recently dismissed television technician.The summary I have just composed is both entirely accurate and completely irrelevant. Such is the nature of La Antena a film which immediately announces itself as rather more than just a narrativewild wacky and wholly original though that narrative may be. Firstly the film is aesthetically stunning composed in a beautiful monochrome effulgently photographed and composed of a miasma of fantastic effects which hearken back to cinema's earliest days. The references to the cinema of days gone by are many and frequent in both the visuals the lighting the camera angles and of course a replication of the moon itself from Mlis' Le Voyage dans la Lune. The film is completely packed with tips of the hat to German Expressionism Film Noir andI'm reliably informed having yet to see it myselfLang's Metropolis. It is undoubtedly a film for cinephiles the throwbacks to the silent era a delight to witness and mixed expertly with the aforementioned early techniques. Double exposures are commonplace used to delightful effect especially toward the end of the film. What is modern and innovative about the film however is its abandonment of the classic silent film intertitle in favour of words given physical interactive form onscreen. The words mouthed by the silent characters appear before them echoing an earlier statement along the lines of we still have our words. These objects are manipulatable lending the film an odd but undeniably unique quality which furthers its memorability. As a largely silent film it relies heavily upon its soundtrack which does a solid job often mixing with the actions onscreen in a slightly comical way. The bizarre arrangement of characters adds to the humour which runs throughout the film a largely situational humour engendered through the oddity of this world and those occupying it. Large parts of the narrative are unsurprisingly unfathomable the film much more about allegory than it is storyline. Save for two particularly detractive and diminutive pieces of symbolism in the film's final act it functions as an inquisitive social commentary gently criticising the manipulation of the masses by the mainstream media and suggesting that perhaps we need a saviour of sorts from the brainless garbage which attempts to control usa role it jokingly suggests it might itself fulfil.Bookended by particularly wonderful sequences of a typewriter's words translating to music La Antena is quite quite unlike anything else you are ever likely to see. Originality is this film's fort reference and fond recreation its cornerstone. Though its message is perhaps a little too gentle to be of any significant effect it is the kind of film that ought to be enjoyed by all who love cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Authorship and the film La AntenaBy Rafiqfuad YarahmadiAuthorship in cinemaThe key directors of the French New Wave Jean Luc Godard Francois Truffaut Claude Chabrol Eric Rohmer had been a filmed critic writing for the French cinema magazine Cahiers du Cinema. This was the first film journal to treat cinema as an art form and to discuss it in an academic way. In the early 1950s this group of critics developed an argument through a long series of articles which became known as 'la politique des auteurs'. Taken up by American critics in the 1960s these ideas became known as the auteur theory or authorship theory. In their writings the critics argued that film was primarily a visual medium rather a literary one and that the director was the author of a film in the same way as a writer is the author of a novel. In one influential essay 'La Camera Stylo' 1954 Alexander Astruc argued that the film director 'writes' a film with the camera as if he was an artist with a paintbrush. Rather than film language being used for the adaptation of a script it should be the visual language which is most important. Therefore the director is the true author of a film because the visual language is the language of cinema the script is literary a different language entirely. Authorship in film is a subject of debate in theory of film since the Cahiers du Cinema critics in 1950s for the first time birthed author theory. They believed that films should reflect a director's personal vision. Some directors such as Akira Kurosawa and Alfred Hitchcock are famous for been authors of their movies. 'This doesn't mean that the directors is an expert at every job or dictates every thing. The director can represent tasks to trusted members of crew and directors often work usually with certain actors cinematographers screenwriters and editors'. Film Art page 33According to Francois Truffaut in an article that he published in Cahiers du Cinema in 1954 'an expression of his own personality' an auteur converts the movie into something personal. The main version of French authorship theory was the impression of making a film different to the director by introducing ideas of his own into the characters and the story beyond what the story needed. According to Film History by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson the idea of authorship engaged with the growing art film in 1950s and 1960s. The prestigious directors of the period started to write their own scripts all followed distinctive themes and stylistic choices in film after film. Film festivals managed to honour the director as a main creator. Tati Michelangelo Antonioni and others become 'brand' names in a commercial context. In 1960s and 1970s auteurism helped in creation of film studies. Film viewers made the idea of authorship a commonplace in the film culture. Most of film fans used term of auteurism as a kind of taste not just for filmart directors but they used also for Steven Spielberg Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone who were Hollywood filmmakers. Something that we have to consider is that feature movies never been made by one person. A big crew such as producer cinematographer director editor and lots of ideas and days of hard work go into collaborating on a film production. We should know that only theory of authorship would not answer the questions for all movies. As we know the process of filmmaking film often supports with a more collaborative style of authorship than other artistic media. Even there are some movies that been recognised for their writing or directing style but the true authorship lies in the intentionality of the collective that produced the final product. La AntenaLa antenna is a thriller movie directed by directorwriter Estabin Sapir stars of this movie are Vleria Bertuccelli Alejandro Urdapilleta and Julieta Cardinali. This monochrome film was made in Argentina which the mostly is silent. I can clearly say that the theme of film is about media mind control. This film has got a comic vision and reminds me the Georges Melies's A Trip to the Moon and the strange city in the film is remind me the film Metropolis by Fritz Lang. A dictator called Mr TV in a timeless city has made all the citizens of the city speechless. The city is looks like the Fritz Lang's Metropolis and it is so similar to Expressionist movies with animated billboards TV aerials and towers. The Voice the only citizen who can speak calms people who live in this city. We can't see her face and a hood masks her face. The Voice is forced to have a singing programme on Mr TV s television. The only food that people in this city can get to eat is Mr TV.'s brand food. This behaviour remind us the dictatorship and totalitarianism in those countries that people hasn't have freedom of speech and the film shows swastika symbol several times. He is working on a device and wants to hypnotize his people to be able to control citizens and this is really similar factory scene in Modern Times movie by Charles Chaplin that the factory manager tries to control all workers by using CCTV.

To observe that it is in a certain sense objectively bad using codantique techniques gets closer to the point as times I felt as if I was watching a hybrid of a film by Guy Maddin and the 'Clangers'. But whereas Maddin can feel a little too selfconscious the strange style of the telling of 'La Antena' feels completely of a piece with the strange world being portrayed as if the narrative form comes naturally from the tale.

Several young boys have volunteered to fight with the remains of the German Army on the Eastern Front and their mothers take on a desperate journey to get them back home. This is told in black and white with only small doses of softening and taking stand for the German cause basically a human drama of motherly uncompromising love officers and generals torn between duty and human common sense and boys who feel like deserters if they would be forced to be boys again. And also a little love story between of the widowed mothers and an Officer. Everything is there dominating performances by Therese Giehse and Bernhard Wicki but just a warmup for the much more focused and uncompromising Masterpiece to follow.".

Several young boys have volunteered to fight with the remains of the German Army on the Eastern Front and their mothers take on a desperate journey to get them back home. This is told in black and white with only small doses of softening and taking stand for the German cause basically a human drama of motherly uncompromising love officers and generals torn between duty and human common sense and boys who feel like deserters if they would be forced to be boys again. And also a little love story between of the widowed mothers and an Officer. Everything is there dominating performances by Therese Giehse and Bernhard Wicki but just a warmup for the much more focused and uncompromising Masterpiece to follow.";

Some fine performances are mixed with some pretty dreadful ones. Some great lines are mixed with some dreadful clichs. The cinematography was superb throughout. The star performance is that of Therese Giehse. How did she not have a wider fame outside of Germany? Bernhard Wicki who does pretty well appears interestingly in the later movie Paris Texas.".

Emmy the daughter of the local pawnbroker is impressed by his humble appearance and soft spoken ways so that she pays him a higher amount than the instrument is worth. Their friendship commences and she soon learns a song everyone seems to be singing on the streets was written by the young impoverished composer. Later he at his job teaching math to a class of young students when he becomes distracted and starts instead to compose music. But instead of being fired when caught by a superior he is offered a chance to perform for some very influential people at a forthcoming soire and to be introduced to the Countess Kinsky.With rented clothes he tries hard to impress everyone there with a very difficult and beautiful piece of music he wrote just for the occasion. However a beautiful young lady Eggerth arrives late and is teased by here friends until she laughs out loud spoiling the concert. The composer angrily stops and refuses to play on storming out of the event and ending his chances at being discovered by the elite.With his career over before it started he needs a job and he's offered a commision by a very wealthy patron if he will come and give music lessons to his children. Schubert is surprised to discover the counts daughter is the same beauty who disrrupted his concert and she wants to make amends. He keeps his anger at bay and starts to instruct her in how to read music and she not only learns quickly but when she starts to sing the piece he is stunned at how beautiful her voice is! He then lets he know that the piece she so beautifully sang was also his composition. Soon they start to develop feelings for each other but he knows they are far apart in class. She then tries to show she can love like a peasant girl when she dances a Czardas for him one evening at the village inn. Despite the differences both want to get married. However her father thwarts their plans and arranges for a speedy marriage to a member of the aristocracy. After his return to Vienna Schubert receives a letter calling him back only to arrive on the wedding day.Just at the time of the wedding Schubert arrives at the castle. As unexpected 'wedding gift' he hands her his unfinished symphony which he finally completed. At the point at which they had then laughed particularly loud Caroline now falls into a swoon.

It is not one of the greatest composer biopics out there but it is one of the most unjustly underappreciated ones and a must for those who loves Schubert's music and wants to know more about him. There are a few instances of less than sumptuous photography though most of the time it's fine stilted dialogue and dull sound but criticisms really are few.'Lover Divine' is mostly lushly produced with gorgeous costumes and elegant settings with a truly luscious romantic atmosphere evoked. The story of the composer's life and how he came to not finish the symphony makes for fascinating viewing it may not be entirely accurate but historical accuracy or lack of it however hardly ever masks my enjoyment for the film and regardless it is beautifully told.Words cannot describe how masterful Schubert's music is we are given a healthy dose of it here some of it among his most famous pieces and his best and it benefits hugely from the involvement of the rich playing of the orchestra and the fine singing from Eggerth. Standouts are Eggerth's rendition of Standchen beginning with the line Leise Flehen Meine Lieder and the movingly stirring choral performance of Ave Maria. The use of the Unfinished symphony was too inspired.Willi Forst directs well. Hans Jaray is a wonderfully sensitive and confident Schubert while Eggerth beguiles again in a role well suited to her. The supporting cast are more at ease in 'Unfinished Symphony' but they are still more than competent.In conclusion lovely if not quite divine. 810 Bethany Cox".

But it's one of those movies that grows on you with time. Even if you don't like it at first give it some time. You have to accept this movie for what it is. A dark comedy aimed at poking fun of the lighter things in life. Jim Carrey obviously carries the movie with his infamous quirkiness but Matthew Broderick holds his own as the anal retentive guy which he is great at playing. Whether you are talking about the Midevil Times restaurant scene or the karaoke scene this movie is a gem. Highly recommended.".

The actors fill their roles extremely well Broderick perhaps a little underwhelming but Carrey's astonishingly dark and eerie portrayal of his character carries the film. the cameos are brilliant and show the respect the movie received by those who read the script with many top actors willing to appear for only short roles. in the vein of other Stiller comedies that must not be taken at face value such as the classic Zoolander this film genuinely needs a repeat viewing. and try to forget Carrey was ever Ace Ventura before you watch the movie. naysayers will be converted! full marks!".

When word of Carrey's enormous 20 million paycheck for this film spread hopes were high that Cable Guy would be smothered in Carrey's slice of hilarious dementia to the extreme.Carrey certainly brought an air of craziness to Chip Douglas a lonely TVaddicted and creepy cable installer who befriends the unwilling Matthew Broderick here looking just nervous and bewildered for the entire film. But something was missing from this Carrey vehicle from the others he was not all fun and games. In fact he was downright funny weird not funny haha.So here lies one of the major problems people have with this film it veers from dark comedy into darkness period.  Carrey isn't making an ass of himself in every scene.  No.  Instead Carrey's Chip Douglas is an obsessive extreme twofaced sociopath.  The result? What would be Jim Carrey's best performance to date surpassed only by his Truman Burbank in The Truman Show.Sure it's got a story that's been done to death normal guy meets psycho and is stalked.  But oh what fun it is to see Jim drag Matthew Broderick into such uncomfortable situations as playing Porno Password with his parents Carrey whispering Nipple into Broderick's ear is absolute brilliance.Cable Guy is definitely not for fans who want to see Jim Carrey do what created his career that is silly goofy and flailing comedy.  However avid fans of black comedies will love seeing Carrey's first step in his evolution as a gifted serious and undeniably interesting actor.8 out of 10.".

Personally I don't consider The Cable Guy a comedy at all. Sure there are some side splitting moments  Carrey is hilarious alongside Matthew Broderick's by the numbers 'average Joe' but id suggest that anyone who was not taken in by this film to look at it a little differently...This is a horror film. I swear!For me Chip Douglas does not come across to me as a harmless lisping clingy chump  HELL NO! The guy is a maniac. An obsessive intelligent controlling stalking Fatal Attraction styled nutter!Watch it again!For me this is Jim Carrey's career launching performance. He has a lisp right? after a while you don't really notice it do you? Right. This is an incredibly difficult task for an actor  maintaining a speech impediment for an entire film keeping it level and not exaggerating it its really something to take a look at. Carrey's character is sick and very very creepy. With Broderick et al giving relatively standard performances Carrey's performance is a stand out and Ben Stiller should be proud of this film and what it lead to in terms of Jim Carrey's career.Trust me if you didn't like this take another look and prepare to be freaked out by a very not funny very creepy Carrey performance...810".

	schema:reviewBody "To some people movies are more than a passion. They are a way of life. For me movies are not only one of my favorite hobbies but I feel that all films express a certain reflection of the individual watching them. They say that you can tell a lot from a person by the way they act talk walk. I believe you can also tell a lot about a person from the sort of movies they like. And I think that for Chip Douglas Jim Carrey movies and television are more than disposable entertainment. They are his entire life. He is consumed by film to such an extent that he creates multiple personas based on TV personalities. Many critics bashed Carrey's performance for being too sadistic. I think it's perfect because it's daring and hugely different than his other movies and accurately reflects the mindset of a troubled individual who has grown up on his TV rather than actually experiencing true life. Not many movies are like The Cable Guy and most of them don't have the guts to make a statement so bold and striking.In The Cable Guy Carrey is the title character his real name supposedly Chip Douglas but towards the end we're not really sure what's true and false anymore. Chip works for a cable company and offers to hook up new apartment tenant Steven Matthew Broderick up with illegal cable. All Douglas asks for in return is a friendship which Steven reluctantly agrees to. But what he doesn't realize is that Chip is an obsessive monster  bred on films as a child and unable to separate celluloid from reality he pursues a Fatal Attraction route and begins to stalk Steven. This is one of those movies like What About Bob? where the hero is apparently the only one who realizes how crazy the bad guy is. Richard Dreyfuss went nuts trying to convince his family of Bill Murray's insanity in Bob. In The Cable Guy Matthew Broderick has a tough time trying to expose Chip's sadistic side.I am not Carrey's biggest fan. But I have to admit that over time the comedian has grown on me. And when I see him in Dumb and Dumber I can't picture anyone else taking on the role. Here he is in another role where I can see no one else portraying his character and yet he still hasn't convinced me that he's a great talent. Strange.I think Carrey's comedy is distinct and the reason his films have become more wellreceived over the years is because he has invented a certain area of modernday comedy and thrived in that cubby hole for quite some time. I believe that humor is not existent it is invented. Different forms of humor come and go. Right now Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey are two of the highestpaid comedians the world and yet in fifty years where will they be?Comedy is constantly changing. Humor is invented and reinvented to the point that what was once funny no longer is. That is why so many comedies from various eras of American history seem so outdated by today's standards. We are living in a world of Jim Carreys Adam Sandlers and Mike Myers. Although they still receive jobs Steve Martin Eddie Murphy Bill Murray and especially Dan Aykroyd  some of the most popular comedians of the '80s  have found themselves all stuck in ruts filming kiddie movies for Disney and  some of them especially Murray and Aykroyd  departing comedy to pursue more serious careers in an area of film that will never become outdated drama for Murray it is Lost in Translation Aykroyd is less lucky with projects such as Pearl Harbor which might as well be classified as comedy.The movie was directed by Ben Stiller who carefully balances the neurotic against the sweet. The movie has its fair share of cameos and in a great sequence Owen Wilson stars as a confident jerk who takes out Steven's girlfriend on a date. The Cable Guy finds out and thinking he's doing Steven a favor assaults Wilson in the bathroom of a fancy restaurant.Perhaps the reason so many critics disliked The Cable Guy when it was released in 1996 was because they found themselves relating to Carrey's character. Maybe not. All I know is that it is one of the most daring and surprising comedies of the '90s  not especially great but very unique and entertaining. I relate to its main character because we both love movies. My obsession is much calmer than Chip's. But the film does have a good eye for spotting good areas of satire. Yes it's often rather dark and absurd. But isn't that the point?45.".

Chip Douglas is an interesting guy because he is both desperate and confident. On one hand he can't believe someone wants to know his name on the other he is adept at sabotaging Stevens life even putting him behind bars. Clever huh? It is underrated and Carrey's manner is really very good. It is jampacked full of subtle connotations and interesting undercurrents as Chip crosses the line again and again...".

What a sick joke this movie has such a low rating on IMDb. I have a sneaking suspicion it's down to the pathological Jim Carrey haters rather than based on the movie's merits. I'm giving it a star more than I would have otherwise as a protest vote.I guess if a particular person in a movie annoys you that much then it's going to preclude it from being a good movie for you but surely you can take a step back and say something like ah now wait a minute that's just my personal dislike for an individual and it wouldn't really be fair to transfer that dislike onto any collective effort they happened to be a part of. What about the poor writer director other actors and the crew? I know I've made a big assumption there and it's possible people just didn't find it funny. I find that so hard to believe though  I've seen a hell of a lot of comedies over the last 40 years and find the vast majority made from 1990 onwards to be safe lazy and badlywritten or more recently trying to be zany or alternative and failing miserably. However I found this surprisingly wellwritten wellmade and brilliantlyactedcomedy acting not OliverGielgud! and allround compelling and bloody hilarious.I think it's a great idea  the central character's minor misdemeanour at the start results in immediate payback in the form of a demented psychopath taking over his life. It gets pretty dark in a couple of places which somehow makes the humour work better.Whatever you think of Jim Carrey the range of stuff he pulls off on screen is incredible. Like a reanimated old Vaudevillian on PCP. I found him totally convincing as the lonely Walter Mittypsycho who really just needs a friend and uses what he knows best to make it happen. Broderick is a born fall guy and effortlessly provides the anythingforaquietlife victim illequipped to halt the psycho's hostile takeover of his life.There's also a microelement of social comment on using people friendship the abuse of power and the influence TV can have on a person's life. Tutt and scoff all you want at that but can you honestly say there's even that much depth in any other comedies made now? So for anybody who doesn't hate Jim Carrey please don't listen to all the negative reviews and give this one a chance.".

If Jim Carrey can be said to be one of those actors where you either love him or hate him then the same can be said for this movie. It has a very particular type of often quite dark humor in it which doesn't appeal to a lot of people but in which Carrey thrives. If you didn't like this movie give it another watch. You might change your mind. This movie is a must for any Carrey fan or any fan of good 90's comedy. Ben Stiller does a fantastic job directing and the rest of the cast supports Carrey's role brilliantly.1010Also I heard that the Chip Douglas role wasn't originally intended for Carrey but after watching it can you honestly picture anyone else executing it so damn well??".

This was undoubtedly what hindered my appreciation of the film the first time i watched it a few years ago and i think why some critics and the IMDb mark it poorly. The only mistake of the film is it tries to please Carey fans with classic Carey comedy which he does so well in 'Ace Ventura' and 'The Mask'and challenge the viewers intellectually as well. As a viewer this is a difficult duality to comprehend and enjoy however on 2nd and 3rd viewings the inherent quality's present themselves. Careys character i say character because he has a multitude of names in the film although surreal is the product of a technology that effects us all the television.SPOILERIn a sense he is the darkest product of that technology a man without a singular identity but that engendered by years raised by the television. Careys character has no understanding of social interaction in the real world and so fails to connect with reality. Instead he acts inappropriately within every context and is subsequently rejected by Steven Played by Matthew Brodrick who brilliantly captures the normality of the average joe in a sense he is the pure opposite of Carey almost grounded in reality superfluously i just don't have enough room in my life for a new friend. The film ends poetically with Carey's epiphany that he must destroy his creator. Symbolically Careys conflict with television represents every child's relationship with its parent culminating in the child's rebellion. Great film 810".

Also was the brilliant and yet creepy performances by Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick. they played a very good comedic team and Jim Carrey really shined as the film's antagonistic cable guy who just needs a friend. this is one of those hidden masterpieces that people don't know about. Go buy the movie folks. It's 6.99 at best buy and worth every penny. Although it has very dark undertones it never ceases to put me in a good mood for like the rest of the day.

Now that will start anyone's career off to a blazing start! What was Jim's audience expecting? More silly comedy. Parents take their kids to The Cable Guy title fits a dumb silly JC comedy and wonder what is going on here! This is a movie for today's kids not back in 96. That is why this movie holds up so well. It is an adult dark comedy.Matthew Broderick was as usual boring but that complimented Carrey. The supporting cast was great. A lot of up and coming stars. Comedies are really a string of scenes like a SNL episode that at the end hope to make any sense. There are few really good comedy movies. The Cable Guy has all the good scenes and ties it together pretty well.Beneath the surface is a lot of depth about a very lonely guy trying to connect because he was abandoned as a kid and TV was the world he knew. This rings true for many. He felt empowered with his special customers and overcompensated but deep down just wanted a buddy. I think this movie is much more honest than many would admit!".

When it was released in the mid90's Jim Carrey's fans were expecting another Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. When they were taken down a different road they kind of stayed away a rare weak box office take for the Gumbylike funnyman. I however embraced the darkness and relentless mischief that his character displayed. Make no doubt about it he earned his paycheck 20 million I believe. And yes Jim sometimes goes over the top the lisp thing got a little tiring but he finds common ground with the addition of Matthew Broderick playing straight man to his lonely desperate soul Carrey's character has 34 names which I won't reveal.The film is not really about cable installment. It's about the need for friendship and the measures taken to achieve it. With each viewing if you decide to view it more than once you realize more and more that The Cable Guy is vastly underrated. Look for funny cameos from young unknowns Owen Wilson Lesile Mann and star in the making Jack Black pre HiFidelity. Ben Stiller's direction is risky but it pays off showcasing a flick you can laugh at while feeling a tiny speck of empathy at the same time. Oh and watch for a side plot involving Stiller. Just think the 1993 murder trial of the Menendez brothers. Remember it's a parody so there is no need to take it too seriously.".

Enters the quirky and slightly deranged cable guy Jim Carey whom then never exits...A rather simple plot which became in 1996 a very odd and yet pleasurable film indeed. Although following a pretty straight forward structure the script provides enough background to Jim Carey's character to make of him a lot more than just a runofthemill weirdo while Matthew Broderick aptly counterbalance the excessive title role by a fair performance of the withoutaglitch nice guy of the piece. The constant referencing to TV culture also makes it an entertaining and strangely enough somewhat nostalgic experience. It is quite obvious that a fair amount of improvisation was incorporated to the piece to sometimes great effect the Silence of the Lamb episode anyone? which I suppose is probably the most effective way to work with someone such as Jim Carey. Curiously however the main asset of the film also becomes at some point its main shortcoming. This was to Jim Carey what 1994's The Good Son was to Macauley Culkin a departure from their comedic roots to more darker territories but as opposed to Joseph Ruben's thriller The Cable Guy seems to always hesitate to boldly go as far as its story would allow it to.

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Carrey has only been better than this in two movies Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Man on the Moon but both were more or less dramatic roles. Aside from the classic Dumb and Dumber none of his comedy roles can even begin to compare to his superb electric performance here. Most people I know don't really enjoy this but that's because they can't really relate or they don't want to. Carrey plays 'Chip Douglas' which might be his real name or it might not a Cable Guy brought up on TV and movies. His performance works so well because he normally goes too far with his antics making himself seem annoying on occasion rather than funny. Here he plays a lunatic so there are no limits for him to adhere to and where he would normally seem over the top the Medieval Times sequence he is genuinely hilarious.Now I might not be a cable guy but I'd be lying if I said that I don't spew lines from random movies out of nowhere and I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an obsession. Maybe it makes fellow fanatics a bit unsettled to see themselves compared to maniacs like Chip which is probably why the critics assaulted this as well. Although this is by and large Carrey's movie there is no doubt that Matthew Broderick Jack Black and Leslie Mann help elevate this film further with excellent performances. Ben Stiller has directed a few other films but none of them even come close to matching this. He keeps a perfect balance between the dark and the funny so The Cable Guy doesn't come across as too mean or sadistic. He also shows up in a running gag as a former child star from a cheesy old sitcom who shoots his own brother and goes to court a trial whose verdict is highly anticipated by pretty much everyone. Owen Wilson has another great cameo as a cocky ass who takes Steven's Broderick girlfriend Mann on a date and gets assaulted by Chip when he goes to the washroom.I have never seen a movie like The Cable Guy and chances are you haven't either. This is a great movie and one of my personal favorites. It's important you don't watch this expecting a cheery slapstick comedy. If you know what to expect this will be a fun time.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Hang On  Thrills and avalanches in high above Rocky Mountains. Cliffhanger is one of my personal favorite action films from Sylvester Stallone from the 90's. This is one of the best actionadventure films that is set in Rocky Mountains. I love love this film to death. This film was filmed and set in a real Rocky Mountains and the mountains were filmed in Italy. They don't make movies like this anymore. I love the fact that they were real mountains not CGI the effects are done for real and they are practical. The film is rated R it has thrills action and men faces nature.You see snow mountains good acting performances from the cast and the director. Everyone did a 100 of them self's in this movie. A real stuntman was paid one million dollars to cross once between two planes at fifteen thousand feet without the aid of any safety devices or trick photography. I would put this movie right between Rocky and Rambo because it is so good action movie ever. It was directed by Renny Harlin who directed A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master Die Hard 2 The Long Kiss Goodnight Deep Blue Sea Mindhunters and Skiptrace. Cliffhanger is my favorite Renny Harlin film. He did a great job directing this film.This is Die Hard in Rocky Mountains  A group of criminals thieves makes an air heist on an airplane in which results three suitcases 100000000 in cash being been lost the Rocky Mountains. Now a group of criminals calls rescue team for help. When 2 search and rescue mountain climbers respond Gabe and Hal they become trapped and hostages in in a search for three bags. Gabe walker Sylvester Stallone is trapped himself in a desperate battle against ruthless criminals and unforgiving nature. The stunt effects were crazy and insane but Sylvester Stallone did all practical stunts him self I love his character Gabe Walker. It is my favorite character that Stallone ever played. In this movie he is not a soldier Vietnam Vet or a Cop he is a rescue climber a normal person who instead muscles guns knives uses his wisdom and his brain to stop the thieves and kidnappers who kidnapped his best friend. I watched this movie 3 years ago with my dad on TV many times even my dad loved the film that time. I really want to say personal thanks to Sylvester Stallone for making this movie. Thank you Sly for this movie I enjoy it It is a fun too see this film.John Lithgow as Eric Qualen is fantastic villain I enjoy his performance. I love love Caroline Goodall as Kristel I love the actress she was great. I love Michael Rooker as Hal Tucker Gabe's best friend who becomes a hostage and Gabe does everything in his power to save him. He couldn't save Sarah Michelle Joyner Hal's girlfriend but now he is trying to save his best friend. Janine Turner as Jesse was excellent as Jesse Gabe's girlfriend. You have Leon who play's another bad guy. Rex Linn is Richard Travers FBI agent who goes rouge I enjoy his performance in this movie.Rambo films Rambo First Blood Part II and First Blood are my top 2 favorite action films of all time Cobra Rocky films Demolition Man are really my all time favorite Stallone films. I am huge Stallone fan he is my number 1 favorite action star of all time. So I have too talk about Cliffhanger because why I think it is so good. It come out in 1993 the same year Jurassic Park come out Hard Target The Fugitive Judgment Night and more. It earn 3 Oscars and it was hit in a worldwide the movie was also in in movie theater I wish I could see this movie in movie theater.My favorite scenes in the film is on the bridge in which Gabe and Jesse find a C4 Plastic explosives set on a bridge and Gabe trigger the trap like in Rambo and they both run and the bridge explodes. Practical effects all done for real it is excellent. One of my favorite scenes is in the cave in which Gabe and Jesse cross the path with bats. I love the fight between Gabe and Kynette Leon it feels the death in this movie is more a slasher film. A beautiful music score from Trevor Jones I love the music score. You also have Paul Winfield and Bruce McGill as cameo role in this movie. Ralph Waite who plays Frank R.I.P. was really decent actor and I love his character to death I really feel bad for him.My favorite personal action film call it what you want I love Sylvester Stallone to death and Cliffhanger to death his best action movie he ever did.".

This is one of the best actionadventure films that is set in Rocky Mountains. I love love this film to death. This film was filmed and set in a real Rocky Mountains and the mountains were filmed in Italy. They don't make movies like this anymore. I love the fact that they were real mountains not CGI the effects are done for real and they are practical. The film is rated R it has thrills action and men faces nature.You see snow mountains good acting performances from the cast and the director. Everyone did a 100 of them self's in this movie. A real stuntman was paid one million dollars to cross once between two planes at fifteen thousand feet without the aid of any safety devices or trick photography.

	schema:reviewBody "Cliffhanger 1993 is one of the best Action thriller heist movies of the 90's. I love this film to death! It is one of my personal favorite movies. Besides the Rocky and Rambo which are Stallone's most popular stuff I would put Cliffhanger right above those! I absolutely LOVE this film!!!! Gabe Walker is awesome I love it. I would put this movie over Rambo III and Cobra because I have enjoy it more than those two films. I don't like Rambo III it is a bad action movie. I love Cobra but Cliffhanger beats Cobra and I love Cliffhanger to death It is my childhood movie. This is the finest action movie of all time and it is a perfect 10 it deals with no CGI but real climbing real action sequences. Dangerous stunts that people could have died. Even for a 70000000 budget movie the action and the stunts are well done for the 90's. Renny Harlin made an awesome job on this movie. The movie is awesome. It has slow motion running jump! The action sequences in this movie are fantastic! It is actually the first best favorite Action that Stallone did I love this film and it is my childhood film I love it. One of the most Stallone hit and the most successful Stallone film! This movie is filmed in the real Rocky Mountains and not a CGI or computer crap the stunts are real and insanely crazy. I watch this movie with my dad on Bluray 3 years ago and I really want to say thank you to Stallone for making this movie. I have enjoy it and even my dad did enjoy it and it is really my favorite memories on my dad so thank you Stallone. Is one of my first best favorite movies ever. Why I love this movie and I put it above Cobra? Simply because the whole movie is about thrills in the rocky mountains during snow time. Renny Harlin's 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger' one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right 'Cliffhanger' rules and we all know it. Stallone uses his mind and not his muscles a machine gun or a hand guns to defeat terrorists. He uses his mind he is rescuing people and he try's to save his friend's life who is held hostage by terrorists. They are thrills suspense avalanche and action all over the place in the Rocky Mountains. And I seriously love this Action thriller. The opening scene where the girl is hanging on the line for her dear life still makes my hands sweaty. And When Gabe Walker couldn't saved her I really felt pain and I mourn with Stallone's character. Cliffhanger was actually the film I grew up with it. It is a stone cold classic action film a film that I will always cherish! Mine favorite is Cliffhanger and almost no one puts Cliffhanger into their favorite best action movie so I put it as my Top 4 best Stallone action movies out there. Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good action film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. On the airplane the plane heist up in the air from planetoplane airborne transfer a money transfer stunt was filmed in the USA as such a stunt is illegal in Europe. The stunt itself cost over 1 million to film. Cliffhanger is a 1993 American action adventure film directed by Renny Harlin and starring Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow. I love this film to death beside Rambo movies it is one of my favorite trills action movies. It is Die Hard in the mountains. I love the music theme from Trevor Jones he write and made a perfect music score that fits to the film. The basic plot story is about A botched midair heist results in suitcases full of cash being searched for by various groups throughout the Rocky Mountains. It is die hard movie in the mountains.This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. It is way to underrated and it is my personal favorite Stallone action movie.".

Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams facefirst into several rock faces with no apparent sideeffects. After all isn't that what action movies are all about?'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness.

	schema:headline " Ah nostalgia for an oldfashioned action movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as Die Hard in a on a.  Cliffhanger is Die Hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it is.But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and  trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.The opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening.  Not even Harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face can dim the sequence's power.The next impressive setpiece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody doublecrosses are completely unexpected.  As Roger Ebert has observed the stuntman who made the midair transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.Later during the avalanche sequence one of the terroriststhieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. So far as I know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot.  But the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how Harlin or more likely one of the secondunit directors knew exactly where to place the camera.I'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain.  The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively lowkey performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.In contrast to many of today's postMatrix comic bookinspired action heroes Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computerenhanced abilities.  In Cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another.  He winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rockystyle pummeling from one of the maddog villains.It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when I first saw this movie as a teenager I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point I actually cheered as one of the most coldblooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter but he's fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says You stay!  You fetch!

No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face and this precipitates a gripping tugofwar between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or at times a Western Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already actionpacked narrative.  Finally Harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.It's a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later.  But perhaps it's best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already.  There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit compared to that clinker Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb's Top 250 list.Rating 8 Very good especially considering most of Stallone's other movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as Die Hard in a on a.  Cliffhanger is Die Hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it is.But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and  trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.The opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening.  Not even Harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face can dim the sequence's power.The next impressive setpiece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody doublecrosses are completely unexpected.  As Roger Ebert has observed the stuntman who made the midair transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.Later during the avalanche sequence one of the terroriststhieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. So far as I know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot.  But the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how Harlin or more likely one of the secondunit directors knew exactly where to place the camera.I'll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain.  The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively lowkey performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.In contrast to many of today's postMatrix comic bookinspired action heroes Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computerenhanced abilities.  In Cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another.  He winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rockystyle pummeling from one of the maddog villains.It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness when I first saw this movie as a teenager I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point I actually cheered as one of the most coldblooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter but he's fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says You stay!  You fetch!  Even a better actor such as Anthony Hopkins might have had trouble with that line.Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.Early in the movie for example Lithgow openly says to one of his men Retire Stallone when he comes down.

Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the actionfight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow Michael Rooker Janine Turner Rex Linn Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. The actionfight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. The villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action drama some suspense excitement thrills and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.".

I knew I would be in for an action packed treat as soon as I realized Stallone was starring in this film however I failed to realized how great the other actors were in this film.Stallone is joined by Michael Rooker Janine Turner and John Lithgow as they produce quite possibly the best action film of 1993. The cast is perfectly selected and chosen to play their parts. It was a joy to see a reversal of roles. I'm not accustomed to seeing Rooker as a hero or Lithgow as a villain it is a refreshing change.I couldn't have asked for a better villain than Lithgow. He is one of the most ruthless and cunning villains I've seen. I enjoyed how he never let anything get in his way and spared no expense to get what he wanted. I'm glad I got the chance to see him play the villain and hope I see it again.Turner gives tremendous support to this film and creates an atmosphere where it is enjoyable to watch. She is the heat that warms a cold room because everytime she comes on screen it seems as though it is hot. It is a delight to see an incredible actress to have that much power. Rooker makes up the other the third of talented actors that makes Cliffhanger a delight to watch. Rooker brings a fresh view to the film as well as credibility all I have to say is awesome work Michael.There is an avalanche of talent in Cliffhanger. Stallone is an unstoppable force and incredible action hero. After watching Cliffhanger I'm convinced that Stallone was the only man for this job. Stallone had the fire in his eyes for this part that told me he means business. Only true action stars have the fire I saw furthermore I was fascinated with the strength power and conviction with which he took on the role.Another reason I enjoyed Cliffhanger was the writing because it contained unbelievable action sequences a man dealing with redemption and dialogue is awesome. I was impressed to see that Stallone also cowrote the script because he really has a knack for what action fans want.Cliffhanger is a supercharged heartracing suspensefilled action thrill ride that you should take because at the end it will leave you asking for more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Was this based on a comicbook? A videogame? A drawing by a 3 yearold? There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action. Nothing. We have hightech international terroristscriminals who bicker like preschool kids Stallone's manofsteeltype resilience towards icecold weather dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious and so on. Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb tangotango. A film that entertains through some suspense good actionsequences and a nice snowy mountainous setting. Oh yes and the unintentional humour.The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our golucky and happy characters who are obviously having a swell time. Then comes a sweatinducing failedrescue part which should make anyone with fearofheights problems want to pull their hair out. And then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action. This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. Stallone's melodramatic exchange with Turner when they meet after a long time is so soapy so clichd so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any selfrespecting viewer. Soon after this display of awful dialogwriting we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. The entire action is one big absurdity but it's mindless fun at its best. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. After the landing our mastercriminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker. They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they won't give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off. DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT??? Very silly. Apparently they don't trust Stallone but surely they know that they can always blackmail him by using Rooker as a hostage. Nevertheless our gangsters make Stallone's climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are  lest there be any doubts. And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they overact brag and snicker in a truly evil manner. Everyone convinced? Good. You'd better be. Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystalclear to everyone.The old guy who flies the chopper... How the hell did he fall for the trap? Firstly he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals and secondly he must have heard Stallone's and Rooker's voices on the walkietalkies. A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. Get off my back! Lithgow I haven't even started climbing on your back. Or Lithgow to Stallone We had a deal but now we only have each other! And as for Lithgow's gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. They are very creative about it they philosophize pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on. Stallone cowrote this thing. I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. I'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I.Q.".

	schema:headline " Die Hard on a mountain spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening to Cliffhanger is meant to be a harrowing experience. We're meant to feel terrible that an innocent woman plunges to her horrible death. But how can we experience the horror when Frank a helicopter pilot played by Ralph Waite out of The Waltons is in the background cackling with laughter. Just watch him. His eyes sparkle when Stallone tells the woman that she's not doing to die and he collapses in near hysterics when she falls. Contrast this with Michael Rooker's overacting  he almost faints when the girl plummets while Frank is hooting in the background  and you have a scene that is nowhere near as powerful as it should be.But to be fair to Stallone and the girl they do a pretty good job. The girl pleads and pleads and Stallone gamely hangs on. And the situation itself is excellent  huge drop cracked harness burly lazymouthed actor trying to hang on to hysterical woman. But whenever I watch the scene I can only see Frank's huge grin his glowing eyes and a shocked reaction that looks more like him doubling over in laughter.However laughter is a common reaction in Cliffhanger. Well for me at least. But that's not to say I dislike the film. It's a very enjoyable action movie. But it can't transcend the clichs of the genre. Instead it buries its face in them and thrashes about like mad for over an hour and a half.One of the clichs the film adheres to is that the villain must be English. Well at least I think he is. John Lithgow puts on an accent of some sort. But it's an amusing performance. His best bit has to be when he gets Stallone to climb up a rock face to get his money. You stay. You fetch. The joy is in his exaggerated enunciation. Another funny bit is when Stallone throws Lithgow's money into the helicopter's rotors. Damn you Walker! he screams like he's split a fingernail.But there are other English villains. The first is Caroline Goodall who comes across in the film as sort of a lowrent Emma Thompson. But much more amusing is Craig Fairbrass Dan out of EastEnders. His performance is atrocious. All he does is shout and swear. And he does it in a thick Cockney accent. But he's immortalised in the scene where Michael Rooker goads him into beating him up rather than killing him straight away  the Cockney is about as bright as a puddle of oil. It turns out that Fairbrass' character is an exfootballer. And I guess that shouldn't be too surprising when his dialogue consists of lines like Yeah? And you're a loudmouth punk slag who's about to die. The only people I know who talk like that are West Ham fans. But Fairbrass proceeds to give Rooker a surreal footballthemed beating  he even runs up to take a penalty. Is this how Hollywood sees the English? We're either effete brigands or beerswilling hooligans. Actually thinking about it it's quite an accurate observation.But my favourite villain is played by Leon he's so cool he doesn't even have a surname. He eschews Fairbrass' shouty brand of villainy and tries to be quietly intimidating. But his line delivery is so bad that he's about as scary as a moustachioed villain twiddling his exaggerated face fur. However it's notable that unlike Fairbrass he actually does excel once he gives into his urge to shout. He has a great scene in a cave where he actually seems like a genuine threat  he stalks Stallone and his girl with menace. But then Stallone grabs him by the balls and presses him through a spike. It's a WWE sort of deathwhich I dig a great deal.But what about Stallone? How does he fair in the film? Well I've never really had much of a problem with him. Yeah he's not a terribly good actor and yes he sounds like man who was born with an upside down brain but that's part of the joy of watching him act. Just take the scenes after the accident at the start. His idea of being haunted is to mope about like a thirteen year old that's been told to stop using his father's credit card to download porn. It's so amateurish. And I love the way that the villains when making him climb the mountain order him to remove his jacket. I can't help but feel that this wasn't done to prove how evil the villains are but to allow Sly to climb while flaunting his thick muscular arms. We don't want those babies covered up.However Stallone looks like Marlon Brando compared to the Whoa dude! extreme sports enthusiasts. They're sort of like Bill and Ted but without the charm. In fact I wasn't distraught that one of them died I was distraught that one survived. But at least the death of the one who looks like Kurt Cobain gives us a hilarious silent No! moment from Michael Rooker. But then later on we get to relive the hilarity because Frank's death elicits another's ribtickling No! moment. Hey what can I say the old bastard had it coming. You ain't laughing now are you?".

	onyx:emotionText "The opening to Cliffhanger is meant to be a harrowing experience. We're meant to feel terrible that an innocent woman plunges to her horrible death. But how can we experience the horror when Frank a helicopter pilot played by Ralph Waite out of The Waltons is in the background cackling with laughter. Just watch him. His eyes sparkle when Stallone tells the woman that she's not doing to die and he collapses in near hysterics when she falls. Contrast this with Michael Rooker's overacting  he almost faints when the girl plummets while Frank is hooting in the background  and you have a scene that is nowhere near as powerful as it should be.But to be fair to Stallone and the girl they do a pretty good job. The girl pleads and pleads and Stallone gamely hangs on. And the situation itself is excellent  huge drop cracked harness burly lazymouthed actor trying to hang on to hysterical woman. But whenever I watch the scene I can only see Frank's huge grin his glowing eyes and a shocked reaction that looks more like him doubling over in laughter.However laughter is a common reaction in Cliffhanger. Well for me at least. But that's not to say I dislike the film. It's a very enjoyable action movie. But it can't transcend the clichs of the genre. Instead it buries its face in them and thrashes about like mad for over an hour and a half.One of the clichs the film adheres to is that the villain must be English. Well at least I think he is. John Lithgow puts on an accent of some sort. But it's an amusing performance. His best bit has to be when he gets Stallone to climb up a rock face to get his money. You stay. You fetch. The joy is in his exaggerated enunciation. Another funny bit is when Stallone throws Lithgow's money into the helicopter's rotors. Damn you Walker! he screams like he's split a fingernail.But there are other English villains. The first is Caroline Goodall who comes across in the film as sort of a lowrent Emma Thompson. But much more amusing is Craig Fairbrass Dan out of EastEnders. His performance is atrocious. All he does is shout and swear. And he does it in a thick Cockney accent.

And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though I feared the worst.When Gabe Stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve but than he returns. Soon after he's back they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. At least that's what the rangers believe. In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TVseries 3rd Rock from the Sun but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. Overall the acting is OK it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some oneliners but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys the mountain rivers and the forests... Perhaps that's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action  adventure movie of this kind. I give it a 6.510. If you don't expect too much this is an enjoyable movie.".

Also fun to see Michael Rooker from The Walking Dead in an earlier role I had forgotten he was in this.The ending helicopter scene is still awesome as is the opening accident with the silly panicking girl on the zipline.

Stallone hanging by one arm directly over a thousand foot drop?  I really don't think so but it sure looked that way from the vantage point of one's living room couch. This movie is a part adventurepart caper story and the bad guys might have gotten away with their heist if they had thought through some of the possible unintended consequences. But we know that's never the case with pictures like this. The main thing I couldn't understand was how Gabe Stallone and Jessie Janine Turner managed to find cases number two and three after the first one wound up disintegrated. What did they have to go on? I guess by that point in the movie one shouldn't have to ask such a ridiculous question.".

The movie featured pretty good performances from the very versatile John Lithgow as the mastermind criminal Eric Qualen as well as from the generally onedimensional read Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone as climber Gabe Walker who overcomes a tragedy at the start of the movie to become the great hero by the end. There was some pretty exciting action that was scattered throughout the movie thus keeping the viewer interested a lot of bad guys to root against and a good supporting performance from Michael Rooker as Walker's rescuer sidekick Hal Tucker. In addition to the outlandish plot there were a few things that just didn't work for me. Why it was decided that this movie needed to include a couple of pretty typical stonertype characters is a bit beyond me. The two kids added nothing to the movie and really served only to irritate me. Then there was the absolutely unnecessary and at least mercifully brief batscene in the crack through which Walker and Jessie Janine Turner were crawling. That also accomplished nothing except allowing any batsqueamish viewers to go eeewww when Walker sticks his hand in guano and the bats start to fly at them. Finally does anyone actually believe that John Lithgow could hold his own in a fistfight with Sylvester Stallone the way the respective characters did at the end of this movie? Not likely in my opinion. For all that for a movie with a story that was at best very limited this movie was fun most of the way through which gains it a 710.".

With extreme nonstop action gripping and suspensefilled scenes Stallone has proved why he is a SUPERSTAR with his role in Cliffhanger. I knew I would be in for an action packed treat as soon as I realized Stallone was starring in this film however I failed to realized how great the other actors were in this film.Stallone is joined by Michael Rooker Janine Turner and John Lithgow as they produce quite possibly the best action film of 1993. The cast is perfectly selected and chosen to play their parts. It was a joy to see a reversal of roles. I'm not accustomed to seeing Rooker as a hero or Lithgow as a villain it is a refreshing change.I couldn't have asked for a better villain than Lithgow. He is one of the most ruthless and cunning villains I've seen. I enjoyed how he never let anything get in his way and spared no expense to get what he wanted. I'm glad I got the chance to see him play the villain and hope I see it again.Turner gives tremendous support to this film and creates an atmosphere where it is enjoyable to watch. She is the heat that warms a cold room because every time she comes on screen it seems as though it is hot. It is a delight to see an incredible actress to have that much power. Rooker makes up the other the third of talented actors that makes Cliffhanger a delight to watch. Rooker brings a fresh view to the film as well as credibility all I have to say is awesome work Michael.There is an avalanche of talent in Cliffhanger. Stallone is an unstoppable force and incredible action hero. After watching Cliffhanger I'm convinced that Stallone was the only man for this job. Stallone had the fire in his eyes for this part that told me he means business. Only true action stars have the fire I saw furthermore I was fascinated with the strength power and conviction with which he took on the role.Another reason I enjoyed Cliffhanger was the writing because it contained unbelievable action sequences a man dealing with redemption and dialogue is awesome. I was impressed to see that Stallone also cowrote the script because he really has a knack for what action fans want.Cliffhanger is a supercharged heartracing suspensefilled action thrill ride.".

McPherson informs Chief Black Eagle Tony Kendall of Morton's betrayal and the Indians then ride to save the cavalry when Morton's henchemen Serge Marquand attack the soldiers . This is an oater Western plenty of action  hatred  gunplay an agreeable love story...in a word  emotion  besides it contains effective action sequences as the Indian raids and lots of crossfires .  The picture gets Western action  shootouts  Indian attacks  a love story  and results to be entertaining  but mediocre . It's a medium budget film with passable actors  technicians production values and ordinary results . Of course  there are ritual shootouts among gunslingers confronting each other in some quickdraw duels in the accepted Western movie fashion .

It moves well has a fistfight or two and ends with a noisy skirmish on the desert pitting Indians and cavalry against the henchmen of an evil rancher. Romantic interest is minor but there are two pretty young women on hand one blonde and one with black hair. Needless to say Brad winds up with the blonde both onscreen and off.

The music score hovers between the routine and the annoying and despite its English title the movie contains no reference to Santa Fe.".

	schema:reviewBody "German produced Westerns made in the former Yugoslavia during the 1960s are a pet favorite. The long running Winnetou series with Tarzan actor Lex Barker were as popular in Europe as the James Bond films or any other semiserial of related features. The best known examples of the Schnitzel Western form they have an unreal quality about them set in uniquely decorated East European hill country with rock formations even more bizarre in appearance to those used for locations by the Spaghetti Western directors in Spain. The new old west is what Roger Ebert called the look. North American Westerns all look the same no offense intended. European made Westerns look like Star Trek episodes in comparison Fake confined to tightly claustrophobic sets populated by actors costumed for style rather than authenticity.This is a pretty smooth one. SampsonHercules actor Brad Harris plays the secret agent who rides into a bloody landscape torn apart by Comanche raids on frontier settlements as reprisal for having traditional Native lands taken away by a wouldbe oil baron who sets up the U.S. Cavalry to take the fall for him. Or any other caucasians who happen by the story opening with a massacre which would have been wholly unacceptable for American audiences in 1965. The film is brutally violent yet it's cartoon violence rather than the bloody carnage of a Peckinpah. The look mimics the American productions which inspired the Italian French and German filmmakers who churned these things out for a decade until the fad dried out once it devolved into selfparody.This one may not have the style or panache of a sumptuous Sergio Leone or Corbucci epic instead still rooted in the Experimental era of the EuroWestern form prior to the grubby unwashed look of the Classic era productions. These helped set the tone and gets the job over and done with quickly with little time for remorse for the dead or character development. They are archetypes roles crafted to check off list items on the formulary of Western films. Harris' toughguy persona is well served by the role he plays a youngish Horst Frank is enjoyable as his counterpart and Euro Horror actor Tony Kendall is just swarthy enough to be cast as an Indian Chief without eliciting too many guffaws. For that matter the Native Americans are regarded with surprising sympathy by the filmmakers scoring plot points by having the Cavalry and despotic white men who drive the plot as the bad guys their savage reprisals somehow understandable. The establishment of the Anti Hero was the great contribution by the Euro's to the idiom and indeed contemporary viewers will be surprised at how modern the film feels in this unblemished English version presented by the awesome Wu Tang Collection of restored European produced Westerns.The results may lack the sweeping epic feel of the Winnetou fans but was skillfully filmed in widescreen and has a passable twangy electric guitar vibrato music score which will please those who admire such things. Not as plaintively mournful as a Paellaflavored Spaghetti Western score and closer to popular music forms than an operatic Morricone concoction. In fact I'll say that the film is charming just by having less at stake than a grim sweaty Italo Western instead playing a cool calculated and streamlined game of makebelieve which reminds me so much of playing Cowboys  Indians as a kid. That's why we watch em period authenticity be damned.".

I've found these German westerns to be weaker than those coming from Italy or Spain and this one is no exception. I will say that the production values are surprisingly solid and the movie gets off to an okay start with a lively attack lead by Native Americans but the next hour or so is very tough to sit through. The plot moves at a near standstill and there's pretty much no action. Instead there's a lot of boring chitchat occasionally punctured by a very bad and inappropriate musical score. Things do pick up a little in the last third of the movie but it's too little too late. If you get stuck with watching this try to figure out why the movie is called Black Eagle of Santa Fe when both the character of Black Eagle and the city of Santa Fe hardly make any appearances.".

Gets a little soapy at times some of the politics and science seem a little cheated and key incidents are convenient and coincidental. Production values especially the special effects are pretty weak. And Caan's astronaut is a little too open with his fears to be believed as a man of his position at that moment in history. On the other hand it's impressive that in 1969 someone made a space movie focusing on complex emotions and human behavior not technology. The climax is a bit 'Hollywood' although at least a little more bittersweet than usual if predictable and a cheat. The small roles are well cast and played. Not really recognizably an Altman film but certainly shows talent and is worth seeing.".

Never again for better or worse would Altman relinquish control of his films a tenacity that won him an instantly recognizable style not afforded to many other directors.So Countdown isn't terribly interesting formally and feels like it could have been directed by anybody but that's not to say it isn't an interesting movie. Released a year before man actually landed on the moon it provides a remarkably accurate guess at what such a feat would look like and the film is played with conviction by a strong cast of actors led by James Caan Robert Duvall and Michael Murphy.

	schema:reviewBody "A comment on Marooned the movie that was made about a moon mission disaster which was released after the Apollo 11 landing but prior to the Apollo 13 reallife disaster mentioned that the movie is not available on DVD and rarely if ever appears on television. I believe that the same is true of this movie at least regards TV screenings and it's for the same reason. Marooned and Countdown are movies that are so much of their period that they scarcely make any sense at all to 21st Century minds. Of course we all know about the Cold War and most cold war movies involve international espionage which is timeless.Countdown is a movie about the Space Race which dominated the daily agenda at least as much as conventional Cold War conflicts like the Korean and Vietnam wars. The plot concerns a situation in which the Soviets succeeded in their aim to send a manned rocket to the Moon before the Americans were ready to fly Apollo. However contact with the cosmonauts has been lost and there is still a chance for NASA to fulfill Kennedy's challenge of sending a man to the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth  as well as the kudos gained from discovering and being the ones to tell the Soviets what happened to their men.An interesting sideline on this is that the actually successful method of moon exploration used ie send three men to lunar orbit and then two can travel to the surface in a smaller ship is certainly not the only solution and this movie explores a different one forced by necessity. Since Apollo is not ready and there is no lunar lander capable of taking off from the moon why not send a less complex ship with only one man and let him stay on the moon kept alive by an environment habitat sent on ahead by unmanned rocket and by provision of supplies by further unmanned ships? Such a scenario had already been envisioned by science fiction authors like Arthur C. Clarke as being the most efficient way to explore our satellite. Certainly nobody had previously imagined that we would send men to the Moon for a matter of a few days in a ship which could not carry more than a few hundred pounds of samples back to Earth. By exploring this other methodology this movie succeeds in highlighting the true nature of our Lunar adventure. The point was not to expand the human frontier or to increase the sum of scientific knowledge  the point was to get a man on the moon and safely back before the Russians did.".

In many ways it's a conventional cold war drama but it has some wicked resonances if you see the Robert Duvall astronaut character as what he was surely meant to be an over the top version of John Glenn a boy scout rah rah guy who can't stand the much hipper laid back James Caan who is a standin for the real astronaut Al Shepard. Wolfe's The Right Stuff if I recall has useful material on the mutual distrust between Glenn and Shepard. Altman tries a few tricks for which he is later famous. The primary one is overlapping dialogue. Altman hated the formal style of traditional films in which everyone speaks in complete sentences and never overlaps. You can see the overlapping here though not to the degree that comes through in later films like MASH and McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Still the innovation was enough to infuriate the studio execs when they began viewing the rough cut. Hey! We can't understand half of what the actors are saying! So they fired Altman about ninetenths of the way through shooting. Watch closely and toward the end of the picture you'll see a change in style as the replacement director takes over. It's much more stilted especially in the press conference. And I recall though can't be sure at this remove I haven't seen or read about the picture in decades that the original ending was a tragedy which was changed to a happy one instead.The most effective aspect of Altman's interest in sound design was what he did when Caan loses contact with ground control as he approaches the moon. Altman heightens anxiety Caan is already worried that Duvall is endangering his life when the radio contact picks up static and it gets hard to hear. Caan begins to feel all alone out there millions of miles from earth. And so do we instinctively...we want to hear what Mission Control is saying and their words keep breaking up. Very clever using bad sound to make viewers unconsciously uneasy. It's a great way to accomplish your goal on a lower budget project.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film Robert Duvall and James Caan portray to perfection the rivalry between aviators competing for a mission much better than The Right Stuff. The scrubbed astronaut Robert Duvall tries to wash out his replacement James Caan who he must train for the mission he himself desires. The addition of an onboard electrical power shortage in flight foreshadows the actual events encountered during the Apollo 13 mission.Although entirely fiction the film is a time machine that brings back the look and feel of the Space Race era. To see NASA Building 5 filled with Apollo and Gemini simulators is a pure delight. And the chance to experience the The Space Environment Simulation Laboratory in NASA Building 32 is an even greater delight. Unlike other movies the filming in mission control NASA Building 30 shows just how small it actually is.The cinematography in widescreen format using Panavision equipment is flawless. Although as ordered from Warner Archive digitized from a non remastered print it is crystal clear and free of flaws when projected on a 100 screen. This film is a must have for any aviation and space enthusiast.I should note that there are few special effects in this movie except for some photographic tricks with light to simulate black sky on the lunar surface. All the equipment was actual NASA simulation equipment. There was some stock footage used for the rocket launches. During the space race NASA had contingency plans for a Gemini Lander and a prototype was built. The choice to use one man was because Gemini life support was designed to support two men for 15 days. If a landing was aborted using Earth Free Return life support for one man would be taxed to it's limit.".

Altman's direction is sufficient to keep the picture moving along and the overlapping dialogue is a refreshingly sophisticated stuff. The ego clashes of the two pilot candidates for the moon flight seems a bit stilted Duvall seems at home in the role but Caan's not up to it the antiSoviet rhetoric is a bit grating at times and the female roles are essentially throwaways. When it's time to put together a retrospective on the scifi genre as has been done for war films this one might get 15 seconds during the moonshot segment it hardly deserves more.

It's supposed to be done with the astronaut sated for that historic mission to be a civilian. Air Force fighter pilot Chiz Stewart Robert Duvallwho was hoping to be chosen for the Moon Mission is terribly upset by being eliminated because of his military background. Stewart become very hostile towards his friend Lee Stegler James Caan a civilian worker for NASA for getting picked for the flight christened or designated by NASA Pilgrim One.Taking out his frustrations on Lee Chiz who's in charge of training for the Moon Mission does everything he can to have him wash out of the program. Not just because of sour grapes but because Chiz like Lee's wife Mckey Joanna Cook Moorefeel that he's doesn't have the experience as an astronaut to handle this very dangerous assignment. On top of that Lee being the egomaniac that he is will end up getting himself killed on the mission because of his obsession the be the first man on the moon even if it kills him.Just days before Lee is to blast off there's news from the Soviet Union that the Russians sent a three man crew into obit and that it would land on the Moon before the USA planned Moon shot. That still doesn't have Pilgrim One suspended with those at NASA feeling that the news may very well be a rumor. To keep them form launching the Moon Mission by the sneaky and conniving Soviets.Sent into space the next morning from Cape Kennedy in Florida Pilgrim One has major problems as it goes into the Moons trajectory because of a power loss during the takeoff. With Chiz at the controls at the NASA Space Center in Huston walking Lee through the dangerous complexities of the space mission he makes it to within 200 miles from the surface of the Moon.On the Moon NASA had two weeks earlier landed and unmanned space shelter with a rotating red beacon that Lee is to first identify and then to land as close as possible next to it. At the shelter there's enough air water and food to last two months. It's then when NASA would send an Apollo manned space capsule to pick up Lee and bring him back safely home to earth.It turned out that Chiz and Mickey's worse fears were realized with Lee not wanting to have the mission aborted and sent back to earth without being the first man on the Moon taking his chances in landing Pilgrim One despite not really knowing if it was withing site of the NASA shelter. Which with only two hours of air in his space suit was almost curtain death for him. Walking through the unknown wilderness that's the Lunar surface Lee discovers that the USSR indeed landed a manned space mission on the Moon before the USA. Lee also finds out that the three man crew were killed as it crashed instead of landed on impact.With the air in his space suit almost exhausted Lee looking at his watch which told him that he had only seven minutes of oxygen left notices a bilking red flash reflecting off the glass back at him!

I found nothing of any great interest here. The DuvalCaan game playing was lame and many of the other characters were overplayed. Yes it is easy for me 38 years later with all the film and acting innovations that have taken place to make these comments but I simply was not entertained by the scriptdialog and Altman's attempt at an auteur film. I will also throw in here I am not an Altman fan or I would not spend money to see a film just because Altman made it. Michael Mann I would without question just as a comparison of my tastes.Duval is another consideration. I saw a film made in 1971 by Duval which he claims is his best work that was real 'art'. Quiet simple Wm.Faulkner 14 page tale of life in the Appalachians many years ago.This review is about Altman and 'Countdown'. The film is average at best and the auteur just starting an incredible career shows some flash of genius to come.".

Yes it is easy for me 38 years later with all the film and acting innovations that have taken place to make these comments but I simply was not entertained by the scriptdialog and Altman's attempt at an auteur film. I will also throw in here I am not an Altman fan or I would not spend money to see a film just because Altman made it. Michael Mann I would without question just as a comparison of my tastes.Duval is another consideration. I saw a film made in 1971 by Duval which he claims is his best work that was real 'art'. Quiet simple Wm.Faulkner 14 page tale of life in the Appalachians many years ago.This review is about Altman and 'Countdown'. The film is average at best and the auteur just starting an incredible career shows some flash of genius to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "This preMASH Altman flick will probably be uninteresting to anyone who is not an Altman fan. Maybe a hardcore scifi fan would like it for the novelty but let me warn you it is barely a scifi movie. It tries to be as realistic as possible. It is an interesting prediction of the actual moon landing which would happen a bit over a year from Countdown's release date. As an Altman film it is an interesting precursor to MASH but it is a little bit too mainstream for Altman buffs. I don't know whether the conventions of an astronaut film were instated before this film or whether they were set up here but you won't find anything that much different from Apollo 13 or even Armageddon. Most of the scenes include a bunch of scientists sitting in front of panels with some crosscutting between them and the astronaut James Caan. There are a few inventive touches in the direction including a cut that predates 2001's bonetosatellite edit by a few months Caan throws a baseball into the air we are blinded by the sun and an invisible edit takes us to the launching platform at Cape Kennedy. Actually since 2001 was released only a few months afterwards this film was likely buried under that film's glory even though many despised that film upon its release. Also another famous scifi film appeared around the same time as Countdown Planet of the Apes. The acting may be the film's saving grace. Both James Caan and Robert Duvall give topnotch performances. So does Joanna Cook Moore who plays Caan's worried wife. Most of the other actors are hardly distinguishable. Look out for Barbara Baxley and Michael Murphy who were both in Altman's Nashville in 1975 which I watched earlier this afternoon for about the fifth time.".

Don't be fooled as this isn't really an action film with only a couple of real action sequences occurring during the running time. Instead it's an average thriller redeemed by some nice directorial touches from Mark Lester a taut atmosphere and a truly menacingsadistic psychopath as the main bad guy.Things start off pretty poorly with a cheaplooking truck explosion and some really bad acting. Things continue this way for most of the film but about halfway through I realised that I was actually enjoying it. It may not be the most original or intelligent of films but the plot is passable and the low budget is used to maximum effect with plenty of big explosions and stylised fight scenes. Mark Dacascos is it has to be said wooden in the lead role but he's quite likable and charismatic too. Definitely an acquired taste though. Abell is actually very good in his villainous role and he is put across as a real human being sometimes likable very human too. At other times he just likes banging people's heads into tables and breaking necks but there you go. A particularly nasty piece of work. Coffin is hilarious as the base's general complete with ranting dialogue and dodgy toupee.The action when it comes is extremely violent surprisingly so in fact. There's a brutal bout of martial arts fighting where skulls crack and bonebreaking blows are delivered home extremely loudly. The finale slips into predictable territory as Dacascos takes on the four main bad guys and in one notable moment shoots one at pointblack range repeatedly through the stomach ugh! Basically everybody gets what's coming to them but not before the chief creep has gone mad with an axe and indulged in some misogynistic womanbeating. His death is fun and deserved although ripped from both COMMANDO and DOUBLE IMPACT. Sure this film isn't particularly great or inspired but it's fun enough if you can't find anything else around.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many idiotic comments from people here who obviously expect a Titanic type movie from a movie that was made for video only. What the heck did you expect? A high class movie with second to none visual effects? Considering this is a low budget film that was NEVER advertised it was a very good film.Personally I though the acting by Mark Decascos was pretty good not top notch but Brating. A few of the supporting actors showed talent although the character Lieutenant Kelly Andrews Paula Trickey was played terribly.True there are also countless sterotypes about the military and drug dealers but it did make the movie seem more cool than real life yea! let's watch them run a 5 mile PT. The plot also became very predictable towards the end but at least the action is a bunch of CGI unrealistic Crp. I'm not sure how many mistake there were about the uniforms for the army because I wasn't watching that closely but obviously most of the commenters if any have never been to a military base. Yes you can drive up to a military base on a motorcyle and in blue jeans of course you have to have your military ID all the MP or security forces person will care about is if you have a little sticker on your car which says the base name etc.What was fake was when the tank chase occured and nobody NOBODY did anything even though moments ago Mark Decascos had just shot the base commander.Overall this a good movie and does not deserve it's 4 or so rating from viewers who wanted a high budget film. I give it  and a 12 out of  it is worth the money to watch and a little bit more".

	onyx:emotionText "There are many idiotic comments from people here who obviously expect a Titanic type movie from a movie that was made for video only. What the heck did you expect? A high class movie with second to none visual effects? Considering this is a low budget film that was NEVER advertised it was a very good film.Personally I though the acting by Mark Decascos was pretty good not top notch but Brating. A few of the supporting actors showed talent although the character Lieutenant Kelly Andrews Paula Trickey was played terribly.True there are also countless sterotypes about the military and drug dealers but it did make the movie seem more cool than real life yea! let's watch them run a 5 mile PT. The plot also became very predictable towards the end but at least the action is a bunch of CGI unrealistic Crp. I'm not sure how many mistake there were about the uniforms for the army because I wasn't watching that closely but obviously most of the commenters if any have never been to a military base. Yes you can drive up to a military base on a motorcyle and in blue jeans of course you have to have your military ID all the MP or security forces person will care about is if you have a little sticker on your car which says the base name etc.What was fake was when the tank chase occured and nobody NOBODY did anything even though moments ago Mark Decascos had just shot the base commander.Overall this a good movie and does not deserve it's 4 or so rating from viewers who wanted a high budget film. I give it  and a 12 out of  it is worth the money to watch and a little bit more";

	schema:reviewBody "THE BASE is from a period in Mark Dacascos's filmography regularly highlighted by decent stories good production values and limited action and this one exemplifies all of these qualities. It's a mildly exciting actionthriller with some highlights in its script and it manages to secure a high rating by avoiding many directtovideo snafus and pitfalls. Nevertheless it's a little dull and not quite the ideal Dacascos vehicle.The story An Army Major Dacascos goes undercover to investigate a drug trafficking ring led by a dangerous Sergeant Tim Abell.Much of the film's overall quality seems to be attributable to director Mark Lester who to this day remains on the same downward slide from his heyday of directing COMMANDO but nevertheless injects invaluable energy into the picture  making the most of what would otherwise have been a much more runofthemill outing with a low budget. The script has some basic shortcomings including the thankless and clichd role it renders Paula Trickey but I was pleased with the surprising depth that Tim Abell's character is granted. Abell pulls it off fairly well doing a good job of playing a manipulator and appearing absolutely authentic as a military man.Dacascos is on less even ground he tends to play awkward villains to begin with and does no better in playing a hero pretending to be a villain. Nevertheless he's in good form when it comes to the action. I wish that there were more than three fistfights a handful of shootouts and a couple explosions but by and large this stuff is serviceable. Mark throws a lot of spinning kicks and at times appears to be channeling his rarelyutilized capoeira training. I particularly enjoyed the first brawl wherein Dacascos takes on Darcas Macopson in a surprisingly dirty kendo duel. The finale between Mark and Tim Abell is yards better than anything they got up to in INSTINCT TO KILL.If there's one major flaw to the movie it's that it does not take any chances. The filmmakers may have been trying to replicate the bigbudget experience for the small screen though they would arguably have been much better served producing a movie less homogenized and predictable as is allowed by the DTV medium. Nevertheless if you're a viewer who complains about the failings of Bmovies then the solid conventional route this one takes will probably be considered a plus factor. Dacascos fans are encouraged to check it out.".

Murphy goes undercover and attempts to infiltrate the group as they begin to move in on the existing dealers.The plot behind this is pretty weak  a group of soldiers are running round killing drug dealers and running drugs themselves and they don't raise any major suspicions outside of the base and some military intelligence officers. Surely the police or someone would have picked up on this without having to start an internal covert op to get any evidence. Outside of that it's soso but don't bring your brain.The plot doesn't allow that much action. Sure there's plenty of shootouts with drug dealers but Dacascos doesn't have too many opportunities to do his martial arts stuff. There's a fight when he first enters the base and there's the final fight at the end but other than that it relies on the plot to drive it. Unfortunately even the shoot outs aren't great and the film doesn't totally deliver on the action.What is good is the two main performances and the sense of drama. Dacascos is good but he's a little too pretty to be believable and too much is made of how good he looks on a motorbike. Although he does give a good performance because he's got the looks and talent of someone who should be a bigger star. Tim Abeck is really good as the corrupt Sergeant Gammon he brings a great sense of military meanness to the role and is believable psychotic. Unfortunately all the gangsters are played by Espanic stereotypes and the military base constantly has groups of soldiers running around in groups until there's a gun battle then the base is strangely deserted!.Unusually for a Dacascos flick this is low on martial arts action and has good performances from the leads but really this isn't any better than the usual straight to video stuff that Dacascos does.".

Murphy is to track his every move and report his findings to Lt. Kelly Andrews Trickey. So Murphy shows up at THE BASE and under the name of Cpl.

MurphyDalton is going to have to use every tactic he knows to defeat Gammon and his men  will he survive THE BASE? The Base has some good and worthwhile moments and director Lester certainly knows how to stretch a low budget to get the maximum result from it. While the movie as a whole doesn't feel all that substantial there are plenty of blowups gunshooting scenes and some fights along the way to liven things up. There's even a tankJeep chase  how often do you see that? Plus Dacascos is likable and clearly competent in the fight scenes. It makes sense that the fights are movie highlights when you see that the great James Lew was the fight coordinator unfortunately he doesn't appear in the film. Plus this may be Tim Abell's best work to date. He really inhabits his character and is a solid baddie. And their hideout even has a pinball machine! Pretty sweet.By 1999 the classic era of DTVaction movies was over. Yet that didn't stop Lester from directing a sequel to The Base The Base 2 Guilty As Charged 2000 the next year. Presumably enough people rented The Base at their local video store to warrant this happening. It seems kind of hard to justify but there it is. Even Dacascos was replaced by Antonio Sabato Jr. You don't even have to watch the two movies backtoback  just within the same general timeframe  and you will notice many similarities the most glaring of which is the scene where DacascosSabato shows up at the base and gets into a brawl on the training ground. 'Sure it depletes brain cells  let's do it again!' seems to be the overriding thought process there.So a lot of people get shot stuff blows up and people get beat up. Those are the highlights and some stuff happens in between those scenes that you won't remember. The Base is far from bad but it lacks that extra dimension to put it over the top into being solidly good all the way around.".

Just like with his earlier WHITE FANG 1973 with the same basic cast  crew Lucio Fulci has cooked up a populist entertainment that's way too violent for the kiddies and a bit to cutesy for adults when people aren't being tortured and burned alive that is. While missing the nudity  sex of an exploitation film these are hardly allage adventures at least in their unedited forms.Both of Fulci's White Fang films were part of a minifad that was one of the variants Italian film producers tried to squeeze some life out of their spaghetti western industry. There were maybe a dozen of these things made between 1973 and 1977 or so  Alpine adventures set in the gold rush era Klondike with plucky kids and an intelligent resourceful wolfhound as the star of the film. They usually bring in a ringer for an action hero Merizio Merli Ron Ely Doug McClure or in this case Franco Nero wearing what appears to be one of Farrah Fawcett's old fur coats and a stock trade bad guy Jack Palance Henry Silva or John Steiner as we have here and come up with all sorts of fascinating adventures for the dog to have while the humans stand around cheering him on.Hence the confusion that these were for kids. Kids love dogs and the films always have a young boy for the hound to bond with maybe a pretty nun or some other female lead for the dads to quietly lust over though romance with the action hero is out of the question. So you'd think this would be fun for the whole family until the town drunk is beaten senseless the hapless Indian family is murdered in cold blood and the child terrorized by big greasy bad guys who get a kick out of torturing cripples. The bullets fly the bodies pile up and White Fang gets to do clever things like figure out that someone is cheating at poker.If there are any saving graces to this outing it is that White Fang is not forced to fight any other animals for the benefit of the camera though he does get chased around kicked beaten with ax handles and thrown out of burning buildings. We can only hope that they asked the dog to sign a release form first. He's also depicted as fighting off a golden eagle that attacks the plucky young boy for some reason that I missed taking wildlife biology leading to one of the most bizarre gore effects sequences ever staged where the doggie performer is festooned with a truly twisted zombie makeup effect to have it appear as though the bird scratched his eyes out. I imagine that was one of the parts cut from the prints imported to North America in the 1970s.The film culminates in a preposterous dog sled race finale that took a few cues from BEN HUR with the two sled riders battling it out as they hurtle across the wilderness. The credits here cite Canada as one of the filming locations but I don't know somehow I doubt they would have imported the whole cast  crew from Europe just to film a movie about a kid and his dog. WHITE FANG was filmed in Austria and I'd say that looks like the same town set but it really doesn't matter. The whole thing is marvelously fake and tacky which is half of the fun of this little subgenre of spaghetti westerns. I think they are fascinating and this is probably one of the better examples with no apparent harm coming to the animal performers for once. The people though boy they get battered around some. Looks like it was a tough physical shoot under adverse conditions. It's a marvel the film was even made at all and I dare say you couldn't come up with anything like it today.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Challenge to White Fang or Il Ritorno di Zanna Bianca original title is an exciting adventure set in Alaska during Gold Rush . The wolf dog  White Fang aids a little boy  an elderly man  a nun of ridding a gold mining town of a sleazy crime lord in 1899 Yukn  Canada .

Wolfdog White Fang teams up with an old mountain man and a boy when his master  a young Eskimo  is killed . Together they try to avenge his death . This adventure movie is set at the end 19th Century  in the Klondike region of Yukon Canada . It has as starring the wolfdog named White Fang  as when his master is killed by the evil  unscrupulous Beauty Smith John Steiner then the trusty dog is adopted by a young boy  Bill Renato Cestie  the grandson of fur trader named John Tarwater Harry Carey J.  usual actor in John Ford films . Meanwhile  the grandfather  an old man named John Tarwater and his grandson arrive to the small gold town and befriend Jason Scott . After that  the dog teams up the avenger prospector Scott Franco Nero and his friend Kurt Jansen Raimund Harmstorf  who seek revenge against the notorious villain Beauty Smith . But Beauty changes his identity posing as a wealthy boundwheelchair and now living under the alias Forth in another Northern Canada town  claiming a recently discovered gold mine and exploiting the villagers . There also appears Sister Evangelina Virna Lisi who's attempting to build a new mission hospital in the small town . A bit later on  Evangelina shows proof of his criminal past to the Canadian Mounted Police  and she subsequently has her mission burned down . The prospector and his faithful mate  the wolfdog attempt to stop the evildoer  the ambitious  snarling businessman called Smith and his hoodlums . A dying old prospector bequeaths his newly discovered goldmine to John Tarwater  but the mean businessman tries to claim it for himself . As SmithCharles Forth is blackmailing prospectors and deceiving of faking manner to the natives by means of stealing them supplies and the Alaskan gold mines and to profit from townspeople .This followup to Lucio Fulci's White Fang with Franco Nero  Virna Lisi  Fernando Rey  John Steiner  Rik Battaglia  Daniel Martin and Carole Andr is a tepid and lighthearted adventure about known and classic novel by Jack London . Here the famous dog teams up once again with novelist Jason Scott  Franco Nero  and his colleague Kurt Jansen  Raimund Harmstorf who has a brief intervention  to detain the nasty Beauty Smith . Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian landscapes . It's a passable sequel that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Breathtaking final scenes when take place some impressive sledge races across the tundra . Weak screenplay from Alberto Silvestri  Lucio Fulci and Roberto Gianviti who also wrote in similar similar style to former movie . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Rustichelli who also composed White Fang .

Wolfdog White Fang teams up with an old mountain man and a boy when his master  a young Eskimo  is killed . Together they try to avenge his death . This adventure movie is set at the end 19th Century  in the Klondike region of Yukon Canada . It has as starring the wolfdog named White Fang  as when his master is killed by the evil  unscrupulous Beauty Smith John Steiner then the trusty dog is adopted by a young boy  Bill Renato Cestie  the grandson of fur trader named John Tarwater Harry Carey J.  usual actor in John Ford films . Meanwhile  the grandfather  an old man named John Tarwater and his grandson arrive to the small gold town and befriend Jason Scott . After that  the dog teams up the avenger prospector Scott Franco Nero and his friend Kurt Jansen Raimund Harmstorf  who seek revenge against the notorious villain Beauty Smith . But Beauty changes his identity posing as a wealthy boundwheelchair and now living under the alias Forth in another Northern Canada town  claiming a recently discovered gold mine and exploiting the villagers . There also appears Sister Evangelina Virna Lisi who's attempting to build a new mission hospital in the small town . A bit later on  Evangelina shows proof of his criminal past to the Canadian Mounted Police  and she subsequently has her mission burned down . The prospector and his faithful mate  the wolfdog attempt to stop the evildoer  the ambitious  snarling businessman called Smith and his hoodlums . A dying old prospector bequeaths his newly discovered goldmine to John Tarwater  but the mean businessman tries to claim it for himself . As SmithCharles Forth is blackmailing prospectors and deceiving of faking manner to the natives by means of stealing them supplies and the Alaskan gold mines and to profit from townspeople .This followup to Lucio Fulci's White Fang with Franco Nero  Virna Lisi  Fernando Rey  John Steiner  Rik Battaglia  Daniel Martin and Carole Andr is a tepid and lighthearted adventure about known and classic novel by Jack London . Here the famous dog teams up once again with novelist Jason Scott  Franco Nero  and his colleague Kurt Jansen  Raimund Harmstorf who has a brief intervention  to detain the nasty Beauty Smith . Lumpy blend of adventures action  villainy though needlessly violent and aimed to young people . The film is loosely based on the novel by Jack London  though differs significantly from the book but this is an invented version  however remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and locations and several moving scenes . The talent of diverse and wasting casting is redeemed in part for the spectacular outdoors filmed on Austrian landscapes . It's a passable sequel that maintains the charm and adventure style of the previous film but still makes for decent juvenile amusement . Breathtaking final scenes when take place some impressive sledge races across the tundra . Weak screenplay from Alberto Silvestri  Lucio Fulci and Roberto Gianviti who also wrote in similar similar style to former movie . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Rustichelli who also composed White Fang . The film is rated PG13 Parents guide because contains some violent scenes about killing of a boy at the beginning  a cruel fighting between eagle and dog  a strong slap against a kid  people hitting to White Fang and brutal biting  among others . The motion picture was regularly directed by Lucio Fulci  an expert filmmaker of terror movies full of blood and gore .

	schema:reviewBody "This is supposed to be a children's film right? Who else but Lucio Fulci would present a film for the kids involving a young boy being shot dead nuns burning to death gold prospectors freezing in the snow then having their legs amputated and then tortured! a dog fighting an eagle a man shooting himself in the head and a bunch of dogs eating a guy alive? Just look at the line up of actors for this one however. You've got Franco Nero Street Law Enter the Ninja John Stiener Commando Leopard and Mannaja in fine moustache twiddling evil form here Donald O'Brien Emmanual and the Last Cannibals Ghosthouse Werner Pocath Days of Hell and Cat of Nine Tails and a guy who looks like Al Cliver House of Clocks and Demonia but isn't Al Civer Devil Hunter and White Cannibal Queen. Wasn't Al Cliver The Beyond and Zombie Flesh Eaters available? Also Nick Alexander dubs about 70 of the cast personally. I haven't even got to the dog yet! While Franco Nero is off enjoying the success of his book about White Fang White Fang himself witnesses John Stiener kill three Indians including a kid and then ends up with a boy call Bill. Bill at first calls White Fang 'Firebreath' although on my washed out copy it kind of sounded like he was calling the dog 'Fartbreath'. The boy and the dog bond while Bill's granddad hustles for cash while looking for a gold mine everyone's searching for. The town is supplied by Forth Steiner who sells people supplies that can hardly keep them alive in the wilderness.Meanwhile a nun pegs Forth as the disguise of an evil guy probably from the first film which I haven't seen but the local police are in cahoots with Forth so Nero the nun Donald O'Brien etc try and figure out a plan to bring Forth down which doesn't end well for several people. Before you know it O'Brien's being fed to some dogs White Fang takes the rap and him and Bill have to head for the hills.Another guy found frozen half to death by O'Brien spills the beans about the location of the gold mine after having his frostbitten legs removed and therefore everyone is racing to get to the gold. I'll say no more about the fate of the rest of the characters not much of a spoiler for O'Brien's character as I honestly can't think of a single film he survives.What makes me think that this is intended for kids is the extent to which Fulci does manage to restrain himself. Ever watched Four of the Apocalypse? Here there's not much gore but still plenty of violent situations. Even with my washed out full screen copy I could see that Fulci was employing all his usual visual techniques and you can go wrong with that roster of actors. Nero's always good but between this film and Mannaja I'm really beginning to appreciate John Steiner too. He makes an excellent villain.One point that had me slightly worried was the words 'animals' and 'Italian seventies film' cropping up but to it looked like they actually manage to make the film without harming anything although I'm not sure how they managed the 'dog fighting the eagle' scene. Surely they couldn't afford to waste an eagle? I'm pretty sure they didn't what with the quick editing and what not. If they had wasted an eagle they would have lingered on it and Fulci never seemed to steep as low as Lenzi Deodato or Sergio Martino.Overall good cast good story plenty of action. Hooray for Challenge to Fartbreath! This is Seventies Fulci gold not lateeighties bummed out by making horror films Fulci.I agree with the only other reviewer on here  They'd never make a film like this these days.".

The only way to get an R rating in 1964 for a movie with a sexual subject seems to be to turn it into a leering puerile comedy.  The problem is that it doesn't work as a comedy or as erotica or even as historic fiction.The plot revolves around Fanny's belief that she has been taken in by a kind lady to work in a hat shop instead of in an expensive brothel.  Fanny manages to avoid the clients she's been set up with for the entire movie without ever finding out the truth.    The plot never evolves beyond this obvious story.  There's also no attention paid to accuracy the setting for the movie lurches around between 1750 and 1890 and the dialogue ranges even further.Of all the actors in the movie only Leticia Roman and Miriam Hopkins show any life.  The others are stick figures feigning animation with affected voices and arched eyebrows.  Not that Roman and Hopkins aren't guilty of overacting they just occasionally show there might be more there.This movie may be worth preserving along with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice for anthropological studies on 1960's Hollywood attitudes towards sex but it's not worth watching for entertainment.  Read the book.".

Leticia Roman's woefully miscast as a poor lass who's taken under the wing of a brothel madam Miriam Hopkins who doesn't look too bad and even has a little decollet going' on and finds her virginity in peril at every turn. It's still intact I think at the happy ending much to Miriam's exasperation and if it had a more risqu script a bigger budget color photography and Stella Stevens as Little Orphan Fannie Louella Parsons would have been right in proclaiming the film A female TOM JONES!";

	schema:headline " Very weak atypical film from Russ Meyer";
	schema:reviewBody "Fanny Hill proved to be something of a oneoff for famed sexploitation director Russ Meyer. For one thing it was a film he made in West Germany and it was also a period film based on a literary source. It was hardly therefore the kind of material that Meyer was used to tackling. As such it is definitely one of the less personal films he ever made where he truly seemed like no more than a directorforhire. The story follows a young woman who falls on hard times but is welcomed in a house populated by women which the wide eyed innocent doesn't recognise as a brothel.Whenever Meyer veers too far out of his comfort zone it often ends in trouble and Fanny Hill is unfortunately no exception. It is a film which will be unlikely to satisfy many Meyer fans nor those who liked the novel I should imagine. It's neither erotic nor funny and also commits one of the worse cinematic sins in being overlong too. Definitely a film which Meyer completists should at least see but it is something of a slog to get through though so be warned. The most interesting aspect of it for me was the appearance of Laetitia Roman in the lead role. I had hitherto only known her from her starring performance in Mario Bava's highly influential yearzero giallo The Girl Who Knew Too Much 1963 which needless to say was a considerably better film than this one. But it was nice to see her in something else at the very least.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing this 1929 version of Madame X was quite a revelation the only other version I had seen was the Americanized Ross Hunter soap opera production that starred Lana Turner in 1965. This film illustrates the problems of early sound production and how the players and directors had trouble adapting to the new sound medium. Ruth Chatterton was nominated for her stage like overwrought performance as the degraded Madame X formerly Jacqueline Floriot. I'm glad that before seeing Chatterton I had seen Mary Pickford in the Oscar winning film for Best Actress Coquette. Pickford's performance is no more overwrought than Chatterton's. The Academy voters I'm sure chose from a whole lot of similar product. Lionel Barrymore was up for Best Director in the only other Oscar category Madame X was entered in. Barrymore directed a few silents but after talkies came in he soon found himself in front of the camera. His direction is for a stage play but again I'm sure no better or worse than his competition.The play is of French origin and debuted on Broadway in 1910 with a run of 156 performances. The lead was Dorothy Donnelly whose reputation today comes from being the book and lyric writer for Sigmund Romberg for Student Prince Blossom Time and My Maryland. The author Alexandre Breson took his plot idea from Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. Chatterton marries a cold hard self righteous Lewis Stone who when she gets no love at home strays and seeks it elsewhere. Stone acts like Anna Karenina's husband and tosses her in the streets. And like Karenin Stone tells his son his mother is dead.Fast forward about 25 years and Chatterton is now a poor man's version of Sadie Thompson. She hooks up with a South Seas low life in Ulrich Haupt who guesses her true identity and sees the blackmail possibilities in it. But when the idea is broached to Chatterton she balks and Haupt pays the price.This one as did the modern version had the Victorian ladies weeping every Wednesday matine. Chatterton Stone Raymond Hackett as their grown son and Haupt deliver their performances in true 19th century style.The film is a curiosity and of course doesn't hold up well for today's audience. But in viewing don't compare Madame X with more modern work. It won't stand comparison that way.".

The first 30 minutes suffer horribly from atrocious miking unbelievably stilted acting and frozen camera placement that was all too common in the early talkie era. It's as if the actors were on morphine laced with acid and performing under water. The one scene that takes place outdoors in a public park is crudely recorded and more jarring than revelatory in its effect. When the locale finally shifts to southeast Asia the juicy part of the story begins with the star Ruth Chatterton on the first leg of her debauched roundtheworld journey to oblivion as the wayward official's spouse whose life is ruined by an extramarital tryst. Chatterton's performance careens from laughably abysmally dated posturings at the beginning to incandescent hyperrealism as she portrays the dissolution and ravages of absinthe addiction and self loathing. It is a brave and even startling tour de force especially for its time. And the extreme contrast between the awful and the sublime is itself a phenomenon worth observing for its own sake. It speaks to the transition in acting styles that was taking place in the 1920s a time of deep cultural change. Usually a movie from this era will contain different styles of acting coming from different actors  but here the differences are all within Chatterton herself.The rest of the cast simply falls by the wayside although in the early minutes it is Lewis Stone who registers more strongly due to his deeper and more mike friendly voice. Raymond Hackett as Madame X's clueless son is suitably earnest and sympathetic in his bravado courtroom climax scene. Ullrich Haupt is effective as the con man who befriends the heroine in South America but Burgess Meredith's rendition of the same character in the 1966 version was more chillingly repulsive. Toward the end Chatterton's performance begins to slip back into treacly mode not helped by the overwrought dialogue but for about 45 minutes she delivers one of the most entertaining acting jobs of 1929.".

You had to cross cut between shots to get even the illusion of motion.As for Ruth Chatterton and Lewis Stone in my opinion these two never could give a bad performance and that is true here too. These two were pioneers in acting in the talkies and acquit themselves marvelously considering that actors were often directed to overemote. Ruth Chatterton resists the common early talkie urge to chew scenery better than Stone though probably owing to the fact that until she was 35 she was a star of the stage and thus was familiar with handling dialogue. Stone had started acting in silent films so in these early talking roles he was having to feel his way through it although he quickly got the hang of it.In this case the two play estranged couple Jacqueline and Louis Floriot. Unlike the other filmed versions of Madame X this one starts several years after Jacqueline has abandoned her family and at a time of severe illness for her son. The man she left her husband for has died and she asks for a fresh start with Louis who still loves her but rebuffs her anyway on account of his pride and turns her out into the street without even allowing her to see her son.In this version there is no meddling motherinlaw thinking the wife is not good enough for her son. Instead it is Louis' coldness that apparently caused Jacqueline to look for affection elsewhere. The vast majority of the film belongs to Chatterton as we see her go from man to man and fall deeper into alcoholism and despair. The makeup job was quite good on this film too as we see Chatterton transform from a woman with delicate China doll features to a bloated usedup alcoholic that not even her exhusband recognizes when she goes on trial for her life in a courtroom where he presides as judge. Raymond Hackett is excellent as Jacqueline's grown son who feels real compassion for this woman that he does not know is his mother when he is assigned to defend her.".

Unlike the other filmed versions of Madame X this one starts several years after Jacqueline has abandoned her family and at a time of severe illness for her son. The man she left her husband for has died and she asks for a fresh start with Louis who still loves her but rebuffs her anyway on account of his pride and turns her out into the street without even allowing her to see her son.In this version there is no meddling motherinlaw thinking the wife is not good enough for her son. Instead it is Louis' coldness that apparently caused Jacqueline to look for affection elsewhere. The vast majority of the film belongs to Chatterton as we see her go from man to man and fall deeper into alcoholism and despair. The makeup job was quite good on this film too as we see Chatterton transform from a woman with delicate China doll features to a bloated usedup alcoholic that not even her exhusband recognizes when she goes on trial for her life in a courtroom where he presides as judge. Raymond Hackett is excellent as Jacqueline's grown son who feels real compassion for this woman that he does not know is his mother when he is assigned to defend her.";

And let the histrionics begin.This film was a real weeper in its day but to modern eyes it appears simply overwrought and overacted.

Director Barrymore deserves kudos for placing the microphone on the end of a fishingpole the first sound boom so the actors could walk and talk at the same time. One must take this into consideration when critiquing this film. Other talkies produced from JanSept 1929 are far more creaky. Raymond Hackett as Ruth's son is too overwrought in the courtroom scenes but his youth almost makes this forgivable.

Despite what we've been told Madame X is NOT a story of sacrificial mother love. It is instead a story that is ludicrous but one which gives the actress a juicy role and the producer a surefire hit.Spoilers follow so if you don't know the story despite having read the other reviews and want to be surprised stop reading now. In Part 1 Chatterton having abandoned her husband and son to marry another man who has since died begs her former husband to take her back. Her pleas fall on deaf ears and spurned she leaves. Correct me if I'm mistaken but abandoning one's child in search of happiness in romance  ala Anna Karenina  is not and never has been an example of mother love. Part 2 covers 20 years of absinthe and globetrotting with mean companions which has transformed Chatterton from the treaclysweet lady of the first scenes into a cynical semicriminal. This portion of the film is totally absorbing and Chatterton is magnificent in portraying her character's slide into the sewer.In Part 3 Chatterton is in court on a charge of murder and can you believe it her defense attorney is her son. Also pushing the limits of believability is that despite the passage of 20 years her former husband his best friend and the governess all of whom are sitting some distance from the accused immediately recognize the silent and unrecognizable Chatterton. They react with shock pity and remorse. The viewer's tearducts open and the sobbing begins. Moments later Madame X her identity about to be revealed shouts that she wants to protect the boy she loves from scandal. While laudable this is only part of the truth. She also says that she doesn't want her former husband and son to know what she has become to know how low she has sunk. Understandably she wants to protect herself from further shame and though concealing the truth is certainly the right thing to do it is not evidence of sacrificial mother love. Then the son not knowing who she is makes an impassioned and lengthy speech the purpose of which is to wring tears from a credulous audience begging the jury to acquit her which seems to me to be inappropriate behavior on the part of Counsel. But there's still one final incredible moment to come that wraps up this ludicrous story. Chatterton I kid you not drops dead before the jury brings in its verdict and the son says ... something to melt a misanthropes heart of stone. Phooey on the story. But don't let that stop you from watching Chatterton work wonders with this old wheezer. You'd think Hollywood would have shoved Madame X in the vault and locked the door but instead they filmed it again in 1937 with Gladys George an inadequate substitute for Chatterton and yet again in 1966 with Lana Turner a version I have not and will not sit through no matter how tempted I am to see Turner without makeup.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit I did not expect to like this old 1929 version of Madame X. However I was pleasantly surprised. Yes this film is downright ancient now with the usual static camera and bad sound. Ruth Chatterton is the real reason to watch. Her performance is certainly a bit histrionic and theatrical but this was not unusual in early talkies. Chatterton is Madame X  a wayward married woman who is shunned by her rich husband. She goes from living like a queen to skid row  she becomes an alcoholic and associates with some bad characters along the way. Madame X then kills one of these dubious characters who has discovered her real past. She goes on trial and of course the man who defends her turns out to be her now grown son Raymond Hackett a handsome lawyer who is very kind hearted towards her. Lewis Stone plays the husband whose pride stands in the way of allowing Madame X to see her son when he is small. This film was made again in the mid1960's with Lana Turner in the Madame X role but I rather prefer this one. I recorded this version from Turner Classic movies and the print is fairly awful with a bad picture and much static in the sound. But Ruth Chatterton kept my attention and she would go on to do good films throughout the 1930's including Female and Dodsworth as two of her best. Strangely after the 1930's she would never recapture much fame even though she would continue to act up to the 1950's.".

I am pretty sure back in the day however these weepy films worked well with the audiences...particularly because there are many similar stories of selfless mothers such as this one and So Big. So at the outset I need you to know I am not a fan of the selfless mother genre. Additionally this version of the story is hampered even more because it's very old fashioned in style and the sound quality quite poor. The dialog direction and look of the movie also seem dated...very dated.As for this 1929 film it's directed by Lionel Barrymore of all people! Apparently sound pictures were new to MGM and Barrymore was interested in sound and they let him direct the picture. After all he'd been a director a decade earlierbefore he'd become more famous as an actor.The story begins in Francewhich is odd since not one of the principle actors sounds the least bit French! Jacqueline Ruth Chatterton is estranged from her husband Floriot Lewis Stone as apparently she was caught cheating on him and he tossed her out...and won't let her see their son. It seems that Floriot has told the boy his mother is dead and she begs him to let her see the boy...to no avail. What's next is pretty hard to believe but it's a saga involving Jacqueline losing herself to drink and redeeming herself in order to help her son.My feelings about this one are rather negative. I am not a huge fan of the story and the film quality is poor in so many ways. Watch it if you'd like...but you could do a lot better.".

Not having a clue about it we decided to take a chance and frankly we were surprised by the work of its director Simon Gross a talented man who also contributed to the screenplay.The setting is Morocco where Daniel and Laura German tourists are seen taking the sights. They decide to rent a jeep to go into the majestic desert. At a gas station they meet the mysterious man who will play a key figure in what ensues. The happy trip becomes something of a nightmare because Daniel and Laura are not prepared for what this stranger has in store for them.The most vivid sequence has to be when Laura and Daniel reach the castle they see from a distance. Is it a mirage? Is it real? Well nothing prepares us for the surprising outcome of the story. More intriguing is the ending in which both tourists return to the desert after having finally discovered the way to a nearby town.The menacing stranger is played with equal parts of sadism and mystery by JeanHughes Anglade a French actor that has made a career portraying such creeps. The beautiful Marie Zielke is seen as Laura and Matthias Scheighofer is the weakest of the trio with his take on Daniel.The vibrant cinematography of Peter Steuger captures in vivid detail the adventure that director Gross had in store for us. The desert has been lovingly photographed as never before. Although ultimately the film doesn't quite make it we realize we are dealing with a filmmaker that will no doubt go far in his next films.".

Not having a clue about it we decided to take a chance and frankly we were surprised by the work of its director Simon Gross a talented man who also contributed to the screenplay.The setting is Morocco where Daniel and Laura German tourists are seen taking the sights. They decide to rent a jeep to go into the majestic desert. At a gas station they meet the mysterious man who will play a key figure in what ensues. The happy trip becomes something of a nightmare because Daniel and Laura are not prepared for what this stranger has in store for them.The most vivid sequence has to be when Laura and Daniel reach the castle they see from a distance. Is it a mirage? Is it real? Well nothing prepares us for the surprising outcome of the story. More intriguing is the ending in which both tourists return to the desert after having finally discovered the way to a nearby town.The menacing stranger is played with equal parts of sadism and mystery by JeanHughes Anglade a French actor that has made a career portraying such creeps. The beautiful Marie Zielke is seen as Laura and Matthias Scheighofer is the weakest of the trio with his take on Daniel.The vibrant cinematography of Peter Steuger captures in vivid detail the adventure that director Gross had in store for us. The desert has been lovingly photographed as never before. Although ultimately the film doesn't quite make it we realize we are dealing with a filmmaker that will no doubt go far in his next films.";

Hey let's get of the road and try to get lost that sounds like a good Idea! Until they get lost I was just annoyed with the Kids and slightly amused about The Stranger who looked just like Peter Maffay. But after they started walking there doesn't really happen anything. I was so bored that I rather walked home from the cinema through the rain than having to watch this till the end. Don't get me wrong I can absolutely enjoy slow or even art movies. But there was nothing I could cling to here. The actors didn't convince me for a second the soundtrack was way boring and clich and even the picture quality was rubbish really grainy  all that combined with a wannabeartistic direction some real dramatic cuts of... nothing happening and a nonexisting story was just to much. Please give me back my 4!PS The ONLY nice thing was some nipple after 10 minutes. And even that was below average.".

	schema:headline " A Good Movie Filled With Doubts and Mirages";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of Fata Morgana is very simple and quite easy to go through it A young couple lost in the desert is helped by a strange and mysterious man. What is not that simple is to understand some of its profundities or to understand what really moves the characters of this movie. German couple Daniel and Laura played by Matthias Schweighfer and Marie Zielcke respectively entered in a jeep and went to the desert it's not said where but somewhere in Africa I think live a little adventure. They got lost the car stopped working and they walk into the desert trying to find the road where they followed earlier. But a stranger JeanHughes Anglade appears and helps him with the car and taking them to the road. What makes this stranger character so peculiar is that he almost doesn't speak to the couple he can't seem to answer any direct question is asked to him not even his own name is presented in the film and the irony is that he's credited as The Friend but to quote his own words I don't have any friends. He doesn't even try to become friend of the couple. When Daniel wants to film a simple recordation of his own time in the desert and he turns the camera at him he only replies that he doesn't want to be filmed and that's it. His intentions doesn't seem to be right thinks Daniel Laura thinks that this strange man might help them as long as they help him too. Even without knowing this guy very well the couple follow him he has a motorcycle and the couple go with the car but every moment and every minute something might happen and they don't know what. But one thing is certain this haunting man are not leading them back to the road.This is a very good road movie with a lot of anticipated tension simple dialogs and a great dreadful and suffocating scenery. But here comes some things that might disappoint. It's not a menacing movie like Dead Calm where you know that the third person is going to do something terrible each second goes by. It doesn't give answers to the audience of who the stranger is and his motivations and ambitions. He just happens to be there. Doubt is the engine of the movie so if you don't like this kind of perspective in films don't watch it.Another doubtful thing was the title and perhaps it might have something to do with JeanHughes Anglade's character at the end of the movie for those who doesn't know Fata Morgana is a mirage. The trio of actors are very great most particular the male actors I didn't liked the character and the performance of the female actress. Giving 8 stars out of 10 because of the lack of answers ok the director and the writer wanted to instigate its audience and sometimes that works very well and because it's a movie that's almost like a mirage itself Ironic! when you watch it for the first time it's interesting beautiful but when you give a real look to it or watch several times the good thing disappears or it becomes less interesting.".

First of all I am very happy to have picked 'Fata Morgana' of all movies from the Munich Film Festival 2007. It simply was a mind mindblowing movie experience yet totally unexpected. And as I still find myself reflecting on what happened in that movie  almost two weeks later  I might as well drop a line here. But backtoback 'Fata Morgana' is pure purism. The story is simple straightforward and as a result of that particularly striking. The parts  there are only three of them  are extremely well cast. One might even say Matthias Schweighofer as well as JeanHugues Anglade played the roles of their lives so far. And Marie Zielke also did a great job. The pictures are stunning and at no time overscripted. In fact I have never been that impressed by any desert movie or documentary before. The music is  on the one hand  inconspicuous throughout the entire movie while as on the other hand it's the perfect match for every picture every detail every sentiment. Besides Not included is the music during the final credits. That was awful. Finally the dramaturgy The movie has got an absorbing very unique speed. It builds up slowly but while you are still wondering whether and when the thrill will start you are already deep down into it.In brief Simon Gross reduced everything to a max. There is nothing in that movie that does not belong there. And even after days and weeks the movie still keeps its impact and secrecy. What more could you expect?Well done Simon Gross. And just to increase the pressure a little I am anxious to see your next movie.".

She decides to get close to a big time drug dealer played by Tony King to get the goods on him.To make her cover as a runaway sound feasible higher up captain Hector Elizondo has Moriarty make some routine inquiries looking for Blakely under her street name of Chicklet. The only problem is that Moriarty takes the assignment way too seriously earnestly trying to win respect among his peers. It results in tragedy all around.The cast is really finely tuned in this film. Especially Elizondo who will chill you with his attitude. He turns in a fine performance as a bureaucratic cop real good at department politics but a real snake as a human being.In one of his earliest roles is William Devane who has only one scene in the film questioning Moriarty about what's happened. Devane's a hotshot Assistant District Attorney who's practically salivating over a homicide conviction another scalp for his lodgepole so to speak. You will remember him.Report to the Commissioner is a nice look at the Seventies in New York and a great police drama.

When he was questioned about his subversive college activities he poignantly stated that he had protested the Vietnam war. It was resonant for me having been one of those protesters and relevant to these times our war in Iraq and the current political environment which implies that anyone protesting it is unAmerican. Looking at the demographics on this site in terms of voting on this film I find it very interesting that my age cohort gave this film the highest ratings.

I'd be curious to see him again because he was unknown to me in 1975 I'd compare his performance to what he's done since. When I think back on that movie I now imagine it as if a young Gordon Clapp played the lead. Everyone else is memorable too. Susan Blakely knocked me outand that was when she was fully dressed.

Report to the Commissioner based on the novel by James Mills can join those ranks with its matter of fact semidocumentary approach. Its characters are vivid and convincing and the performances memorable. The story allows for some tense scenarios and offers an interesting look into departmental politics within the police department and how this sort of thing can create its share of victims.Michael Moriarty stars as Beauregard Bo Lockley a hippieish rookie detective on the police force who's overwhelmingly naive. He's partnered with the hardboiled veteran Richard Crunch Blackstone Yaphet Kotto and gets a little taste of the street life. His own doing good mentality gets him into a lot of trouble when he ends up shooting Patty Butler Susan Blakely a beautiful young detective working deep undercover. She'd made the bold decision to move in with a drug pusher Thomas Stick Henderson Tony King to get the goods on him and Lockley had been fed a line of bull about her identity in order to make the whole thing look good. Now the NYPD has to decide what to do with this mess and how much to tell the commissioner Stephen Elliott.For this viewer the only real debit was Moriarty. Sometimes his eccentricities can benefit a movie ex his hilarious performance in Q The Winged Serpent but here he's just too whiny and mannered to make his character as sympathetic as he should be. Fortunately there's lots of heavy hitters here to pick up the slack Kotto Blakely Hector Elizondo Michael McGuire Dana Elcar Bob Balaban William Devane Elliott Vic Tayback. And it's cool to see a young Richard Gere making his film debut as Billy the pimp. Real life NYC detectives Sonny Grosso and Albert Seedman have small roles.Some of the story is played out in the form of interviews helping us to get insight into character motivations. There's one damn entertaining and lengthy foot chase which also delivers beefcake for the audience because the studly King is running around wearing little. The entire sequence on the elevator is riveting especially since we definitely get a sense of how hot it must be in there for Moriarty and King. And Balaban figures in what has to be one of the most original tailing sequences seen on film. The location shooting cinematography by Mario Tosi is excellent and Elmer Bernstein supplies a sometimes unusual but generally effective music score.This one is well worth catching for fans of the actors and lovers of 70s cinema.Eight out of 10.".

It turns out that Officer Butler's killer in non other the NYPD Det. Beaueguard known as just plain Bo to his friends Lockery Michael Moriarty. Unknown to Officer Butler Det. Lockery was given the task to track her known to Det. Lockery only as Chicklet down to protect her undercover status by being told that she's a teenage runaway from the suburbs.Det. Bo Lockery a complete dud as a cop is only on the force because of the early 1970's NYC police youth recruitment drive to get the young people of the city to have something in common with the men in blue as well as Bo's dad being a former and very highly decorated New York City policeman. We soon get to see in a number of flashbacks about this whole crazy and murderous mess and how Det. Lockery mindlessly got himself into it.The events that lead up to the shooting of policewoman Bulter started with Officer Butler herself volunteering to become Stick's women or live in wife so she could win over his confidence. This action was done on Butler's part in order to get the goods on Stick as the city's top drug pusher and with that have him put away and off the streets for a long long time. It has to be said that at first Butler's boss Let. Hanson Michael McGuire wasn't all that crazy for one of his cops and a woman at that being shacked up with the dangerous Stick Henderson. Still with Offcer Butlers constant insistence and her record of 283 felony arrests the year before how could he refuse!To give Officer Butler some kind of cover the NYPD has the totally incompetent Det. Bo Lockery put on her tail without even giving him a photo of Butler or even her name. Det. Lockery miraculously finds her with the help of the legless and mentally unstable street panhandler Joey Bob Balaban and street wise pimp Billy Richard Gere! This to the shock and disgust of Det. Lockery's boss back at the police precinct Let. Sedensticker Vic Taybeck. Lockery tracking Butler in effect blows the whole HendersonStick sting operation as well as ends up blowing a hole in Officer Butler's chest killing her.Det. Lockery himself is a piece of work being totally unqualified to be a cop much less detective. Det. Lockery is also a pain in the a to his partner the tough and street smart Det. Richard Crunch BlackstoneYaphet Kotto. Det.Blackstone gets so unnerved and discombobulated especially with Bo's annoyingly syrupy and insipid singsong voice in his having to put up with his schmuck of a partner annoying as well as bird brain antics that by the end of the movie he almost ends up drinking himself into a drunken stupor! Finding out just who this Chicklet really Offcer Butler is Det. Lockery like Travis Bickel a year later in the movie Taxi Driver becomes absolutely infatuated with her in trying to get Chicklet away from her pimp lover who in reality she's planning to bust. In Lockery trying to set up and bust Stick himself he sneaks into Officer Butler and Stick's loft not knowing exactly what officer Butler or Chicklet is supposed to be doing there! With Det. Lockery seeing Chicklet who's white romping around practically nude with Stick who's black in his boxer shorts was just about all the abuse that he could take which soon leads to the bloody shootout that cost Chicklet's or Offic Butler's life.After a chase through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan and shootout in the elevator of Saks 5th avenue department store Stick who was trapped in the elevator with Bo ends up getting blown away by the NYPD. The police department in covering it's behind tries to pin all the blame on the clueless Det. Lockery in Officer Butlers death but has so effectively incriminated itself in being behind Officer Butlers ridicules plan that the NYPD later decided to drop the whole thing. The NYPD gives Det. Lockery another chance as a New York City policeman only to have the now emotionally crippled cop who didn't know that he was about to be freed put an end to it all by hanging himself in his prison cell.A sad commentary on how people totally unqualified end up wearing badges and carrying guns because of misguided policies by police departments all over the country. In them trying to be either politically correct or bending the rules and pulling strings in order to get relatives in this case a soninto the department. All this because someone in their family was once or still is a police officer. Bo Lockely was about as qualified to be a cop much less detective as 98 pound weakling Woody Allan was qualified back then in 1975 to fight Muhammad Ali or George Foreman for the Heavyweight Championship of the world. In Lockerys case the unconceivable him being a policeman became a sad reality and that reality not only lead to Officer Butler's death but his own as well.".

This action was done on Butler's part in order to get the goods on Stick as the city's top drug pusher and with that have him put away and off the streets for a long long time. It has to be said that at first Butler's boss Let. Hanson Michael McGuire wasn't all that crazy for one of his cops and a woman at that being shacked up with the dangerous Stick Henderson. Still with Offcer Butlers constant insistence and her record of 283 felony arrests the year before how could he refuse!To give Officer Butler some kind of cover the NYPD has the totally incompetent Det. Bo Lockery put on her tail without even giving him a photo of Butler or even her name. Det. Lockery miraculously finds her with the help of the legless and mentally unstable street panhandler Joey Bob Balaban and street wise pimp Billy Richard Gere! This to the shock and disgust of Det. Lockery's boss back at the police precinct Let. Sedensticker Vic Taybeck. Lockery tracking Butler in effect blows the whole HendersonStick sting operation as well as ends up blowing a hole in Officer Butler's chest killing her.Det. Lockery himself is a piece of work being totally unqualified to be a cop much less detective. Det. Lockery is also a pain in the a to his partner the tough and street smart Det. Richard Crunch BlackstoneYaphet Kotto. Det.Blackstone gets so unnerved and discombobulated especially with Bo's annoyingly syrupy and insipid singsong voice in his having to put up with his schmuck of a partner annoying as well as bird brain antics that by the end of the movie he almost ends up drinking himself into a drunken stupor! Finding out just who this Chicklet really Offcer Butler is Det. Lockery like Travis Bickel a year later in the movie Taxi Driver becomes absolutely infatuated with her in trying to get Chicklet away from her pimp lover who in reality she's planning to bust. In Lockery trying to set up and bust Stick himself he sneaks into Officer Butler and Stick's loft not knowing exactly what officer Butler or Chicklet is supposed to be doing there! With Det. Lockery seeing Chicklet who's white romping around practically nude with Stick who's black in his boxer shorts was just about all the abuse that he could take which soon leads to the bloody shootout that cost Chicklet's or Offic Butler's life.After a chase through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan and shootout in the elevator of Saks 5th avenue department store Stick who was trapped in the elevator with Bo ends up getting blown away by the NYPD. The police department in covering it's behind tries to pin all the blame on the clueless Det. Lockery in Officer Butlers death but has so effectively incriminated itself in being behind Officer Butlers ridicules plan that the NYPD later decided to drop the whole thing. The NYPD gives Det. Lockery another chance as a New York City policeman only to have the now emotionally crippled cop who didn't know that he was about to be freed put an end to it all by hanging himself in his prison cell.A sad commentary on how people totally unqualified end up wearing badges and carrying guns because of misguided policies by police departments all over the country. In them trying to be either politically correct or bending the rules and pulling strings in order to get relatives in this case a soninto the department. All this because someone in their family was once or still is a police officer. Bo Lockely was about as qualified to be a cop much less detective as 98 pound weakling Woody Allan was qualified back then in 1975 to fight Muhammad Ali or George Foreman for the Heavyweight Championship of the world. In Lockerys case the unconceivable him being a policeman became a sad reality and that reality not only lead to Officer Butler's death but his own as well.";

The elevator scenes are nothing short of spectacular.Report to the Commissioner starts off a little slow and haphazard but really picks up after a short while mainly due to Moriarty's fine acting although everyone else in the cast also does a great job. He's a tortured soul who really doesn't want to be a cop and who gets into some serious trouble. Moriarty puts on one of his best performances.Yaphet Kotto is great in anything he's in and Susan Blakely was easily one of the most beautiful actresses of the seventies. Other familiar faces are all over as the drama builds to a harrowing final half hour.Another thing I didn't remember was the ending which hits hard and kind of makes sense when you think about it. There's also a wild foot chase through the rooftops and streets on Times Square love the crowds watching the filming.The seventies was such a fantastic time for films  no political correct nonsense just real street elbow grease film making with actors and actresses who didn't mind getting their feet dirty in Tony King's case literally.

The first half I will admit is weaker than the second half  actor Michael Moriarty seems too wimpish and naive to be a police officer and the plot moves along very slowly. But even during this weaker first half the movie offers a fascinating slice of life of what New York City was like in the early 1970s you can really feel the grit and atmosphere. Patient viewers will be rewarded with a lively second half. There are a couple of well directed pursuit sequences and the whole elevator sequence is quite riveting. And the ending while somewhat predictable does pack a punch. Fans of cynical 1970s cop movies will enjoy this best though it's also rewarding to others provided they possess a reasonable amount of patience.".

The music that envelops the movie does a very good job at matching it's general mood . Short video and sounds clips are used throughout as punctuation which is often reminiscent of a cartoonlike storyline.".

Yet it never loses the focus of the message presented early on in the filmthat we have a time frame in which we must act in order to prevent further more severe consequences than have already appeared.That being said the cinematography in this film is exceptional. The scenes were gorgeously shot and the careful editing really captures the scale of the issue from the smallest insects to the entire globe. Perhaps most noticeable is how well the soundtrack of a very electronic nature flows with the visuals.

	schema:reviewBody "Like the Polish Brothers' previous films Twin Falls Idaho' and Jackpot' Northfork' divides audiences even as it baffles and bewilders them.  Many will surely find this film to be slow moving arty pretentious and boring while others will be intrigued by its originality and visionary quality. Either way you slice it however Northfork' is an acquired taste.It's 1955 and Northfork a small town on the plains of Montana is about to be wiped off the face of the earth by a gigantic flood.  Only this time the destruction won't be the result of the angry hand of Providence but rather of a dam building project developed and conceived by the government in the name of progress.'  Out of this simple premise Mark and Michael Polish have crafted an elegy to the past a tone poem that reflects the deep sadness that comes with change abandonment and loss.  To achieve their effect the writers have incorporated large doses of Magic Realism with heavy religious and Biblical overtones into their narrative.  While we observe the harsh realities of people being driven from their homesteads we are also introduced to a quartet of angels who are searching for one of their number who went missing a number of years earlier.  Legend has it that the town of Northfork was originally looked out for by a group of guardian angels and it is from this rather twisted and bent angle that the Polish Brothers have chosen to approach their subject.  Northfork' is far more about mood imagery and tone than it is about plot and character development.  In fact the characters themselves  the angels a caring priest a dying boy and a father and son whose job it is to make sure no people are left behind when the land is inundated  are as subdued in tone as the film is as a whole.  None of the characters ever speaks above a whisper and each comes across as moody introspective and stolid.  It is in the visuals and in the unhurried subtle pacing of the narrative that the film achieves its power.  The dry barren plains the weather beaten houses the violated cemeteries and the isolated figures of men and buildings placed in stark relief against an imposing horizon  these are the images that seep inexorably into the viewer's subconscious and which make the film a stunning study in melancholy.  Let it be noted however that there is also a modicum of hope and optimism in the story to help mitigate the sadness.A number of big name stars have leant their talents to the project including Nick Nolte James Woods and Daryl Hannah.  Woods with his straightfaced deadpan delivery provides some much needed touches of black humor throughout the otherwise deadly serious work.  Northfork' definitely requires that you be in a certain mood to appreciate and enjoy it.  Hopefully you'll hit it at just the right moment.".

Whether you wish to view the more fanciful scenes as literal or the product of a dying boy's imagination one strong theme connects all the stories. Change happens.

We should ideally make the best of them and accept whatever heartache they cause. Some look forward towards a new freedom the little boy and some obstinately refuse to accept them the ark family. And Walter has to learn the lesson that there are some changes we think are over and done with that must be relived reburying his wife. Just because we think we've buried a chapter in life under the ground doesn't make it so. This is shown so clearly by the conversations between Walter and his son Willis. I say that if you really want to know what the movie is about watch the scene that begins in the outhouse. And pay special attention to the Willis's speech about caring for his car.

	schema:reviewBody "It all depends on how you look at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell says the priest Rev. Harlan in Northfork. The Polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious sociopolitical and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laidback American to reflect on current social values. The film's adoption of the surreal coffins that emerge from the depths of manmade lakes to float and disturb the living homesteaders who nearly crucify their feet to wooden floor of their homes angels who need multiple glasses to read etc. and absurd images of half animals half toys that are alive of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts etc. could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is unspooling as entertainment. Though European cinema has better credentials in this field Hollywood has indeed made such films in the past in Cat Ballou Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap several decades ago. Northfork in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in Citizen Kane taking Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic.The film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient filmgoerthe most interesting epilogue one of the finest I can recall can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end. If you have the patience you will savor the layers of the filmif you gulp or swallow what the Polish bothers dish out you will miss out on its many flavors.What is the film all about? At the most obvious layer a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectricproject. Even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. Real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. Of the 6 only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup while others cannot get anything served to them.At the next layer you have Christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. Most are devout Christians but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.At the next layer you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a mother finds one in an androgynous angel called Flower Hercules. While the filmmaker does give clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angelsnot gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.The final layer is the social commentaryThe country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people. Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.To the religious the film says Pray and you shall receive words of Fr Harlan quoted by Angel Flower Hercules. To the consumerist the film says its what we do with our wings that separate us each of the 6 evictors also have wingsone duckgoose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car.The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable pathbreaking worksuperb visuals striking performances especially Nick Nolte and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.".

Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.At the next layer you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a mother finds one in an androgynous angel called Flower Hercules. While the filmmaker does give clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angelsnot gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.The final layer is the social commentaryThe country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people. Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.To the religious the film says Pray and you shall receive words of Fr Harlan quoted by Angel Flower Hercules. To the consumerist the film says its what we do with our wings that separate us each of the 6 evictors also have wingsone duckgoose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car.The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable pathbreaking worksuperb visuals striking performances especially Nick Nolte and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.";

A fantasy that has points in common with Wings of Desire Northfork tells the story of a '50s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the U.S. government's desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands. It's a wry parable about loss and remembrance featuring angels dreams premonitions and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since Repo Man. The performances are all outstanding especially Nolte and Woods. I've noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics and I want to say that's one of the things that makes this film so great its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's cinematography is stunning. Highly recommended if you've suffered a meaningful personal loss such as the death of a parent I would even call this film necessary viewing.  Ray".

	schema:reviewBody "When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow one of the slowest movies of the year in no way was it boring. As Roger Ebert said there has never been a movie like Northfork.' I usually don't agree with Ebert but for once he speaks the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes nothing that I have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the Polish Brothers' Northfork.Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an arthouse film instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The plot isn't some hackneyed cookiecutter plot it's just so strikingly original. A small town in Montana named Northfork has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. Therefore the entire town must be evacuated. Some people however just don't want to leave. In a side plot a young orphan Duel Farnes is very sick and bedridden he's being taken care of by Father Harlan Nick Nolte. The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel so to speak who help him out through his time of sickness.Although much of the movie is straightforward some of it could give David Lynch a run for his money. There's odd weather patterns a weird wooden huge dog thing and symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as overall confusing as a Lynch film but it's still quite odd. That's what makes Northfork so great it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.Northfork has a magical feel to it it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. As I said earlier I agreed with Ebert on how this movie is unlike any other. However I disagree when he says that it is not entertaining'. He goes on to say it's just enthralling.' Perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is but in lieu of how slow it was I still thought it was very entertaining something many dramas now can't do.Northfork may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie but if you can get to and through it you'll be extremely surprised as I was.My rating 810Rated PG13 for brief sexuality.".

The child delirious is pulled back and forth between two realms while the Father waits upon his dying. Nick Nolte plays this part with enormous sensitivity and restraint. The evacuation teams seem to suggest a parallel to the Biblical flood and eventually the two lines of action merge into a dream state as if the flood is waiting for the child as well. James Woods gives a deceptively simple finely nuanced performance providing emotional depth and focus to the story line. The question seems to be is the flood the waters of life or the waters of death? Or is it both at the same time?

The wild Missouri with all the denizens of the valley will be flooded over if they fail to move out. The bad news is being delivered to these valley people  by six men sartorially dressed like men at a hanging.Their only pay for this dirty task is the  promise to get lakefront property after they have successfully and peacefully evicted 65 homeowners. This is an ecocomment about what a few pieces of silver will be necessary to get people to kill the beauty in the world all in the name for progress or in the case of this flick to divide people into those who drive Fords or Chevvies.Cinematography was striking but quite straightforward since almost everyone who has visited this area of the upper Missouri will attest to the uncanny clarity of the air.Scenes of grave sites which are being opened and the caskets are being moved ostensibly to higher grounds are ominous and chilling.Where the writerdirector fits all the piece together is interesting and quite enigmatic.  Clearly the sickly orphan boy who was returned to the ill kept priest is a turning point in the movie.  The remainder of the movie revolves around the efforts of the six men to complete their task and the priest to find a family for the boy and to nurse him back to health.The movie turns macabre at the end when the boy seems to be in extremis and the priest appears although the viewer is not lead to full certitude  to drown the boy in the bathtub. Is this sort of like the English Patient euthanasia?The boy leading up to this time is in a comalike state wishing to return to heaven which is a thousand miles away by his reckoning.  He meets up with four itinerant angels who want to find a lost angel.  All these scenes are quirky and one cute scene occurs when a rifle is discharged and its accidental target is a toy dog who walks on stilts is mentally created by the boy.New age theology is wrapped into the comments esp. by Flower Hercules who is neither man nor woman but is father and mother.  She couches her comments into riddles which makes the audience scratch their collective heads.I believe the boy is a chimera and that the only real people are the feds and the priest. The former are superficial save for Walter and of course the priest who is doing battle with his own past is evident.The one bizarre pseudotheological  metaphorical scene occurs when Walter is on the pot in a latrine which has a cross cut into the door to let light in.

Each pair of evacuators is supposed to be awarded one and a half acres of prime lakefront property if they can prove that 65 locations assigned to them have been vacated.  One team is James Woods as Walter O'Brian and his son Willis Mark Polish.  They're also supposed to remove Wood's character's wife's coffin because graves are supposed to be dug up to prevent the coffins' floating up in the flooded land.  Needless to say this makes little literal sense  the references here are to the American frontier mentality to imperialism land grabbing materialism and impiety which the Polish brothers are impressionistically dealing with throughout this strange and highly allegorical film.Meanwhile Nick Nolte is Father Harlan a deranged priest running a decrepit orphanage to which a fleeing couple return a small boy they adopted earlier Duel Farnes who is fine  because they say he was defective' being sick all along and is now too sick to travel.Much of what follows revolves around the boy and may constitute his dying delirium or fantasy that he is an angel.  He meets Daryl Hannah Flower Hercules in a graveyard in a wig and Elizabethan costume and goes back with her to see her pals Cup of Tea Robin Sachs also in Elizabethan drag Happy Anthony Edwards with a bizarre complex of adjustable spectacles on and Cod Ben Foster a wordless young man in a bejeweled cowboy hat and begs them to take him away from this place with them  1000 miles away he insists.  They bargain over the distance  this may constitute the denial and bargaining of the dying person.  At its center the film cuts back and forth with lugubrious regularity between this scene in which the boy tries to claim he has scars from where he used to have wigs and a halo Cup of Tea is unconvinced Hannah is weepily sympathetic Happy is scientifically neutral and Cod is mute  and scenes focused either exclusively on the band of evacuators or as the film progresses on them in encounters variously hostile fearful or unfriendly between them and the stubborn or oblivious holdouts on the land. One team is shot at their car nearly demolished.  Woods and son deal with a man with two wives who's built an ark.  They fail to convince all three to leave and having evidence of only 64 evacuations receive no land document.Nick Nolte all the while is seen trying to save the boy whom at one point he offers to Kyle McLaughlin and wife Mr. and Mrs. Hope  this begins to sound like Pilgrim's Progress but they aren't allowed to view the boy up close only through a window so they leave emptyhanded Hope without Faith thus disappointed.  Nolte Father Harlan also goes to a pharmacist and gets antibiotics which he injects in the boy he bathes him reads to him etc. but all efforts fail and the boy dies apparently.  Meanwhile scenes of the boy with Daryl Hannah et al. continue.  In the end they all fly away in a big plane just like the little one in the boy's lap.  Cod is his copilot.Much is made of a set of putative angel's wings' big snowy white bird's wings which inexplicably are carried around in a large suitcase and shown both to the man with two wives and to Hannah and company.Though no doubt enormously puzzling and open to many interpretations it must be said that compared to something like Alejandro Joderovsky's El Topo which this inexplicably reminded me of Northfork makes much coherent narrative sense.  Somehow the apocalyptic mood and the presence of dubious priests spectral landscapes and semimythological characters also bring Cormac McCarthy to mind but the movie lacks McCarthy's vivid regional character and colloquial down home talk.What it all means is more than I can venture to say in any more detail here. The tedium of the pacing might be more unfortunate if it were not to some extent relieved by an omnipresent sense of humor and also by a loyal and able cast and a stunning cinematography that combines colorless dimness with exquisite clarity in ways that heighten the pervasive sense of the surreal. There is no doubt at all that the Polish brothers are originals.  If hip young people and art film cultists like this film as much as Roger Ebert who inexplicably believes the loquacious and visually acute Happy to be both blind and mute Northfork will be on some level a stunning success. To many it is likely to remain arid and incomprehensible  . . .and not sexy and scary like David Lynch.  But the vision is unique  and not as incomprehensible as it may seem.".

To many it is likely to remain arid and incomprehensible  . . .and not sexy and scary like David Lynch.  But the vision is unique  and not as incomprehensible as it may seem.";

This is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can linger in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep. The fact that all of this was done on a shoestring budget of less than two million dollars puts Hollywood with their bloated film costs and hollow movies to shame and indicates something grand to come from the Polish brothers in the future.".

Doing this however diminishes the abstract beauty of the filmthe way an art expert can ruin the experience of a fascinating painting in a museum.By an odd coincidence I had toured the locale for this film only a few months before purchasing it and I thought the director captured the awesome yet austere nature of western Montana well.The film is worth seeing just for the scenery and cinematography alone and it offers many interesting topics for sociological discussions.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Polish's hypnotic Northfork is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time. This exquisitely crafted movie that Michael and Mark Polish wrote is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. The movie is splendidly photographed by M. David Mullen with a haunting score by Stuart Matthewman.If you haven't seen the film perhaps you should stop reading here.The idea to set the film in Montana was a great coup for the Polish brothers. Never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in Northfork. We don't need any color! The beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpost.At the center of the story is Irwin the sick child under the care of the mysterious Father Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. But is he really there at all? We watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery. There are two freshly open graves. Will one of them be for Irwin? At the same time another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can. This will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created. Their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people.The third story line centers on the mystical group composed by Flower Hercules Cup of Tea Cod and Happy. They are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets them at the cemetery he offers to help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. We watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible. Could Irwin be that angel? The closing sequence show us all parties leaving Northfork in different directions. The men in black riding their automobiles perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward. The mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place. We also realize that the child in Father Harlan in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure has died.Michael Polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals. Nick Nolte as Father Harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man. James Woods as Walter one of the men working for the developer does a fine job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer who makes an excellent impression as Irwin. This child actor with the right guidance shows great promise.The mystical group is brilliantly acted by Daryl Hannah Robin Sachs Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards the man with the funny spectacles. Peter Coyote Mark Polish Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under Mr. Polish direction.The beauty of the film relies in its simplicity. Mr. Polish's vision will haunt one's memory. The images of Montana as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in American films in quite a while.".

The plot is difficult to summarize so just know that the story includes agents trying to evacuate a city God in a cowboy hat the selling of angel wings and a sick orphan but it all works. M. David Mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at. The performances of the actors working with the Polish Brothers' inspiringly offbeat script are pitchperfect and give the film its emotional punch. The strongwilled audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story the comic and moving actors and finally the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience. A great great great movie!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film played for a criminally short time in Buffalo and of course was gone by the time I wanted to see it. I'm sure the beautifully shot rugged western landscapes would have been great on a big screen but unfortunately I had to settle for the video version on my 13 TV. With that said Northfork is that rare and elusive bird of movies a commercial film that is worthy of the viewer's hour and a half and doesn't manage to be insulting. Despite the career sins of Nick Nolte and Darryl Hannah in the past don't be turned off by their presence here. They are perfect in their respective roles Nolte as worldworn mystic and Hannah as enigmatic ghostangelvision. Without rehashing a plot summary which I might add is somewhat inaccurate on this site let me say that Northfork is a kind of delirium alternating between the dreamlife of a dying boy and the surreal landscape of a mostly empty town peopled only by a handful of eccentric stragglers. The central plot as it were revolves around a group of statesanctioned volunteers given the task of clearing out these final hangerson before the town is flooded. The six deputized agents clad in black and issued identical black sedans speak in detached banal fragments going about their task with an odd fatalism. Although the dialogue and cold alien demeanor owes heavily to David Lynch it is sure to please fans of the eclectic and bizarre like myself. The other plot strand that of the dying boy's fever visions is a bit heavyhanded in places with an overkill of its clumsy angel motif but it manages enough ambiguity and originality to avoid queasiness.Above all else this film has the feel of a strange dream mired in drab shades and an undercurrent of ominous mystery. The camera work is brilliant and despite awkward moments the film has the feeling of a deep cold water reservoir running beneath a landscape familiar and unreal at once.".

Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison Wim Wenders' 1987 Wings of Desire Der Himmel ber Berlin it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural. This story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the American West withholds the fairytale literalness that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. Its celestial transcendence be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream never parts ways with crud and rot.

As we soon meet a remaining priest taking care of a sick child a greedy land owner we could be set up for a simple story we could all easily digest.  However when one is first introduced to this film you notice the amazing wide open cinematography and a scene involving a church hall missing a wall that opens up to the pastures and scenic view of the mountains with cattle grazing.  It soon  becomes clear that after this scene and a few of the towns peoples introduction that this is no ordinary film and no ordinary story it is something very special and unique.At first glance things are not as clear but the cinematography and landscape that the viewer is witness to is stunning and the characters that inhabit this small soon to be extinct area are just in word amazing.  It's what can either draw you in closer to this qwerky film or either have you bored sitting there waiting for something to happen.The films deep spiritual and dream like qualities give it a slow and methodical approach which I am sure will bore some viewers but if you are patient with it and see the bigger picture the film is great to witness.Rating 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently attended Sundance as I have often done in years past and was  treated to the small pleasures of the edgy little indies the glut of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Polish's 'Northfork' and I remembered why I so fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' sweeps across the screen with visionary daring and harkens back to the seminal early work of Terence Malick and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It's an impossible film to easily explain which is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say it's an adult fairy tale with many carefully layered levels of meaning. It reawakened my imagination and cast an imposing shadow over all the other films I saw this year. It is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophistication of writing not seen in most American movies. I plan to revisit this film several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. For it is a beguiling piece of magic and mystery a haunting work where one can roam the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast performs this luminiscent piece with striking conviction particularly James Woods and Nick Nolte who remind us of the nerve and daring displayed throughout the course of their careers. Maybe 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American cinema where excellence in craft and writing become more the norm than the exception. See it when it comes your way and take your friends for the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred by seeing 'Northfork' will awaken memories of great movie once seen in your past and now hopefully may be returning with the advent of the Polish Brothers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved the movie Northfork. I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. Therefore I had no outside influence or information to guide me in what I was seeing unfold on the screen. In retrospect I would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it. Do not read anything about the plot story line or evaluation of the movie. In fact STOP reading anything further in my comments although I believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you I don't want to diminish the value of the movie to you. Find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potential.In general I found the 3 benign strangers in Northfolk puzzling. As the movie unfolds they could qualify as three entertaining escapees from a mental hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy or three angels sent to find the lost angel.The sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three strangers to abandon the search for the lost angel become his guardians mother  father and take him safely far away from Northfork no less than 1000 miles. He even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. Only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement.The priest who is nursing the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith. He transcends the desolation and emptiness of Northfork and its people he is the light of goodness and hope to both Northfork and to the movie viewer.Near the climax of the movie the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits. They board to find the other two strangers also on the plane in fact one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off.Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane? Where is the plane going? Did the other two find the Lost Angel? Is there a lost angel and if so who is it? Who are the six men dressed like undertakers? If all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his headneither the boy or strangers had contact with these men?One or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake this is not a spoiler it's statement about advertising only. So if you haven't seen the movie Northfork the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun forks in the road of thought when you view the film Northfork. If you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again... I know I will.Terry".

It resembles a 'living dead' movie without the gore. The retro props served to make it even more remote. This film does answer one question I have wondered about since I saw Twin Falls Idaho Is Mark Polish trying to act like he can't? I'll leave it to you to discover the answer by watching this film.

I have actually received some spiritual strength from Northfork.......Angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by Angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... At a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life I personally really needed this film. Yes as I wrote before it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to Heaven...Being so sick of all of the FX and Formula stuff I found this film to be genuine Cinema. All I can say is it touched me in so many ways that I still am sorting it all out. North Fork is a wonderful film. One that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. The spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. Pay attention as you'll need to use the brain and heart God gave you to follow the story. I think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some but I feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. I want to view it several more times just so I can take it all in!The Industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist.My thanks to all involved in the making of this film.".

	schema:headline " Well made but too bleak";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very well photographed film but the overall tone and pace make this one of the most demanding films to watch. Story is set in 1955 Montana and a whole city called Northfork is suppose to be evacuated because it will soon be underwater from the dam. A small boy named Irwin Duel Farnes is brought back to an empty orphanage because he is sick and Father Harlan Nick Nolte takes care of him the best he can but it appears that Irwins days are numbered. While lying in his bed Irwin fantasizes that he is an angel and wants four other angels that are staying in an abandoned house to take him with them. The angels are Cup of Tea Robin Sachs Cod Ben Foster Happy Anthony Edwards and Flower Hercules Daryl Hannah. In another part of the film we see Evacuators that are sent two at a time to evacuate any stubborn remaining home owners. The Evacuators are all promised a certain amount of land for doing their job and one team consists of a father and son James Woods and Mark Polish and the father decides to find the grave of his wife and dig her up and bury her someplace else. He doesn't want her coffin to rise to the surface when the area becomes flooded. This film is directed by Michael Polish and cowritten by his brother Mark. Together they paint a landscape so bleak that the characters in this film appear totally hopeless. The cinematography is stunning to watch with the endless Montana landscape. The sky is continuously gray and cloudy and the open fields that surround this story make the characters seem secondary. Hannah and Woods have a few fleeting moments with their performances but for the most part the actors come across emotionally distant and cold. The pace of the film is extremely slow and for some viewers it may be impossible for them to view. If your familiar with the films of the Polish brothers then your a step ahead of everyone else but for the others this may be too ponderous and bleak to appreciate. Film is demanding of your patience and the overall story leaves you at a distance which for me means that I could not fully appreciate what the Polish brothers have made. Impressive looking but extremely slow and bleak.".

Maybe that is why the film was banned in 1937 it was considered a film that could endanger public order and nationalsocialist feelings.Good cast with Heinz Rhmann who shows his natural comic talent at best and Max Adalbert who is very good as the grumpy uncle supporting cast good as well.

The director is Max Ophls and just like lead actor Heinz Rhmann it was still pretty early in his career when he directed this film we have here. Ophls went on to make many French language films in later years. And I must say even if Rhmann's range and charisma is clearly visible I am not yet as impressed by him as I am by some of the films he made at the age of 50 and afterward. The story here is about a young man who will inherit a fortune if he manages not to drink any alcohol for some time. Strangely enough he will be awarded a wine estate if he succeeds. A similar story I have seen in some old blackandwhite short films from previous years so it is neither too original nor too creative I have to say. Quite a shame. All in all this one is really worth seeing for the biggest Rhmann fans and even with the short runtime of approximately 75 minutes it lacks focus on some occasions. I give it a thumbsdown.".

True Carl Panzram was the product of a barbaric prison system but he stands out in history as one of the few archcriminals who did not want sympathy something this film ignores.This was a film that needed to be made but unfortunately the story was mishandled in a maudlin attempt to get the viewer to care about one of the most reprehensible human beings who ever lived.

Therefore can thieves rapists and murderers the Killer of this movie Carl Panzram James Woods is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds? An interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And this is where Killer A Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film tries to put Panzram's behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. Sure the system is corrupt with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of Leavenworth Prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot. But why on earth does new prison guard Henry Lesser Robert Sean Leonard take such pity on Panzram? Even after having read his gruesome diaries? The movie offers some explanation Lesser witnesses Panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by Panzram's intelligence though it isn't clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so smart. Surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? Towards Lesser Panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in Panzram's diaries. Does this man Lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is Lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substance.I can advise Monster starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope.BTW Killer looks as though shot for TV not so good".

	schema:reviewBody "All films that take place in prison are essentially focused on one central theme and that is survival. Clint Eastwood was a survivor in Escape from Alcatraz and so was Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption.One of these stories was anchored in reality and the other was purely fantasy. But both had the same theme and so does Killer A Journal of Murder.The primary difference between Killer and Shawshank is that the latter is greater than the former in many various ways. But the former is also based on fact which makes it more importantin some waysthan Shawshank. But Shawshank had more spirit than the former and the former's morals don't come across as strong as the latter's.The latter regardless of it being a completely false tale and a semicopy of Alcatraz is a much better story. Even if Stephen King wrote the short story.It's the true story of a petty thief James Woods who claimed to have murdered twentyone men during the 1930s and was sent to prison under the care of a devilish warden and a new worker who had a mysterious connection with him Robert Sean Leonard. Their relationship is never very convincing and the film doesn't do a very good job of making us care for either of its characters.Acting as a tertiary consumer the thief kills the secondary consumer The Bad Guard Robert John Burke. The thief is moved to a new jail cell afterwards. He has all the cigarettes books and magazines he could wish for not to mention a larger cell. I shoulda killed a man ages ago says the thief. Is he crazy or not? Did he brutally beat the bad guy via a split personality or was he in a right state of mind? This is the question that the film wants to presswhether the man was injustly hangedbut it never takes the idea any farther than a fleeting moment in the mind of the good jail guard who understands that prison is wrong. Hey no society is perfect. You want them all to be let loose on the streets? You don't have any better ideas about capital punishment? Then quit whining.There are too many ideas in a film such as this. First we have the touching story of a jail guard who becomes best buddies with the notorious criminal who inhabits the place. Then we move into the Danger Zone of clichesthe mean warden the bad jail guards who are bad for no reason etc. Then we move on to the journal written by the thief and we get a halfhour flashback of the man's life. Then we're back in the present and everything turns into a murder trial. Then we get an unsatisfying ending where the good guy blows all his money buying beer. Say what?Essentially these types of films in this type of genre rely on likable characters to carry them towards the touchdown. Killer A Journal of Murder has none and isn't very inspiring in any sort of subtle way which makes me wonder whyand howit ever got green lit in the first place.James Woods is a good actor because he can lend himself to various characters in various situations. He played a criminal in Leone's Once Upon a Time in America too but he also played a radio talk show manager in Straight Talk and a nasty bird in Stuart Little 2. He's played a cop before and he's played an everyman before and he's played a doctor before. He plays everything.Surprising then that this movie relies entirely on Woods' performance for supportand entirely fails.There's nothing wrong with it except that there's nothing behind it. There's no life in this petty criminal he portraysa man who may or may not have been insane but was hanged in the 30s anyway. Woods lends no likeability or believability or characteristic traits to this man he is portraying and in the end he comes across as a pointless incarnation of a man whose life perhaps never even merited the Hollywood treatment in the first place.This is the type of stuff Oscars are crafted and polished for but the director had it mixed up from the getgo.The common conception is that it is hard to survive in prison. This is a wellknown fact. But it's also very hard to survive yourself. That is why prison is representative of more than just bars and criminalsprison relates to all of us and we all relate to the confinement of prison. But the common misconception is that prison automatically makes a good film. It's the exact opposite. You've got to have the material first then put the prison in as a sort of metaphorical bridge for the characters to pass over.No one does any passing in Killer A Journal of Murder. It's sort of depressing in a nondepressing sort of way.2.55 stars.John Ulmer".

Their relationship is never very convincing and the film doesn't do a very good job of making us care for either of its characters.Acting as a tertiary consumer the thief kills the secondary consumer The Bad Guard Robert John Burke. The thief is moved to a new jail cell afterwards. He has all the cigarettes books and magazines he could wish for not to mention a larger cell. I shoulda killed a man ages ago says the thief. Is he crazy or not? Did he brutally beat the bad guy via a split personality or was he in a right state of mind? This is the question that the film wants to presswhether the man was injustly hangedbut it never takes the idea any farther than a fleeting moment in the mind of the good jail guard who understands that prison is wrong. Hey no society is perfect. You want them all to be let loose on the streets? You don't have any better ideas about capital punishment? Then quit whining.There are too many ideas in a film such as this. First we have the touching story of a jail guard who becomes best buddies with the notorious criminal who inhabits the place. Then we move into the Danger Zone of clichesthe mean warden the bad jail guards who are bad for no reason etc. Then we move on to the journal written by the thief and we get a halfhour flashback of the man's life. Then we're back in the present and everything turns into a murder trial. Then we get an unsatisfying ending where the good guy blows all his money buying beer. Say what?Essentially these types of films in this type of genre rely on likable characters to carry them towards the touchdown. Killer A Journal of Murder has none and isn't very inspiring in any sort of subtle way which makes me wonder whyand howit ever got green lit in the first place.James Woods is a good actor because he can lend himself to various characters in various situations. He played a criminal in Leone's Once Upon a Time in America too but he also played a radio talk show manager in Straight Talk and a nasty bird in Stuart Little 2. He's played a cop before and he's played an everyman before and he's played a doctor before. He plays everything.Surprising then that this movie relies entirely on Woods' performance for supportand entirely fails.There's nothing wrong with it except that there's nothing behind it. There's no life in this petty criminal he portraysa man who may or may not have been insane but was hanged in the 30s anyway. Woods lends no likeability or believability or characteristic traits to this man he is portraying and in the end he comes across as a pointless incarnation of a man whose life perhaps never even merited the Hollywood treatment in the first place.This is the type of stuff Oscars are crafted and polished for but the director had it mixed up from the getgo.The common conception is that it is hard to survive in prison. This is a wellknown fact. But it's also very hard to survive yourself. That is why prison is representative of more than just bars and criminalsprison relates to all of us and we all relate to the confinement of prison. But the common misconception is that prison automatically makes a good film. It's the exact opposite. You've got to have the material first then put the prison in as a sort of metaphorical bridge for the characters to pass over.No one does any passing in Killer A Journal of Murder. It's sort of depressing in a nondepressing sort of way.2.55 stars.John Ulmer";

Well the Irishman is interesting enough. The acting is good. Editing and cinematography are average. This is close to being pure emotional porn for those who readwatch stories about serial killers.

Ward's the Program. Ward also wrote and directed Major League a great movie however with The Program it is obvious how much his sports writing style has evolved.The movie traces one season of college football for a once dominant but now struggling Division 1 powerhouse the fictional ESU Timeberwolves. James Caan is hilarious and wellcast as the Head Coach on the hot seat and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field. Craig Shaeffer does a solid job at both his role and the QB position. His character is like a young much more tortured Steve Young he can throw the long ball he can buy time with his feet and he can do it all while battling inner demons. Omar Epps the Wood is simply perfectly cast as Darnell Jefferson the prototype freshman Tailback fighting for his spot on the 1st team plus the beautiful Halle Berry plays his love interest.The movie is filled with hilariously awesome lines and performances and is a classic among people who actually play football. While the editing work could be scrutinized among movie Nazis the editing job when Kane and his girl are riding his motorcycle is questionable at times the good far outweighs the bad. Namely the inhelmet camera work really puts you on the field with them. Overall David S. Ward does an excellent job of jumping from perspective to perspective and it quickly builds into this chaotic early 90s mosaic of Division 1 college football. And surprisingly the issues explored in the film really resonate with the issues going on in today's sports i.e. Steroids Motorcycle death wishes.Listen if you haven't seen this movie and you love football and are of mild intelligence then you are either really young or really lucky that you missed it because I wish i could watch it again for the first time. However if you have no appreciation for the game of football you're better off going elsewhere. Football idealists be warned as well. This movie is the antiRudy. It's the story of one school's fight for a bowl bid and fighting for that bid at all costs.PS My vote is very biased. I love to quote this movie with friends. I love to watch football on both Saturday and Sunday. I play fantasy football. I play Madden. I played Division 3 football in college. You have been warned.".

OK so it doesn't rank up there with Brian's Song or is as flashy and symbolic as Any Given Sunday.Maybe it doesn't have the attitude of The Last Boy Scout or North Dallas Forty it lacks the comic appeal of Necessary Roughness. But you know what it does have that all of those abovementioned films lack a connection to any person that has ever stepped out on that field and experienced the pressures and bliss that comes with the nitty gritty game of football. I remember seeing this movie in the sixth grade and having never been into football that much I didn't expect a lot. YetI walked away in awe at the sheer excitement experienced from this movie. This was an instant classic and even years later in my high school football days the players were still talking about it. It is one of the best and most realistic football movies made. It puts you in the mindset of a big play maker like Jefferson or a backbreaking linebacker like Alvin Mack. It also has its human side displaying the pressures of trying to live up to expectations and coping anyway you know how. In Joe's case it's through a bottle. Lattimer sees enhancement drugs as the only way out...the film just takes you down to their level. Better yet it's a college experience that you haven't experienced yet or are trying to remember it goes so fast!. After viewing this movie so many times every year when the college ball season starts or even back in the day before twoadays began I can't help but to get excited and giddy from viewing it. My tape has worn out and I now own the DVD I just wish they would add the deleted scenes. The Program will always be on my top ten list and that's why I give it a great rating.".

The action looked realistic and that is the least and most that I expect in a sports movie.  And playing Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N' Roses during a football practice is surely worthy of some credit.  All in all the game footage was pretty short a few minutes at a time.  What was more interesting and what the film focuses on most was what happened to the players between games as they dealt with their personal lives and game preparation.I'm guessing the movie was trying to shock us with this part.  Steroid abuse by one player alcohol abuse a bar fight and suicidal tendencies by another cheating on an exam by yet another and his subsequent expulsion then reinstatement girl problems with a couple players etc.  The movie has a lot to say and it's a good message but I didn't find this shocking.

This just isn't true at all.SPOILER ALERTThe defensive end Alvin Mack I believe busted up his knee and at the end of the movie it appeared that he would never play again.  This was surely the most poignant moment in the film.  Lattimer the one with the steroid problem was back on the juice and you get the feeling he won't ever lick this problem.

	schema:headline " Getting With The Program";
	schema:reviewBody "The Program may very well be the best film on college football ever done in that it shows its not quite the way it was when Pat O'Brien was playing Knute Rockne or even when Knute Rockne himself was coaching at Notre Dame.During the Nineties another classic film about professional football was done Any Given Sunday. The main theme about Any Given Sunday was that sports was now more business than anything else. But pro football has always been a business. What The Program shows is just how much a business college football is yet it maintains the fiction that this is amateur athletics. As is so eloquently put no one is going to pay for a ticket to see a chemistry exam. Football with its ticket revenue its alumni contributions it's TV and radio rights it's memorabilia rights is a very big business. It brings in money for the colleges hence the colleges have a vested interest in a winning team. And some will do quite a bit more than others.James Caan does a fine job as the coach of mythical ESU who is a decent man caught up in the system. He operates his program straining the bounds of ethics. He knows full well that some of his kids are being greased right through college without an education but football is his life and living and Caan operates the best he can.His players are a cross section of young America. Craig Sheffer is the very talented quarterback from a white trash background trying hard to rise above it. Omar Epps is the inner city ghetto kid who sees football as his ticket out. Andrew Bryniarski is the defensive player that steroids gave us something Caan pretends not to notice until it really smacks him in the face. By the way Bryniarski was also in Any Given Sunday.My favorite in the entire film is Duane Davis who is another kid from the ghetto who both really loves the game can barely read and write and who also sees it as a way of rising from poverty. He's a nice kid but a bad influence on Epps who he constantly tells that The Program will grease him through. Davis just lives for that National Football League contract.I do love the way Davis psyches himself before a scrimmage. You have to see the film to appreciate. Sad to say his is the saddest of all the stories here. You have to be made of stone to not be moved by seeing him at home leg in a cast listening to the final championship game with his mother knowing the future he foresaw for himself is blasted to smithereens.Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson are there as love interests to both Epps and Sheffer respectively. There characters are quite a bit more than the usual airheaded cheerleaders cast in these parts. Another good performance is John Maynard Pennell as Sheffer's second string backup. He romances and talks Caan's daughter into taking an exam for him. When she's caught both are expelled. Caan personally kicks him out of the university and then has to swallow his pride and a good deal more to bring Pennell back when Sheffer has to go into rehab. That's also a classic scene.The Program is one of the finest if not the finest film on college football ever done. I think more than sports fans will appreciate this finely crafted piece of cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Program may very well be the best film on college football ever done in that it shows its not quite the way it was when Pat O'Brien was playing Knute Rockne or even when Knute Rockne himself was coaching at Notre Dame.During the Nineties another classic film about professional football was done Any Given Sunday. The main theme about Any Given Sunday was that sports was now more business than anything else. But pro football has always been a business. What The Program shows is just how much a business college football is yet it maintains the fiction that this is amateur athletics. As is so eloquently put no one is going to pay for a ticket to see a chemistry exam. Football with its ticket revenue its alumni contributions it's TV and radio rights it's memorabilia rights is a very big business. It brings in money for the colleges hence the colleges have a vested interest in a winning team. And some will do quite a bit more than others.James Caan does a fine job as the coach of mythical ESU who is a decent man caught up in the system. He operates his program straining the bounds of ethics. He knows full well that some of his kids are being greased right through college without an education but football is his life and living and Caan operates the best he can.His players are a cross section of young America. Craig Sheffer is the very talented quarterback from a white trash background trying hard to rise above it. Omar Epps is the inner city ghetto kid who sees football as his ticket out. Andrew Bryniarski is the defensive player that steroids gave us something Caan pretends not to notice until it really smacks him in the face. By the way Bryniarski was also in Any Given Sunday.My favorite in the entire film is Duane Davis who is another kid from the ghetto who both really loves the game can barely read and write and who also sees it as a way of rising from poverty. He's a nice kid but a bad influence on Epps who he constantly tells that The Program will grease him through. Davis just lives for that National Football League contract.I do love the way Davis psyches himself before a scrimmage. You have to see the film to appreciate. Sad to say his is the saddest of all the stories here. You have to be made of stone to not be moved by seeing him at home leg in a cast listening to the final championship game with his mother knowing the future he foresaw for himself is blasted to smithereens.Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson are there as love interests to both Epps and Sheffer respectively. There characters are quite a bit more than the usual airheaded cheerleaders cast in these parts. Another good performance is John Maynard Pennell as Sheffer's second string backup. He romances and talks Caan's daughter into taking an exam for him. When she's caught both are expelled. Caan personally kicks him out of the university and then has to swallow his pride and a good deal more to bring Pennell back when Sheffer has to go into rehab. That's also a classic scene.The Program is one of the finest if not the finest film on college football ever done. I think more than sports fans will appreciate this finely crafted piece of cinema.";

It doesn't have all the clichs that normal football movies have where the starting quarterback gets the beautiful cheerleader and any certain game is won at the buzzer on some totally bizarre play. It's about the truth of what goes on in the college game. Sure this stuff doesn't happen everywhere but it certain frickin' happens. I'm talking about the steroids the football players being allowed a free pass when it comes to academics the fact that some people cannot even read but are able to go to college just to play a damn game.This movie shows it all. James Caan does a perfect job of playing the coach trying to keep it all together. Although he is corrupted just as much as his players he had his own problems to worry about with losing his job so he had a big balancing act to perform. This movie was NOT about triumph it's about tragedy and sacrifice that young men make just to be a top player in a sport which in the long run normally doesn't amount to anything.Great watch for you people who don't know much about the behind the scenes stuff and if you haven't seen this movie and are interested in college football check it out. It's not necessarily a greatly acted movie but it's a very telling movie which more people should pay attention to. 7 out of 10 in my book for what it's worth.".

The major problem that I see is that David Ward tries to throw as many football cliches into an hour and a half movie as he can and for the most part the actors fail to rise above the mediocre script.The cast is a talented one and this film helped to propel the careers of some semistars and one super star but in the end the cliches are too much to overcome.  We have Caan who I have do and always will love no matter what roles he chooses playing the longtime head coach whose job seems to be in jeopardy.  And there's Craig Sheffer playing Heisman hopeful Joe Kane. Sheffer was wonderful in Robert Redford's adaptation of Norm MacLean's A River Runs through It but here he can't escape the cliche of the outofcontrol star quarterback with fatherson issues and a need to live life dangerously.We also catch glimpses of the pumped up steroid user the illiterate student athlete the promising young freshman Omar Epps and the incumbent whose position he is trying to win.Halle Berry Kristy Swanson and Joey Lauren Adams add some sex appeal to the film but those early '90s wardrobes are hideous.In my opinion this movie tries to show too much of everything and in doing so fails to show enough of anything.   More of the plot should have been dedicated to the characters of Caan Sheffer or Epps in order to establish a better connection with the audience.The football sequences are well doneI don't think any football movie has anything on this film herebut the characters aren't given enough time to develop.Some things that annoy me about this movie Omar Epp's taunting as he is returning punts.  It's so cheesy. The terribly dated musical score.  It's absolutely dreadful to listen to and almost ruins the entire movie.410".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a football fan although it's not like I haven't enjoyed football films from the past.... such as North Dallas Forty SemiTough and The Longest Yard. Not that any of those were pure football movies but maybe that's why I enjoyed them. So I didn't look at The Program from the eyes of a football fan but from the perspective of whether it's a good movie or not. Certainly it's very professionally made and acted and the football scenes are pretty exciting. The pointofview shots with the football helmet's bars in the foreground made you feel like you were there as in any selfrespecting shoot 'em up video game.The main reason why I was attracted to give The Program a peek was that I was in a James Caan state of mind... having recently seen him in Warden of Red Rock and rediscovering what a fine actor he can be. My first disappointment is that Caan as the coach is present mainly as a vehicle to keep the film moving along. He fixes things  when the boys screw up acts tough makes appropriate facial expressions... and is basically a onedimensional character with no depth. Naturally the film has decided to focus on the lives of the football players as youth sells.Basically we pursue the love lives of two jocks. Joe makes a play for Camille played by the original Buffy Kristy Swanson while Darnell zeroes in on Autumn Halle Berry... who helps make the movie come alive after suckering her to tutor him. In both instances both women are vehemently against dating these guys. Camille in fact flat out states that she does not go out with football players she ultimately does so by losing a bet. Now it's nothing new in movies... as sometimes in real life... for a fellow to court a reluctant girl only to win her over at the end. I know we like to see that sort of thing. However neither of these young men had the kinds of characteristics that would turn these girls' pretty heads in the manner that they did. Darnell's sweet but not educated enough to hold a sharp gal like Autumn for long and Joe can be a smartypants smirking jerk at times especially for a hardnosed and demanding sort that Camille is initially established to be.However not only do the girls fall for these guys and granted some women have been known to fall in love for no good reason... but they do so in a totally devoted and nearly altruistic way. I could have bought one of the female characters doing so but both? How very unrealistic in real life unless a woman feels that immediate click... before surrendering so completely... usually she will make a man jump through many more hoops than what these lucky bs go through. We're just moving the plot along folks.This is a great display of how Hollywood movies are made... I can imagine the screenplay being discussed by the marketing whizzes at Disney where the committee of account executives decided that everything should safely and neatly fall into place. All the predictable cliches have that neat happy ending... Darnell finally bonds with his rival for example Joe's neglectful father is shown tuning into to his son's big game. Yes the movie pushes the right buttons but there is no soul within like in so many Hollywood cookiecutter films... films that are too often hard to distinguish one from the next.".

Not that any of those were pure football movies but maybe that's why I enjoyed them. So I didn't look at The Program from the eyes of a football fan but from the perspective of whether it's a good movie or not. Certainly it's very professionally made and acted and the football scenes are pretty exciting. The pointofview shots with the football helmet's bars in the foreground made you feel like you were there as in any selfrespecting shoot 'em up video game.The main reason why I was attracted to give The Program a peek was that I was in a James Caan state of mind... having recently seen him in Warden of Red Rock and rediscovering what a fine actor he can be. My first disappointment is that Caan as the coach is present mainly as a vehicle to keep the film moving along.

	schema:reviewBody "Man first off let me say what a well acted and fantastic movie in general. The young guys playing the football stars were believable and well prepped. I also loved James Caan character. He seemed like a genuine college coach who had flaws and issues along with that something that makes him who he is!. Also this was one of the very first movies I saw about college life for an inner city youth and college football shown from a darker perspective. Omar Epps character is so well thought out and that I wish we could have seen more of him more of his highlights a better background story. I loved the fact the kid came from the city and was big time. But at the same time i barely felt like i was part of his big time life in high school like i think a Boobie Miles may have felt back in the same time. I understand thats Texas but you get my drift.I really liked how the kids had their own issues and families and problems displayed throughout the movie as well. It made it so much more believable i wish they would make a revamped version where we can actually feel that Heisman race in full effect.Overall I think this is one of the best college football movies ever made The movie should be longer to add small details i wouldn't mind one bit. I loved it and have to give it 9 out of 10 baby! Only because when you look at the genre of College Football Football movies in general this one actually ranks very high among the best ever in my opinion. Rudy being a 1010 and North Dallas 40 being a 1010 Any Given Sunday 1010because they all have great on field action just like THE PROGRAM. great movie when you really break it down!!!!!!".

The assistance shown in the movie is somewhat true to the advantages one receives for being a college athlete but indeed too extreme.

With all this raw aggressions and raw ability Coach Winters must try and hold it all together despite his own problems.It has been so many years since it came out that many viewers will have forgotten the fuss that made this film better known than it really deserved to be at the time. I won't go into it but I really fail to see aside from the one impersonation why a scene involving chicken with cars was cut yet a scene involving chicken with trains was left in  surely if one was unsuitable then the other should be so too? Now over 10 years later the film remains more famous that it deserves on the back of some fortunate casting  it was the cast list that attracted to this film. The actual story is a fairly hohum sports movie with all the usual clichs about college sports as well as the usual semidrama stories around the characters  overcoming bad backgrounds party excesses girl troubles and so on. As a basic sports movie it is enjoyable enough but it doesn't really do anything that makes it stand out from the genre.The cast is the ongoing selling point of the film and the performances are OK considering that the material doesn't give them a great deal to do other than go through the genre motions. Caan plays a grizzly old coach who has to cover the player's indiscretions and he does it well enough. Berry looks OK but has little to do in a very male dominated film. Sheffer is supposed to be the lead role but he doesn't really have the ability and he is easily swallowed up by his support cast. Epps is good and minor female roles are also given to Swanson and Adams. Bryniarski overplays his steroid addict but still works and I thought Davis showed a gentle touch when he was given the chance to in minor scenes during the final game.Overall aside from the controversy that helped it getting a bigger audience at the time of release and the good list of names in the cast this is actually just a competent film rather than a really good one. It has all the usual clichs that you expect from college sports films and it doesn't do anything special with them but it doesn't do them badly either. Entertaining as along as you know what to expect.".

The Program had a streetchicken scene removed because some child imitated the scene and got himself killed. So it was in the actual theatrical presentation for a little while but was cut while still in theaters. The Program on DVD is little more than itself on VHS.Rated R for language and brief nudity bare male backside this film drama is not so deep and imaginative results lead to resolutions. The ESU backdrop is actually Duke University in South Carolina so their stadium is where the football action happens. The football is core to the film but there are five players with short stories to tell on and off the field The plight of the college athlete... Siskel and Ebert liked it though.Halle Berry Andrew Byrniarski and Duane Davis are the best things about this movie. Berry's figure is wasted in this movie but she still delivers her part well as token love interest such a nice decent girl. Byrniarski and Davis have the most entertaining problems and dialogue respectively. Craig Sheffer as Joe Kane is the male lead not James Caan. Caan doesn't do much but play coach.My final thoughts are that Halle Berry should have been a smart and sassy gold digger who slapped someone anyone will do Byrniarski should have gone for the full monty shower and locker scenes should have been visually Rrated too with better casting Craig Sheffer isn't cute enough to be a quarterback and the movie should have ended. Just how did the season end? I'd like to know. Other than that The Program is an okay film but I wouldn't recommend it.".

For me it wasn't. It felt like a longer version of Marcus Weiler's short 'Always crashing in the same car' a German version of Larry Clark's study of aimlessness and loneliless in 'Ken Park' or even a German version of Richard Kelly's masterpiece 'Donnie Darko' reduced to that feeling of being somehow lost without a direction to follow that seems right.The acting is brilliant and the nondialogues are brilliant.

The figures move nervously undecided contradictorily  are they puppets guided by someone or not even that? The protagonist obviously cannot stand the breathtaking narrowness of the Bundeswehr German army anymore. Penned and crammed we see him amidst of his soldier colleagues on the track. During a refreshing break he just remains sitting while the others go back to their duties. Via autostop train and on feet he reaches the bungalow of his parents where he meets his brother and the brother's girlfriend. From bunker to bungalow. You will seldom find a movie that makes you this menacing imprisoning narrowness everywhere feel creepier even the swimmingpool is small the protagonist swims his round on the horizontal like the tiger goes back and forth in the vertical.So far for the impression of this minimalist movie whose lack of dialog remembers to French New Wave. But what is the story? Did the protagonist know that he would meet his brother's girlfriend in whom he is interested? He seems not to be astonished when the two arrive. Moreover he must have known that the bungalow is the first place where the armypolice would look for him. But he shows no sign of fear although hard prison for his desertion is awaiting him. Planless aimless goalless he lives between his bedroom the swimmingpool and sometimes a bottle of Scharlachberg. More and more it turns out that he has one goal to sleep with this brother's girlfriend. Not even the breakup of his own girlfriend torments him much and when she comes back and invites him to stay overnight with her he does not go. Finally his more and more acute danger to get caught by the military police seems to awake the motherinstinct of his brother's girlfriend. When they come home they see the army cars standing before the bungalow they drive on obviously unrecognized. In a little hotel they rent a room and finally the protagonist gets what he was yearning for so intensely he and his brother's girlfriend sleep with one another. However before she is picked up later by his brother the protagonist calls the militarypolice and turns himself in. The question is why. Is he tired of the catandmouse game? Did he simply reach what he wanted so dearly and  after me the Ogygian deluge? Or did he break his brother in a most important moment? We don't know and without any commentary on the disc we will never know. However Fassbinder said once that a movie is good if it does not stop when the cinema is over when it stays in the heads of the audience. This movie does not go out of your head.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bungalow is a German movie from 2002 that is also mostly in the German language. It has its 15th anniversary this year and was the first full feature film work by director Ulrich Khler who is also one of the two writers. The cast includes some relatively known names even today 1.5 decades later like Striesow Castel and Dyrholm. strangely enough Lennie Burmeister who was the lead in here has not acted in almost 10 years now. Looking his name up it seems as if he is focusing more on skateboarding apparently. But back to this movie. It is a pretty short work only runs for roughly 80 minutes and it is the story of a young man who decides to leave his army squad Bundeswehr and disobey orders this way. So the soldiers are basically looking for him for the entire film but this is just a subplot. The real action is about the boy returning home to see his exgirlfriend and brother once again and we find out about his relationship with these two and how it was in the past and what it may or may not look like in the future. A major addition is also the brother's girlfriend who is considerably older than our protagonist but still not only goes on a tour with him but even has sex with him. Eventually this one is one of just a few aspects that make the film appear somewhat unrealistic at times. This is quite a shame as the general premise isn't a bad one and could have made for a decent relatively tense and atmospheric family drama. But I guess Khler was not at his best yet as the good moments like the ending were just too rare or he just doesn't appeal to me as I for example wasn't impressed at all by his considerably later work Schlafkrankheit. I can only say the stuff I already saw from him does not make me curious about what I haven't seen yet. As for this one here I have to give it a thumbsdown and I believe it was a missed opportunity as with some better writing love to detail and perhaps actors as well this could have turned out a much better film. I think all the awards attention is not justified. Watch something else instead.".

That's the plot. The pace can only be described as static. The lead actor is a handsome young man who drops his underpants in at least four scenes. In fact one might be forgiven for thinking that the whole point of this production was the director's urge to get this young unknown actor to be naked on set for as long as possible. There is even a scene where he actually begins to explicitly masturbate on camera. This did not exactly propel him into stardom as he appeared in only 4 more productions. One really has to question the value and the purpose of his displays in this production.After an hour I had to fast forward the last fifteen minutes to reach the climax. It was that bad. So boring are the characters that any interest in their fate evaporates in the warmth of drowsiness.

	schema:reviewBody "'Kohlhiesel's Daughters' was the most successful film of Ernst Lubitsch's German period it was extremely popular at the box office and was rereleased more than once. The story takes its basic premise from 'The Taming of the Shrew' relocated to 19thcentury Bavaria.Innkeeper Kohlhiesel has two daughters whom he wants to marry off. Younger daughter Gretel is pretty and popular no shortage of suitors there then. But older daughter Liesel is a hellion who has no interest in dressing nicely or pleasing men. Naturally no man will have her ... and tradition in 19thcentury Bavaria requires that Kohlhiesel's younger daughter cannot marry before the elder daughter.Although plenty of men want to marry Gretel the man whom she wants to marry is Xaver ... played by Emil Jannings. I hesitate to describe this Falstaffian actor as 'handsome' or 'slim' but in this movie Jannings comes far closer to those traits than I would have thought possible for him. A few years later and several stone heavier Jannings often played men who were sexually humiliated here he's surprisingly virile and athletic. Realising that he cannot marry Gretel before Liesel lands a husband Xaver decides to marry Liesel ... intending to divorce her as soon as possible so that he can marry Gretel. Would their father really consent to this?The two sisters are played by the same actress Henny Porten who makes almost no attempt to differentiate her physical appearance for the two roles. Because of this casting gimmick I kept expecting some plot twist to exploit the resemblance between the two sisters one sister impersonates the other or one of Gretel's swains mistakes Liesel for Gretel. In the event none of those things occur. There is one amusing shot in which Gretel runs through an alley followed a moment later by Liesel the same actress in a different costume. But if the two sisters had been played by different actresses this coup de theatre would have had no point at all. We never do see the sisters together which would have required a doubleexposure or a standin.Interestingly there are some sophisticated photographic effects in this movie. Credit the brilliant photographer Theodor Sparkuhl. At one point there's a burst wipe. Near the end of the film when Liesel decides to prettify herself to please her husband Xaver the transition from dowdy to dainty is achieved with a graceful dissolve. A couple of times the camera speeds up the actors for comic effect I truly loathe this grossly overused device when it turns up in modern films but in 1920 it was still somewhat a novelty.Although Jannings is excellent and Henny Porten is good in her two roles though not good enough to justify the dualrole casting gimmick the best performance in this film is given by the harridan actress who plays Frau Kohlhiesel the innkeeper's wife. With a few understated bits of body language she convincingly and hilariously creates the character of an overworked peasant wife. I'll rate this movie 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kohlhiesels Tchter is a German blackandwhite film from 1920 so it is not that long anymore until this one has its 100th anniversary. The film includes two names that are still very much known today at least to German film connoisseurs. The first would be Ernst Lubitsch who wrote and directed this one with his longtime collaborator Hanns Krly quite a while before their breakthrough in Hollywood. The second is Emil Janning one of the finest German actors from the silent days and you could probably even cut the German with him being an Academy Award winner at the first Oscars about a decade later. But lets have a look at this film. Apart from the duo I already mentioned Henny Porten plays both female lead characters and she was also a star back then. I am a bit disappointed I did not like this film here as much as I hoped I would. It's tough to put a finger on what exactly is the reason I found it uninteresting and flawed but it may be a combination of several factors such as writing and acting and also the lack of more frequent intertitles which is almost always a problem with silent films. I generally like Lubitsch's early silent comedy work but this one here not so much. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taken out of its Nazi Germany context My Life For Ireland for me is not even good propaganda. It was a story I just could not buy. But during its day playing to an audience of impressionable youth and that's who it was aimed at who never got any contrary information I can see why it had a certain appeal. This film was never shown in Ireland the products of German cinema in 1941 were not getting off the continent.My Life For Ireland was aimed at German youth Hitler youth about to go to war against the British to show what a rotten nation this was. It begins in 1903 when we see landlords evicting tenants starvation all around things that were actually happening over fifty years earlier. Werner Hinz playing Irish patriot Michael O'Brian is captured after a raid where an English sheriff who looked a whole lot like Winston Churchill is shot and killed. Hinz is sentenced to deathbut on the day of his execution he marries his pregnant girlfriend Anna Dammann and she swears to raise an Irish patriot.Fast forward to 1921 and that kid is now young Will Quadflieg and he and other Irish kids are going to an English public school set up in Dublin to train the youth to be good subjects of His Majesty. Quadflieg brings home some his friends and one of them Heinz Ohlssen is really taken with Quadflieg's mom. So when he sees IRA man Rene Deltgen visiting Damann he misreads things but still it was only innocently that he betrays Deltgen to a British kid going to his school and acting as an informer.For the rest of the film let's say the young man gets a big old chance to redeem himself for the cause of Ireland. The title of the film says it all.This film was directed by Max W. Kimmich who was Joseph Goebbals brotherinlaw so you know that this film had the interest of the highest authorities in Nazi Germany. Marketed to German youth the message was obvious the Irish kids fought and beat the British back you Hitler led German youth can do the same.Personally I found the whole puppy love aspect of the plot just a bit ridiculous. I can't believe that Kimmich who was a writer as well as director of this film could not come up with a better plot device.On the plus side Kimmich also must have seen John Ford's The Informer because My Life For Ireland has that same dark look of intrigue about it and the final scenes of the uprising are well staged. And I learned here that extras were actually killed during those scenes and they were left in the film. Even in Hollywood that wouldn't have happened.Seen today My Life For Ireland is a curiosity and a sad remembrance of kids going off to battle with the message of this film and others ringing in their ears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Max Kimmich was a hack writer of adventure screenplays who had failed in Hollywood in the Twenties but found a niche back in Germany when more talented men were driven into exile after 1933. Marrying Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels's youngest sister gave him an edge in the biz by grinding out antiBritish stories about as perfunctory and patronising to their audiences' intelligence as the typical postwar Redbaiting script from Hollywood.'The Fox of Glenarvon' 1940 had demonstrated via Kimmich the Nazis' tender solicitude for the liberties of small nations specifically Ireland. In 'My Life for Ireland' next year Kimmich came up with a story so inept and ahistorical that it makes American pabulum look like Edward Gibbon.

	onyx:emotionText "Max Kimmich was a hack writer of adventure screenplays who had failed in Hollywood in the Twenties but found a niche back in Germany when more talented men were driven into exile after 1933. Marrying Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels's youngest sister gave him an edge in the biz by grinding out antiBritish stories about as perfunctory and patronising to their audiences' intelligence as the typical postwar Redbaiting script from Hollywood.'The Fox of Glenarvon' 1940 had demonstrated via Kimmich the Nazis' tender solicitude for the liberties of small nations specifically Ireland. In 'My Life for Ireland' next year Kimmich came up with a story so inept and ahistorical that it makes American pabulum look like Edward Gibbon. One doubts that Goebbels a sophisticated analyst of politics saw it as more than prolefeed.To take only the first scene we are told this is 'Dublin' in 1903.

	schema:reviewBody "EICHMANN is not an easy film to view revisiting the atrocities of the Nazi Third Reich through the greasy smooth denying words of Adolf Eichmann is a nightmare but a nightmare we must revisit periodically to remind us of just how heinous was that period of history. The film is set in 160  1962 and is based on transcripts obtained by the Israeli forces from the files of the concentration camps and Nazi regime transcripts that document the words of Adolf Eichmann that lead to his final confession of his participation in the Third Reich atrocities as unveiled under the slow and insidious interview by Police Captain Avner Less. The film opens after the 1960 capture of Eichmann from his home in Argentina the country where he and his wife and four sons had been in hiding since the end of WW II. Adolf Eichmann brilliantly portrayed by Thomas Kretschmann had been the World's Most Wanted Man and his transport to Israel was met by jeering crowds. The Israeli Minister Tormer Stephen Fry elects police captain Avner Less Troy Garity to conduct the interview in what is supposed to be a topsecret assignment. But the news escapes and Avner's wife Vera Franka Potente suffering from polio of the spine and the Avner children are marked as targets by the Israeli's who do not appreciate the duty of Avner Less's obligation to interrogate and gain a complete confession from Eichmann before he can be tried. The months that the interrogations take prove that the Israeli's believed in justice the facts must be proved completely before the prisoner is tried for atrocities. During the interrogation months Eichmann is shown in flashbacks to have been not only following the orders of Hitler but being committed to the purification of the 'Aryan race'. What screenwriter Snoo Wilson and director Robert Young allow is for us to see the human weakness of Eichmann as portrayed By Kretschmann he had mistresses including one Austrian Jewess and a Hungarian Countess who urged him to complete the Final Solution he coldly signed extermination orders 'because he had to follow Hitler's orders' yet he also was an apparently devoted father to his own sons. Equal time is given to allow the audience to see the interaction between the conflicted parties of the interrogation Avner was convinced he must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the prisoner was indeed guilty of all of the crimes fro which he was accused. The interrogations become a battle of wills between the smarmy oily manipulative Eichmann and the personally distraught Avner. At the close of the film the real Avner E. Less provides voice over regarding the hanging of Eichmann along with statistics of the Nazi atrocities that no matter how often they are quoted continue to astonish our ability to comprehend. The only artistic aspect of the film that is ultimately distracting is the director's choice to have cinematographer Michael Conner use near black and whitesepia toning for the film. Certain scenes break into real color but the tone of the film footage seems dirty  and perhaps that is the reason for the choice. Richard Harvey adds the musical score and there are some very fine cameo roles by Delaine Yates Tereza Srbova and Judit Viktor. But in the end it is the performance by Thomas Kretschmann that is terrifyingly real he deserves awards for his courage to accept this role and for his unforgettable impersonation of a man so evil that under other actor's skills would be simply unbelievable. It is Kretschmann's extraordinary performance that brings home the terror of his film. Grady Harp".

Richard Harvey adds the musical score and there are some very fine cameo roles by Delaine Yates Tereza Srbova and Judit Viktor. But in the end it is the performance by Thomas Kretschmann that is terrifyingly real he deserves awards for his courage to accept this role and for his unforgettable impersonation of a man so evil that under other actor's skills would be simply unbelievable. It is Kretschmann's extraordinary performance that brings home the terror of his film. Grady Harp";

Using the inherently dramatic and compelling nature of the Nazi period to create a largely inaccurate film seems to be another kind of crime. Such a period of evil deserves the most sober treatment possible and should not be used to create a kind of historic horror film.All of that is leading up to my strong suggestion that you skip the film and read Hannah Arendt's amazing book about the actual Eichmann trial in Jerusalem Eichmann A Report on the Banality of Evil. Here you will find a nondramatic nontitillating version of the story that neither exaggerates nor diminishes Eichmann's evil but rather reveals him in a matteroffact way as an opportunist a careerist who merely wanted to advance climb the ladder attain the next title etc. He apparently did not have any particular hatred toward Jews. None of this in my estimation makes him less evil the book actually reveals the banality of his evil by taking away the specter of a crazed monster. His evil lies in its being sane and in a sense ordinary. Therefore given its serious subject matter I feel the film only partially reflects the facts Arendt reveals so clearly obscuring them with with sex and useless side stories. The performances are good the film is well made etc. That's not my point. If you want to make a formulaic film a horror film a sexy film or any other kind of film have at it. But don't use Eichmann as your subject matter. The subject matter is too serious to be misused in any way. Read the book please.".

Was Thomas Kretschmann born to play the perfect Nazi of our nightmares and dreams or what?Well here his Nazinessin total contrast to his brief but impactive appearance in Polanski's THE PIANIST and in DER UNTERGANG as Hitler's brotherinlawis a waste. It's a waste because the script of the film is horrible. His stereotype Nazi features would have been better spent in the USA 1960's sitcom HOGAN'S HEROES.I live in Brazil and have spent a good part of my life here in Argentina and in Germany though I'm American and grew up in the 60s when WWII was still as fresh as the collapse of the USSR is now. So any wellrounded movie fan from this area or news junkie would have as a compulsory experience followed on radio and TV no cable back then the before  postwar antics of these Eichamnns Klaus Barbies and their cohorts.Now I sat through a 5 or 6 hour film in Berlin in 1998 or 1999 or was it two 4 hour sittingsof the COMPLETE Eichmann trial in Israel. The documentary was a big release as Documentaries go. It was playing in several art cinemas in Berlin one near the Memorial Church another in Kreuzbergand in the Oranienburgerstrasse art film multiplex where I saw it.If anyone knows which film I'm talking about please submit as anew title or email me. It is not any of the options this site gives Displaying 8 Results 1.The Man Who Captured Eichmann 1996 TV 2.Adolf Eichmann 2003 TV aka I Met Adolf Eichmann  UK 3.L'Hidato Shel Adolf Eichmann 1994 4.Operation Eichmann 1961 5. Eichmann Trial 1961 TV 6. Eichmann and the Third Reich 1961 7. The Trial of Adolf Eichmann1997 TV 8. Witnesses to the Holocaustthe Trial of Adolf Eichmann1987TV.I thought it was Number 7 the 1997 TV version but it's too short and has a moderator which the long film I saw lacked. Anyway with that film as DEFINITE REAL and irrefutable genuine human emotion tragedies and wrecked lives revealed WHY make a feature film?Well as the list of seven above show there was no shortage of Eichmann films when this film was shot and released. And it has been released. In the Rio Festival EICHMANN had 4 screenings in the main large cinemas and was held over for a third week of Last Chance For the Best of Rio which ended last week. And the copy had burned subtitles in French with electronic Portuguese subtitles below the screen. So it has been somewhat shown around the world. As this looks like a probable straight to DVD release. I had never even read about the filming of this feature which also mis casted the German but dark and with a star power name Franka Potente as the Israeli's prosecutor's wife in one of the boring and pointless subplots. Potente like everyone else including Eichmann only spoke English though she and her Prosecutor husband had met in France and supposedly spoke French with each other. But not a word of German Yiddish French or Hebrew is heard.FINE. English is the international language. But this being a criminal court case movie with loads of depositions at least one of the victims could have spoken in the 4 major languages related to the case. Just for effect like Arien Brody's attempts at German in the PIANIST for some authenticity with English though not one of the four languages related to the case as the main language but not asthe language spoken 100 of the time! Anyway there is a real film with authentic testimony from the actual victims in their mother tongues plus a couple of hours in Austrianaccented German deposition Eichmann gave. That documentary was basically in Hebrew but both sides staunchly used their national identity languages. Eichmann spoke only German and the Israeli prosecutor judges and victims did too  but chose to ask in Hebrew so the crowd could understand apparently. Thus the translations to French English Russian  Yiddish which I'm counting here as German added to an already long documentary in black  white with no visual power film of it all two sets of subtitles running all the time. It was difficult to watch but authentic and a real treasure something this EICHMANN is not. Again the hours of the real trial is what you should look for. The Israeli Prosecutor was not a gorgeous and elegant leading man nor was Eichmann nearly as attractive and Nazilike as defined by the Hollywood stereotype. This film gives NO new insight on Eichmann. The screenplay is shamefully bad and the scenery is SO notIsrael. It screams MALTA where it was shotthough NO southern Mediterranean island would have given us something that looks like Tel Aviv. These islands are ancient and Tel Aviv started to become a city in the late 1920s and 30s not in the 15th century.My suggestion if you are diehard Thomas Kretschmann and Franka Potente fans go. But just to see them. You won't find any substance or anything new in this movie  such a terrible waste of time money story and great and beautiful German actors!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to agree with everything lexo said about this drama and I say drama because I was never wholly convinced I was witnessing history.When I bought this title I was expecting a detailed examination of the architect of Hitler's plan no matter the bias. All I received in return was a turgid family drama set against a few pointless conversations between the police captain Less and Eichmann. Once sensationalised by dubious episodes in the man's Nazi career all that remained were constant accusations and denials by Less and Eichmann. Admittedly this man may not have been exciting or even entertaining within the Nazi regime but one thing he most certainly was was lifechanging.There is an interested audience for films that seek to examine the minds of the architects of Hitler's plan as Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall has shown. Studying German history I was more concerned with the Socialists than the National Socialists but the Nazi motivation and objectives are still a fascinating aspect of 20th Century History. Eichmann however does nothing to advance the understanding of the Nazis nor the Eichmann that oiled the wheels of the Holocaust and seems more like Jewish apologia for interrogating Eichmann by a man who suffered personal tragedy in the Holocaust convicted him on mere supposition and rumour and murdered him because of intense social and political pressure.".

We both really enjoyed it had my mom in tears! I thought it was a eyeopening insight into what happened before Eichmann went to trial about his interrogation and most importantly giving recognition to the little known police captain Avner Less. It isn't true that other languages are not spoken I heard German and Hebrew spoken. I think the comments made were by people who wanted to see a remake of the story of the trial which as they point out has been done many times where this is telling the untold and more interesting story and background to the trail and examines what Eichmann was actually responsible for. I've also have to disagree with scenery not looking Israel enough having been there many times I thought it very real. Amazing performance by Thomas Kretchmann with an OK one by Troy Garity supported well by Franka Potente. A really important movie for Jewish people!".

	schema:reviewBody "This acceptable biopic deals basically with the pretrial interrogation of Adolf Eichmann after he was captured in Argentina and brought to Israel. In the interrogation he insists his role in the Holocaust was minor just a sort of transport commissioner who has to make sure the different prisoners arrive on time at each concentration camp. This is contrasted with flashbacks from Eichmann during World War II showing him directly in charge of the extermination of Jews. His main interrogator is a police captain and the movie shows some of his background how his role affects his family life etc. German actor Thomas Kretschmann who has made a career of playing Nazi officers in Downfall Stalingrad and Valkyrie for instance is very good as the Nazi criminal. So is Troy Garity playing the Israeli detective. Maybe the movie would have benefited from a larger scope  it includes nothing of Eichmann during the trial itself very few about his life in Argentina his capture is dealt in just one quick scene. And there were a few scenes that sounded false to me. For example Eichmann is seen making love to a Hungarian mistress during the war and to get her hot he tells her the amounts of people he ordered killed. Or in another scene the same lady dares Eichmann to kill a baby. Maybe it really happened but the way it is portrayed in the movie sounded downright false and tasteless to me. These few objections aside this is not a bad film.".

This film is basically nothing more than an interrogation with some flashback scenes thrown in and as such really a battle of wits between Eichmann who tries to portray himself solely as an uberefficient paper pusher and the Israeli interrogator tasked with getting a confession out of him. The problem is while Eichmann is somewhat fleshed out in the flashback scenes and Kretschmann does a fine job with what he's given the character of the Israeli interrogator is flatout boring and the actor's performance simply wooden. There are no sparks between the cop and the bad guy. No witty repartee or shock disclosures that make the interrogator question his assumptions even if just for a moment. The ending of this film is ridiculous. Not even a shot of the hangman's noose to give us closure! Just someone talking over a radio in the background.

More than six million because nobody really knows how many and the homosexuals mentally retarded political undesirables gypsies and the rest are often forgotten. It was morally right for Eichmann to be hanged.Psychologically I'm not so sure. We all need enemies. They serve as bad examples for the rest of us. They hold us together. When they've escaped justice they animate our existence. We can see the dynamic at work today in America. The air is full of hatred. With the execution of Eichmann part of our reason for being disappeared. It's like achieving any other grand goal to which you've dedicated years. What follows the initial celebration is an emotional let down. I wonder how many of us slumped when we learned that Josef Mengele was confirmed to have been long dead deep down underneath the gratitude paid to Fortune.Sociologically the results are mixed. Religious offenses are carried across generations. Anyone of Jewish background is less likely to forgive and forget. Not a family went unscathed. Germany will always be the villain for all of us although every German who participated in any way in the Nazi genocidal program is now dead. The Shi'ites and Sunni have been at each others' throats on and off for more than a thousand years.The film is told mostly from Eichmann's point of view when he was a captive being interrogated. A fine performance from Thomas Kretschmann whether as the young SS officer or the selfjustifying prisoner. And from Franke Potente as the interrogator's wife Vera although she's dubbed. Troy Garity as Avner Less the interrogator is particularly weak. There are times when it seems that he's never acted before.The flashbacks begin when Eichmann is already a colonel in the SS and he's a heartless and treacherous bastard. He may love his children  it sounds like it  but he's an adulterer and manipulator. In Budapest he takes up with a succulent baroness Tereza Srbov with whom under other circumstances any normally depraved man would willingly take up.Some of it is literally hard to believe. The baroness gets Eichmann all hot and glandular by having him recite the number of Jews he's killed from different countries while sitting naked on his lap. Later she brings him a cheerful baby in a basket tells Eichmann that the baby's blood is tainted and orders him to kill the baby on the spot. And don't worry. The flesh will be fed to the dogs and the tiny bones ground up for fertilizer. I've always heard the cabbages from Budapest are the best. Eichmann hesitates then shoots the babe with his pistol. Murdering the toddler yes. He murdered a million toddlers. But shooting it in its cradle in front of his antiSemitic girl friend? It's easier to believe that the Chief Interrogator drove a Volkswagon in 1963 Jerusalem which he does.At least we're spared the horrors of the concentration camp films and Eichmann isn't presented as a slavering monster. The narrative is really a duel between the solemn Jewish interrogator and the suave Eichmann. Most flashbacks are brief. We listen to a list of Eichmann's many sins and watch him smoothly deny them. Die Wannseekonferenz captures the younger Eichmann as little more than a secretary when the Nazis were trying to unravel the numerous knots of the final solution. It's a more informative film than this because it tells us things we didn't already know.Or DO we know about Eichmann and the Nazi genocide? A survey of 1000 secondary school pupils aged 1116 revealed that 15 were not sure what Auschwitz was. 10 thought the infamous Nazi camp was a country bordering Germany and 2 thought it was a brand of beer. A further 2 identified Auschwitz as a religious festival while a worrying 1 believed it was a type of bread. The poll also found that 60 did not know what the Final Solution was with a 20 thinking it was the name given to the peace talks which ended the Second World War. sky.com".

Thomas Kretschmann plays Eichmann brilliantly. Troy Garity is also good as Captain Less. The movie often shows flashbacks of the war during the interrogation scenes. But mainly I like the scenes themselves. The movie mainly focuses on Avner dealing with the controversy of interrogating Eichmann. Everyone seems to be against him. Things get worse when they find out that Avner's dad was killed at Auschwitz. And Kretschmann as Eichmann is perfect. He seems to capture perfectly the emotions of an evil man trying to cover up his horrible crimes. He even tells Avner that he was never against the Jewish people. It's a very good movie so go check it out.".

I don't CARE. Give me more of Kretschmann being interrogated. He is riveting.Now the bad stuff The 'artistic license' this film takes is shameful in that it is an insult to every single jew who was murdered by the Nazi regime. There is no good reason for the filmmakers to have given Eichmann a Viennese Jew for a mistress. The notes of Eichmann's interrogator Avner Less do not mention anything about this nor did it come up in Eichmann's Nuremberg trialinabsentia or the Israeli trial. Nor was there a need to make Eichmann the lover of a Hungarian mistress who was so insatiable for the deaths of jews that she would reprimand him for not killing enough while they engaged in foreplay. This is obscene and it obscures the larger truth that seemingly inconsequential everyday men can do terrible damage.To take these liberties is an attempt to obscure the monster that Eichmann really was. To remove the inexplicable terror that is the result of banal men doing unspeakable things in the name of ideology and  or the protection of a larger group of criminals is misguided at best and an insult to every Jewish man woman and child who walked into those building thinking they were going to get a shower. They should have stuck to the text of The Eichmann Interrogation and let the actors use their skills to produce the tension. That's what they are paid for after all and I would have liked to have seen more of the interaction between the two main characters. I give it a '4' on the strength of Thomas Kretschmann's acting alone. Otherwise this movie is a terrible waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's an irony of the worst criminals in history  those ruling the regime of Nazi Germany 193345 were so unremarkable  so much so that the phrase  The banality of evil  was coined for them . This film directed by Robert Young chronicles the interrogation of the most banal man of the Nazi regime Adolph Eichmann who was kidnapped by Mossad while he was living in Argentina and put on trial in Israel in 1961 . If Young has heard of the phrase banality of evil then he's taken it a little too literally because this is a rather banal movie There are some good points such as the opening that has Muslim immans calling the faithful to prayer via loudhailers . Forget all the nonsense you've heard about Israel being an apartheid state because 15 of the Israeli population is Arab who are citizens of the country and are awarded the same rights as the Jewish population . On the subject of democracy the end credits has a voice over from Avner Less who describes the system that saw Eichmann commit his crimes would never happen in a democracy and that democracy is the only political system worth fighting for . The film also has impressive cinematography where the scenes set in 1960s Israel has a brownish sepia tone . It makes a nice change to see a film where the primary colours aren't prominent since films nowadays have an indistinguishable look Nothing else about EICHMANN is distinguished and is a rather dull movie as we shown countless scenes of Less interrogating Eichmann as to his crimes . History has it that Eichmann was bullied at school because his peers thought he was Jewish and I would have liked to have seen the possibility that so many high ranking Nazis might have been of Jewish descent themselves . Instead we get something along he lines of a sleazy soap opera where Eichmann meets several hot high class women for sex including a Hungarian Countess . At any moment you're expecting Joan Collins to come swanning in to a scene where THE COLBYS meets SCHINDLERS LIST And that's the problem . SCHINDLERS LIST has a monopoly on holocaust films . If you're doing a movie featuring the real life crimes of Nazi Germany then you have to bring something new and remarkable to the table and this bland banal drama doesn't".

I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this story  the country bars the little apartment the mobilehome lot the fence factory. It's gritty and real the dust the wind the empty Texas roads. Kim Basinger is truly delightful as Jodie. She's all charm with her Georgia drawl in full swing. I am a huge Jan Michael Vincent fan and this is one of his best roles! It's nice to see him in a more adult role. The heavy drinker side of his character comes naturally  obviously! But Jan always had a great underlying angst in all his characters. He always has a detached macho pathos which he conveys with those eyes  just makes him fascinating to watch. He has great chemistry with Kim Basinger in this. He struggles with his job his sleazy brother his drinking and Jodie's willfulness. It's a great role for him! This is a MUST SEE for any Jan or Kim fans out there!".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading here that this film was held up in release for two years someone must have thought it was going to be a turkey. Then when Urban Cowboy got released and did so well someone then decided we might have a good thing in the vaults. Watching Hard Country with its plot so very similar to Urban Cowboy I was thinking they've got everything here but the bull.JanMichael Vincent and Kim Bassinger in her first big screen film are a pair of twenty somethings who are living in sin as Bassinger's mother tells her in no uncertain terms. Vincent's life consists of his construction job by day and going to the Stallion Bar at night to raise a little hell with his good old boy friends. And of course Bassinger goes along as a little Texas arm candy.But Vincent doesn't see the change is coming with her and that Bassinger is starting to think there has to be more to life than this. Her itch for something better is cultivated by Tanya Tucker who is a friend who went on to Hollywood and Nashville and is now a country music star. She'd like to be a flight attendant although back in those days they called them stewardesses. But JanMichael wants his woman home barefoot and he's doing his best to see she becomes pregnant. And that meets with the approval of all his friends.You can see already that Hard Country is along the lines of Urban Cowboy. I can't call it an imitation since it was made earlier but maybe we can call it a prototype.Like Urban Cowboy it has a nice country and western score. I do like Tanya Tucker singing her famous salute to the Lone Star State entitled simply Texas. Some other prominent roles are Darryl Hannah in one of her earliest roles as Bassinger's sister Michael Parks as Vincent's brother and Gaillard Sartain one of Vincent's goofball buddies who gets himself with some nasty injuries for acting drunk and stupid.This film might have been a good hit in Texas other than the fact it really Texas and Texans down something fierce. Hard Country is not a bad film but Urban Cowboy is better.".

And that was one heckuva fight that Vicent got into with his mobile home selling brother. Vincent sure did have one sleazy brother when he was sitting in his office watching porno and then tried to seduce Vincent's girlfriend played by Kim Basinger. I don't know if Vincent got into that fight with his brother cause he was jealous of all the money that his brother had or because he was messing with his girlfriend. I think Vincent's brother musta been greedy or something because his wife sure was gorgeous. So why woulda he wanta hit on JodieBasinger? If this movie was made today and Vincent woulda tried to run outta on the runway to beg his girlfriend from leaving he mighta got shot! Seriously this was a good movie and I hope to get it on DVD!".

Hard Country is a 1981 dramatic movie starring JanMichael Vincent and Kim Basinger and costarring country music star Tanya Tucker along with Daryl Hannah. It was directed by David Greene and is rated PG in the USA.SUMMARY This picture opened in theaters in the USA sometime in April of 1981 starring Jan Michael Vincent as Kyle Kim Basinger who made her movie debut in this picture starred as Jodie Michael Parks as Royce and Gayland Sartain as Johnny Bob. This movie is about the lives and that great state of Texas. No one ever moves away from the great state of Texas or even thinks about except one person. That person is a very young lady who's name is Jodie and she works for the telephone company. Jodie is filled with love and has that Georgia charm that makes anyone that comes around her fall in love with her right away. Jodie leaves with a young man name Kyle. Kyle is a young Texas boy who works at a local factor making chain link fences. These two young kids lived together in a little mobile home along with Kyle's dog. The problem is that Kyle likes the some country bars his friends and drinking beer while Jodie wants more. The country bar that everyone goes to is Stallions where they sing drink beer and have a good old country time. One night while at Stallions a young woman that Jodie grew up is announced as tonight's entertainment and her name was Caroline. After Caroline is down singing her and her friend all meet at Jodie place to drink and talk. Caroline and Jodie go into another room where they catch up on old times. Jodie biggest dream is that she wanted to become a flight attendant. The next day while at work one of Jodie's coworkers shows her and ad in the local paper that states that the airlines are holding interviews at the local Marriott Hotel. While in the interview Jodie is asked if she would be willing to go to California for training and she accepted now all she has to do is wait to see if she can get the letter in the mail that states that she was accepted. Things start to erode when while at the Stallion Kyle is called out in a drinking game. The object of the game is both players get a pitcher of beer and the first person that drinks it all and puts his pitcher on the bar wins. After sitting and watching this Jodie gets up and walks out because she had enough of Kyle childlike behavior.QUESTIONS Will Jodie get accepted to the airlines as an Attendant? Will Kyle ever grow up and realize that what he has with Jodie is hard to find. Will Jodie dream of leaving Texas and moved to California ever happen.MY THOUGHTS I thought this movie kind of drag a little even thought it had action adventure and drama in it. I thought that Kyle was your typical young man who had a good thing going but continue to act like a jerk. I thought Kim Basinger was excellent in her movie debut. She had spunk and knew when to use it. She was not only beautiful but she has talent also. I love the scene where she's cooking breakfast in her underwear and the other scene where she lying in bed with her legs up showing off the gorgeous thighs. I think that this movie could've used some more drama but Kim Basinger saves this movie and that's why I'm going to give this movie 10 weasel stars base on Kim Basinger alone. Kim Basinger movie debut was fantastic".

Jodie realizes that in order to pursue her dreams she will have to leave Texas and move to the big city. However her shiftless factory worker boyfriend Kyle a fine portrayal by JanMichael Vincent wants to stay in Texas. Director David Greene working from a thoughtful and perceptive script by Michael Kanes firmly grounds the compelling story in a totally plausible gritty blue collar reality and delivers a flavorsome evocation of the colorful downhome Texas setting. Moreover Greene and Kane show genuine compassion and sensitivity towards the everyday characters and their wants and desires the narrative makes a pertinent point about the compromises and sacrifices one has to make in order to get ahead in life but thankfully never gets too sappy or melodramatic. This film further benefits from sturdy acting by a sound cast Basinger and Vincent do sterling work in the lead roles Tanya Tucker contributes a vibrant turn as sweet and successful country singer Caroline plus there's able support from Michael Parks as Kyle's slick'n'sleazy welltodo brother Royce Gailard Sartain as rowdy good ol' boy Johnny Bob Sierra Pecheur as Jodie's doting religious fanatic mother Lewis Van Bergen as smarmy heel music producer Ransom and Daryl Hannah as Jodie's brash and restless kid sister Loretta. Richard Moll has a neat bit part as a belligerent beerguzzling redneck. Jimmie Haskell's twangy score hits the harmonic spot. The country music soundtrack is likewise quite tasty. Dennis Dalzell's polished cinematography also does the trick. A good little movie.".

This film further benefits from sturdy acting by a sound cast Basinger and Vincent do sterling work in the lead roles Tanya Tucker contributes a vibrant turn as sweet and successful country singer Caroline plus there's able support from Michael Parks as Kyle's slick'n'sleazy welltodo brother Royce Gailard Sartain as rowdy good ol' boy Johnny Bob Sierra Pecheur as Jodie's doting religious fanatic mother Lewis Van Bergen as smarmy heel music producer Ransom and Daryl Hannah as Jodie's brash and restless kid sister Loretta. Richard Moll has a neat bit part as a belligerent beerguzzling redneck. Jimmie Haskell's twangy score hits the harmonic spot. The country music soundtrack is likewise quite tasty. Dennis Dalzell's polished cinematography also does the trick. A good little movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was in high school and wondering who that good looking cowboy was. This film evokes the whole feel of the '80's when Dallas was popular and a lot of people I knew wanted to move to Texas. JanMichael Vincent delivers a great performance as a back to the grindstone everyday bluecollar worker. Kim Bassinger does a great job in an early film role for her as Jodie the disenchanted girlfriend of Kyle's. The film does have some great funny parts and lines. One of my favorite funny scenes is when Kyle asks the manager if he would like a pair of socks. I enjoyed Darryl Hannah's character as Jodie's inquisitive little sister. I think the plot hits home for a lot of people who fall into a mundane routine each day going to work and then try to bring some fun to their lives on Friday and Saturday nights. Even the scene when Kyle asks Jodie if she is on her period after they argue probably is familiar to a lot of women out there. The fight scene between Kyle and his brother is a great scene and a bit touching when you see the tears in Kyle's eyes. It seemed the fight not only affected him physically but emotionally as well. OK and being a JanMichael Vincent fan I enjoyed seeing Jan's backside too. There is a lot of music but maybe because Michael Martin Murphy was the screen writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Killing Birds is being belatedly marketed as a part of the vague Zombie series. It has nothing to do with any of them but none of them have anything to do with any of the others so that's OK. There are zombies in Killing Birds but that's not really what the movie is about. The plot itself may leave you a little confused. The first time I watched it I was lost but eventually by reading up on the film I put the pieces together. The movie opens with a mostly unseen soldier who walks into a house and murders all of the inhabitants. If you didn't read about the film on the Internet you might not know what the heck the murders have to do with anything but to have the plot explained to you from an outside source helps the movie itself is no good at communicating facts to the viewer the soldier is returning home from Vietnam. He finds his wife in bed with another man and apparently it's not much of a secret because a few other family members live there too and they're all home including a baby. Oh there are a lot of exotic birds around too. The soldier kills all of the people and even a few of the birds except for the baby. As he's trying to clean up the bloody mess the remaining birds attack him and peck out his eyes which all birds in horror movies will instinctively do.The point is years later a group of students venture into the wilderness to study the rare ivorybilled woodpecker. This will help them get an A in their classes you see. They visit our nowblind soldiermurderer who has aged into Robert Vaughan. It just so happens he's an expert on birds and the kids hope he can help them find their woodpecker. After leaving him they drive off into the Louisiana swamp and come upon the murder house where they discover strange things and are eventually besetupon by zombies. I'm not exactly sure why zombies exactly. I suppose they are the reanimated corpses of the murder victims at the beginning of the film and they are out for a little blood. Not that the college students make it difficult for them. They are the kind of horrorfilm characters who insist on splitting up when danger is present. They wander off alone to investigate strange lights or to look for the car keys or whatever paltry reason the script writer could come up with for them to be alone and defenseless.I suppose this is all in the spirit of good horror movie fun but I found it to be really boring and a test of patience. The characters behave like morons at all times and do not respond to anything in any way that can be considered rational or even human. For instance even before they get to the house they discover a corpse in an abandoned truck. Instead of turning back immediately one of them says That's what will happen to us if we don't KEEP MOVING! Huh?Then later the first character to be killed by a zombie is murdered when she visits the cursed porch where the old bird cages are another character sees her go up onto the porch but refuses to react when she sees the girl screaming and knocking over the cages to get away from the zombie. After the zombie victim is already dead then the girl goes and wakes up her companion I think something's wrong with Jennifer.In my favorite example of nonhuman responses two guys are trying to start a generator. One of them is wearing a long pendant which gets pulled into the rusty machinery and drags his face slowly into the gears. For about two minutes the other guy just stands there watching wideeyed as the other one is mangled by the machine. Then he runs off to tell the others what happened. On the plus side the film is surprisingly welllit although it's almost nonsensical rooms are lit blindingly bright when the power's supposed to be off. There's some nice cinematography. One interesting scene echoes the swinging light fixture at the conclusion of Psycho with the light intermittently illuminating an approaching zombie and another involves the slow approach of zombies glimpsed through the windshield of a truck.The film is obviously inspired by Fulci's The Beyond but the gore is really tame and there is very little suspense or atmosphere. Too much logic is sacrificed and very little is offered in its place. The soundtrack made me chuckle at first then became rapidly annoying with the repeating Casiokeyboard synth lines and canned musical cues that went out of style in 1984. In one of the scenes they rip off Two Tribes by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Swear to God! The conclusion of the film is truly laughable as if they ran out of money and just had to stop shooting. It should also be noted that although the zombie makeup is pretty good everything else in the special effects department sucks. There's a hilarious slitneck appliance that shows up four times. There's an outrageous scene where a picture is supposed to black itself out but they just put some scratches on the film. One of the characters has a hitech computer that looks like a modernday laptop crossed with a Commodore 64 and some awful superimposed graphics to go along with the computer scenes. The acting ranges from amateurish to just plain awful Robert Vaughn appears to be half asleep which is how you'll feel watching Killing Birds. In the end the biggest killing has been the hour and a half it took to watch the thing. Of interest to genre purists only and even then you probably won't want to watch this more than once.".

Killing Birds suffers a little too much from awful sound editing and low budget production values to make it worth renting.

Completely undeserved because any other Zombie film contains more gore in the opening minutes than this production features throughout the whole playtime.

	schema:headline " Disregard the plot line given here this is not really much of a zombie flick.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all this movie is not really Zombie 5 as someone pointed out Zombie 4 After Death came out a year later. Rather both movies are just being repackaged and given new names simply to make some connection to Fulcio's Zombi 2. The only thing they have in common is that the dead do rise. I liked After Death a little I thought it was a nice little zombie flick nothing super great but worth a look. This one however was really kind of tedious. Started promisingly enough with a man going on a killing spree after he finds his wife in bed with another man but then it almost turns into a teen flick as we are introduced to the rest of the cast. The music even makes it seem like a teen comedy. Oh and though it really is not clear at all there has been a significant number of years that has passed since the killings. Well we meet our young group of bird watchers and one annoying bus driver and a rather unremarkable reporter and all you can think is I hope they all die in extremely horrible ways. Not a good way to establish your characters in a horror movie is it? I mean when they aren't arguing over stupid stuff they are mumbling their lines so badly they sound like the parents in a Charlie Brown cartoon. Well they set off to find a bird which has not been seen in 20 or so years and they run across a blind bird watcher. You'll know who he is and you will know what one of the gang of teens is right away so there is no real surprise at the revelation at the end. Well after they bother the blind guy they proceed to go bird watching get lost in the woods and find a house. They immediately set up camp here despite the fact there vehicle is like just over the hill and if they would have continued searching for another 5 minutes they could have gotten out without anything happening. But hey its a horror movie. Well finally some stuff starts to happen as people begin to die while their friends just stand there watching the person die. Of course they don't offer to help just standing there like idiots and then reacting well after the fact when it is far to late. My favorite being the guy who gets caught in a generator gear and gets ground up while this moron stands there not offering to help then after the guy has had it he runs up stairs and says they got him. I had to say no they didn't the jerk got caught and you kind of let him die. As for the zombies they aren't in this movie much and they don't make much of an impression. The plot is practically nonexistent as there is no explanation for why any of it is happening besides the blind man's explanation at the end. Then you expect a rather grisly conclusion but it never materializes and it just ends. Not a real zombie movie I say the makers were trying to make a movie more in the vain of The Beyond. Of course that movie looks better sounds better and has better kills so there is no comparison there. I don't know maybe this was two movies that got bumped together. One film crew was making a horror movie the other a teen romance but they ran into each other and the teen romance people thought a horror movie cool. That would explain the strange changes in the music in the first thirty minutes or so.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's another lateera Italian horror film! For a change this one involves a bunch of kids in a haunted house a setting which definitely didn't appear in House of Clocks House of Lost Souls Witchery Ghosthouse or House of Witchcraft. But hold your horses there mister because this one also chucks in a slasher storyline for a bit and some zombies...eventually.We start out in the late sixties where a Vietnam vet returns home to find his missus in bed with another guy so naturally our marine goes mental and kills the two of them then another couple in laws? who are just arriving with a new born baby. The marine doesn't kill the baby however but when he returns to his home which has an aviary outside some eagles get loose and tear his eyes out. Any good Italian film should start with four murders and an eye removal.We see the kid getting taken into care and then fast forward to 1987 where college studentbad actor Steve has just gotten the goahead to go and track down a rare bird called a greybilled woodpecker so he gathers together his crew of expendable youngsters but not before Lara Wendel gets involved. She works for some college newspaper I think and has tracked down three people who have seen this bird. She's not dubbed in this one either.Lo and behold the only witness nearby is Bill Oddie! I mean Robert Vaughan! And he's the blind psycho guy from the start of the film. We see Robert using two revox tape recorders to monitor various bird sounds and after an awkward conversation with Steve and Lara before a lengthy montage of our group of youngsters going around recording bird song in various locals which somehow reminded me of the Hafler Trio's field recordings. Man! I forgot to mention that one of our potential victims here is played by the Muh Baybee? girl from Witchery! Remember the Hoff trying to get into her pants in that film? Well it seems that she got the part in that film based on her performance here. That's good stuff.After finding a corpse in a jeep which the film doesn't bother explaining our group end up at an old dilapidated house with an old aviary outside. This being an Italian film the house is haunted which leads to several scenes of the house messing with people's heads before the zombies finally appear fiftyfive minutes into the film.So we've gone from slasher to haunted house and now zombie attacks so that's all good as far as I'm concerned. This is when the cast start getting picked off too as you'd imagine with people having their heads caved in throats ripped getting burned and pulled through the roof via the attic just like in Anthropophagus. There's a couple of twists as usual really far fetched ones as usual and although Robert Vaughn doesn't have much to do his explanation for why anything was happening led to a good Italian head scratching ending.Be warned I probably like these films a lot more than anyone with a brain but this is good bet if you're looking for a decent late era Italian horror full of lame fashion prehistoric computers a bit of gore and enough loose ends to something a something. I'm not sure of Joe D'Amato's involvement in this one or how much of the film is his.Man reading the rest of the reviews I might be the only person on Earth that enjoyed this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Under developed underwhelming addition to the Italian Zombi horror series tells another self contained story you don't need to see previous entries before seeing this one. The tale sees a Vietnam veteran return home to slaughter his loved ones before the many hawks on their property attack him. Many years later a bunch of dumb chump college students go in search of an elusive woodpecker species and come upon this old abode which is now a house of horrors.Not much could be done to save this movie not even a guest star role for 'Man from U.N.C.L.E. star Robert Vaughn who plays a oneeyed old bird expert. The young cast is definitely attractive but otherwise nondescript. You don't really care for their characters and don't mind seeing them knocked off. The script by Daniele Stroppa is one of those deals where it's short on sense and long on nonsense. It doesn't bother giving you a lot of details or exposition and actually waits until the dying minutes of the movie to pay off Vaughns' character. The plethora of feathered costars however never does amount to much. Also while Killing Birds does feature zombies there aren't that many of them. It isn't until around the one hour mark that this even becomes somewhat interesting  entertaining. The gore effects are quite grisly and enjoyable. The music score by Carlo Maria Cordio is also good. Directing credit goes to Claudio Lattanzi. Joe D'Amato also directed  produced without credit and served as cinematographer under a pseudonym.Five out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good luck in trying to make sense of this one it's a total mess even by '80s Italian horror movie standards. The freewheeling nonsensical plot goes something like thisVietnam vet Fred Brown Robert Vaughn returns home to Louisiana to find his wife in bed with another man after killing the adulterous couple and his inlaws Fred disposes of the bodies cleans up the scene and frees the family's pet birds after which he is attacked by a hawk which claws out his eyes.Years later the blind exsoldier's crime somehow remains undiscovered and he now spends his time at home studying bird song. Hoping to locate a rare species of woodpecker a group of Louisiana college students pay the old man a visit and following his advice they set out for the swamps. After stumbling across a decomposing body in a car which they opt to ignore they finally stumble upon the old deserted house where Brown's murder spree took place and decide to spend the night firing up a generator in the basement.During the night the friends experience a series of strange inexplicable occurrences including grisly hallucinations after which they are attacked by several zombies and a supernatural force which pulls one unfortunate victim into the gears of the generator. In the morning the two remaining survivors escape the house meeting Brown as they leave. The blind man enters the dilapidated property where he is attacked by a flock of birds. The End.None of this follows any kind of logic there's no explanation for the supernatural goings on the violence is bloody but unconvincing and the ending incredibly weak. Although not an official part of the Zombie series it's easy to see why Killing Birds was given the alternative title of Zombie 5 it's every bit as random badly acted and shoddily directed as Zombie 3 and Zombie 4unfortunately it's also a lot more boring.".

	schema:headline " Oh Bird Poop!";
	schema:reviewBody "First thing I'd like to mention about KILLING BIRDS is the misleading title. The version I have is called ZOMBIE 5 KILLING BIRDS. I've got a question for the filmmakers. Where are the zombies that are promised in the title? Where are the birds that kill for that matter? Granted there are birds of prey that technically kill in the movie. But they don't kill any character in the course of the film. The worst they do is blind a person and flock around. Mind you there is killing and there are birds but they aren't one and the same. The official title maybe should have been KILLING BIRDS. After Hitchcock's monumental 1963 film as far as I'm concerned no other killer bird movie has ever come close to being scary. Though the eerie crow scenes in RESIDENT EVIL EXTINCTION come close. The story starts in the late 60s a Vietnam vet returns to his house in the marshes of Louisiana to find his wife sleeping with another man. Before you can say HALLOWEEN ripoff he kills them both as well as his mother and father who appear out of nowhere carrying his baby boy. Soon after his pet birds attack and peck out his eyes. Why? We don't know and never will. Once again this is Eurotrash of a low standard where bad acting abounds the plot is nonexistent and gore flows. The first thing that must get cut are annoying little details that thoughtful viewers would question. Flash forward about twenty years and we meet a young man named Steve you guessed it he's the baby all grown up now. He's at college and his thesis has just gotten approved. Now Steve along with a group of other college students set out to find a rare wood pecker. Along the way they are joined by a park ranger. Eventually they stop at a house owned by a blind bird watcher haha! played by Robert Vaughn... yes THE Robert Vaughn! Did it for the moolah? Finally after his big scene which goes absolutely nowhere much like the rest of the film the group winds up in the marshes and stumbles across an old house. Amazing the house looks remarkably like the same one from twenty years ago. Guess what happens next? They hold up for the night as weird Poltergeistlike stuff happens. Boards are nailed up an ancient generator turns homicidal and much much more happens using the word loosely. Finally after the disposable characters are eliminated by a zombie or two we're down to Steve and a student reporter named Anne. Robert Vaughn appears out of nowhere and claims that he's the one they're after. The young couple escapes and we hear Vaughn screaming. THE END. Scratching my head afterwards all I can think is Huh what just happened? In truth not a whole lot! The zombie is simply a slowmoving backlit guy because makeup costs too much I guess. Half of the time we don't even see a monster at all. Things pop up or start on their own and characters die. There's one scene where the group is trying to get a van to start and one character is attacked by a hand that emerges from the fog. This scene seems to be ripping off Fulci's phenomenally better CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD. No explanation is really given as to what causes the monsters or apparitions or zombies to attack. Out of revenge or pure evil? The filmmakers obviously don't care enough to explain so neither should we care enough to see it. Along with BURIAL GROUND NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES and ZOMBIE 4 this qualifies as one of the worst zombie flicks ever made. As an unintentional comedy however it's great! So make popcorn and invite your funniest friends over for a night of sheer utter uncontrollable........ laughter!".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening sequence of the much maligned Zombi 5 Killing Birds is very promising  ten dialoguefree minutes which show a Vietnam veteran returning to his lakeside home from the war and slaughtering his wife her lover her parents and some pet birds before having an eye pecked out by their avian fellows his baby child survives. This is an impressive piece of visual storytelling highlighted by elliptical glimpses of the marauding veteran we never see his face an impressively atmospheric shot of him reflected in a lake and nastily gory deaths. This all sets up a creepy doomladen atmosphere which is effectively murdered as soon as we jump 20 years into the present and meet as unconvincing a group of student conservationists as it would be possible to put on screen readying themselves for a trip to the same lakeside area in order to spot the possibly extinct ivorybilled woodpecker!.Given the film was codirected by Joe D'Amato it is just about possible that the students are deliberately bland craven and dumb their leader Steve is particularly misconceived  a wannabe scientist who has nothing to say but who seems to be in the grip of some kind of featureless ambition a role not helped by the casting of the previously and subsequently obscure Timothy W. Watts an actor so inept and charismafree that only nepotism sexual favours or directorial mischievousness could have got him the role. Ultimately the students are so stupid and dislikeable that one gets the feeling that D'Amato is setting them up as ripe for the slaughter yet how much of their dislikeability is deliberate is impossible to gauge D'Amato had deliberately played the trick of making his victims dumb middleclass consumers on various previous occasions.There's a germ of a good idea here with the group of Western ecowarriors travelling on their birdspotting expedition and getting caught up in the sins of their fathernation's patriarchal and Imperial past the holy family is the site of murder the colonial Vietnam war bred crimes against humanity the industrial West has made nature murderously dangerous. The kids lost in the haunted house by the lake makes for some moody imagery and the killings are appropriately vicious even if the means of death are rather random  the best is certainly that of the young woman who a zombieghost literally kills by trying to knock some sense into her. But too much of the film is meandering spent watching the moronic young blandies walking around purposelessly so the potentially good ideas are smothered by longueurs.Robert Vaughan pops up and does an impressive turn as the older version of the Vietnam vet who seems to have got away with killing his wife  her parents but who is blind from the bird attack his role as a latterday Tiresias is massively underdeveloped although the scenes where the students first enter his house show D'Amato's baroque cinematography off to its best advantage. The extent of D'Amato's involvement is hard to gauge  the mashup of genres zombie slasher ecohorror haunted house and craven theft of influences The Birds The Fog various Argentos and Fulcis points to his presence but the film never feels as daring or polished as D'Amato's best horror tales. Ultimately with its throbbing electronic score and its concentration on prolonging moments of impending mortality the film feels most like a secondrate Fulci without the sheer Gothic breathtaking gall of a masterpiece like The Beyond.".

Then we are once again supposed to know that several years go by without the film telling us so. We get introduced to the worst characters of all time. From the getgo I was hoping they would all die painful and slow deaths. And since they are a gang of birdwatchers you know they won't be able to defend themselves from the undead. Haha. So I'm just waiting for the zombies to arrive and slaughter everyone in sight. Ten minutes in no zombies. Thirty minutes no zombies. Fifty minutes still no zombies!!! Why was this released under the Zombie banner. There are no zombies until the very end of the movie. There are other things missing as well. There is no explanation given for anything and there are no killing birds. This is one bad bad movie. Did I mention the cheesy music and bad acting? The only actor who fairs well in this is Robert Vaughn. O how the mighty have fallen. Vaughn was an Academy Award nominee and my favorite of the Magnificent Seven. A real shame. Killing Birds is completely avoidable.".

But no I still do not know what my eyes has just seen.It baffles me.This movie is the film adaptation of the question mark. Upon viewing this you will find yourself wondering Who would say that?! Why did you do that?! What did that have to do with anything?! Where are you?! How big is this house?! Where did that zombie come from?! Why did he just catch fire?! Why is it brighter than the sun if it's in the middle of the night?! where are all the birds?!.Almost every scene and every piece of dialogue gives birth to a set of questions that will forever be without answers. No actions taken by the characters makes any kind of sense. No words spoken makes any kind of sense. I'm still not sure about the plot! What the hell is this movie about why are they so dumb and why would they do the things they do? And where are all the murdering birds?!I want to understand this movie I really do. I've got so many questions! Where did the zombiezombies still not sure if there's actually more than one come from? What did the intro flashback got to do with the rest of the film? Why are they just aimlessly running around in this house committing random acts of stupidity? Where does all the smoke come from? And the lights?! The lights?! Oh God!Who green lighted this?! Somebody along the production line must have noticed how bad it was?Take this as a warning. I do not enjoy to bitch about movies I am a huge fan of Bmovies and euro trash and there's always SOMETHING good about a film. But I can't find anything that works here. The camera works the audio the plot the acting the effects... It's just not good. There is nothing good about it. I do not lie.This film has a negative entertainment value. You loose previous fun you've had when you watch this. It leaves you with an empty feeling inside and enough questions to last you a life time....Why? ".

The last survivors find out about the dark secret of the house and the forest and its birds...One of the less wellknown works of Italian exploitationspecialist Joe DAmato. Maybe not as sick as his masterpieces Buio Omega or Emanuelle in America but still pretty creepy and full of suspense. The film could be seen as a mixture of John Carpenters The Fog and Lucio Fulcis City of the living Dead and it has some nice gore scenes like a guy who gets dismembered by a generator or a teared off head. The students only differ from their names and their clothes but they are by far not as dumb as the teenagers in the Friday the 13th flicks whats no mistake in my opinion! Robert Vaughn as blind and mysterious scientist is the definitive highlight in this film! Highly recommended if you like creepy stuff with some gore! Id give 7 out of 10!".

It deals with the issue of heroism and it's political value in wartime. Woodrow Truesmith Eddie Bracken is a 4F who has been working in California in a plant because he could not get drafted. But his family and neighbors expect him to be in the army. His father was a war hero in World War I he was named Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith after President Woodrow Wilson General John Pershing and the Marquis of Lafayette  supposedly Pershing's staff Major Charles Stanton made the statement Lafayette we are here when our troops arrived to help the French in 1918  so that Woodrow was born about 1918. Bracken has lied in letters to his mother that he is a marine and a hero. He tells this to a small group of Marines led by William Demerest and including one named Bugsie played by former boxer Freddie Steele who decide to accompany him back to his home on their furlough. They go with him and back up his lies so that Bracken finds himself the town's leading hero  and a potential piece of political timber.The town is run by two men Al Briggs the quiet but intelligent town boss and Raymond Walburn the richest man in town who is the mayor as well Everett Noble. Walburn is always blustering but he basically knows what's what. However it is Briggs who asks the right questions. When the reform party nominates Woodrow for Mayor Briggs asks I wonder if he really is a hero? And he starts making inquiries.They have an unwitting ally Woodrow himself. He finds the expansion of his lies too much pressure on him and he questions it's value. But he can't buck his mother his girlfriend Ella Raines nor Demerest Steele and the other Marines. They've learned that Woodrow is the only hope for the town's future because it's currently somewhat shoddy and corrupt in it's goals and actions. They can't let Woodrow confess.What makes a hero? In HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO set in the middle of WORLD WAR II it turns out that heroism is not only found on a military front or battlefield but can be found on the home front as well. It can take many forms and sometimes it is at great personal humiliation and hurt. Bracken never had a better role except for his other starring role for Sturgis in THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK and demonstrate the growth of his moral stature quite well. Demerest Walburn Raines Briggs all do well Demerest in an oddly different role  he's a soldier not a wise guy and Freddy Steele's Bugsie is a wonderful portrait of a slightly mentally ill soldier with a mother fixation. Steele had a a career in movies in the 1940s mostly in bit roles. This was his best performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tip of the hat to the other commentors of this film.  Their comments are enlightened and do justice to a real work of art.  Here is my small contribution.Eddie Bracken does a wonderful job as the meek pitiful hero who just wants to go home.  The word that comes to mind is sanctuary.  More than a place it's a goal and ultimate need. Home back to his town his mother and his girl.William Demarest as the sergeant shines.  He gives a laudable performance. Or is it just him?  His bark in this film is very reminiscent of another famous role of his that of the salty Uncle Charley on the long running TV sitcom My 3 Sons.The town is a delight.  It is a typical small town of 50 years ago or what we expect one to be.  It's a warm friendly place with people you can count on.  In typical small town American tradition the truth is triumphant everyone pulls together and a tearful happy ending is assured.  I'm sure that if you close your eyes you'll be able to picture this place in your mind's eye.A sentimental funny patriotic movie that would be very much appreciated during the dark days of war it's charm still comes through 50 plus years later.

	schema:reviewBody "The last of the really great comedies that Preston Sturges directed had a more serious undertone than his previous films. This is not to say that Hail the Conquering Hero isn't hilarious though. It is just as intelligent fastpaced subversive and witty as could be expected from the writerdirector of The Lady Eve and The Palm Beach Story.Eddie Bracken plays Woodrow Truesmith a wouldbe marine who was discharged from service for chronic hay fever. Woodrow whose father died a hero during WWI hasn't had the heart to tell his mother about his discharge and has been pretending to still be on the front line. When he befriends a group of marines on leave they dress him up as a hero and bring him home to make his mother happy not anticipating that his whole town will give him a hero's welcome.Considering that the film was made during the war it is surprising the way it satirises the notion of the war hero as well as the attitudes of those who did not go away to fight. The awestruck townspeople are depicted as being rather gullible while the marines are shown as a tough cohesive unit if maybe a bit dishonest and mercenary and in one case slightly unhinged. The film has fine production values and great performances across the board but it is Sturges' script with its marvellous characterisations and sparkling dialogue that really shines. If you like Preston Sturges' other earlier comedies this film is essential viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "What makes a hero? That's the essential question being addressed by this movie which is at one and the same time both a funny piece of escapism for a warweary population and a very thoughtprovoking study of heroism.Eddie Bracken is Woodrow Truesmith son of a World War I Marine and grandson of a Civil War veteran. Given his family history Woodrow is of course expected to serve honourably in World War II but when he goes to enlist he's rejected for chronic hayfever. Unable to bring himself to tell his mother the news he tells her he's been sent overseas. One day he meets a group of real Marines headed by Sgt. Heppelfinger played very well by William Demarest and shares his story. They arrange to take him home and have him pose as a veteran of Guadalcanal. I admittedly had some trouble with the plot. From what I know of the Marines I doubt they'd take kindly to someone posing as a veteran of Marine battles let alone set the whole thing up. That aside however once Woodrow gets home with his new Marine buddies the story takes on a life of its own. Woodrow is suddenly portrayed as a great hero. He's met by bands and given the keys to the city by the typical movie version of the small town mayor Raymond Walburn. Then the town decides to erect a monument in his memory. Then the opponents to the mayor draft him to run against the mayor. One lie leads to another and Woodrow can't get out of it. In the meantime his reappearance in town causes emotional angst for his former girlfriend Libby Ella Raines who's now engaged to be married to the mayor's son but who really still loves Woodrow.It's fascinating to watch a little lie take on a life of its own and grow beyond anyone's wildest imagination. It's also interesting to watch Woodrow's torment. He knows he's no Marine hero but no one will let him out of the story. Every time he tries to explain he gets shouted down by those who don't want the truth they just want to live with the hero image. Eventually though Woodrow becomes a hero. Here's where the study of heroism comes in. Heroes in wartime are usually those who fight the battles and kill the enemy. Woodrow never did that but his heroism will ultimately be defined not by wartime battles but by honesty and integrity and a real courage as  in a powerful scene near the end of the movie  he faces the town's citizens and finally tells all admitting the deception in such a way as to let the town know he's no hero but that will also protect the reputation of the Marines who got him into this in the first place.This is a very good movie featuring a fine story and a collection of excellent performances. It should definitely be watched. 710".

	schema:headline " a 4F returns home a war hero";
	schema:reviewBody "Preston Sturges wrote and directed the 1944 film Hail the Conquering Hero which stars Eddie Bracken William Demarest Ella Raines and Franklin Pangborn. Bracken is Woodrow Truesmith whose father was a famous war hero. Woodrow however is 4F because of hay fever. Discharged and depressed he sits in a bar delaying going home. He confesses the truth to some marines he meets in a bar and they decide to accompany him home to back up the story he told his mother  that he's in a hospital overseas due to war injuries. When he arrives home he has a hero's welcome. Later there's a statue and a song. Then the town wants him to be mayor.Sturges' gift was coming up with wacky plots while others of the era could create wacky situations within a plot. This one is pretty outrageous. As Woodrow feels more and more guilty the public adulation becomes bigger and bigger. It's a strong message about people believing what they want to believe and their need for a hero.Bracken plays his role very seriously and lets the situation and the lines get the laughs. His character looks and feels trapped. Ella Raines plays his exfiance and she's very beautiful  a cross between Jeanne Crain and Gene Tierney she gives a very sweet and sincere performance. She was a very underrated actress and beauty who for some reason never reached the top tier of stardom today she is remembered for some wonderful film noirs in which she appeared. William Demarest is very funny as the marine helping to keep the story alive  at any cost.I enjoyed The Lady Eve The Palm Beach Story and Sullivan's Travels better mainly because of their casts but for Sturges fans this is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curiously enough while I do admire and enjoy most of Sturges' films I've never been quite as taken with him as his reputation would seem to demand. Nevertheless I fully acknowledge his standing as one of the most important figures in Comedy.The thing is that having started off as a writer like his contemporary Billy Wilder Sturges' peerless talent in this department kind of swamps his technical side which is boldly integrated into the comedies of Frank Capra whereas it's more refined but still palpable in those of Ernst Lubitsch  so that his films come across as undeniably erudite which however clashes at times with their smalltown settings and workingclass characters but also a bit loquacious! For me the best comedy director remains Howard Hawks  in whose work the form not only appears effortless but is actually made to transcend genre thus acquiring an artistry without resorting to undue camera gymnastics or editorial tricks. What Sturges' films may have lacked besides was that he rarely worked with bonafide stars instead he amassed an enviable repertory of character actors around him and then let them rip  with the consequence that most of his canon emerges to be undisciplined and tiresomely frenetic! Anyway after that rambling introduction let's get down to the issue at hand HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO can surely be counted among Sturges' finest. As were all of his films it's an absolute original but also somewhat audacious his previous outing THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK 1944 had tackled an even more outrageous and controversial theme  this being a wartime comedy about the putdown of heroworship! The plot sees milquetoast hero Eddie Bracken rejected for war duty because of hay fever not wanting to break his mother's heart his father was a hero of the previous war incidentally he only returns home after a year. He meets up with six marines on leave the Sergeant among them happens to have served with Bracken's father and they contrive to get him a hero's reception thinking that all will blow over once they're there. However the whole town shows up to greet him at the station with due fanfare  he's clearly embarrassed at this but the soldiers persuade him to go along with the ruse for the time being. The situation escalates further when the town decides to erect a statue in Bracken's honor and eventually pushes him into an electoral campaign for the Mayor's seat! There's a predictably upbeat ending following a Capraesque speech in which Bracken confesses the truth about his 'war record' where the people decide they still want him because  for once  they've been faced with an honest declaration!! Eddie Bracken may have had too limited a range to make it as a comic genius in the Bob Hope mold but he certainly fit the Preston Sturges universe characteristically he's given an unwieldy  and ironic  name here. Leading the Sturges stock company is William Demarest as the fixer of a Sergeant who lands Bracken in more trouble with every new scheme to aid his 'case' a memorable scene early on sees him attempting to trade service at a caf with a collection of war 'mementos' only to have the owner turn out to be even more supplied with such worthless trinkets than he is!. Other members include typically wellmeaning but perennially flustered Franklin Pangborn his efforts to organize multiple bands at Bracken's reception are continually frustrated through lack of cooperation or outright incompetence from those concerned Raymond Walburn as the pompous and unpopular current mayor  whose similarly insensitive offspring is naturally engaged to Dad's secretary the lovely Ella Raines and in smaller roles Al Bridge Jimmy Conlin and Torben Meyer.Raines herself  whom I'd only seen in film noirs  gets quite a wellrounded character though her longing for a homespun life alongside Bracken feels decidedly idealized. Also notable is exboxing champ Freddie Steele playing an orphaned soldier who finds in Bracken's mother a surrogate parent  often berating him both verbally and physically for what he deems Bracken's inconsiderate behavior towards her! This subplot introduces an element of sentimentality into the fray which usually bothers me but it was quite amusing here to see a big man like Steele go soft every so often.I should be getting soon to Sturges' most misunderstood film THE GREAT MOMENT 1944 which would then leave me with only his littleseen directorial swan song  THE FRENCH THEY ARE A FUNNY RACE aka THE DIARY OF MAJOR THOMPSON 1955  to catch up with from his brief but highly individualistic oeuvre...".

The idea of a man medically discharged from the Marines passing himself off as the great hero from Guadalcanal even at the behest of some Marines he meets in a bar is ludicrous on its face. But by golly Preston Sturges pulled it off.Think about it within a year of the end of World War II a genuine 4F with no pretense about it would be a great American hero in Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life. In the end both George Bailey and Woodrow Pershing Lafayette Truesmith would be the saviors of their respective small towns.Generally however a military record of some kind was going to be a necessity in politics after World War II. Hubert H. Humphrey had a legitimate draft deferment and was Mayor of Minneapolis during the latter part of World War II. But his lack of war record contrasted badly in running for president against John F. Kennedy in 1960.Sturges realized that it's the integral part of his satire of small town life and politics. Certain forces within Eddie Bracken's town would like to use his new found celebrity status to make him mayor to unseat bloviating Raymond Walburn at his bloviating best on screen. Ideas about how to govern get real lost in the political process the same way they do in Sturges's first real success The Great McGinty.Bracken who after Sturges left Paramount gradually slipped back in the ranks of supporting players is in the hands of the director who knew how to utilize his schnook persona the best. Poor Bracken is the posthumous son of a World War I Marine hero who died at Belleau Wood and those were the first Americans in combat in that war. When the second World War comes he enlists hoping to emulate his late father whose unseen presence was felt growing up.But he's washed out due to hay fever and can't face coming home and disappoint sweetheart Ella Raines mother Georgia Caine and aunt Elizabeth Patterson. He buys a round at a bar for some returning Marines from the Pacific led by William Demarest who knew his father back in the day. The Marines cheer him up and Demarest gets the bright idea of passing him off as a great war hero discharged due to battle wounds. They accompany Bracken back to his home and his political 'career' mushrooms from there.Hail The Conquering Hero earned Preston Sturges a nomination for Best Original Screenplay and he was up against himself in that category for Miracle At Morgan's Creek. His films canceled each other out and Wilson won the Oscar in 1944 in that category.You know if they had succeeded in pulling this off I do wonder how Bracken might have done trying to get Veteran's benefits later on.But Hail The Conquering Hero is Preston Sturges at his best.".

It kind of runs out of gas at the end but I was so tired from laughing through the movie that it was a relief.As with any comedy seeing it in a theater is best since the audience appreciation amplifies the pleasure but see it by all means.

We see him in what appears to be a regular practice buying drinks and food for a group of six Marines led by William Demarest in the role of his long life.The grateful Marines get Woody's story out of him  that he could not face going home following what he viewed as his disgrace and wrote his mother letters mailed by soldiers shipped abroad that he WAS serving over seas and released his girlfriend who he was sure wouldn't want someone who couldn't serve. Freddy Steele's Bugsy raised in an orphanage is so outraged that Woody would cut himself off from the Mother he didn't have that he calls Woody's Mother telling her that her son's been discharged following recovery from wounds and is coming home  starting the little lie that rapidly snowballs in comic complications.All six Marines after first setting up the core situation by forcing their own uniforms and medals on Woody on the train home to pull off the charade for his mother are such solid grounding presences throughout the film packed with Sturges' regular team of character players from Ray Walburn as the opportunistic more than corrupt small town mayor to Franklyn Pangborn as the general factotum that it is almost criminal that only a couple of them are credited by name. The film's chief leap of faith is that any Marine would violate regulations as to the wearing of uniforms and medals not earned  but Sturges the screenwriter bridges this gap neatly between Woody passionately struggling NOT to be caught up in the charade and the soldiers themselves becoming trapped in it.In the end in a film not remembered for its subtlety Sturges' actual subtlety nearly works against him by neither making his justifications as up front and memorable nor his bad guys as deeply villainous as say a Frank Capra might have but the warmth and essential nobility of the true hero shine through and make this something of value far beyond the time it was made for.In 1961 the tale came acropper in a noble attempt to turn it into a Broadway musical with a book by Larry Gelbart MASH a score by Moose Peter Pan Charlap  Norman Gimbel and direction and choreography by the great Bob Fosse who was fired on the road in a dispute over his choreography!. The timing was off more than the content  half a decade later once the Vietnam conflict had heated up and was still perceived as a noble effort we were never told at the time that the war was to prop up a government which refused to participate in UN supervised popular elections when the French withdrew from their former colony because the nationalist general who led the drive for freedom  their George Washington  was sure to win things might have been different. The demo recordings which survive are nice enough  but thanks to TCM and home video the real deal is available and one of the best.This is not a pro or antiwar film it is simply a film set in wartime and excellently capturing the home front of that time which quite beautifully looks at the nature of quiet heroism. If you've never seen it you should  if you have it's worth another look. It's probably even better than you remember.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Preston Sturges film is a wartime comedy with more to it than appears on the surface. It's a good story with a plot that is well developed. The situation comedy is plain for all to see. Eddie Bracken's Woodrow Truesmith returns home after being away for a year supposedly for wartime service overseas. William Demarest as Sgt. Heppelfinger heads a group of Marines who are back in the States from Guadalcanal and who concoct a ruse to make Woodrow a hero back home. There are more details but this sets the stage for much of the story. Yet underlying this is a message about nonmilitary service in wartime. It's no disgrace that Woodrow was medically discharged from the Marines after one month of training. And people who fill civilian jobs back home also are important to the war effort. None of this is overtly obvious so that it doesn't become a preachy film. But that nice subtle message is there. Bracken does a good job in his role but I think Demarest was especially good as the sergeant. The rest of the actors were all quite good. The film has a sizable cast with several notable character actors of the day. Franklin Pangborn plays the reception committee chairman in a frenzied disorganized and pompous way that was a trademark of many of his roles. Raymond Walburn as Mayor Noble had some of the best lines in the movie  a good number of lines. He played his role superbly well and clearly provided must of the humor in the film. He had many snappy very funny quips and lines. Which lead me to think that the film also was something of a spoof of politics. Even the stereotyping of Marines as not well educated gets a pass. This bunch is seen as caring and considerate men even with their toughness. In the end Woodrow swallows his pride and tells the town folk the truth. Honesty once again proves to be the best policy.".

His father Peter Armin MuellerStahl is a selftaught pianist who teaches David his same love of piano and classical music. There is love there but as portrayed in the movie Peter is a rigid man who gives his son mixed signals. He drives his son to succeed as a pianist teaching him that winning is everything and yet when David has opportunities that would take him away from the family Peter won't permit it. The reason for this is that Peter and his wife lost relatives in the Holocaust. Peter is also given to physical abuse toward David when he loses his temper.David finally gets away from him and attends the Royal Conservatory in London where with the help of his teacher John Gielgud he wins an important competition but then suffers a severe nervous breakdown. The rest of the movie deals with the road back which leads him home to Australia and to his wife Gillian. Gillian is actually his second wife though the first marriage isn't mentioned in the film.The dominant performances belong to Rush and MuellerStahl. Rush does a brilliant job of showing us the likable but stuttering David who speaks rapidly and repetitively expressing himself through music. MuellerStahl as the tortured Peter is fabulous a man who is both monstrous and pitiable. In a small role John Gielgud of course makes a fine impression as an elderly teacher a wonderful pianist himself who believes in David's talent.The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto 3  Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used  and the aftermath. What I missed in this film is music  there was a lot of talk about David's promise but until the Rachmaninoff not much playing.Helfgott's work today has been deeply criticized for being  well lousy. A review in The New York Times of one of his concerts is horrible. The reviewer however mentions that Helfgott occasionally showed vestiges of excellent technique. I think it's safe to assume that his playing nowadays is more erratic than it was in his earlier years. There are several examples of Helfgott's playing in the movie La Campanella Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 In C Sharp Minor Flight of the Bumble Bee Rachmaninoff's Prelude In C Sharp Minor Opus 3 No. 2 the previously mentioned Rachmaninoff 3 and Liszt's Sospiro and it is all quite stunning. Rush does the fingerings himself. One of the comments also claims that Helfgott's wife has Helfgott perform on no medication so that he'll seem crazy  it's common for performers on medication for mental problems to have to cycle off of it before performing. I don't think the commenter has any idea what Helfgot is like on his medication  certainly in the film he acts strangely.Shine is highly recommended for its fantastic performances beautiful music and its inspiring story.".

	schema:reviewBody "David is a stuttering rambling man having suffer a complete breakdown as a young man.  However when he was a child his skills on the piano were unmatched.  Driven by his father opportunities open up in front of him to go abroad to learn but his father denies him the chance.  He leaves for London where he drives himself to the point of exhaustion before coming back home to find his father has disowned him.It took me years to finally watch this film. I was still in Northern Ireland when it came out in the cinema and such films were not permitted to cross our borders lest they keep the latest action movies from our 1 or 2 screen cinemas!  So away from the hype and the Oscar hoopla I sat to watch this film and found myself easily taken in by it.  The story is the true story of David Helfgott who was a boy genius before his breakdown.  The film starts with him as an adult then jumps back to see him as a child.  This approach works well to allow us to see the end result' as it were before we see what would be considered the causation factors.  These factors are a little heart breaking to watch but they are very well delivered.  As an adult David is comic warming and tragic.  The pain in his life is brought out very well.A great deal of the praise for this must lie with the wonderful cast. Rush got his Oscar of course and I'll leave it to the users on the message boards to argue over whether or not you can be the lead actor with screen time of less than half the film!  He is great walking a difficult line with a disabled' character but managing not to just make it a caricature at any point.  David as a child is very well played by Rafalowicz and does more of the development work than Rush and hence gets less credit than he deserves for making us care for the adult David.  MuellerStahl is as good as he can be and gives a great performance the only downside being that he doesn't age a single day between the adult and child sections of the story  surely some makeup could have been used?Overall this is a very enjoyable human story that is driven by several really strong performances in key roles.  The story keeps it's tone light but yet still manages to be dramatic and in some scenes far too touching to avoid being slightly moved.  The music is beautiful when it is called on to be and dramatic at other times  the director does very well to make the intense music translate into intense scenes in the film.  Overall a simple story of a man but one that is interesting and a lot more moving that I expected it to be.".

Driven by his father opportunities open up in front of him to go abroad to learn but his father denies him the chance.  He leaves for London where he drives himself to the point of exhaustion before coming back home to find his father has disowned him.It took me years to finally watch this film.

	schema:reviewBody "I did some reading after this driven by idle curiosity about the account. The real Helfgott didn't spend 15 years abandoned in a room with a piano he didn't have to stand in the rain outside of a bar before they would let him in he was pretty well known in the local scene as a pianist his father was not a Holocaust survivor and David had been married before father and son were never really estranged and David was present at his funeral.But the 'objective' pointofview that purports to explain him or any of us at any time based on a few facts is in the end no less hypocritical than any attempt to pass dramatization as 'the real story'. This matters. Someone can be present at a funeral without being truly present and someone can feel forgotten and alone even when they're factually surrounded by people estranged from a parent even when formally this was never so.The film is at a simple emotional level where the attempt to conquer a maddening complexity music life snaps the tethers of mind and in due time the reconfiguring of this damage into blossoming art. The moral is that we must keep trying and hope for the best perhaps the worthiest lesson even if it appears slightly trite in the context of a more or less happy ending. Still why feel the need to invent all those things knowing you are doing nothing short of that? When the inflicted violence on the son could be inferred by a more ambiguous tension instead of an outright beating.Because it seems we can only choose to accept the lesson if at the center we find a good soul worthy of the saving. In other words it is not the fact that he gives a great last recital that matters but that he plays at all not that a genius was salvaged because he might never have been that but a human being. And this is what rankles so much Helfgott's piano critics who find him borderline incompetent in his playing  he is cheered on in concerts because he is the character from this film.Ideally we would be able to discern all these points here instead of one harmony the truly damaged but kind soul the inability to place blame for that damage on any ogre father or Holocaust and being able to somehow experience his music the real Helfgott recorded for the film as a trained ear would fixated flourishes followed by distraction and incompetence according to critics musically extending the damaged self.For a more demanding film on the same subject of madness and transcendent musical genius see a little known film on a medieval composer called Death in Five Voices all about the dissonance between different voices trying to harmonize a story and this carried in the music itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shine is one of the great movies of the '90's that became an unexpected success in 1996 and was the movie that earned Geoffrey Rush his as of yet only Oscar win and got the movie 6 more Oscar nominations including best director and best picture.The movie shows how Australian born David Helfgott gets formed and influenced in his early life by his demanding and abusive father wonderfuly played by Armin MuellerStahl who is in strict control of the family. He asks a lot from the already very unstable David and influences ever step in his life probably also to make up for his own shortcomings in life. He's an unpredictable character with two faces and you can really feel the fear he puts in the family and David in particular. Things go worse and worse mentally for David as he grows up and eventually goes to study in England at the Royal College of Music. He has a breakdown which for once and for all definitely labels him as a psychotic man. His personality could definitely been described as crazy.He gets perfectly and beautifully portrayed by Geoffrey Rush who truly deserved the Oscar he received for his role. But in fact he is only in the movie for perhaps halve the running time. For Shine uses lots of flashbacks about Helfgott's early life and as a young adult when he is being played by different actors. One of those actors is the know very well known Noah Taylor who also plays the part fine. Also really impressive is Armin MuellerStahl. He doesn't usually have very big parts in English spoken movies but in this movie he plays one of his bigger and more interesting roles. It's a true memorable performance from him and he also truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie. I keep thinking it's a great shame he got discovered so late by the bigmoney movie industry since he is already close to 80 by now which should mean that his biggest and greatest roles should already be behind him by now. But who knows some actors just go on forever till a very old age. Take for instance John Gielgud who also stars in this movie. At the time he was already well over 90 years old and he would continue to play on in many more great and big productions till his death in 2000. Some actors are just truly born as actors. It simply is in their blood and they can't stop playing.Moments in Helfgott's life are never portrayed too long but also never too short. This means that the story always comes right to the point and doesn't dance around it. The movie becomes very effective because of this and on top of that gets presented with a good steady pace. It's a reason why this movie is really one of the better autobiographic movies ever made. It's a really great directed and told movie from Scott Hicks.But of course like every good biopic the movie doesn't only presents facts and some things are altered in order to enhance the movie and its story or characters. For instance right after this movie the real Helfgott became a true full God while in all honesty David Helfgott is a great piano player but just not the genius one as portrayed in this movie. It's kind of like the piano man. The mysterious mute man who was found in Kent England in 2005. It was said he was a brilliant piano player while in fact he just simply knew how to play a piano well but was by no means a great or professional player. Just like David Helfgott it are just the unusual circumstances and character personalities that makes people say they are geniuses rather than it's an objective reflection of their actual qualities. But like I said this isn't anything unusual to do for a biopic to play around a little with the facts and it certainly is no objection when it actually enhances the movie. Shine truly benefits from its approach and story.I also enjoyed David Hirschfelder nice little musical score also Oscarnominated. Of course the movie also benefits from it's classical compositions that are being featured. It's of course a very musical movie since it's about the life of a musician but you really don't need a classic musical lover to enjoy or to appreciate this movie though.The movie ends quite abrupt and perhaps not satisfying enough but this is of course simply due to the fact that David Helfgot is still alive and active today. Who knows perhaps they could had better waited for another 30 years to come up with a movie about his life for who knows what more strange and beautiful moments his life shall know.Perhaps it's not the most stylish or greatest made movie but the combination of the interesting unique story pace and main character and of course Geoffrey Rush his performance of him are what makes this movie such a basically flawless you simply just forgive the movie for its flaws and shortcomings while you're watching it and captivating one to watch.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

So much so I was pretty much uncontrollably weeping much to the chagrin of the friend I went with.  Time has softened the film a lot for me but it still remains a powerful tender and somewhat inspirational film about a piano prodigy who has led a pretty tragic life.  Geoffrey Rush is unbelievable as the piano prodigy David Helfgott and although the film is kind of sewn up a little quickly with the Vanessa Redgrave subplot what about Helfgott made her so in love with him in a short period of time as to want to marry him? it is a very well done film that I highly recommend to just about anyone but especially musicians and music lovers.Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "That's a marvelous but cruel film. Cruel to us in its beauty. Cruel to David in his complete estrangement from the world of noise lost that he is in his world of music. How can you be deaf to anything but music? It is possible even if that sounds crazy if that is a mental lunacy. The film tries to get us to two conclusions. The first one is that a father can be right but only for a short while. A son has to get away from his father as soon as he can otherwise he might be destroyed utterly destroyed. In this case he is only mentally destroyed. He loses the sense of time and even space probably. Time does not exist any more which is not serious in itself many people can live without time. But duration goes away too and that is unbearable. When life does not have any duration any more it does not exist any longer and it becomes so static that it may drown you completely. David Helfgott is saved from his predicament first by one decision to go away from his father when he gets a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. Then by the phenomenal teacher he gets in London that accepts his decision to play Rachmaninoff in the Albert Hall what his father wanted him to play when he was still a child. The connection of the father and his curse the composer and his own predicament and his emotion that he projects into the music the place and his father's absence all that does it he loses the sound of the world though not of the music he loses the sense of duration and he falls into a complete vacuum a mental hospital. He will be taken out of it by a simple lady who plays the piano for the patients and then from this to that he will find a bar where he will be able to perform day after day and build a reputation that will attract people and one woman will accept to redeem him to life and marry him into a new career in the Albert Hall again for a second triumph this time with no escape possible from the stage and success. And that is the second lesson. When you run away from your father and you lose him in the process you lose any and all sense of reality that can only come back to you from inside and by accepting to bring that inside world of yours out. But you need some helping hands along the way helping hands you have to negotiate and find all by yourself. And David did it. The son of the super poor surviving Jew exiled in Australia after the war was able to reach the sky and be some kind of an angel up there in the sunrise dancing in mid air as if he were on a trampoline. This optimism is refreshing because we all know too many people who did not end up like that. For one of these victims of life that manages to get through so many will never even be able to raise their eyes and look at the stars.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush in a welldeserved Oscarwinning turn played Helfgott during his teenage and adult years. Armin MuellerStahl is also excellent as the abusive father in an Oscarnominated performance.  However the film stalls on several occasions.  This is bad considering that the film is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.  Lynn Redgrave's role is terrible she is totally wrong for this film.  Shine is a prime example of a near miss.

Scott Hicks' masterpiece is difficult to summarise in any traditional review or comment because it touches upon so many facets and ranges of human emotion. It is no surprise that this tale based 'loosely' on the life of pianist David Helfgott I say loosely because this is by no means a strict documentary as many liberties are taken with the script was nominated for the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars and were it not for THE English PATIENT would have walked away with the grand prize.Geoffrey Rush as the adult Helfgott is amazing and his Best Lead Actor victory for his portrayal of this musical genius was welldeserved as the performance was simply breathtaking. A popular complaint is that Rush was only on screen for less than half the runtime of the film and as such should not have really won. The counterargument is such it is the quality of the performance that counts not the screentime. Armin MullerStahl is equally impressive and deserved his nomination. My only gripe is that Noah Taylor was not given at least a nod for his portrayal of the younger Helfgott.The writing cinematography and musical score are topnotch and transform this Motion Picture from good to great. 810. 3.5 stars out of 4.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is inspired by the life of David Helfgott. The facts of Helfgott's life that seem to be beyond dispute are that he was a gifted pianist as a child and suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent that impaired him for life. In spite of his disorder that landed him in a mental hospital where he was administered Electroconvulsive therapy he has been able to perform first in a wine bar and then on the concert stage he has also made several recordings. Director Hicks admits that this is a partially fictionalized biography and there is dispute as to just how fictionalized it is. Helfgott's sister Margaret has published a book Out of Tune David Helfgott and the Myth of Shine that disputes much of what is in the movie particularly the portrayal of Peter the father. And if it is fictionalized why use the names of real people?Helfgott's story is indeed an interesting one but pursuing the real David Helfgott story should not be a consideration when evaluating this movie.The biggest problem I had was with the total disconnect between Helfgott's personality in the first half of the movie before his breakdown and the second half many years later. There is little hint of Helfgott's having mental problems before he collapses after his recital. I cannot believe that such a dramatic personalitychanging emotional disorder can be precipitated by a single event as implied. There had to be warning signs and I felt it was unfair to spring this on us simply for dramatic effect. The extreme transformation from a rather serious likable reserved youth to a completely different manchild who loves to hug people and babble incoherently I found unbelievable.The nature of David's mental illness is never explored and that left me at a loss in trying to understanding the man. Helfgott's troubled relationship with his father is implicated in his breakdown as is his intense preparation for a performance of the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3. But lots of people have troubled family dynamics and most every person who embarks on a professional career has moments of extreme stress and they don't come close to David's reaction as seen in this movie. I find the suggestion that strictly external events caused David's breakdown to be disservice to what is known about mental illnesses. Clearly there was a ticking time bomb in David's brain just waiting to be set off.While studying the Rachmaninov at The Royal College of Music in London David's mentor Cecil Parkes makes the comments Performing's a risk you knowno safety net. Make no mistake David. It's dangerous. People get hurt. Also Helfgott's father has made the comment that the Rachmaninov 3rd Piano Concerto is the hardest piece in the world which is simply not true. The concerto is indeed a difficult one but no more so than dozens of other classical pieces and it should be within the abilities of a prodigy in late adolescence. Parkes and Helfgott's father make the decision to perform the Rachmaninov Concerto out to be a life or death venture that only a few who attempt it survivethis makes for dramatic tension at the expense of the truth.David's father Peter is presented as having a controlling love for his son. Interspersed with some tenderness on Peter's part are episodes of his perpetrating mental and physical abuse. When David has the opportunity to study in America Peter prohibits it. Later when David announces he is going to London Peter tries to prevent it and when David says he is going anyway Peter tells him that if he leaves he will never be allowed back in the house. Peter's behavior makes little sensehe wants his son to succeed in the worst way but seems bent on preventing that from happening. When Peter tells his son that No one will love you like me I would think David's response would be I certainly hope so.There are a lot of little bothersome things. Like the first scene that has David as an adult showing up in the rain late at night at a wine bar that has just closed for the evening. Ignoring discouragement David keeps knocking until the proprietor comes to the door and she quickly adopts the attitude of Oh come in we love you. Hardly a believable reaction to a crazy person appearing at your door speaking in an incomprehensible staccato.When as a child David is playing a part of the Rachmaninov Concerto from what he has heard on a recording his father sends him off to bed and amazingly then picks up a score for the concerto that just happens to be on the top of the piano. Wouldn't David have looked at that score if he were really interested in learning it?Geoffrey Rush runs around trying his best to make the adult David out to be a mad but lovable genius. This is the type of flashy role that wins Oscars and Rush did. For my money Noah Taylor as the adolescent David is the one who shines. John Gielgud as David's London mentor is delightful as usual. Armin MuellerStahl as David's father creates a believable selftormented character in his Oscarnominated performance. Lynn Redgrave is fine as David's wife.I came away feeling that this movie was disguising what could be a truly interesting story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a nice story but it is very troubling how the movie suggests that David's mental state which is obviously schizophrenia is somehow cause by his father's abuse. Schizophrenia is an organic brain illness. No one know exactly what causes it but it is not caused by parental abuse. It seems that nearly every summary of the movie states outright that David's father creates David's nervous breakdown. This belief takes us right back to Freudian psychology of the 1950s when the belief was that schizophrenia was a reaction to refrigerator mothers. The movie A Beautiful Mind was more realistic in depicting how schizophrenia strikes seemingly out of nowhere and is a diabolically difficult disease to ameliorate in any way. It is a disservice to all of us to suggest otherwise. Again it's enjoyable to be swept along in the story but if you take away the premise about the cause and cure of Helfgott's illness the movie feels a little hollow.".

David after winning countless tournaments is eventually offered a scholarship to study in an American music institution and it is his father's reluctance to let him go that sparks the rivalry that draws them apart.

The story was interesting and the cinematography well done. Overall it was a good film but it had a few glaring issues I cannot overlook.First if we are to feel sympathy or understanding for Helfgott's condition it would be nice to know exactly what it is.  Is he schizophrenic?  Not sure.  I find the label of madness to be far too vague and nearly clich.Second as a little research on Helfgott confirms the filmmakers were not accurate in many aspects of the story.  According to his own family Helfgott never broke down while playing the Rach 3 nor was his father an abusive taskmaster.Third there were just too many confusing andor vague moments throughout the film.  There was a scene of David receiving electroconvulsive therapy at one point with absolutely no explanation of what was going on.  His relationship with his father once he left home was confusing at best. Similarly Gillian tried to help David write a letter to his old music professor but we never heard any more about that either.  Loose ends and apparently superfluous scenes made the film sometimes hard to follow and left me with an empty feeling at the end.Lastly I take issue with the implication that overbearing parents and intense mental and emotional labor can lead one to mental illness. Schizophrenia in particular is not something caused by your relationships or activities.  It is organic.  Things can't drive you mad in that sense. Certainly parents can cause mental and emotional damage but if that was goal of the film it should have been more clear.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhat reminiscent in the basic story at least of A Beautiful Mind Shine offers a take on the story of Australian pianist David Helfgott. I understand that there's debate on the accuracy of the film both in terms of Helfgott's background and his piano playing skill. Knowing nothing of his background and little of the skills needed to play the piano I'll choose to avoid the controversy and deal simply with the movie. It started off very strongly. The first half offered a powerful exploration of Helfgott's childhood at the hands of a domineering father as well as a look at the early indications of both his abilities as a pianist and the first hints of mental illness. It was a little bit slow paced but interesting nonetheless. Something happened though at the point at which David seemed to go truly insane after his Rachmaninoff recital. The movie itself seemed to lose its focus at that point and it became what seemed to me to be a largely unconnected series of events offering a taste but not much more of Helfgott's later life in a rush which was far less interesting than the first half. Geoffrey Rush was truly excellent as Helfgott as was Alex Rafalowicz who played Helfgott as a child. I was also impressed with Armin MuellerStahl's performance as Helfgott's father. The character of Gillian played by Lynn Redgrave who became Helfgott's wife seemed to be introduced far too quickly and I had no idea how they ended up suddenly married. Redgrave did well with the part but there was little substance to the character. As far as I recall there was also no mention of the fact that Helfgott had been previously married.The comparatively weaker second half pulled this down a fair bit in my estimation. In the end I'd say it was OK but not much more than that. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the many user reviews I think it's great that the movie has made more people appreciate Rachmaninoff's music. And I'm glad this movie made people appreciate how fragile the mental psyche can be. I had some challenges though getting past the basic premise of the movie.It has been proved medically that a traumatic event or series of traumatic events occurring close together can trigger a build up of serotonin or other chemical that can cause in a highly susceptible individual what would have been called  in those days  a mental breakdown.But the movie shows such ranging symptoms and treatments it's difficult to understand exactly what happened. Maybe the symptoms changed from adolescence to adulthood? It was like night and day. I would have liked to have understood what happened better and lacking that information I found the inconsistent symptoms distracting.I'm sure many will disagree but I also have to say many of the children born to WWII survivors and veterans grew up in what would be considered inappropriate or volatile households today. Counseling came in the form of a casserole in those days. The WWII survivors are the lost generation  growing up in an atmosphere of war and terrible fear  and often themselves just a bit mental after all they had been through. As a result with corporal punishment considered the norm an overbearing WWII veteransurvivor parent was not unusual. What was unusual was how the child reacted.... if the child was predisposed to mental fragility and broke down. I have no quibble with the acting although I think Noah did the lion's share of the emotional scenes while Geoffrey did the virtuoso scenes so I'm not sure who deserved the Oscar more all were excellent. The filming was lush the music was quite good. I have gotten to the point where I just want to hear Sir John read the phone book and I'll gush adoringly. Lyn was awesome Nicholas Bell was excellent Armin was great.If the script has just given a bit more detail provided a bit better understanding I might have been less distracted and more supportive of the character. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie as a whole because I could not understand the character.".

I would have liked to have understood what happened better and lacking that information I found the inconsistent symptoms distracting.I'm sure many will disagree but I also have to say many of the children born to WWII survivors and veterans grew up in what would be considered inappropriate or volatile households today. Counseling came in the form of a casserole in those days. The WWII survivors are the lost generation  growing up in an atmosphere of war and terrible fear  and often themselves just a bit mental after all they had been through. As a result with corporal punishment considered the norm an overbearing WWII veteransurvivor parent was not unusual. What was unusual was how the child reacted.... if the child was predisposed to mental fragility and broke down. I have no quibble with the acting although I think Noah did the lion's share of the emotional scenes while Geoffrey did the virtuoso scenes so I'm not sure who deserved the Oscar more all were excellent. The filming was lush the music was quite good. I have gotten to the point where I just want to hear Sir John read the phone book and I'll gush adoringly. Lyn was awesome Nicholas Bell was excellent Armin was great.If the script has just given a bit more detail provided a bit better understanding I might have been less distracted and more supportive of the character. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie as a whole because I could not understand the character.";

	schema:reviewBody "Grave Robbers! Black Masses! Indian Guru! Masked Murderer! Voodoo Doll! Ritual Sacrifice! Evil Twin! Chicken Decapitation! Gleeful Undead!  a horned Satan who drinks blood from a golden chalice!!! All to a 1972 lounge soundtrack! This movie is totally awesomely hilarious! The makeup is pretty OK except that Satan stole the lead's eyebrows! and the costumes and even effects are unexpectedly good but the soundtrack is mostly pretty inappropriate my favourite example of this is when the music is all relaxed jazz while one guy gets an axe to the face. The film quality is pretty much what you expect mediocre to bad. I won't bother to summarize the plot because unlike many of the bad seventies movies I've been watching lately  and this is surely their queen  the plot is unusually clear apart from the role of the bus driver. What the hell was that guy up to and how did he know anything about the secret voodoo plot anyway?? ...I also suspect that the guru Krishna must have some kind of hypnotic gaze as the only explanation why the lead would fall into bed with him I'm afraid the lure of the exotic is entirely mitigated by the pudginess and boot polish. But it has some fabulous scenes my favourite by far being the initial Satan dream sequence. It has a meat factory scene and while I'm sure PETA and the SPCA would have some severe reprimands for the producers about the whole chicken sacrifice deal you've gotta admire their chutzpah in being that 'authentic' although obviously anyone who is sensitive to these things at all will hate it... however I doubt you will be watching something called Revenge of the Zombies if you are that sensitive!.I love that the 'good guys' have a portrait of the queen on the wall to prove their britishness!  their accents are totally not enough convince alone! Favourite Quote You will be food for our Lord Satan! He is waiting waiting!!! This movie is clearly terrible but I completely loved it. It is total schlock but I found the way it keeps changing its focus and bringing in new themes engaging rather than confusing or stilted. You should definitely NOT watch this if you don't 'get' old bad horrors or if you are not prepared to see a chicken getting its head cut off it's actually not that bad  no closeups or violent blood spray the cutthroat scene is more gory but otherwise it is really surprisingly enjoyable to watch especially with a few drinks and low expectations. Come on you know how bad it's gonna be as soon as you see the blooddripping title! Get ready to mock and be shocked.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vengeance of the Zombies 1973  out of 4 Bizarre but mildly entertaining Spanish horror film has Paul Naschy playing a mystic who uses his powers to have women return from the dead and kill his enemies for him.Sometimes a second viewing can make you see a film in a completely different light. The first time I watched Leon Klimovsky's VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES it was from a public domain disc and the colors were drained. I gave the film a BOMB rating because I just found the entire thing to be deadly dull poorly made and at times laughable. What changed on this second viewing? Well being able to see a fully restored print certainly helped but I also managed to enjoy the film a lot more because I knew what I was getting into.If you're expecting George A. Romero type of zombies then you're getting into the wrong movie. The zombies here basically just have some face paint on them but I found them to be mildly effective and especially with the light blue tint and how well it looked on the restored print. Another plus were the slowmotion scenes of the zombies approaching their victims. I usually can't stand when slowmotion is used but here it's actually quite effective. The gore isn't all that high but there are a couple gory scenes including a bizarre one where a can is used as a murder weapon! Fans of Naschy will be happy to see him playing three different roles here. The scene with him wearing horns as a Satanic leader is certainly an eyeopener and for the most part he's good. The supporting women are all beautiful as you'd expect in a Naschy film. There are certainly some flaws here including the pacing of the picture as well as the rather bizarre soundtrack. I'm not sure if this soundtrack was used to make the film appear hip but it's quite distracting to say the least.".

The first time I watched Leon Klimovsky's VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES it was from a public domain disc and the colors were drained. I gave the film a BOMB rating because I just found the entire thing to be deadly dull poorly made and at times laughable. What changed on this second viewing? Well being able to see a fully restored print certainly helped but I also managed to enjoy the film a lot more because I knew what I was getting into.If you're expecting George A. Romero type of zombies then you're getting into the wrong movie. The zombies here basically just have some face paint on them but I found them to be mildly effective and especially with the light blue tint and how well it looked on the restored print. Another plus were the slowmotion scenes of the zombies approaching their victims. I usually can't stand when slowmotion is used but here it's actually quite effective. The gore isn't all that high but there are a couple gory scenes including a bizarre one where a can is used as a murder weapon! Fans of Naschy will be happy to see him playing three different roles here. The scene with him wearing horns as a Satanic leader is certainly an eyeopener and for the most part he's good. The supporting women are all beautiful as you'd expect in a Naschy film. There are certainly some flaws here including the pacing of the picture as well as the rather bizarre soundtrack. I'm not sure if this soundtrack was used to make the film appear hip but it's quite distracting to say the least.";

	schema:reviewBody "Opinions on Len Klimovsky's La Rebelin De Las Muertas aka. Vengeance of the Zombies 1973 are obviously split. While some regard the film as utter crap many of my fellow Paul Naschy fans seem to regard it as a particularly bizarre highlight in the Spanish Horror icon's filmography. As a more and more enthusiastic of Paul Naschy I must say that my feelings on this one are somewhat mixed. On the one hand Vengeance of the Zombies is probably even THE weirdest film I've ever seen Naschy in and weirdness is a quality his films generally have and therefore highly recommendable to all his fans. On the other hand it is undeniable that the film tends to get very tedious inbetween which is rare with Naschy films. While Naschy films are not usually 'good' in a traditional sense they are almost always vastly entertaining and have a genuine inimitable charm. Naschy often wrote the screenplays and stories for his films himself as he did for this one. Director Len Klimovsky is doubtlessly best known for a film that is probably also Naschy's most famous one La Noche De Walpurgis aka. Werewolf vs. Vampire Women of 1971 with Naschy in his most famous role of Werewolf Waldemar Daninsky whom he played thirteen times.Vengeance of the Zombies has an entirely nonlinear structure and mostly makes little sense but in many parts the film is just a delight to watch. Naschy fans will be delighted that the master plays a triplerole in this one  as an Indian Guru a Satanic Voodoo Master and Satan himself. The film includes countless elements that my fellow cultcinema fans will love resurrection of the dead Voodoo Zombies Satan black masses and even murders that were clearly inspired by the Italian Giallo. The gore effects are pretty nasty and wellmade in this one. Yet the barely existent structure of the film often makes it hard to keep watching inbetween the good parts. The film is about resurrecting the dead and using them as Zombie slaves for sinister goals but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. Watching Naschy in three roles is awesome although an Indian Guru is probably the least credible role imaginable for him. The female cast is beautiful to look at especially Romy as the main protagonist and the Argentinian beauty Mirta Miller who plays the Guru's Indian girlfriend. The funky soundtrack seems terribly out of place for an occult Horror film like this one but then again it underlines the amusing 'camp' factor. Vengeance of the Zombies is a hard movie for me to rate. On the one hand it is impossible not to love it for its awesome absurdity. Then again this is overall the only tedious Naschy film I have seen. Overall I recommend this film to my fellow Paul Naschy fans yet I definitely prefer seeing him in the roles of murderous hunchbacks deranged graveyard personnel werewolves or satanic medieval knights. My opinion on Vengeance of the Zombies 5.510".

As with almost everything Franco did this director obviously had the knowhow to create a decent film but he couldn't be bothered to go back and polish all the rough parts. And the movie seems to be nothing but rough parts all the way through. The result is like watching the rushes for a talented neighbor's home movies for a script he hacked out in a day if your neighbor had a photogenic wife like Rommy and a 35mm camera. The plot is completely lurid which actually part of the movie's charm. It starts out with a masked guy very Phantom Of the Opera reviving dead women as zombies to do his bidding which mostly involved strangling people who obligingly just stand there and let them get on with it. I have to admit that the make up on the zombies is pretty effective and one of the real reasons to watch the movie. At least that's the opening scene. And before you know it the plot has become a freeway pileup of Indian mysticism serial murder topless women stylized slow motion assaults zombies of course Satanism ritual sacrifices hallucinatory nightmares...have I left anything out? Oh yeah all done to a swinging heavy jazz soundtrack that starts a new theme every two or three minutes stops in the middle of a musical phrases whenever a scene ends and in general seems to have nothing to do with the action on the screen.The DVD print I saw part of a Drive In Movie Classics 50 pack was awful it was a full screen pan and scan but managed to consistently leave out one or all of the actors in a given shot instead giving us revealing shots of the middle of the set.And mixing for the sound was apparently done in the bottom of a steel barrel. The overall sound managed to be muddy but was nevertheless so shrill and tinny that I was afraid it might make the neighborhood dogs start to howl. This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era  the dialog is still stilted and clumsy but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio. And again the jazz music was mostly very sprightly and vivid  sort of the stuff you'd hear in a TV commercial for the new model Lamborghini or something it would have been nice to hear it the way it was performed. My guess is that someone in production intentionally mixed things to sound best coming out of the speakers at a drivein movie. Either that or they hated us and wanted us to bleed from the ears and die in torment. So yes it's a mess. But somehow it's an enjoyable mess if only for the ambition of the lead actor who casts himself in three different parts and the director who tries to mix three or four different horror genres in one screenplay and some hard working supporting actors who try their best to give the proceedings some dignity. Do NOT pay money to see this unless it's part of a collection. If you pay more than 5 to own a DVD of this movie by itself you will probably be looking around for a throat to slit when it is over.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining Euro sleaze";
	schema:reviewBody "Vengeance of the Zombies is one of the more enjoyable European horror films of the time.SPOILERSSpeaking in London cult leader Krisna Paul Naschy performs with his companion Kala Mirta Miller their usual Middle Eastern philosophy. When Lawrence Victor Alcazar and his girlfriend Elvira Irving Romy attend one ceremony she suddenly succumbs to weird visions of deceased relatives and opts to take a trip away to clear herself at their house out in the countryside. While back in London he stumbles upon a murder mystery while trying to study about cults where the victims are drained of blood and offered up as a sacrifice allowing the deceased to come back as voodoodriven zombies to do the bidding of their master. Racing to find the master he tries to put a stop to it before an evil voodoo sorcerer uses them for his own nefarious plans.The Good News This here isn't all that bad and certainly has some good points. The mixmash of genres present in this one a strong point which gets some points for it. The fact that it manages to do so offers up some creativity that might not be apparent to some. The supernatural elements brought on from the black mass rituals are really creepy and genuinely unnerving helped in no small part by their attention to detail and authentic feel. The first one where witnessing a participant dressed headtotoe in gold paint with stoic figures around the back watching a Devilfigure drink blood from a horn shaped like a human leg all set to a jazz score is something to remember. The later scenes carry just as much impact and a sequence in the morgue that features a wax voodoo doll filled with blood and set on fire where the dead sit up under the sheets behind them offers a great visual and the later mass ritual is something to behold in it's impressiveness. The slasher aspects here get the majority of the blood and gore in their kills as a victim is forced to slit their throat a hatchet is buried in the face a bottle opens a big bloody wound on the neck a knife stabbed in the back and the film's big highlight where an approached figure is revealed to have been decapitated upon touching. It's a nice shock and looks really impressive. Even the killer looks great as the use of voodoo to do some of them is really original and adds a nice touch. The zombie plot allows for some nice makeup effects as the zombies look suitably dead without the justkilled look. The fact that they're draped in gowns and come completely with demonic grins is even more appreciated and a spectacular scene as they massacre a group in a cemetery at night is all Gothic brilliance. The several dreams are creepy as well adding in another flavor to the film and altogether makes this one really interesting and watchable.The Bad News This one here does have a couple of mild flaws. The fact that it mixes everything together and uses so many different ideas and themes is something that can cause confusion and annoyance in some. The slasher story set inside the DevilWorshiping cult story is one that stands out mainly for being as confusing as it is hard to explain the need for it. It adds to the body count and provides some blood and gore to the film but it really feels like it belongs in another film and really taken the time to be explored and thought out more.

	onyx:emotionText "Vengeance of the Zombies is one of the more enjoyable European horror films of the time.SPOILERSSpeaking in London cult leader Krisna Paul Naschy performs with his companion Kala Mirta Miller their usual Middle Eastern philosophy. When Lawrence Victor Alcazar and his girlfriend Elvira Irving Romy attend one ceremony she suddenly succumbs to weird visions of deceased relatives and opts to take a trip away to clear herself at their house out in the countryside. While back in London he stumbles upon a murder mystery while trying to study about cults where the victims are drained of blood and offered up as a sacrifice allowing the deceased to come back as voodoodriven zombies to do the bidding of their master. Racing to find the master he tries to put a stop to it before an evil voodoo sorcerer uses them for his own nefarious plans.The Good News This here isn't all that bad and certainly has some good points. The mixmash of genres present in this one a strong point which gets some points for it. The fact that it manages to do so offers up some creativity that might not be apparent to some. The supernatural elements brought on from the black mass rituals are really creepy and genuinely unnerving helped in no small part by their attention to detail and authentic feel. The first one where witnessing a participant dressed headtotoe in gold paint with stoic figures around the back watching a Devilfigure drink blood from a horn shaped like a human leg all set to a jazz score is something to remember. The later scenes carry just as much impact and a sequence in the morgue that features a wax voodoo doll filled with blood and set on fire where the dead sit up under the sheets behind them offers a great visual and the later mass ritual is something to behold in it's impressiveness. The slasher aspects here get the majority of the blood and gore in their kills as a victim is forced to slit their throat a hatchet is buried in the face a bottle opens a big bloody wound on the neck a knife stabbed in the back and the film's big highlight where an approached figure is revealed to have been decapitated upon touching. It's a nice shock and looks really impressive. Even the killer looks great as the use of voodoo to do some of them is really original and adds a nice touch. The zombie plot allows for some nice makeup effects as the zombies look suitably dead without the justkilled look. The fact that they're draped in gowns and come completely with demonic grins is even more appreciated and a spectacular scene as they massacre a group in a cemetery at night is all Gothic brilliance. The several dreams are creepy as well adding in another flavor to the film and altogether makes this one really interesting and watchable.The Bad News This one here does have a couple of mild flaws. The fact that it mixes everything together and uses so many different ideas and themes is something that can cause confusion and annoyance in some. The slasher story set inside the DevilWorshiping cult story is one that stands out mainly for being as confusing as it is hard to explain the need for it. It adds to the body count and provides some blood and gore to the film but it really feels like it belongs in another film and really taken the time to be explored and thought out more. The zombie plot is the most puzzling since they follow up on the more traditional version rather than the raging flesheating kind more commonly known and their appearance as that kind will no doubt be something that will be hard pressed to get over for some. The fight sequence is incredibly bad looking too staged for it's own good and comes across as foolish.

More people are due to die thanks to the machinations of the powermad villain who indulges in elaborate voodoo rituals.Naschy certainly did better than this during the 1970s for example this viewer holds Horror Rises from the Tomb and Inquisition in higher regard yet Vengeance of the Zombies IS a fun flick. It's far more cheesy than scary with an unfortunate lack of true atmosphere a comparatively lightweight plot and a music score that just doesn't work most of the time. It's much too jaunty and jazzy to fit this material.Eurohorror aficionados will still enjoy the sex  violent quotient and the cast is enjoyable. Romy is a rather stiff but not entirely unsympathetic lead Victor Barrera is okay as her good friend Mirta Miller and Maria Kosty are devilish fun Luis Ciges is a hoot as a character named MacMurdo and Antonio Pica has a solid presence as a Scotland Yard superintendent named Hawkins. Naschy of course is great value as always likeable as Krisna nasty as the villain and a typically grandiose Satan. The ladies playing the zombies do appear to be having a good time they don't stalk around looking for human flesh to munch on basically just doing our villains' bidding.Overall a diverting but largely forgettable feature.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe that Paul Naschy horror films are generally good because Paul himself was a big fan of horror. Plus it helps that he scripted a lot of his own films so what you usually get is the old classic monster movies updated to the seventies with added gore and nudity and very little waffle. Or you could say he takes the Hammer template and dispenses with the boring bits. One of those two. I guess in a normal world the fact that Paul blacks up for this film would be offensive but if it was a genuine Indian person playing the role it would be Paul Naschy! It's still much less offensive that Peter Sellers doing it as Paul isn't sending up the Indian race at all but merely making some sort of statement about how white folks will follow anyone claiming to be a guru even if they also are possibly Voodoo zombie masters at the same time. Now that I've written that he's possibly playing an Indian Voodoo Guru I think there might not be any social commentary there at all. I'm getting dizzy thinking about it.Anyway one particular possible follower for Paul's Krishna character is Elvira who is looking for some spiritual guidance. Her pal Yorgen I can't remember his name is very sceptical about it all even following a demonstration when Krishna's assistant who is jealous of Elvira starts stabbing Krishna in the back without subsequence. At the same time someone in London is draining blood from men killing women and bringing them back to life as zombies. When someone in a mask breaks into Elvira's house and kills her father and cousin she runs off to the countryside to live with Krishna which might not be the best idea. Who else is wearing that mask and a cloak with a build like that  Sandy Toksvig?This is all heading in the direction you'd expect but then Paul does throw in a couple of curveballs that take things off in different directions. What I really could have done without is the blatant beheading of a chicken for voodoo purposes. Not cool Paul not cool. This also happened in Boris Karloff film The Snake People which has a similar voodoo plot. However the Satan nightmare sequence was great! As were the Hidehi 'you have been watching' style end credits so we'll call it a draw.No point in telling anyone if this is good or bad. If you're going to watch a Paul Naschy film you'll know what to expect anyway. Please note that the zombies here are pastyfaced women wearing black robes and not rotting corpses.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fairly typical Paul Naschy vehicle with a muddled plot. In my opinion this is an average genre film for Naschy although those who aren't fans of the Spanish horror stalwart's work may want to knock a star off the rating here because I'm inclined to enjoy his films however silly they may be. VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES is a mixed bag dragged down by Leon Klimovsky's unusually bland point the camera and shoot style of direction enlivened by a few arty touches like having the zombies move in slowmotion and the like. As with THE MUMMY'S REVENGE this is a film which sees Naschy merely going through the motions rather than setting a trend with SHADOW OF THE WEREWOLF.Naschy plays cult leader Harry Krishna a longhaired muscular dude who sits around meditating in a spooky old mansion while his Indian house servant looks on sinisterly. The film is set in London and England incidentally although it doesn't look like it for a second which gives ample opportunity for Klimovsky to throw in some stock footage of red London buses and the like. Amusingly there's also a bad soundtrack which mixes jazz with bizarre singing which is good for a laugh. Meanwhile the female lead the actress going only by the singular name of Romy looking for a quiet retreat goes to live in Naschy's house and ends up falling in love with the weird one. She also has a macabre dream sequence of a black mass taking place in the basement of the house which gives the evergleeful Naschy the opportunity to dress up as a horned demon.Meanwhile to keep the plot spicy a series of giallolike gore murders are being committed in London by a mysterious figure who goes through a succession of jokeshop fright masks. Could it be Naschy? I won't say but the plot is about the use of the power of voodoo to bring the dead back to life and hypnosis into helping people carry out diabolical plans. Which leads me to the zombies  they certainly manage to make the film atmospheric but as screen scaries they're a bit of a disappointment being just women in white makeup with no other sign that they're dead.Klimovsky inserts liberal scenes of sex and violence axes go into heads numerous throats are slit graphically to try and keep the viewer's interest going but all in all it's a bit of a muddled film which didn't exactly fill me with joy although like most Spanish Gothic films it's more than watchable. My favourite moment comes when the heroine not exactly memorable as heroines go goes to see an old woman whose head then proceeds to slowly fall off to one side blood spurting out. Unfortunately the genuinely creepy moments  like a shot of a dead body hanging amid the carcasses of slaughtered livestock in a freezer  are abandoned in favour of more predictable inyourface shocks and fright scenes.".

Naschy was known to often mix genre staples eg. werewolves against vampires but I'm not sure what he was going for in invoking that particular barbarity.The film is overall more a giallo than a typical zombie flick with a masked man dressed in black sneaking around killing to a psychedelic soundtrack.

The way this movie was made out it sounded like it may be good as they made it out to be quite disturbing on the back of the package and on the description used at amazon. Suffice to say the only thing really disturbing about this piece is the fact it seems they killed a chicken on screen for the film. The film was very reminiscent of another European horror called Scream and Scream again in that it had a lot of plot points coming together at the end. This film is a bit easier to follow than that one but that one was by far a more enjoyable flick.The story opens up with a couple that are going to rob a tomb. Why? Who knows as these people are just in the film to show us the awesome power of the strange man who can summon the dead to do his bidding. A couple watch a show featuring a man from India showing an audience his ability to control his body. Meanwhile more killings take place the female that watched the show is attacked her father murdered and she goes to the spiritualist's house that also happens to be a place where ritualistic killings were performed in the name of Satan. The killer seems to have a strange motive and is not working alone and the female is falling in love with the spiritualist while her boyfriend tries to find a reason for the killings. He suggests to the police it is voodoo and that they are dealing with zombies and the police are more accepting of this theory than one would think they would be.Just a bit much going on but it keeps your brain entertained as they flash here and there throughout the film. About the only thing the film has going for it as the kills are okay and the story falls apart at the end as a character that had not been established at all becomes all to integral to the plot. The lead female is an attractive redhead and is the focus for a lot of the film but she disappears for a large bit as does the man that was her boyfriend. Meanwhile I am left wondering what was so shocking about this film? Perhaps it is the fact that the one redhead saw a woman's head fall off and then it is ten minutes later and she is seducing the object of her affection. I did not see that coming I would think a person's head coming off would put one out of the mood for a bit longer!".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought just for a change I'd watch a Paul Naschy film where he doesn't spout fangs prosthetic hair and tear throats out . Also I needed a much needed reminder of what zombies were like back in the day . Nowadays post 28 DAYS LATER is someone who ha been infected by a virus with an incubation period of seconds that causes the character to lose all self awareness and have one overriding instinct to kill or infect the uninfected To be fair to VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES it does follow the folklore of myth where a zombie is literally a reanimated corpse who is controlled by a shaman  it's churlish to complain that they're too slow moving to be much of a threat and to give the film some credit the make up of the undead is effectively understated . Likewise the plot isn't too predictable . After all if Nsschy is playing an Indian guru then you instantly expect him to be the villain and ... well yes and no without giving too much away . He does give a good performance as Krishna and I take it that it's not Nschy's own voice being used in the dubbing but the calm and lack of inflexion does seem suited to the character What let's the film down is the intrusive and totally inappropriate score . The establishing shot of London  Incidentally the same establishing shot was inserted in to THE WEREWOLF AND THE YETI  contains a soundtrack best described as a sort of hybrid dirge between psychadelia and a big band sound . I know it's supposed to give a feel of swinging London and sounds more someone hanging from a piano wire noose . Every time there's a supposedly scary scene totally inappropriate music blasts out robbing any scene of potential atmosphere which does defeat the purpose of the exercise . As it stands it's a fair horror film with old style zombies but could have been much better".

	onyx:emotionText "I thought just for a change I'd watch a Paul Naschy film where he doesn't spout fangs prosthetic hair and tear throats out . Also I needed a much needed reminder of what zombies were like back in the day . Nowadays post 28 DAYS LATER is someone who ha been infected by a virus with an incubation period of seconds that causes the character to lose all self awareness and have one overriding instinct to kill or infect the uninfected To be fair to VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES it does follow the folklore of myth where a zombie is literally a reanimated corpse who is controlled by a shaman  it's churlish to complain that they're too slow moving to be much of a threat and to give the film some credit the make up of the undead is effectively understated . Likewise the plot isn't too predictable . After all if Nsschy is playing an Indian guru then you instantly expect him to be the villain and ... well yes and no without giving too much away . He does give a good performance as Krishna and I take it that it's not Nschy's own voice being used in the dubbing but the calm and lack of inflexion does seem suited to the character What let's the film down is the intrusive and totally inappropriate score . The establishing shot of London  Incidentally the same establishing shot was inserted in to THE WEREWOLF AND THE YETI  contains a soundtrack best described as a sort of hybrid dirge between psychadelia and a big band sound . I know it's supposed to give a feel of swinging London and sounds more someone hanging from a piano wire noose . Every time there's a supposedly scary scene totally inappropriate music blasts out robbing any scene of potential atmosphere which does defeat the purpose of the exercise . As it stands it's a fair horror film with old style zombies but could have been much better";

	schema:reviewBody "Although definitely a bit dated this film overall isn't a bad entry into the zombie genre. Focusing on voodoo this movie is about a man who is obsessed with vengeance on certain families who have made him pay for wrongs committed by him earlier. So he turns to voodoo and exacts his revenge by killing certain members of these families and recreating them as zombies. Admittedly the plot is somewhat slow to develop and the acting is barely adequate. Additionally the fight sequences are laughable and the makeup and filming technique are clearly a product of its time late60's and early70's when it comes to this particular style of horror. But I have always enjoyed horror movies from this era and this is no exception. Likewise the addition of some sexy ladies like Carmen Romero Elvire Irving and Mirta Miller Kala certainly didn't hurt this picture in any way. Now that is not to say that everyone who enjoys zombie movies will like this film. Again sometimes it helps to have been alive during this period in order to appreciate movies of this era. That said this is a decent films for those who can make allowances for its obvious flaws and shortcomings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Psychotronicfilm buffs who watch the Paul Naschy films Crimson 1973 and The Hanging Woman also 1973 may come away feeling a bit shortchanged regarding the amount of screen time allotted to the socalled Boris Karloff of Spain. In the first Naschy plays a jewel thief who has been shot in the head following a botched robbery and thus lays in a near coma for the film's first hour while awaiting a brain transplant in the second he plays a necrophilic grave digger whose screen time is brief in the extreme. No such drawbacks for the eager Naschyphile crop up in Leon Klimovsky's Vengeance of the Zombies 1973 again...quite a year for Paul! fortunately in fact in this one Spain's leading horror icon plays no less than three 3! roles and is marvelous in all of them. In the film a rash of killings has begun in modernday London perpetrated it is soon discovered by a quartet of recently resurrected women whose interred bodies had recently gone missing. When Elvire Irving played by an actress only listed as Rommy is almost slain by the zombie of her recently departed cousin she hightails it to the country estate of her Indian guru Krisna Naschy 1 soon to be joined by her psychologist boyfriend Lawrence Redgrave Vic Winner who had also costarred that same year with Naschy in the excellent film Hunchback of the Morgue. But as it turns out even this escape to the pastoral village of Llangwell is not sufficient to separate Elvire from the ghastly zombie predations or the schemes of Krisna's burntfaced brother Kantaka Naschy 2....Basically a giallo film with large doses of the supernatural stirred in VOTZ gives us a masked killer utilizing a small band of the female undead to do his bidding as well as numerous other homicidal tricks. It features a nicely complex story line courtesy of screenwriter Naschy to keep the viewer guessing and a few genuine surprises toward its conclusion. The picture contains any number of startling moments most notably a dream sequence in which Elvire meets the Devil himself played byyou guessed itNaschy 3 and the quartet of pastyfaced slowmoving zombie gals really is quite eerie to behold. For the dedicated gorehounds out there VOTZ should also prove quite pleasing boasting as it does a battered bloody face a hatchet in the head a hanging a throat impalement several garrotings assorted knifings death by beer can ! a throat slitting a decapitation a crucifix stabbing andperhaps worst of allthe beheading of an actual chicken during a voodoo ceremony as in Hunchback of the Morgue with its live rats on fire an animal WAS apparently harmed during the making of this picture!. The film makes excellent use of its London locales it was also shot in Navacerrada and Torrelodones Spain both sites being northwest of Madrid and spotlights the most strikinglooking goldpainted woman since a certain 007 movie from 1964. That's the good news. The bad news is the film's unfortunate soundtrack from Juan Carlos Calderon a funkfusion blend seemingly more apropos for a blaxploitation action flick starring Fred Williamson or Pam Grier. The juxtaposition of zombie risings with this funky junk seemed highly inappropriate to me almost non sequituras it did apparently for many other viewers as well. Still Calderon's music IS occasionally effective here most especially the discordant outre jazz that accompanies that abovementioned dream sequence. For the most part however it almost torpedoes what is otherwise a wellputtogether horror outing hardly essential viewing but surely a mustsee for all of Paul Naschy's many fans.As for this DVD itself from the always dependable folks at Deimos it sports a greatlooking print of this obscure film the socalled export version with all the nudity deemed too risqu by the bluenosed Franco censors of the time left intact...although whether we need to see a zombie in a seethrough nightie is another question! The DVD is introduced by Naschy himself a few years before his death from pancreatic cancer in 2009 oh if only HE could be resurrected! in which he tells us with lovable immodesty It is a strange movie a really shocking movie...one of the most horrifying movies in the Spanish horror cinema! Who am I to argue with the Boris Karloff of Spain?".

However she is attacked several times by zombies what a bummer and ultimately is carried by one of them into a weird Satanic ceremony filled with greenfaced zombies. There the Indian mystic is dressed like the Devil the outfit and makeup are pretty cool but they later refer to him as 'Baron Samedi'the voodoo spirit of death and the lady is stabbed and he drinks her blood. But just as she's about to die she awakens to find it's all a dream. Despite this freaky dream or vision or whatever it was the lady remains at the mystic's homeproving she's pretty dumb.In the meantime various murders take placeorchestrated by the same masked person you saw at the beginning of the film. As for the murders by today's standards they are tamethey were for their time very bloody and graphic....and featured a bit of gratuitous nudity. This is probably NOT a film to show your motherinlaw! After these killings you finally learn from some Scotland Yard folks that those killed were all somehow related. It seems that they all came from British families of people who remained in India following independence in 1947. In 1957 some sort of evil event occurredand the families returned to India and did not talk about this incident. So it appears that perhaps the mystic is using Haitian voodoo to exact revenge for this 1957 incident. Tune in if you want to find out where it goes next.This story has a lot of good and a lot of bad. The killings are pretty graphic and there are plenty of scary moments. But the plot often makes little sense such as why the lady never called the police and why all the victims of the zombies just stood there waiting for the slowmotion killers to get them!. If you love Spanish horror films this is worth seeingotherwise it just didn't quite work. The writing certainly should have been better.By the way in one scene a guy is apparently killed by a canyes a can. How this killed him I have no ideait sure seemed pretty stupid as well as impossible. Also a live chicken is actually beheaded for the filma rather cruel way to get some chills.".

I have lost count of the number of times i have seen this film but it is as enjoyable now as it was the first time i saw it. The plot is simple just two mates having a wager to see who will be the first to arrive in Brighton while taking part in the veteran car rally and their poor female partners having to suffer all the way.

Much of the film is typical race and chase stuff but avoids the usual potholes of overengineered stunts and tricks. The characters are far more interesting than that!A brilliant harmonica soundtrack by Larry Adler keeps the tempo and spirits high and the full colour production provides a ready backdrop of 1950's town and country scenes.

The use of the countryside is great too and here the colour film is saturated perfectly  although I have seen it in black and white as well so it is not essential colourviewing.The race back to London is memorable for the many pranks and downright rude goingson between the two men and their longsuffering partners.

It's quite risqu for 1953 but done in a splendidly subtle way that can only be described as a forgotten art. And as usual I shall be whistling Larry Adler's magnificent score for days after viewing.I laughed I cried I loved the old cars. What more could you ask from a movie? Quite possibly the closest thing to perfection you're likely to see in a movie  and it didn't need special CGI effects and a cast of thousands just four extremely talented actors a few old cars and the glorious postwar English countryside.11 out of 10.

Many of these vehicles would today be collectors items in their own right.It would not be putting it too strongly to say that the film 'Genenieve' is a toy vehicle appreciators and collectors delight as well as an inspiration for restorers of full size veteran vehicles.Alan Wainwright".

Many of these vehicles would today be collectors items in their own right.It would not be putting it too strongly to say that the film 'Genenieve' is a toy vehicle appreciators and collectors delight as well as an inspiration for restorers of full size veteran vehicles.Alan Wainwright";

It stays in my head to this day and I haven't seen the movie in some time. Kenneth More is fun to watch as his character competes with John Gregson in an antique car race. Genevieve by the way is Gregson's beloved car competing in the race. Arthur Wontner was also in the picture. I've only seen him donning the famous deerstalker hat of Sherlock Holmes before this in several movies made in the 1930's. I hope sometime soon this film will be made available on DVD here in the United States.".

Since my dad was very into old cars and in fact took part in one of the Veteran Car Club's runs at about the time the movie was made perhaps the following nitpicks may be of interest.1. The cars were VETERAN cars not 'vintage' as widely asserted. Old cars in the UK anyway are classed as Veteran if built before 1904 Edwardian if built between 19041910 and Vintage if built between 19101930. PreWW2 nonmassproduced cars were deemed Postvintage thoroughbred and that was it.2. The annual November event is not a 'race' it's a 'run'. Street racing was and is forbidden and definitely invalidates autoinsurance coverage. OK the movie plot climaxes in an unofficial race home to London the next day but that's moviemaker's license. I loved the disclaimer during the opening titles from the Veteran Car Club saying Our members would NEVER do anything like that.3. Kay Kendall's character's dog is not a St. Bernard or a Shepherd it's a Mastiff. A nice one too! 4. I too recognise many of the films locations  most of them nowhere NEAR the Brighton road.5. Those who find the comedy unfunny are clearly no students of human nature and that is indeed a tragedy.6. My greatest joy in recognising great character actors in supporting roles was not even Joyce Grenfell as the hotel clerk when I was a student at what is now Brighton University in the sixties I digged with landladies just like that but to see Geoffrey Keen cast as a motorcycle speed cop just astonished me! Genevieve is now a cornerstone of my private video collection  just as wonderful as I remember it.".

None of these were allowed in Production Code America as policed by the Legion of Decency who could turn out boycotts on a dime while Hollywood's studios quaked in fear. Congrats to the Brits for treating adults like adults even if it was 60years ago.It is of course a delightful movie with just enough grit to keep things from getting sappy. I loved seeing those picturesque country lanes I hope are still there. Happily filming in color turned out to be a real plus. However it occurred to me about halfway through that neither of the two guys Ambrose or Alan was particularly likable rather unusual I would think for a commercial film. Alan of course does win wife Wendy's and our respect with his noble gesture toward the old man. But otherwise the two guys appear defined by their rather smallminded obsession with outracing the other.Nonetheless the race is a lot of fun as the two girls look on in bewilderment at the boys' madcap antics. Likely the real stars however are the two wonderful vintage crates that belch fumes and leak fluid but somehow sputter along. At the same time that solo harmonica is perfect eccentric accompaniment. Hard to believe the filmmakers could take such a slender premise small cast and do it so well. But they do so don't miss it.".

The first think that surprised me was seeing the date 1953 printed on the DVD... I thought I must have got it confused with another film as I'd recalled it being in fairly good colour surely a film that old would be black and white... No I had remembered correctly it was in surprisingly good colour for the time! The story follows Alan McKim a vintage car enthusiast who is taking part in the London to Brighton rally in his 1904 Darracq 'Genevieve' along with his less than enthusiastic wife Wendy. Also taking part is his friend Ambrose Claverhouse and his guest Rosalind. It is rather surprising that they are friends as nothing pleases them more than seeing the other's car breaking down! Despite various difficulties both cars eventually get to Brighton and after an argument with his wife Alan goes to work on his car it is here that Ambrose bumps into him and suggests a wager the first one back to London wins one hundred pounds a large sun in those days. There race starts well enough but soon they are resorting to dirty tricks to ensure victory much to the disapproval of the women.This film has a lot going for it the cast do a good job although the male characters are much less sympathetic than I expected not only are Alan and Ambrose rude to each other they are rude to their female passengers and even to people who have stopped to help them! Wendy played by Dinah Sheridan is the most sympathetic character with her willingness to put up with her husbands obsession and her mischievous sense of humour! The funny moments cause chuckles rather than laughter but were good enough. Fans of old cars should enjoy this of course even the 'new cars' that feature are sixty years old now... although modern drivers might envy the '50s motorist's empty roads!".

	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing I can say that would increase anyone's enjoyment of this nearperfect film. What I would like to point out is simply that it deserves wider recognition from the film community. Genevieve is probably the 'smallest' film that I'd put among the top five or ten best of all time but I would include it without hesitation in the same ranks with Citizen Kane 2001 A Space Odyssey or any of the other Great Films you'd care to mention.Unlike many classics Genevieve is not a film that should be overanalyzed. It's not a calculated work of cinematic Art but a delicate almost accidental masterpiece. In a way it's very much the British equivalent of Jacques Tati's Mr Hulot's Holiday. Like Hulot Genevieve deserves 'classic' status not just for its brilliant humor impeccable characterizations and unique cinematography... but also for how perfectly it manages to encapsulate all of human nature. We have the lows playing dirty tricks on your friends the highs giving up your competitiveness to share your passion with a passing stranger. And we have the ridiculous as characters go into hysterics at each others' antics. Like Hulot Genevieve also has a unique and absolutely perfect musical backdrop. Larry Adler's nostalgic harmonica score is one of the alltime greats offering a perfect counterpoint to the visual antics.Watching Genevieve recently I was also put in mind of a more serious British film The Third Man. Both provide a deep insight into human nature via intense imagery and brilliantly unusual music. But where Hulot and Genevieve are parallel British and French visions Genevieve and Third Man are perfect yinandyang opposites color vs monochrome dark vs light comedy vs tragedy. It's not fair that one is a mandatory study for film scholars the other an obscure rarity. Especially outside of the UK.Recognizing Genevieve as a classic won't increase my enjoyment of it. Nothing can do that. I watched it recently for perhaps the tenth time and it still seemed fresh and wonderful as ever. But I would like to know that the film's creators  especially writer William Rose and director Henry Cornelius  are getting the credit they so richly deserve. The former is probably best known for It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World or the Ladykillers while the latter is more likely to be associated with Passport to Pimlico. But Genevieve is their greatest work one of the few truly perfect films.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's nothing I can say that would increase anyone's enjoyment of this nearperfect film. What I would like to point out is simply that it deserves wider recognition from the film community. Genevieve is probably the 'smallest' film that I'd put among the top five or ten best of all time but I would include it without hesitation in the same ranks with Citizen Kane 2001 A Space Odyssey or any of the other Great Films you'd care to mention.Unlike many classics Genevieve is not a film that should be overanalyzed. It's not a calculated work of cinematic Art but a delicate almost accidental masterpiece. In a way it's very much the British equivalent of Jacques Tati's Mr Hulot's Holiday.

	schema:reviewBody "A delight from start to finish this film is about an annual car club's trip from London to Brighton. The cars in question are vintage. Alan and Wendy John Gregson and Dinah Sheridan travel in their 1904 model affectionately named Genevieve. Ambrose and Rosilund Kenneth More and Kay Kendall have their own vehicle and it soon becomes a rivalry about which car is better. It eventually turns into a race on the way home in which they have to outsmart each other to win 100 pounds. This is a great film because it relies on the richness of its characters and is filled with scenes that are both amusing and relevant. There is a great scene in which a drunken Rosilund plays trumpet with the band and another when Wendy and Alan have to check into a down market hotel next to a train and a giant clock watch what happens when the clock strikes nine. In a brief but fun role the always engaging Joyce Grenfell plays a hotel concierge but this film is all about Alan Wendy Ambrose  Rosilund. The acting is superb. Buy or rent the DVD since it has an interview with Dinah Sheridan biographies of the main characters and location shoots. This film is from 1953 but it is completely fresh today and even makes you a bit sad to know this world doesn't exist anymore. Oh well at least you have this completely wonderful film to watch.".

But somehow the basic good nature and decentness of Messrs More and Gregsonthe determination and spirit of Mesdames Sheridan and Kendal combined to create an alchemy that spelled gold at the 1955 Box Office and created a legend that has lasted over half a century. Perhaps not appealing to 21st century eyes for it's unfailing cheeriness and good humourthere is not an ounce of meanness or cynicism in it. Clearly such innocence cannot be allowed to have ever existed. WellI'm here to tell you it did.

Full of British sensibilities and sexual tension Genevieve ranks as one of the best British films from the 50s. Both couples seem poles apart but the men are bound by a machismo sensibility whilst the women are both astutely charming in loyalty with a bullish awareness of the situation.
