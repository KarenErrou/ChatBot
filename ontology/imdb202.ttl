The Germans take 100 Frenchmen and are threatening to execute them unless the saboteurs come forward. Picard who would rather die at the hands of the firing squad as oppose to the guillotine offers to go to the Germans and say that he is the saboteur. Bonet accepts and so they go the village near where the bridge was to learn all that they can so that Picard can convince the Germans that he is the saboteur.

	schema:reviewBody "Errol Flynn always wanted to prove that he was a dramatic actor of range not an athletic nonentity who was always demonstrating his abilities as a horseman a fighter or a swordsman. That his best adventure films did show him as more than just an acrobat he barely understood. He wanted to play normal types. But normal types look more like Walter Matthau or Paul Muni or Allan Jenkins  they are not the strikingly handsome Flynn.In 1944 Flynn did this film which was a war picture but not like DIVE BOMBER or OBJECTIVE BURMA. The film was about a French criminal who had committed a murder and was tried and convicted for that homicide. He is able to escape the guillotine when a bomb hits the prison just as the execution is about to occur. He flees and manages to get into the countryside. Pursuing him is Paul Lucas the French police inspector who arrested him originally. Lucas finds Flynn but at that time an act of sabotage against the Nazis occurs. When the Nazis threaten to kill 100 French hostages unless the saboteurs appear Flynn offers Lucas a devil's choice If Lucas will not act for the next few days Flynn will surrender himself to the Nazis as the saboteur he prefers being shot by a firing squad rather than being guillotined. Lucas has little real choice  unless he is willing to do the same thing instead of Flynn. But will Flynn keep his word or not? As Flynn meets a young girl and finds that they can flee away together the audience wonders if he'll do the heroic thing or not.Flynn is pretty good in this cynical part. It is obvious once he makes the offer to Lucas that he really planned not to go through with it. It is also true that as the moment of truth arises he gradually sees the hideous tragedy that his selfinterest is likely to cause many families. The glimpse at occupied French society is also good showing the victims and the collaborators. It is almost as good as the picture of that society in THIS LAND IS MINE.Yet the film produced by a company that Flynn was involved in and selected by him failed at the box office. The public did not quite accept a thinking man's Errol Flynn instead of the adventurous sexy star of THE SEA HAWK or GENTLEMAN JIM. It set back further attempts by Flynn to find straight dramatic parts. It also verified that Jack Warner Flynn's studio boss was a really smart man in knowing what the public liked or did not like for their stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being quite a fan of Errol Flynn's I had somehow managed to go forty years without seeing this movie largely on the basis of its poor critical reputation. I always loved Flynn's swashbuckling his insouciance and especially his poignant performances near the end of his career in The Sun Also Rises The Roots of Heaven and Too Much Too Soon. I expected nothing from Uncertain Glory but a clip in a recent Flynn documentary caught my eye with what seemed to be a quite real and touching performance. I finally saw the film tonight and was impressed far beyond expectations. Flynn always harbored a hope of being respected as a dramatic actor and though I think he achieved that in the previously mentioned later films I was surprised to find in this 1944 performance a richness and texture every bit the equal of his best dramatic work. The film itself has like most American movies of its period certain conventions and unrealities which must be accepted such as the variance in accents and some melodramatic plot devices but it seemed to me to be quite believable and realistic within those confines. I was impressed by Paul Lukas never a favorite of mine in particular and the story kept me quite involved. Elements of it were quite moving. But Flynn quite simply overwhelmed my every expectation and I suggest that this film might actually be reconsidered and included among the best pictures of his career. It's certainly one of his best performances.".

The question is whether he can follow through or whether he'll follow his new romantic and idealized love interest to a free new life.It's all rather good even if contained in movie expectations.

Their brother their son. And that's kind of what this movie is about showing heroism and goodness and how the war is a just cause and the Nazis are truly horrible they were. Flynn does what he needs to do here and if there is artifice and some lack of total believability that's almost necessary so that a safe distance and cushion is in place.Not an essential movie but a really good one especially if you already like this kind of film and this era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uncertain Gory is a thoughtful wellmade warintrigue thriller staring Errol Flynn and Paul Lukas. Flynn whose acting skill was oft unfairly derided as suitable only for swashbuckling athletic roles could have easily let himself be overshadowed by Lukas a highclass dominant character actor known for his acerbic psychological portrayals. In fact Flynn seems to have been inspired by his costar and turns in what may have been the best acting job of his career.While Flynn usually played the dashing hero and Lukas was often cast in sinister roles here the roles are reversed. Lukas portrays an upright police inspector escorting scummy lifelong criminal and convicted murderer Flynn through Nazioccupied France to face the guillotine. As the Germans are preparing to execute a hundred French hostages unless the saboteur who blew up a bridge with a German troop train on it surrenders himself Flynn suggests he could end his misspent life with a noble gesture by claiming to be the saboteur. He would rather be executed by firing squad anyway he avers than face the awful prospect of beheading. Against his better judgment the inspector agrees. The complications and suspense hereafter hinge on whether consummate conman Flynn is sincere or is he working the con of his life  for his life. The ensuing catandmouse game between the wily criminal and the determined suspicious policeman provides an entertaining suspenseful story and a pair of brilliantly realized character studies by Flynn and Lukas. Along the way the criminal picks up the help of a naive provincial shop girl Jean Sullivan a pretty lithesome flamenco dancer brilliantly cast in her introductory movie roll. Part of the suspense turns on whether Flynn actually loves the girl or is just using her.Director Raoul Walsh has cinematographer Sid Hickox use many closeups to catch every nuance of facial expression in constructing deeply psychological and spiritual character studies. As in all Warner Brothers pictures of this era the marvelous supporting cast sports many familiar and expressive faces. Lucille Watson plays her usual nasty matron as the bitter manipulative mother of one of the hostages. Faye Emerson sizzles as one of Flynn' hardbitten molls in the early going. James Flavin almost unrecognizable in a black mustache and an Adrian helmet turns in his typical stolid authoritarian presence in a typically thankless roll as a harried militia captain feverishly searching for the saboteur. But Dennis Hoy is absolutely riveting as the parish priest. He is like Moses come down from the mountain as he roundly denounces as sinful and demoniacally inspired the plans of Watson and confederates to free their loved ones by fingering and innocent man as the saboteur. He is more quietly moving as he asks his congregation to kneel and beg God's forgiveness for their sins and the sins of their country which have caused them to be delivered into the hands of the enemy they hate.Herein is the aspect of this picture different from what one sees throughout most of the classic movie era or any other time. Characters routinely pray and invoke the help of God and there is much philosophical talk of God. Though ridiculing and joking at the time Flynn's decadent thief is seen to be visibly moved as he watches tough cop Lukas kneel to pray in the church they have entered to avoid the Nazis and their Vichy militia toadies. We never know what Lukas is praying for  his family in Paris? the success of their perilous scheme? forgiveness of his sins?  but we are moved. At least those of us who are Christians are. Likewise as the escaped Flynn watches old people praying in a farm yard for the deliverance of the hostages and his innocent girlfriend lighting a candle for the same blessing. Such scenes were seldom seen in the l930's or the later 1940's. Hollywood was happy to forget God most of the time. Most of the rest of us are too until we start having troubles. World War II was a time of deep deep dark dark troubles for the whole world. So Hollywood like everyone else except perhaps the most diehard of commies was remembering God. As soon as the war was over and brighter times returned God was promptly forgotten again.Those hoping for a ratatattat war action movie will be disappointed by Uncertain Glory. There is little action though much suspense. This is more of a thinking person's Errol Flynn picture. It may be too philosophical and too Christian for some but it should be rewarding in any case for the intense psychological character studies by Flynn Lukas and the sterling supporting cast. A fine moralboosting World War II piece and top grade Old Hollywood entertainment from the best of times and the worst of times.".

	schema:reviewBody "Errol Flynn is headed for Uncertain Glory in this 1944 film also starring Paul Lukas Faye Emerson Lucille Watson Sheldon Leonard and Jean Sullivan. The premise is similar to 1943's Hangmen Also Die! in one way  the Nazis have taken hostages who will die unless a saboteur is found. In this case it's the saboteur who blew up a French bridge and killed Germans. Nazis have taken many men as hostages from a small nearby village. Parallel to this an Inspector Bonet Lukas has finally tracked down a fugitive convicted of murder Jean Picard Flynn who has slipped through France's fingers time and time again  the last time just as he was about to get the guillotine the site was bombed and he escaped. A friend Leonard puts Bonet on his trail and he's eventually caught.

I repeat the theatrical rule when citizens of a country are depicted in their country in a film or play they would be speaking their own language not English with a French accent. Therefore no accent is necessary Lucille Watson in this movie being the purest example of this.

	onyx:emotionText "Errol Flynn is headed for Uncertain Glory in this 1944 film also starring Paul Lukas Faye Emerson Lucille Watson Sheldon Leonard and Jean Sullivan. The premise is similar to 1943's Hangmen Also Die! in one way  the Nazis have taken hostages who will die unless a saboteur is found. In this case it's the saboteur who blew up a French bridge and killed Germans. Nazis have taken many men as hostages from a small nearby village. Parallel to this an Inspector Bonet Lukas has finally tracked down a fugitive convicted of murder Jean Picard Flynn who has slipped through France's fingers time and time again  the last time just as he was about to get the guillotine the site was bombed and he escaped. A friend Leonard puts Bonet on his trail and he's eventually caught. En route to another bout with the guillotine Picard suggests that he'd rather die by firing squad  can't the Inspector say he is the saboteur save the 100 men and Picard can still meet his death? After some thought Bonet agrees. Giving out a report of Picard's death the name Dupont is given to Picard someone on whom the Nazis cannot check.

By the end of the film these characters have a new respect for each other. The film is almost a buddybuddy movie with several humorous scenes that bond these two characters more and more closely. There are also touching scenes where we see that these two adversaries really do care for each other.The cast are all good except for the love interest Marianne Jean Sullivan. Jean meets her and it's In like Flynn once more. However she is too insipid and wet for him but she does make him change his outlook on life while they are on the run together.

However in the interim the Underground has blown up a bridge and destroyed a train filled with German soldiers. And as a result the Germans plan on executing 100 innocent men unless they find the culprit. So instead of executing Flynn they plan on having Flynn take credit for the bombingallowing his execution to save many others. But considering that Flynn is a total reprobate it often seemed very very doubtful if he actually will do what he'd promisedand might just be using this plan to help him bide his time until he can somehow escape.In many ways the character in this film seems almost autobiographical for Flynn. No I am NOT saying he was a murderer or career criminal but there are many similarities. Scenes where Flynn is talking about his wasted life and relationship with God sure seem like he could be talking about his reallife self! As for this plot it is very unusual and made for a very atypical sort of propaganda filmbut it somehow works.

Of course Lukas fell back into the ranks of distinguished character players Uncertain Glory didn't do too much to maintain him.It wasn't a great film for Errol Flynn either. He plays a gentleman thief whose last job cost a night watchman his life and merited him the guillotine. Even in Nazi occupied France the police was diligently doing their job against your run of the mill criminals.But the RAF saves him at the moment of execution with a bombing raid. Flynn escapes but is recaptured by Lukas. However on the way back they are delayed because some Resistance people blew up a bridge with a German troop train. The Nazis are using their usual methods to find the saboteur. If the saboteur is not found by a certain date 100 French hostages will be executed.This gives Flynn a brilliant idea to claim responsibility for the sabotage because if he has to die at least die a hero. Lukas agrees and phones his superior Douglass Dumbrille that he killed Flynn while trying to escape. Of course that's all Errol needs now that the authorities are no longer looking for him and Lukas has his neck stuck out. Flynn's found himself a girl friend in the village in newcomer Jean Sullivan who was little heard from after Uncertain Glory.Errol Flynn was trying a more thoughtful role but he looked bored a lot of the time. Lukas was fine and I do disagree with another reviewer who said he was Javert like. He was anything but. We do see Lukas with his family he has a life outside the Surete. Also Flynn's character is not Jean Valjean. He's a career criminal at the top of his profession and the Surete is naturally interested in catching him.In the supporting cast I like Lucile Watson as the mother of a hostage who will do anything to save her son and Dennis Hoey as the village priest who is a fine moral example for his flock.Uncertain Glory is second rate Flynn and usually not mentioned by devoted fans of Errol as one of his better films.".

Police Inspector Marcel Bonet Paul Lukas tracks him down but before he can bring him in Picard offers to give his life to save the lives of some French hostages being held by the Nazis. Bonet agrees but the question is will Picard go through with it? Raoul Walsh directed this underrated little gem from Warner Bros. Errol Flynn and Paul Lukas have a good chemistry. Most of the film centers around the relationship between their two characters. Lovely Jean Sullivan plays the naive young girl who falls for Flynn. Nice supporting cast includes Lucile Watson Dennis Hoey Sheldon Leonard and Faye Emerson. A really good war drama that raises some nice moral questions as well as having doses of humor and even some romance. And of course the added historical value many of these films have. WB is probably my favorite studio of the '30s  '40s and their war films are a good example of why. They made the best and most interesting movies to help the war effort. Always with good actors writers directors and a solid reliable production.".

Police Inspector Marcel Bonet Paul Lukas tracks him down but before he can bring him in Picard offers to give his life to save the lives of some French hostages being held by the Nazis. Bonet agrees but the question is will Picard go through with it? Raoul Walsh directed this underrated little gem from Warner Bros. Errol Flynn and Paul Lukas have a good chemistry. Most of the film centers around the relationship between their two characters. Lovely Jean Sullivan plays the naive young girl who falls for Flynn. Nice supporting cast includes Lucile Watson Dennis Hoey Sheldon Leonard and Faye Emerson. A really good war drama that raises some nice moral questions as well as having doses of humor and even some romance. And of course the added historical value many of these films have. WB is probably my favorite studio of the '30s  '40s and their war films are a good example of why. They made the best and most interesting movies to help the war effort. Always with good actors writers directors and a solid reliable production.";

Audiences certainly Didn't Want to See Their Favorite Costumed Adventurer as a Modern ThiefMurderer and although Flynn was Trying to Find Roles Outside His Bailiwick everyone around the Studio Knew it was Box Office Poison.But Errol Flynn Despite His Charming Good Looks and Easy Going Manner did Impress in this Against Type Portrayal. He Manages to Dominate the Screen and is entirely Convincing as a Man on the Run from the Law and Capital Punishment Who has an Epiphany Change of Heart and has the chance to Turn MartyrHero and be Redeemed after all.It is Never quite Certain in the Movie that He is Going to Go Through with the Sacrifice but it really is quite Certain Considering. The Film manages to be Heartfelt and Suffering Most of the Time due to the Nazi Occupation and France's Predicament.Paul Lukas leads a Good Supporting Cast. The Movie's Weakness is its rather Studio Bound Back Lot but Rises Above that with some Striking Effect Shots and a Story that Intrigues. One of Flynn's Best Dramatic Roles and Overall a Compelling Wartime Movie with a heavy Emphasis on Religious Involvement in Keeping with the Reality and Spirit of the then Contemporary MindSet.".

But it is a good one.It gives us a somewhat ambivalent view of the French in the 1940s a people whom many Americans saw as having given up before the German onslaught in 1940. Why Americans viewed the French armistice in this manner I don't know. The Dutch and Belgians both got overrun as well and there was no significant American sentiment that they had given up. This was important because during the Occupation 194044 France was not able to produce its own movies about its attitudes toward the Germans and so not able to present its own view of itself and its people.That's what this movie tries to do at the end. After an hour and a half of Jean Eroll Flynn being portrayed as an amoral selfcentered criminal he finally decides to turn himself in to the Germans as the man they are looking for the man whose surrender will save 100 French hostages. As a selfsacrificing hero in other words.It's the most important part of the movie and it could have used better dialogue than what Flynn is given. Because yes as a previous reviewer pointed out Jean suddenly becomes Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities  he sacrifices himself to save others. But whereas Dickens gave Carton  and Ronald Coleman  some of the greatest lines in the English language to explain why he did it JeanFlynn gets only a very flimsy and not really convincing short monologue. There needed to be something more than the very general Sometimes a man realizes that there are things more important than just himself. This scene needed a great speech and it doesn't get one. It also needed to be prepared much better in the scenes leading up to it.On the other hand Paul Lukacs gets the final line of the movie and it is a masterpiece. It suddenly makes Jean a symbol of all Frenchmen and a very powerful and positive symbol for which the movie did nothing to prepare us. Still it is so well done that we don't stop to analyze it.You should definitely see this movie if you have any interest in World War II and how Hollywood made us see it. Flynn Lukacs and Lucille Watson all give great performances. The love story seems pasted on but it's easy enough to ignore as the actress involved  given the symbolic name of Marianne  makes no impression at all.".

In a very tightly constructed wartime melodrama Flynn plays an imprisoned career thief and one time murderer whom fate hands a chance to convert an ignominious guillotine execution by the Vichy French into a heroic firing squad execution by their German overlords. The complex shifting 'reluctant buddy' relationship between costars Flynnas Jean Picard and Paul Lukasas police detective Marcel Bonet provides a fascinating character study.Bonet feels a personal responsibility in recapturing Picard after the latter climbed out of the rubble remains of his cell after an errant RAF bomb blasted the prison. Picard goes to the home of former crime partner Henri Duval for helpmoney traveling papers and civilian clothes including Duval's stylish Fedora hat then leaves on a train with Duval's hardbitten moll LouiseFaye Emerson hoping to escape to Spain within a few days. But Duval turns out to be an informer for Bonet and tells him Picard's plan. After capturing Picard in his Bordeaux hotel room the rail trip back to Paris is interrupted by a saboteurbombed bridge which killed many German troops as well. After learning that 100 local village men will be shot if the saboteursis not soon delivered to the Germans Picard proposes to Bonet that he pose as the saboteur since he will be executed in any case. Picard gradually makes Bonet feel like he is now responsible for the decision whether the 100 live or die.Meanwhile some villagers plan to frame Picard and Bonet as the saboteurs. They are opposed by the outspoken village priestplayed by Dennis Hoey. Also a suspected saboteur has been captured by the local Viche policeJames Flavin plays the chief and they suspect Bonet and Picard of being his accomplices. But in a sudden turn of events Bonet reluctantly shows them his police ID and claims that Picard and the suspected saboteur are working with him to find the saboteurs. Picard and Bonet learn the details of the sabotage operation from their companion then help him escape by small plane to England. Also meanwhile the 2 men meet MarianneJean Sullivan a pretty sweet starryeyed unattached village girl. She's very different from the fast superficial city girls Picard is used to. It's mutual love at first sight and throughout the remainder of the film their relationship serves to considerably soften the otherwise tense drama. As Bonet fears Picard seems to vacillate between his promise to turn himself in as the saboteur and 'running off' with Marianne. Picard gives her conflicting signals saying that their relationship has to be confined to the next day or two for secret reasons. Later he proposes that they 'run off' to the Frenchcontrolled Caribbean island of MartiniqueA former acquaintance whose name Picard has adopted after Bonet supposedly killed him went into hiding in Martinique. Picard tells Marianne he will go looking for friends to get some money and traveling papers for them. However he doesn't plan to see her again and tells Bonet to meet her in his place.At his Nazi interrogation Picard is initially dismissed as another probable phony saboteur trying to save the 100. He looks perplexed when asked some details about the sabotage operation then is ordered out of the room. He begins to walk out but turns around and spits out the precise details asked for impressing the Germans that he must be the saboteur. Did he have a momentary change of heart? Or did he simply require a few moments to recall the details? One would think he would have these details on the tip of his tongue.When Marianne learns the truth from Bonet she asks what sort of man was Picard? After some thought Bonet responds He was a Frenchman implying that he was courageous enough to put the greater interests of his fellow Frenchmen ahead of his own interests.We see Picard's character gradually transform from a cynical selfserving compulsive thief disrespected by Bonet into a somewhat spiritual patriot and hero respected as a friend by Bonet. This transformation was largely affected by Marianne and the village priest.As Jack Warner apparently predicted this film was not well received by contemporary audiences if treasured by Flynn himself who was itching to transform into a leading man of more mature film roles. Flynn had been typecast as a lighthearted dashing action hero mostly of past historical periods and audiences generally refused to accept him as a contemporary career thief and murderer in a film with mostly somber scenes and no real 'action' only implied violence and deaths. Also the last part of the film is a real tear jerker mostly due to the acting of Jean Sullivan as Marianne. Of course in generally less dramatic circumstances many love affairs during these years were soon ended by the warrelated death of one or the other. Perhaps contemporary audiences didn't want to be reminded of this in film. But the 3 principle actors were well cast in a superbly crafted screenplay directed by veteran Raoul Walsh who directed most of Flynn's WWIIrelated films released during the war.

But after an interesting start with Flynn about to be executed the story goes astray when British fliers bomb the area and he is able to escape. None of the subsequent incidents are developed with enough force to maintain suspense.Jean Sullivan as Flynn's brief female love interest adds nothing to the film's overall impactbut Faye Emerson and Sheldon Leonard at least give some spark to their supporting roles.

Zanuck it stars Tyrone Power as Larry Farrell a man on a journey to find the values of life. This fascinating journey takes him all over the world until he reaches a summit in India and there he meets a Holy Man superbly played by Cecil Humphreys who helps him understand his questions and then sends him back to the real world where he must then take his place in life.  Based on the 1943 book of the same name by W. Somerset Maugham it does the story justice with the help of Lamar Trotti in transferring it to the screen.  I read the book before seeing the film and was not disappointed.  Congratulations also goes to director Edmound Goulding for bringing the truth of the book to life.Other noteworthy performances were delivered by the lovely Gene Tierney as Isabel again in Cassini dresses and yet another costarring Tyrone Power film John Payne as Gray in a different type of role as Miss Tierney's husband Anne Baxter as the doomed Sophie in her Academy Award performance and was she excellent Clifton Webb as Elliott Templeton another of Webb's limpwristed performances and another Academy Award nomination.  Herbert Marshall as Maugham himself.  Did anyone get the gay relationship between he and Templeton?  Then there's Lucile Watson Frank Gilmore and the delightful Elsa Lanchester in supporting roles.  I liked Fritz Kortner as Kosti the defrocked priest Larry meets at a bar when he is working the mines.Ray Dorey along with Alfred Newman wrote the theme song Mam'selle for the film.  This is the best of the times.  You can't get better.  Power was superb in this.  He was an underrated actor because he was such a handsome man.  Yet his abilities as an actor were terrific.  He brought the intelligence of Maugham's writing to focus.  Miss Baxter showed you the stuff good performers are made of with her shaded performance in this film. Also watch Marshall's reactions.  His eyes are fantastic.  They way his looks go from actor to actor.  And look for the gay undertones between he and Clifton Webb as the eccentric uncle who delves in the upper crust life. Even to the extreme of having a coat of arms embroidered on his underwear. In the final minutes of the film Marshall speaks to Isabel after Larry leaves her for good saying Goodness is after all the greatest force in the world . . .and he's got it.  This speaks for the film and it's greatness.  I think Marshall should have been nominated for his underplayed performance.  He is credited with many fine roles in his career.  See this classic.  It's on VHS.  Not to be confused with the pale remake with Bill Murray.".

	schema:headline " Stately Exposition of Love and Riches and Meaning";
	schema:reviewBody "The Razor's Edge 1946A stately dramatic richly nuanced film about love true love and the love of life. It's about what matters and what doesn't in a high society world George Cukor could have filmed but this is by director Edmund Goulding coming off of a series of war films and with the great Grand Hotel from 1932 in his trail. Some people will find this a touch stiff or slow or rather too nuanced but I think none of the above at all. It has the richness of the Somerset Maugham novel it is based on and Goulding had just filmed the same year Of Human Bondage another Maugham novel. In both cases the writer contributed to the screenplay and the combination of the two of them seems really perfect. Tyrone Power is an interesting lead man as the idealistic and handsome Larry Darrell and in some ways his restraint and almost studied dullness at times is maybe what the film needs for its rich calm trajectory through the twenty years it covers. He's as stable and good as the wise knowing figure of the author who appears in the form of actor Herbert Marshall. Gene Tierney as Power's counterpart and eventually counterpoint plays the spoiled woman with cool dramatic perfection. She's got energy and edge and beauty from every angle and she maintains just that slightest duplicity in every scene so you are kept on your toes.The only forced and almost laughable section is the one that demands we think profound thoughts...the guru in India being guru to our hero. Unfortunately it lasts for fifteen minutes and though there is a spiritual necessity to the experience he has there this spiritual aspect is implied just as fully in the worldly scenes that follow. I can picture a far better movie without this insert and I can picture the director picturing it too. Someone knows why it got patched in and for whom but this is what we have. It has to be said the filming as conservative as it is in many ways is spoton gorgeous. The brightly lit ornamented busy sets are actually inhabited by the camera and the figures move together not only across the field but front to back as well in triangles and curves of visual activity yet with fluidityit's all contained and lyrically delicious. This is done without ostentatious mood without sharp angles and bold lighting but instead with spatial arrangements always full no emptiness no great shadows always something more to see. A great example easy to find is the very last scene just before the shot on the boat when the end titles run. Watch how Marshall walks the long way around Tierney and then she walks around him and the camera keeps them framed side to side front to back. It's nothing short of brilliant and yet in style so different than say Toland doing Kane or at another extreme Ozu doing Tokyo Story. But no less spectacular.At one point a minor character a defrocked priest says to Darrell in a working class bar You sound like a very religious man who does not believe in God. The movie is really about godliness or what Maugham calls goodness in the end. And some people have it and share it and make the world better God or no God.".

It's about what matters and what doesn't in a high society world George Cukor could have filmed but this is by director Edmund Goulding coming off of a series of war films and with the great Grand Hotel from 1932 in his trail. Some people will find this a touch stiff or slow or rather too nuanced but I think none of the above at all. It has the richness of the Somerset Maugham novel it is based on and Goulding had just filmed the same year Of Human Bondage another Maugham novel. In both cases the writer contributed to the screenplay and the combination of the two of them seems really perfect. Tyrone Power is an interesting lead man as the idealistic and handsome Larry Darrell and in some ways his restraint and almost studied dullness at times is maybe what the film needs for its rich calm trajectory through the twenty years it covers. He's as stable and good as the wise knowing figure of the author who appears in the form of actor Herbert Marshall. Gene Tierney as Power's counterpart and eventually counterpoint plays the spoiled woman with cool dramatic perfection. She's got energy and edge and beauty from every angle and she maintains just that slightest duplicity in every scene so you are kept on your toes.The only forced and almost laughable section is the one that demands we think profound thoughts...the guru in India being guru to our hero. Unfortunately it lasts for fifteen minutes and though there is a spiritual necessity to the experience he has there this spiritual aspect is implied just as fully in the worldly scenes that follow. I can picture a far better movie without this insert and I can picture the director picturing it too. Someone knows why it got patched in and for whom but this is what we have. It has to be said the filming as conservative as it is in many ways is spoton gorgeous. The brightly lit ornamented busy sets are actually inhabited by the camera and the figures move together not only across the field but front to back as well in triangles and curves of visual activity yet with fluidityit's all contained and lyrically delicious. This is done without ostentatious mood without sharp angles and bold lighting but instead with spatial arrangements always full no emptiness no great shadows always something more to see. A great example easy to find is the very last scene just before the shot on the boat when the end titles run. Watch how Marshall walks the long way around Tierney and then she walks around him and the camera keeps them framed side to side front to back. It's nothing short of brilliant and yet in style so different than say Toland doing Kane or at another extreme Ozu doing Tokyo Story. But no less spectacular.At one point a minor character a defrocked priest says to Darrell in a working class bar You sound like a very religious man who does not believe in God. The movie is really about godliness or what Maugham calls goodness in the end. And some people have it and share it and make the world better God or no God.";

	schema:headline " Somerset Maugham's epic novel becomes a glossy ambitious ultimately flawed piece packed with serious star wattage.";
	schema:reviewBody "British storyteller William Somerset Maugham's 1944 speculative novel The Razor's Edge as did his earlier semiautobiographical Of Human Bondage won a devoted following when it hit the book shelves and so 20th CenturyFox wasted no time in securing the screen rights to this mammoth warera adventure into existentialism.  It was a difficult elephantine undertaking but they somehow managed to carve out a screenplay and present the whole package within two years of the novel's first print.Awesomely produced and directed the resulting movie for the most part propels Maugham's central theme  that there is good and bad in all human beings.  The focus centers in on the long spiritual quest of Larry Durrell a basically virtuous individual who surrounded by wealth beauty and privilege abandons his enviable but superficial trappings to pursue a more humble meaningful life.  Oddly enough it's the superficial elements of the story and the more pretentious characters that hold up The Razor's Edge while the spiritual scenes grow flat and weary often times stopping the action dead in its tracks.In casting Tyrone Power as the protagonist one finds THE major flaw in its presentation.  Tagged as a pretty boy for most of his career he managed to show only glimpses of dramatic aptitude from time to time Witness for the Prosecution comes to mind.  Earnest and utterly sincere in his approach Power simply lacks the power sorry and the depth to carry off this complex confused anachronistic soulsearcher. His Durrell seems better suited amongst the shallow and superficial.  One only wonders what a Robert Donat or Fredric March might have done with such a role.Surrounding Power however is a stellar list of names that gussies up this production and it is in them that we find the film's emotional impact.  In particular Gene Tierney offers one of her finest performances as Isabel the grasping captivating socialite obsessed with Durrell who shows her true colors in the end when goodness and all else fails to win her the love of a man.  Like Power Tierney is a flawless incredibly photogenic beauty who tended toward posturing instead of acting.  Here she is allowed to capitalize on her tendency towards elegant frippery offering a cool intriguing portrait of a woman who can and will never have enough.We are also blessed with the presence of Clifton Webb the epitome of smug elegance who is true to form here as the meticulous wasptongued prig who is not use to being told no.  As in the classic Laura Webb is handed the film's most delicious lines as his character goes about buffering his unhappiness with scorn and witty sarcasm.  He would warm over this character recipe many times in movies but darned if you don't keep going back for second helpings. He is delightfully hateful and absolutely mesmerizing. Anne Baxter as the helpless tragic Sophie is heartwrenching giving a florid Oscarwinning performance that lingers long after the final reel. She not Power is the heart and ravaged soul of this piece.  The hospital scene following her horrific accident will rip you apart as will her subsequent degradation into alcohol and prostitution.  Known for her flashy theatrical roles Baxter plays Sophie for all its worth.John Payne is typically upright and appealing and does what he can in a rather stiff thankless other man part while suave Herbert Marshall who in reality lost a leg in WWI but continued to act often in a chair portrays Maugham himself with customary flair.Granted The Razor's Edge is no Lost Horizon in the metaphysical department but on its own it is quite admirable and engrossing entertainment.  It manages to hold up exceedingly well under its great length and weight feels only slightly dated and prides itself with gorgeous production values and a handsome handsome cast.".

Balancing the ones and the others it stands as a sound beautiful instance of classic movie.The story based on Somerset Maugham's novel is certainly original although some twists of the plot are hardly believable others are naive and predictable. The spiritual quest by Larry Tyrone Power is an interesting theme. However his yearning for living among workers and poor people is farfetched and fails to be touching. The director's job is just adequate. The cardboard backdrops are awful! The scenes placed in the fake Himalaya are laughable. The representation of French people is inaccurate and too picturesque. By the way French people NEVER spoke a foreign language in those years in truth not much has changed nowadays.Fortunately enough the merits of the movie overwhelm the flaws. The script is brilliant. A thorough psychological study of the characters is made through lines at times dramatic at times permeated with typical English sharp wit. A great acting is a major strength of the film. The whole cast minor roles included makes an excellent job. Anne Baxter deserved to win the Oscar for the best supporting actress. Gene Tierney is fantastic her Isabel fully believable and realistic is the most interesting character of the movie. Gene's acting is willingly understated but extremely subtle and accurate. Look at the glances she flashes to the drunk Sophie Anne Baxter at the tavern. Look at Isabel's expression when Sophie vulgarly sits down on the table turning her back to Isabel and flirting with Larry. We feel that a mortal hate is soaring. The clash between Isabel and Sophie is a great scene. Baxter beautifully shows Sophie's tragic weakness But Gene's icy attitude is even more effective. After all let's take Isabel's point of view we realize that she's perfectly right. It's true that Sophie is a hopeless drunkard. It's true that Larry wants to marry her just as an act of pity. And Isabel fights for her love. Why shouldn't she?Yes Isabel is selfish spoiled even ruthless... and so? For all his generosity sense of duty and so on Larry neglected Isabel just to avoid such an enormous selfsacrifice as to take a job! And then Isabel shouts Love me Larry love me! Come on Larry! How on the earth can you resist to such an appeal? Why aren't we audience allowed to replace you undeservedly overlucky fellow? Alas! Larry is completely out of mind as Isabel puts it.  By the way Larry's incoherences in a world of people ever following their own way snobbery for Elliott comfortable wealthy life for Isabel poised literature for Maugham debauchery for Sophie by no means are a flaw of the movie. They rather make a fine artistic effect even improving the realism of the story.And how I like the scene when Herbert Marshall as Maugham makes a detailed description of Isabel's perfect beauty loveliness grace GeneIsabel staring at him with a halfdreaming halfmocking smile. That's a much appreciated gift for all us devoted fans of Gene Tierney.Yes I don't hide the defects of The razor's edge. But it is certainly entertaining interesting even profound at several moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Darryl Zanuck gave in to Tyrone Power's request for some serious acting roles and not another costume part in his first post World War II film after returning from the Marines. The Razor's Edge is a bit overlong but Tyrone Power and the rest of the cast is shown to best advantage.The Razor's Edge is the story about a returning World War I veteran's quest for spiritual meaning in his life. Author W. Somerset Maugham wrote this during the 30s and his themes then found a good audience in 1946. He appears in the movie played by Herbert Marshall and it is his eyes through which we see the action unfold.It starts at a party in the Midwest at the beginning of the Roaring 20s. All the principal characters are introduced there including Larry Darrell played by Power who wants to postpone his engagement to Gene Tierney. Power explains about his lack of spiritual fulfillment and his desire to do some global soul searching. Tierney's not happy but she thinks all he wants to do is sow some wild oats and she reluctantly acquiesces. A year later she's in Paris and she finds Ty living on the fringe and she realizes he was serious. Now Tierney is hopping mad so she marries steady and reliable John Payne. Now the plot unfolds.As I've said in other reviews of his films Power was either the straight arrow hero or a heroheel type. He's a straight arrow in this one as noble as you can get without crossing over into Dudley DooRightism.Gene Tierney had essayed bitchiness in Leave Her to Heaven and she refines it to a high art here. Even though she's married to Payne she still has a yen for Ty and her machinations are what drives the rest of the story.John Payne I have always been convinced was brought to 20th Century Fox as a singing Tyrone Power for musicals. So it is interesting to see them together. It is unfortunate that Payne wasn't given a better role because his part as Tierney's husband who loses his fortune in the Stock Market Crash wasn't better written. Payne proved on a lot of occasions he was a capable enough actor to handle more complex parts.Clifton Webb plays fussy Uncle Elliott Templeton and got an Oscar Nomination losing to Harold Russell in the Best Years of Our Lives. Webb was the closest thing for years to an out gay actor and a lot of his roles reflect that part of him like this one. My favorite scene is after Ty Power goes to India and in that Shangri La like lamasery feels he has been made spiritually aware with the symphonic crescendos rising the action cuts away to a Paris tailor shop where Clifton Webb is complaining that the tassel on his robe doesn't sway but that it bobbles. Anne Baxter won a Best Supporting Actress Award for a playing a friend of Tierney's in the mid west. Baxter is a happy girl marrying a young man she's deeply in love with. Her husband and baby are killed in an automobile crash. Baxter's study of physical and moral decline and degradation is some of her best work maybe even better than Eve Harrington in All About Eve.The story is a bit dated now but it's still a fine film and one that shows Tyrone Power capable of far more than swashbuckling.".

	schema:headline " A Semi Spiritual Melodrama By Somerset Maugham";
	schema:reviewBody "W Somerset Maugham's is a character in his own The Razor's Edge. He's played by Herbert Marshall and he's given the hardest lines to deliver He looks extraordinarily happy calm yet aloof He's talking about Larry Tyrone Power's character after his enlightening trip to India. Power returns and reintroduces himself in the life of Isabel played by the impossibly beautiful Gene Tirney.

	schema:reviewBody "The author of numerous novels plays and short stories W. Somerset Maugham 18741965 was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public. Published in 1944 THE RAZOR'S EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values. It was Maugham's last major noveland it was immensely popular. Given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues it was also an extremely odd choice for a film versionbut Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.According to film lore THE RAZOR'S EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himselfand it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation. When the film went into production however Cukor was replaced by Edmund Goulding a director less known for artistic touch than a workmanlike manner and the Maugham script was replaced with one by Lamar Trotti the author of such memorable screenplays as THE OXBOW INCIDENT. Tyrone Power recently returned from military service during World War II was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell Gene Tierney one of the great beauties of her era was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley. The supporting cast was particularly notable including Herbert Marshall Anne Baxter Clifton Webb Lucille Watson and Elsa Lanchester. Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.But time has a way of putting things into perspective. Seen today THE RAZOR'S EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced filmbut that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity. As in most cases the major problem is the script. Although it is reasonably close to Maugham's novel in terms of plot it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story. We are told that Larry is in search of enlightenment we are told that he receives it we are told he acts on itbut in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual artistic philosophical and intellectual processes behind any of it. We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself. It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.We are left with the shell of Maugham's plot which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them. Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support. Unfortunately that does not happen here they are extremely onenote and Power is greatly miscast to boot. Fortunately the supporting cast is quite good with Herbert Marshall Clifton Webb and Lucille Watson particularly so the thenfamous performance by Anne Baxter however has not worn as well as one would hope.With a running time of just under two and a half hours the film also feels unnecessarily long. There is seemingly endless cocktail partytype banter and indeed the entire India sequence which reads as faintly hilarious would have been better cut entirelyan odd situation for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film. Regardless of the specific scene it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.As for the DVD itself the film has not been remastered but the print is extremely good and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor. When all is said and done I give THE RAZOR'S EDGE four stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the materialbut frankly this a film best left Power and Tierney fans who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

At 146 minutes it's certainly one of the longest films Fox ever made  especially during its golden period. Based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham the film stars then reigning heartthrob Tyrone Power as wealthy Chicago playboy Larry Darrell. Without much cause except that he's bored with life in general Larry breaks his engagement to Isabel Bradley Gene Tierney in favor of becoming a world traveler. Eventually his trips abroad lead to India to the very seat of spiritual enlightenment under the tutelage of a guru.Meanwhile back in Chicago the impatient Isabel decides to marry Gray Maturin John Payne. After the stock market crashes Isabel leaves Gray to go continent tripping with her social climbing egotistical Uncle Elliot Templeton Clifton Webb  at his usual acerbic best. Eventually all this intercontinental head bumping leads straight to a reunion of sorts for all concerned one that is made bittersweet when it is discovered that an old family friend Sophie Macdonald Ann Baxter after having lost both her husband and child in a terrible accident has succumbed to a life of spousal abuse and drug use. Having awakened his moral center Larry makes a vein attempt to reform Sophie. But Isobel's jealous need to have Larry all to herself  even though his interest in her has never been rekindled  leads to a bitter and tragic end.Goulding's direction on this magnum opus of a motion picture is slick stylish and polished. Around every turn he imbues the staging of events with an overall sense of foreboding tragedy that like the final flowering of the old south in Gone With The Wind simply reeks of a time far removed from the currency of life in which his characters ultimately find themselves living. Only the central worldweary performance of Tyrone Power seems to hit the high notes acting wise. For the rest but especially with Gene Tierney the cast seem to be going through the motions  albeit with considerable flair and panache as is befitting classically trained actors from Hollywood's golden age. There is also something to be said for Herbert Marshall's characterization of the author Somerset Maugham. Though probably inaccurate to history it is nevertheless one of the great bits of character acting ever put on film.Fox's DVD is exceptional. The picture is sharp and nicely balanced. But an audio commentary is all one gets to augment the experience  a shame!".

	schema:reviewBody "William Somerset Maugham was one of England's greatest popular novelists in the 20th Century. He's still among the most read of the 20th Century novelists with Orwell Woolf Greene Waugh Amis and many others. But he is not considered outside of his OF HUMAN BONDAGE a very deep novelist. His best work illustrates personality or areas of life like the world of English letters in CAKES AND ALE. When he tried to be deep he had mixed results. His best known misfire on this was his attempt to discuss religious spirituality in THE RAZOR'S EDGE. Written after World War I he was trying to discuss how a survivor of the killing fields of France goes into the East i.e. Asia to recover the needed religious basis for his life that the senseless slaughter in Europe destroyed. As a counterpoint to this search by the hero Larry Darrell we are shown the shallow materialistic lives of Larry's lover Isabel and her socialite uncle Elliott. Basically Elliott who never thought highly of Larry even before this search for spiritual purity encourages Isabel to dump Larry and marry stock broker Gray Manturin John Payne. She does this especially when she finds that Larry is more interested in his spiritual quest than in her. The marriage does produce one child but it is not a very close one. As for Elliott he moves to France and hobnobs with the ultrasnob set on the Riviera in the 1920s. He shows great concern about his clothing does the sash of his robe properly sway as he moves or does it bobble?. He is into enjoying the finer things in life like Polish liquors. And Larry? He finds contentment after going to India and finding inner wisdom. So who turns out to be the happier? Maugham is good enough a writer to make the personalities of his characters interesting. Elliott played deliciously by Clifton Webb as the ultimate snob is made to look shallow and ridiculous and bitchy but relatively harmless. Isabel is far worse. Larry's attempts to help his old friend Sophie Anne Baxter who is a recovering alcoholic after tragedy. He announces they will be marrying. Isabel Gene Tierney sets up Sophie's low esteem and then allows her to get drunk  which leads to a second tragedy. At the end Isabel is resigned to remain married to Gary although she may begin an affair with neighbor Somerset Maugham Herbert Marshall. Elliott gets the highest recognition of his lifetime before he leaves the scene. And Larry  he's determined to continue his life of good deeds from now on.As you can see the real issues of religious revivalism and spirituality are barely touched. Larry finds a secret  and he is a changed man. But so what! We don't know what the secret is. I doubt if Maugham did. Tyrone Power had been begging Darryl Zanuch for more meaty acting roles  less adventure parts. He did not realize that his acting skills in adventure films like JESSIE JAMES and THE BLACK SWAN were quite good ones and that those roles were more realistic than this. But he acquits himself well despite the real emptiness of the character. The real characters who bring the story to life are Webb's Tierney's Baxter's an Oscar winning performance and Elsa Lanchester in a nice cameo. This is the best version of THE RAZOR'S EDGE...but that does not say too much.".

The buildup to his entrance the kind usually reserved for the female lead in an oldtime picture or play is almost campy in its excess but fits the way the gay Maugham would have seen the main character.

Anne Baxter is wonderful as the alcoholic and doomed Sophie bringing the right kind of callow innocence to the part at the beginning and then worldly weariness at the end. Webb does his usual effete gay character the kind he played before this in Laura and then many times afterward.The production is studiobound. The sets look like sets the exteriors are unconvincing. Real locations Paris the Himalayas might have added much to this film and made it seem less claustrophobic as would color though the black and white photography is exceptional. The music is overdone even for its time as if the producer realized the picture just wasn't making it and urged Newman on Write MORE music! which is loud a lot of the time and quotes Brahms and Wagner to excess perhaps to add profundity to the static proceedings.

	schema:reviewBody "What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? If he had he could have called it The Razor's Edge since the KathaUpanishad tells us The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard. But Maugham decided to stick with the wellbred class and so we have Darryl F. Zanuck's version of Larry Darrell recently returned from WWI carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner. Or as Maugham tells us This is the young man of whom I write. He is not famous. It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature. The Razor's Edge has all of Zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy. It's so earnest so sincere...so selfimportant. As Larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend Isabel played by Gene Tierney his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb and Willie Maugham himself played by Herbert Marshall taking notes. The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton. If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes. Webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb not Elliot Templeton. Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maugham's novel. He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service. He made sure there were welldressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself. The effort is as selfconscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux. Despite Hollywood's view of things in The Razor's Edge I can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay. After nearly twoandahalf hours we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale. He's going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face. My dear Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get. I don't think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him. You see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he's got it! Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine. Maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.".

If he had he could have called it The Razor's Edge since the KathaUpanishad tells us The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard. But Maugham decided to stick with the wellbred class and so we have Darryl F.

	schema:reviewBody "Larry how can you bear to sit here in a backwash when America is living through the most glorious adventure the world has ever known? Isabelle BradleyThese words spoken passionately by the very lovely Gene Tierney summarize the intense conflict that the two central characters of this excellent movie are forced to endure. While they are undoubtedly attracted to each other in the physical sense Isabelle's fianc Larry Darrell Tyrone Power in what I believe was the best role of his career is in search of the spiritual meaning of life itself. He returns from service in World War I profoundly moved by the heroic and unselfish actions of a fellow soldier who sacrificed his own life in exchange for Larry's during the very final moments of the war. So he's gone and I'm alive. Why? asks Larry. For a dedicated socialite such as Isabelle Larry's noble quest for the very meaning of life is totally beyond her comprehension and therefore unacceptable. I'm young. I want to have fun. Do all the things that people do. We wouldn't have a friend in the world! Isabelle pouts.Instead of selling bonds in Chicago's financial district and mingling among the empty superficial country club set Larry decides to leave Isabelle and Chicago's high society behind traveling first to Paris and then to the Himalayas of India to seek answers to the most profound questions concerning the meaning of life itself. His pursuit becomes the focus of his entire existence. With the love of her life gone Isabelle marries Gray Maturin John Payne a wealthy securities broker but do they live happily ever after?In the meantime Larry's lifelong childhood pal Sophie McDonald Anne Baxter survives a horrible personal tragedy and resorts to alcoholism and prostitution as a remedy for her deep emotional pain. As it turns out half of Chicago including Larry Isabelle Gray their two kids Isabelle's caustic pompous and somewhat bitchy Uncle Eliot Clifton Webb and Sophie turn up in Paris. So who is left in Chicago? Al Capone? At first I believed that Isabelle's persistent attitude merely represented the can do sentiments of many Americans after both world wars until the very dark dimensions of her jealousy and selfishness finally surface. Eventually we see how Isabelle's viewpoint is much more sinister than what we may have originally thought. Instead of focusing on the pressing needs of her family which had been financially shattered by the stock market crash of 1929 another sudden reminder that we're not in 1946 she deliberately and cruelly proceeds to ruin the lives of others. In extreme contrast Larry faithfully follows the advice of his Indian spiritual adviser and returns to Paris from remote Himalayan isolation in order to assist his fellow human beings by use of the enhanced inner knowledge that he had gained there. First he helps Gray recover from the nervous breakdown that resulted from the financial crash and then he attempts to rehabilitate Sophie who sinks deeper and deeper into despair thanks to the indispensable assistance of a shamelessly jealous and selfish Isabelle. The character contrast of former lovers Isabelle and Larry could not be more pronounced at this point.While Judy Garland and Betty Grable both refused the role of Sophie as too depressing Anne Baxter was richly awarded with an Oscar for her outstanding performance. I also enjoyed the alltoobrief and quirky appearance of Elsa Lanchester as the singing Scottish secretary to a magical princess with a spectacular office view of the Riviera. Quite a gig! The leads including Power Tierney Webb and Herbert Marshall as the original novelist W. Somerset Maugham are all excellent. At one point Tierney descends a long staircase in a stunning black gown. Power waiting for her at the bottom declares that she is more beautiful than ever and he is absolutely on the money here. The magnificent musical score of Franz Waxman significantly contributes to the drama from beginning to end. This is a film that very successfully contrasts the serious pursuit of life's deepest meaning against the prevailing social norms of the times. War or no war what is this life all about anyway? No one should ever have to apologize to an often silly and selfabsorbed society for asking the truly important questions concerning the reasons for our being here whether or not any answers can ever be found.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT.....SPOILER ALERTMake no mistake this was one of 20th Century Fox's big productions. The 1.2 million budget led to gross rentals of 5 million. The scenes here are lush although it's a shame they didn't spend just a little more money to film it is color. Fox purchased the film rights from Somerset Maugham for 50000 plus a percent of the net profit. It appears to have been a fairly lavish production. The musical score in part by Alfred Newman is quite impressive and was the original source of the song Mam'selle. The film runs long 145 minutes but it needed to and I give credit to 20th Century Fox for allowing it to.I am updating this review to reflect my recent Blu Ray replacement of the original DVD. The first question that comes up is whether or not the Blu Ray is a significant improvement over the DVD. An improvement in this case yes quite good although at points the film's score seemed just a tad harsh. At any rate it is a good transfer and looks good on widescreen highdef television. Somerset Maugham played here by Herbert Marshall narrates the film and drifts in and out of the story at opportune moments much as he had in 1942's The Moon and Sixpence. As the film begins we see Tyrone Power romancing Gene Tierney. But Powers also wants to explore the meaning of life and travel the world...but Tierney simply wants a proper and wealthy marriage. The fiancs separate and Tierney marries John Payne a millionaire. Mutual friend Sophie Nelson Anne Baxter marries happily but her husband and child are killed in a car accident. Power eventually travels to India where he seeks a deeper understanding of life from a mystic and time in the Himalayas where he becomes enlightened. Power returns to France and becomes friends again with Maugham and Baxter and her husband. An alcoholic Baxter shows up Power decides to marry her but Tierney's scheming results in the death of Baxter. All this comes out at the end of the movie when Power leaves for America never to again see his circle of friends.It's an especially strong performance by Tyrone Power here. He's at his young 32 handsome best here but what's most impressive is that this is one of his most impressive acting performances. His character wants to know what life is all about because of an incident that occurred during WWI it seems clich now but it makes sense here...and frankly always will. It's interesting here how through some vignettes they pack a good sense of Power's character traveling in Europe...and it's hardly the life that Tierney's uncle Clifton Webb intended in his scheming. Gene Tierney comes off as being a very unsympathetic character...but that was the role. Early in the film she stresses her desire that her intended Power be ambitious and while she feels strongly about it rather than seem unreasonable she seems logical. At this point it's simply a question of 2 people whose attitude toward life are simply too different to enter into a marriage. And so she marries another  John Payne. Later she learns that Anne Baxter will marry Tyrone Power and she leads the recovering alcoholic woman into a drunk resulting in suicide. That's when you realize that Tierney's character is evil. But of course she has her comeuppance at the end of the film. John Payne and Anne Baxter played their roles very well and Baxter even won the supporting Oscar for it...although I didn't feel she was that special here. Payne was always a rather pleasant B actor. Baxter here plays a pathetic woman who is handed some tragic events in life and can't handle it. She becomes a slut in a Paris bar...which I found rather far fetched. And then the bombshell  Power is going to marry Baxter and though married herself Tierney is livid. Sophie totally falls off the wagon and ends up murdered. Herbert Marshall is excellent as Maugham although his role is sparse in the first half of the film.Clifton Webb nominated for best supporting actor Oscar here is superb and perhaps never did he play his foppish character quite so well as in this film. Webb's character's demise in the film is a classic. Also worth watching  mostly early in the film  is Lucile Watson as Tierney's mother...a wonderful character actress. Fritz Kortner a Viennese actor has a nice smaller role as a European minerunfrocked priest with a fair amount of wisdom whose talk leads Tyrone Power's character to India. Cecil Humphreys has an interesting role as the holy man in India again a rather small part. Elsa Lanchester has a small but delightful part near the end of the film.Perhaps the biggest fault of the film is the small amount of time spent on Power's character's time in the Indian mountains where he became enlightened. What did he learn there? How did he learn it. It's given short shrift and as such I felt as though an important piece of the character's enlightenment was missing.This is on my DVD shelf! And should be on yours. I have given the film an 8 albeit a weak one because I was disappointed in the segment in India. This film is good enough that it inspired me to seek Maugham's novel but I was dissatisfied for the same reason with the novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tyrone Power's studio gave him an ambitious project when he returned from the wara screen version of Somerset Maugham's 'The Razor's Edge' the story of a man's quest for his spiritual side and salvation. Opposed to his quest is the selfish beautiful Isabel Gene Tierney who marries another man John Payne but later out of jealousy tries to prevent Power's marriage to her friend Sophie Anne Baxter. The best scenes in the film come in the final confrontation between Tierney and Power when she reveals what she has done to help destroy Baxter. Tierney excelled at playing jealous possessive women as in 'Leave Her To Heaven' and her Isabel is just another extension of other such roles. But she is ideal for the part and is strikingly attractive in one of her best roles. Power meets her only half way. His Larry is not quite strong enough to be the protagonist described in the Maugham novel. Other performances are excellent especially Clifton Webb who was nominated for an Oscar as the prissy Elliot Templeton. Anne Baxter is moving as Sophie and deserved her Supporting Role Oscar. But the film although interesting throughout tends to be a rambling overblown story that seems as cold as its central character. We always feel we're outside looking in. It lacks heartbut from what I've heard of the more recent Bill Murray film it is superior to the remake.".

The best scenes in the film come in the final confrontation between Tierney and Power when she reveals what she has done to help destroy Baxter. Tierney excelled at playing jealous possessive women as in 'Leave Her To Heaven' and her Isabel is just another extension of other such roles. But she is ideal for the part and is strikingly attractive in one of her best roles. Power meets her only half way. His Larry is not quite strong enough to be the protagonist described in the Maugham novel. Other performances are excellent especially Clifton Webb who was nominated for an Oscar as the prissy Elliot Templeton. Anne Baxter is moving as Sophie and deserved her Supporting Role Oscar. But the film although interesting throughout tends to be a rambling overblown story that seems as cold as its central character. We always feel we're outside looking in. It lacks heartbut from what I've heard of the more recent Bill Murray film it is superior to the remake.";

	schema:reviewBody "We loved Somerset Maughan's The Razor's Edge as well as the rest of his literary production. In the 1946 film version of the novel Mr. Maughan was asked to help Lamar Trotti with the adaptation which can be considered contains the essence of the book. Darryl F. Zanuck entrusted the direction to Edmund Goulding who made the version of The Razor's Edge a favorite of the movie going public.As a big spectacle The Razor's Edge had a lot going for it. It was Tyrone Power's first starring role after he came home from WWII. Mr. Power was one of the most handsome actors in Hollywood then and now. His looks were a distraction as shown in here. The basic flaw with the movie is the character of Larry Darrell who in the novel is presented in a better view. We don't believe for a moment that this man was interested in nothing else but in his looks and the superficiality of being in the high circles of society of those years.The trip of enlightenment to India in search for the truth is basically poorly handled. The mountain sets look cheap and unrealistic and doesn't add anything to the movie at all. We don't believe for a moment that Larry has gone to work in such menial jobs and the end where he is seen as deck hand in his trip back to America is also completely mishandled. Perhaps with another actor the figure of Larry would have come out stronger and in a more positive way the way Mr. Maughan drew him in the novel.The rest of the players are wonderful. Clifton Webb above all is an elegant Elliott Templeton the witty society figure that is obviously gay but knows a thing or two about his enemies. Elliott is always ahead of the game which in a way doesn't explain well how he becomes so sick and dies in no time but again this is only a minor observation which had to be arranged within the almost two and a half hours of the film.Gene Tierney was a ravishing Isabel Bradley a woman who wanted it all and thought she could have her cake and eat it as well. She refused to marry Larry because his income was a paltry three thousand dollars a year. Horror of horrors how would she buy her Oleg Cassinis shmattes with that amount? She lets Larry go but when he meets him again in Paris she wants him back. Ms. Tierney made a great portrait of this woman with an evil streak in her character.Anne Baxter made a great impression as Sophie. Ms. Baxter was an excellent actress who gets under the skin of her character and runs away with it. The fact that Sophie is a prostitute is handled the Hollywood way not dwelling on it as the studio people want to keep the status quo of a woman who is seen in an Apache dive in the Paris of those years before the war.The rest of the cast is splendid. Herbert Marshall plays the author himself Somerset Maughan the man who is the connection among all the characters and situations. Lucile Watson makes another elegant society woman in the film something she knew how to play well. Elsa Lanchester that delightful actress is only seen for a moment but she is absolutely perfect as the flighty secretary to the princess that has slighted Elliott Templeton. John Payne plays his part a bit on the wooden side but as a society man what else could he do?The music by Alfred Newman is an asset throughout the film. Mr. Newman always knew what fitted best. The music fits well the proceedings. Best of all the scene at the low class bar where Mamselle is heard in the background.While Edmound Goulding's The Razor's Edge is flawed it still packs a tremendous impact which we have to recognize it wasn't as great on this the second viewing of the film. Yet the film will satisfy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Delight has no Competitor so it is always most. Emily Dickinson's epigram satisfyingly describes the sublime last film of Franois Truffaut Vivement Dimanche! 1983 Finally Sunday aka Confidentially Yours. It's a Hitchcockian thriller shot in black  white with A Man and A Woman Trois Colours Rouge Jean Louis Trintignant as the man suspected of murders and Fanny Ardant as his dedicated secretary going all out to investigate on her own. It's becoming my best favorite Truffaut film besides Fahrenheit 451 1966 and Stolen Kisses 1968. Delightful comic rhythm they have Ardant and Trintignant together impeccably delivered this fun thriller like a dance between Astaire and Rogers. Truffaut's thoughtful details abound. There's the dedication to Stanley Kubrick at Cinema Eden we see poster of his 1957's Paths of Glory which was once banned in France. There's mention of Vietnamese Restaurant. Ah the Rear Window feeling when the pair poked around entering a stranger's apartment. There's the use of Le Provenal car. And the 'killer' from Barbara's angle we see the feet but not the face  who could it be?  The variety of women characters married woman divorced woman madam sinister dealer secretarial applicant and Barbara. Barbara is a brunette who looks dumb and smart all at once insecure about herself yet so confident in her deductions bold not shy she's obstinately determined to get the 'killer' so to prove her boss Trintignant's Julien whom she secretly loves innocent. Ardant is Barbara personified. It's so cool watching her moves and energetic responses with Trintignant matching her steps. A truly colorful black and white lighthearted mystery. The fun is in the dialog and the repartee between the characters including the detectives and the many phone calls. The delight is in the plot movement suspenseful intrigue upon intrigue continuing humor and surprise after surprise as we follow Ardant and Trintignant even a kiss has a 'movie' reason.Absolutely satisfying cinematic affair it is entertaining complete with a melodic end music from Georges Delerue to go with the playful imagery behind the credits roll. I succumb this is my best loved Truffaut film Vivement Dimanche!P.S. At times it brings to mind Woody Allen's 1993 Manhattan Murder Mystery while certain angles of Fanny Ardant reminds one of Geena Davis' profile.".

One can only think if Truffaut had lived longer what other genres he might have explored since this was such a wonderful example of not only the genre itself but also of his brilliant style of filmmaking for generations to share forever. God bless Francois Truffaut!";

	schema:reviewBody "Confidentially is truly one of the very best fun mysteries. FranklyI don't quite understand how some do not seem to understand that this is just a wonderful way to pass a couple of hours. It certainly is not necessary to analyze each and every minute of the picture. I suppose that most of us have a few films which we always remember and continually go back to contemplate. This is Confidentially. I have it on a quite old VHS and probably watch it at least once every few months. There are so many wonderful aspects. So very different from the run of the mill. I can watch over and over again the opening scene walking with the dog or the closing playing with the lens cap. What incredible music. Interesting in another Truffaut film the leg walking scene is vividly portrayed. Ardant is one of those very special French artists that never seem to change or for that matter age. Twenty years after this film she starred in Nathalie and Callas. She still is extremely beautiful. I sure would like to figure out just what is the French secret. Danielle Darrieux is still making pictures at 93. It has been more than 50 years since Jean Louis Trintignant became famous after his Brigitte Bardot film. BTW  there are so very many ever so interesting small pieces in Confidentially. One I really like is the one about the girl who comes to the office for a secretarial job interview. This picture is now 27 years old. Will we have to wait another 27 years for another perfectly coordinated and exquisitely designed film to appear?".

The leads are pitch perfect Fanny Ardant as Barbara is just wonderful putting layers into the role the further into the seedy underworld she goes whilst JeanLouis Trintignant feeds off Ardant's lead and gives a gusto and perfectly wrought turn to savour shot in classic black  white to add to the flavour of the genre the film is a sure fire winner and the ending is tops as well 910.".

Such was the choice of Francois Truffaut one of the champions of the New Wave movement and a fervent admirer of director Alfred Hitchcock to translate the story into a French one paying homage to his idol as he only knew how. The result was a film a step below of his great movies.The story is about Jean Vercel a real estate agent who is a suspect for killing both his wife MarieChristine and her lover. Vatel goes to hide in his office and engages his secretary Barbara who is secretly in love with her boss to do the investigating as he wants to clear his name. It is clear that Barbara has a knack for getting to the bottom of the problem to help the man she loves.Truffaut shot the film in black and white. He worked on the screenplay with two writers he had worked before Suzanne Schiffman and Jean Aurel. The result is a movie that was more a product of the way he felt about Hitchcock and in many respects also an homage to Stanley Kubrick whom he also admired than a deeply felt film. To prove how he felt about Kubrick he has Barbara at one point ask a cinema ticket seller whether Paths of Glory is a love story. Mr. Truffaut must have been sick while involved in the project because he died shortly after it was finished.Fanny Ardant is the best excuse for watching the movie. She plays Barbara the secretary that wants to exonerate her boss and acts as a detective. Jean Louis Trintignant is the accused man Jean Vercel in a role that didn't do much for him. This film was also a tribute to Ms. Ardant and the way the director felt about her.".

It's the kind of nobrainer where in the last reel having seen no prior evidence of it Ardant can say to Trintignant with a straight face that she's been madly in love with him all along.

Here we're asked to stomach the fact that a man JeanLouis Trintignant wanted for murder would be able to hide out in his own Real Estate office almost indefinitely whilst his secretary Ardant is out solving the crime whilst the police fail even to stake out his office. It's the kind of nobrainer where in the last reel having seen no prior evidence of it Ardant can say to Trintignant with a straight face that she's been madly in love with him all along. See it for Ardant.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film with some editing and a slight rewrite could have been a fantastic film. I wonder if Truffaut's declining health he died of cancer right after this was completed perhaps had something to do with the roughness of the plotthere were too many plot holes to keep me engaged. Over and over throughout the film the characters reacted WRONGLY to a given situationoften in VERY illogical ways. Let me point out a few examples 1. When the main character confronts his wife about her adulteries she admits it and treats him like dirt I mean she is REALLY obnoxious about it. Then seconds later the police arrive and she asks him to tell the police she is not home. Fine. But then he DOES EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAIDeven though any normal person wouldn't have given a rat's behind for her based on the previous scene AND because his lying to the police only served to implicate him for murder! 2. When the accused man's secretary returns after going to Nice to find clues the man responds by slapping herwhen she is trying to save his sorry butt! Then she doesn't even get angry or yell at him for physically abusing her! This whole scene made no sense. Perhaps the French treat their women like that but I seriously doubt it.3. A romance suddenly materializes just before the film ends. Where it came from and why it occurs makes no sense at all. For more info see 2 above! So in summary the movie has an excellent overall plot but is just too full of holes and logical errors to make it anything better than an average film. That's a shame because I'm sure Truffaut was capable of better.FYIOne little thing I really DID like about the film is the priest who gets decked towards the middle of the film. When he reappears I had to laugh out loud!".

	schema:reviewBody "The subversion here is that this is one of the Hitchcock Wrong Man type of movies where a character in his films it was always a man since I suppose that was his only real frame of reference when it came to these complicated thrillers as far as who the audience could see themselves in but the one who is really figuring everything out and doing all of the hard work is Fanny Ardant's character. One might want to feel bad that Trintagnant is in this position of needing to prove his innocence but for much of the film he seems to be in his own office hiding away while Ardant goes off to Nice pretends to be a streetwalker follows suspicious characters and does all the work that one usually sees someone with authority do. Of course Ardant's Barbara isn't some professional at this and gets thrown into the thick of this mystery as much as Julien. But it's just the clever twist Truffaut and writer and longtime collaborator Suzanne Schiffman found adapting this book we actually can have strong and quickminded women who can solve a case bit by bit  in this case as we see a little acting training helps the learning curve  and I was impressed by just how much Truffaut puts on Ardant's shoulders to carry. When I got the DVD I thought it would be the typical thing of it being Tritignant's movie with his lady friend by his side again think back to 39 Steps and North by Northwest for that template. So while Truffaut and Almendros get rich black and white photography of this story setting it in a mood moreso than a specific time some of Barbara's clothes cant be mistaken for being from after 1980 the film has a solid progressive undercurrent to it all. She has total agency and Ardant is charming assertive and compelling in her performance Tritignant is good too though after a while I found his demeanor kind of one note  she carries much more of the charm between him though he does try.Is some of this a little light or too reliant on those aha those two names match snap fingers! beats? Absolutely. That's part of the fun though and if you key into it then theres not too much one needs to intellectualize about what goes on unless one wants to read even deeper into the gender politics of it all how women have to but also chose to act in a number of ways when its this male dominated sortascuzzy French crime world of the movies. What cant help but be brought up as so many have done is that this was Truffaut's final movie. It never has that feel of being some total allencompassing statement to me about Truffaut and his beloved Hitch. One can certainly try to read it that way but I doubt he knew what was to come that would take him from the world so tragically young he was 51 52 I think he was 50 when this came out. While I wouldn't rank what is Confidentially Yours as a light though not necessarily overly comic twisty dramaticthriller as one of his finest to his credit he didn't go out slumming it either if anything its style helps make it so that if one wanted to go from say Shoot the Piano Player right into this the quality wouldn't be a terrible drop off.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I have often pointed out in several reviews Franois Truffaut is far from being prominent in my canon of favorite French filmmakers of all time. I have always thought that he was one of the most overrated ones and he contributed in making me hate the New Wave and its pretensions. Les 400 coups 1959 is a very academic work. Jules et Jim 1962 has not worn very well and its innovative camera work couldn't conceal the extreme unlikeliness of the story. I also pass in silence the Antoine Doinel saga starring stiff JeanPierre Laud. However there are some palatable flicks in Truffaut's filmography l'Enfant Sauvage 1970 a very harrowing sensitive work l'Argent De Poche 1976 a delightful children's realm and this one Vivement Dimanche! 1983 his last opus before he passed away the following year.It was not the first time Truffaut had tried a stab at handling the detective genre. Tirez Sur Le Pianiste 1960 la Marie Etait en noir 1968 la Sirne Du Mississippi 1969 gave soso results but Vivement Dimanche! is far more gripping and enjoyable than the three quoted films. An estate agent Julien Vercel Jean Louis Trintignant is suspected of having murdered his wife and his lover. He has to hide in his workplace and her secretary Barbara Fanny Ardant investigates about this mystery and leads her to reconstitute Barbara's murky past. Julien confides to Barbara that he knew very well his wife but in the same time he didn't want to know her hidden face. He'll however discover it.With his 21st longfeature movie Truffaut wanted to pay a tribute to one of his masters Sir Alfred Hitchcock and also to the detective films with which he grew up. The Truffaut insiders surely know that he was a big fan of the master of suspense in the 1960's Truffaut published a book in which through a series of interviews he related the work he did in his prestigious filmography. In our present movie Hitchockian references are evident with for example winks at Rear Window 1954 Truffaut's favorite film from Hitchcock or Dial M For Murder 1954. And some objects play a vital role for the evolution of the plot like in some Hitchcock's works the telephone among others.Truffaut's movie conciliates two sub genres of the detective film the whodunit and the film noir the film takes place in the south of France where it is usually sunny but here quite a lot of scenes takes place at night enjoys a solidly structured plot with the usual ingredients of the genre wrong culprit shady places a gripping investigation with the scattering of clues revealing Barbara's past and leading to the resolution of the plot. Actually one could have an inkling about Barbara's and her lover's murderer. What matters is why he killed them. Then Truffaut's work is also served with genteel camera work and especially there's humor which isn't in general his forte. But here it works. My favorite moment would be when Barbara is in front of the brothel a passerby Excuse me. How Much? Barbara Pardon? How much? it's twentyfive to eight. And of course Truffaut couldn't make a work without inserting movieloving details. The cinema plays the Stanley Kubrick film Paths of Glory 1958.The cast? It's immaculate. Fanny Ardant Mrs Truffaut at the time is excellent as well as Jean Louis Trintignant. But the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Each actor who acts a colorful character makes his or her part count.What is puzzling is that Truffaut hated Sundays. It's mysterious why he entitled his last movie with something he disliked. Was he contemplating retirement? Perhaps not since after he wrote the script for la Petite Voleuse which was about to be directed by Claude Miller in 1988 with gratifying results. But Fanny Ardant sighs in the film I can't wait to be on Sunday. It's true that in the film it's a complete change of life. She acts more like a detective than a secretary and it may be grueling to try to resolve a mystery. So Sunday is eagerly awaited. Anyway Truffaut began his cinema career with an overrated work les 400 coups. He will have ended it with a buoyant one.".

This one's a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock featuring Hitchcockian themes throughout and it has a lightness of touch similar to Hitch's work of the 1930s. However in the heavy hands of Truffaut I found it something of a chore to watch the director's approach is to eke out every little bit of every little scene and the result is longwinded and oddly seriously despite the lightness of the subject matter. It's as if the director has been so painstaking that all the fun is taken out of the production.".

	schema:headline " An intriguing movie that falls flat at the end";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the last of Truffaut's films and he died less than two months after its completion. I think the rush job at the end of this film seems to suggest that it was quickly finished as not much thought seemed to be put into it to tie everything together. Vivement Dimanche is a murder mystery set in modern times but it has been done in black and white to give the appearance of antiquity. The movie is timeless in the way that props have been used and that most of the scenes occur indoors rather than out. As one watches the film it is understandable if one were to think that Vivement Dimanche was a much older film than it actually is.A man's friend is shot dead while both are out hunting but the man does not see it and all he knows is that his car has been left wide open. When he returns to his realestate office he is brought in for questioning and learns that his wife was having and affair with the victim and he is the prime suspect. He confronts his wife after receiving an anonymous and abusive phone call but forgives her. He then returns to the police station and during this time his wife is murdered. Thus he goes into hiding while his secretary who was on the verge of being fired because she allegedly had a fight with his wife decides to help him out and clear his name.This film is a real mystery as we learn that his wife doesn't run a beauty parlour in Nice but rather a brothel. As we dig deeper we find that there are some strange characters working at the cinema that turn up in the brothel and we also learn that the man's wife is not really who she claims to be. In some ways this movie is quite far fetched because the main character seems to be quite ignorant to the deep plots that all of his apparently close friends are tied up to. His wife's name is not her name and the marriage that he thought was real is only fake. His friend is a major player in a prostitution ring and his lawyer seems to have a lot to do with it as well.As is typical of mysteries the real criminal must be one of the characters that we know in the movie. There is little evidence brought up during the movie to point to a particular character nor does any seem to make much of an appearance. In one way Truffaut has managed to keep us guessing as to what is going on which I though was good. I was riveted to the movie to find out what was actually happening but I felt the end was very disappointing. It seemed to throw all of the interesting threads that had appeared into a basket with no common tie. Truffaut could have extended the movie a bit further so as to create a much plausible ending and dropped more evidence to point to the real murderer than the lame trick he uses and the murderer confessing straight out anyway.".

The cinematography is lush the music is warm and hearty and the script is fresh and furious.

It touches on primal fears territory survival fear shame love and jealousy and it delivers moral commentary on all of the above.  Did I also mention that this movie is a thriller too?  Hopkins is at his best as the calm and thoughtful Charles Morse billionaire and bored with his ivory tower lifestyle.  His counterpart Mr. Baldwin is a slimy and petty fashion photographer Bob Green.  The interaction between the two shows a middleground that is brilliant in contrast.  Hopkins is a father figure to Baldwin's brash young frenzied Bob.  The competition between the two to survive and ultimately return to civilization and Charles' wife sets the stage for a complex and thoughful character drama.  Bart the Bear is a star indeed and while this movie is marketed for having Jaws with Claws there is SO much more depth and detail to this movie.  This is easily in my top 10 films of all time.  It connected with me and I hope you enjoy it too.  10 out of 10!Best Line CHARLES I have always wanted to do something that was... that was unequivocal".

First of all it delivers as an actionadventure film which is what it is by giving the audience some heart stopping sequences and it never slows down.  The Edge also delivers as a dramatic film with an ending that is painfully sad yet satisfying.  This is one fine movie and the performances by Hopkins one of my favorite actors today and Baldwin are superb.  They portray their characters with an honesty and with a realistic nature that only great actors can accomplish.  As the plot twists and the pace picks up you start to become so involved that you forget time is passing by. I strongly suggest this one to action lovers and to anyone who enjoys a good story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Edge is not interesting just because it's a well made survival thriller. The behind the scenes events on the film are pretty interesting too especially the fact that it was filmed in such difficult conditions that star Hopkins developed life threatening pneumonia midway through the production.The story tells of a shy but intelligent billionaire Hopkins who is married to a stunning model MacPherson. Unbeknown to him his wife is unhappy in their relationship and has been having her wicked way with a photographer Baldwin. All three of them plus a whole lot more find themselves in the wilds of Alaska for a photograph shoot but things go horribly wrong when a plane carrying Hopkins and Baldwin crashes in the middle of the wilderness. They must use every bit of practical skill and common sense they possess to survive until they can be found and to make matters even worse they become the prey of a roaming grizzly bear.Some of the man .vs. bear scenes are the most terrifying scenes of people tackling dangerous animals ever put on film. The increasingly strained relationship between Hopkins and Baldwin as each reveals more of their secrets to the other is very well played and creates some genuinely tense moments. The backdrop of Alaskan wilderness is pleasing to the eye throughout the whole film. There's nothing really wrong with The Edge at all it's a well made interestingly told and often exciting survival thriller. The only drawbacks it has are minor such as MacPherson's inexpressive performance and a few boring stock characters in the small roles. Well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's exceedingly easy to see how some people might not like this film. The most frequent reason in my opinion is that some just don't 'get it'. While busy focusing on pointing out rather trivial and nitpicky things they are so far off the central point and weight of what the film is truly offering that the most rewarding aspects are lost on them.Firstly a very interesting and off center look into survival in the wilderness. Unconventional in the way that any alternate in what I would consider Hollywood version of this film would feature mostly everything taking place in that exotic cabin where this menacing digital bears cuts the power and kills people off one by one because they left food out. Instead we are taken deep into the wilderness for real with no comfort or nearby home base to return to. Decisions made don't feel forced they feel natural and logical. At no point was I compelled to yell obscenities at the screen protesting character stupidityleg cut excluded. Much of the Bear chase presented immediate solutions with no choice to the point where the most illogical choice to actually make a stand and kill this bear becomes the ONLY choice for all other options have expired.Secondly upon close inspection of the performances the acting is spot on. I'd call the performances far from wooden! I think they were heartfelt highenergy and consistent. Of course if you aren't paying attention certainly it would seem as though Alec Baldwin's character Bob shifts toward the end as he 'turns' on Anthony Hopkins' character Charles with his attempt to kill him. However it doesn't take much more than an above 8th grade level of comprehension to get that Bob has been cynically plotting to kill Charles far before the film even begins. That scene in the cabin was simply his chance to finally unburden his feelings toward the situation and justify what he was about to domade final by the For All The Nights discovery. Upon watching the film a second time through it's evident that Bob was able to suppress the impending deed which in my opinion was something he thought he HAD to do in the end for the more imminent task of survival and even taking those feelings and burying them for the time being.There is also an interesting element of male bonding in the face of adversitynot overcoming the vices and evils that cement Bob to his ultimate deed. Also impressive was the extensive knowledge yet honest innocence of Charles being something of a recluse from conventional thinking. To the end giving Bob the benefit of the doubt as a man worth preserving such a sad tale of a very lonely rich mannever feel sorry for a man that owns a plane indeed two men who through this experience could have been friends if not for the complexity of their 'other' lives back in civilization. That said Bob's reasoning was justified to Bob and I could understand his position and motives.Bobs confrontation of Charles in the clearing tells a very deep rooted stereotype he has for the wealthy class not really getting that Charles was at the very least an exception to that rule if not a shining example of what was the better human being. In any case Bob felt as though he was entitled to Mickey moreso than Charles even implying that Mickey and he would be together if not for Charles' wealth. This hatred remained too deep to ignore even after their experience.And I'm sorry but to see that fundamental standup and confidence chant what one man can do another can do despite lingering fear in Bobs face gets me saying hell yeah each and every time. One of the party having already suffered death and devouring by this behemoth the fight was believable as rational thought ended up being the key. Horribly outmatched they owed a lot to courage and luck. In my opinion the film became sobering upon the death of their friend by the bear and I always breath a sigh of relief watching that bear laying there dead the two exhausted men leaning against it out of breath as we swallow what we just went through.Thus survival at that point was over and resolved in my opinion. These men could survive in the wilderness having passed what I thought to be an ultimate test. I also believe that after the bear slaying more time had elapsed than a lot of reviewers give credit for. The fact that they made clothing food and other things out of the bear to me marked the passage of a good deal of time.What I also saw was a very natural and gradual unraveling of their character as the experience wore on them until the core of things finally prevailed in the end. And it wasn't the deceit or even the cheating. It was in the end about two men one dying justly yet somehow I felt sad to see him go. Because on what turned out to be his death bed he offered Mickey's innocence in this business of doing Charles in. An act of virtue from a character who had previously only acted in his own interest got to me. Plus Charles' bond to him was enough to put me on his side and root for this attempted murderer to live.In my opinion the depth scope and insight into darker aspects of the human condition go largely unnoticed in this film for people go in expecting bears Baldwin and Hollywood and usually only see what they expect to see. No more no less. I feel that this film was nicely filled out packed with little things I loved and fundamental things that moved and entertained me. I hate to see relatively highbrow stuff being overlooked and passed off as lowbrow but I suppose The Edge remains a sleeper.".

The wilds of Alaska are probably one of the last great otherworlds of our planet. And Anthony Hopkins has always been one of the best looking actors out there to me. So now you've got a cool looking guy playing a brain yowza!! a rich one at that and some beautiful scenery. A flock of wild geese bring down the plane. From that point on it's nonstop action. ANY time you think that these men might make it out of there here comes BART to prove otherwise! I love how Bart the grizzly is just relentless!! He is determined to eat these fellows or at least one of them. Go Bart!  eat the liberal watch him run  Ah it's a great story and acted very well.I do in all honesty feel sorry for the grizzly bear. I don't care how much his real life trainers may say he loves them I just can't see keeping a creature like that as a pet confined and domesticated. They are magnificent creatures who should be respected  aka left alone . I would feel the same way seeing a human kept very well in a Martian zoo. It's just not right.In the end Charles Hopkins walks up to his wife who he has learned has been seriously unfaithful to him. He lets her know that he knows. But then when asked by the reporter about the other man Baldwin who we as the audience know was trying to kill Charles Charles states that Baldwin saved my life. Okay what does that mean? does it mean that Baldwin pointed out to Charles what a farce his marriage was and the truth has set him free? Or that through his experience with Baldwin and with Bart that he now feels complete as a human knowing that he survived in the deep forest using only his brains and instinct? If anyone knows the answer as to how Baldwin saved his life please let me in. thanks!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a revelation!  When it was on general release in the cinema I gave it a wide berth.  I can't remember why probably the combination of a weak title Alec Baldwin in a starring role and a really unimaginative trailer. I've just seen it on a 14inch TV screen and am so sorry I didn't catch it on the big screen or even a 26inch TV!.David Mamet can write but he knows his place! This is an action adventure movie and so Mamet is not trying to make any great philosophical point. He does provide a wide variety of thematic ingredients man V nature youth V age brains V brawn machismo infidelity to ensure that the story line is far more interesting than most of Hollywood's actionmovie schlock. And of course a furry killing machine that can smell a man from 10 miles and run through the forest at 30 mph!Charles Anthony Hopkins' erudite billionaire character starts out as the vulnerable isolated character of the film.  He's married to Mickey his photomodel wifeElle can act herself! flirts quite openly with Bob the handsome younger photographer Baldwin. Charles seems set up for a fall. In his selfeffacing way he confesses to knowing a lot in theory but not being great at practical application.So when the plane crashes into an icy lake Charles is the one for whom you most fear but that's when all the surprises start..........The biggest disappointment for me is that a fine actor such as Harold Perrineau finds himself playing a role that is a classical Hollywood clich the nice black guy who gets killed.  When are they going to cut this crap out?  Either kill the guy in the crash or give him a character but don't just make him plot fodder.  Seeing Stephen Perrineau with the other two on the lake shore you just knew he would have all the longevity in this film as James Bond's first female conquest.  As David Mamet doesn't share the writing credits with a studio committee or an executive producer I suppose he has to take responsibility.That said this is a really gripping film.  Well directed photographed and acted even by Baldwin!. And the bear!  How long do you have?The shots where you from Charles point of view are staring down the roaring bear's throat and can see his uvula through an emerging cloud of steamy breath are just brilliant.  I could almost smell that bear. I believe they made extensive use of prosthetics.  Excellent FX!".

I can't remember why probably the combination of a weak title Alec Baldwin in a starring role and a really unimaginative trailer.

Well it's actually very well shot and some very nice writing by Mamet.Many people probably haven't even heard of this picture the title is uninspiring but the film isn't.The direction is superb the widescreen frame is filled with details and characters use the 2.351 scope very well. The film is shot with the cinema screen in mind not pan and scan. The photography is beautiful the landscape comes alive sometimes it steals the picture away from the characters.The acting is fine but sometimes a bit more meat was  required in the middle of the picture. I don't think the actors had enough depth but overall not bad.The picture is about survival and that's all I will say.The final frames are disappointing should've been handled better.The director did a terrific job capturing the Alaska terrain.As usual please view this picture in widescreen otherwise people you would have only seen 57 of the picture. There is only one way to enjoy the photography  and that's in widescreen.".

Very nicely done.Music score directing and acting are all top notch as well...doesn't get much better than Hopkins and Baldwin. And especially Bart The Bear RIP. I've watched several documentaries of Bart and his owner Doug Seus. Bart knew when the camera's were rolling and when to turn on the juice in acting ferocious. Nothing scarier than a 1000 pound Kodiak bear stalking you through the woods wanting to eat you.No spoilers highly recommended one of my all time favorite movies.".

I like to call it a rare movie that showcases a fantastic cast who all have good chemistry throughout and tell a good story  all this without being overly known.The story isn't an Oscar winning one but what is refreshing about this particular story compared to others is that it can be related to real life experience. They are in a real wilderness facing a real bear not a CGI monster looking to destroy everything in it's path. The story also allows for strong character development throughout as Charles puts his theoretical knowledge into more practical use. With Bob is a tad different as we slowly see his evil ways as the story progresses but ultimately leaves being somewhat of a resurrected 'good guy' after his plans to kill Charles backfire. Stephen just seems to be the likable character with a few funny jokes to keep himself in the loop of the movie but was always ultimately going to die in the movie. It also truly shows the motif of the panther and the rabbit shown in the movie. We are to believe that the symbolism refers to the bear and the three men but it is more deeply referring to Charles and Bob. We see this in the end where Bob is ready to carry out his plans and end Charles however Charles in the face of death comfortably smokes his invisible pipe and turns the tables on Bob. A forgiving man he is as he spares Bob's life and helps him in the end. A sad ending where it seems that just when all was forgiven Bob decides there is no more left for him in the world and dies. Overall the story is great and I find it to be very original and not mainstream. Everything ties together well from the beginning to the middle to the conclusion.One of the things that make this movie so underrated is the acting namely from Hopkins and Baldwin who give a performance that continue to compliment each others characters. The acting portrays everything a good movie should happiness sadness deceit betrayal triumph forgiveness and motivation. I'm gonna kill the bear! That scene alone summarises just how great the acting was from Hopkins and Baldwin throughout the film. Charles is knowledgeable mentally strong and for the most part soft spoken and reassuring  Hopkins portrays his character to perfection. Bob is arrogant cocky and conniving but in the end remorseful and is displayed excellently but Baldwin from beginning to end. Overall a great acting performance that I believe should have been award winning.The movie as a whole works tremendously well with good chemistry between the characters and fantastic directing and cinematography. For what seems to be a lower budget film it is definitely up there with the best actionthriller movies past and present.".

They battle of wits and the fighting of the elements is fodder for screenwriter David Mamet who has produced more interesting dialog than this for sure. The third star is the Kodiak bear who gets a huge credit line at the end and who unites at least sometimes the two men in the cold isolation of Alaska.But let's face it as much fun as this is this is thin going. It even looks a bit like a slightly adult version of a Disney adventure film with people bonding and conflicting as needed. In fact if you start comparing this movie to others like it there are a few you might even consider the television series Lost which is at least more imaginative and fullblooded in its writing. Or just survival in the mountains you might check out Touching the Void.I just saw the old Spencer Tracy movie Mountain this week and it is a weird precursor to this one minus the bear. That is two people facing the elements have very different ideas of morality and of trust. Like that movie this newer one doesn't explore the conflict of personae or ethics very far giving only what are the obvious differences. That's not enough for a feature length affair.Which brings us back to Baldwin and Hopkins. They are actually enough to hold you in for the duration. You really do hope they survive and if you wince at some of the dialog and at the appearance of bear traps at all the wrong moments you can get into the drama of it pretty well. And into the scenery. Amazing stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Morse Anthony Hopkins a billionaire with photographic memory and two other men Robert Bob Green Alec Baldwin a photographer and Stephen Harold Perrineau his assistant arrive in a remote North America along with Charles's muchyounger wife Mickey Elle Macpherson a fashion model. The group is only there for a photo shoot and staying as guests at a lodge they later are recruited to another area due to a sick model. After their plane crashes the men attempt to hike to a more likely search area only to find that a male Kodiak bear is stalking them. They elude it but later the bear attacks their camp and kills Stephen.The angles of the movie were spectacular it made you feel like you were out in the woods. Seeing the actors in this environment makes you want to put on a coat to watch the movie. A very strong performance by all the actors in a film that deals with using bare instincts on fighting wild animals staying alive from the elements and morality. I can understand why some of the more modern audience might find that to be a turnoff. The sets and locations alone are worth a rental. The photography is beautiful the landscape comes alive and sometimes it steals the picture away from the characters.Very strong performances by Anthony Hopkins Bart the Bear and Alec Baldwin Not only were they great but they were troopers with the set. Anthony Hopkins got a severe case of pneumonia while filming out in the cold I'm a huge fan so his performance was fantastic he can go from a city guy to survival and make it believable. His character was well portrayed and a flawless performance. Alec Baldwin also did a great job in this movie. And I can't say that I was a big fan of Alec before this movie I have only seen him in comedy but I have a better opinion of him now. Elle McPherson has a small role which she played well and portrayed her character very well.A gripping storyline fantastic scenery and a real sense of drama and survival it delivers as an actionadventure film by giving some heart stopping sequences and it never slows down. The Edge also delivers as a dramatic film with an ending that is painfully sad yet satisfying. They portray their characters with honesty and with a realistic nature that only great actors can accomplish. As the plot twists and the pace picks up you start to become so involved that you forget time is passing by. I strongly suggest this one to action lovers and to anyone who enjoys a good story.".

	onyx:emotionText "Charles Morse Anthony Hopkins a billionaire with photographic memory and two other men Robert Bob Green Alec Baldwin a photographer and Stephen Harold Perrineau his assistant arrive in a remote North America along with Charles's muchyounger wife Mickey Elle Macpherson a fashion model. The group is only there for a photo shoot and staying as guests at a lodge they later are recruited to another area due to a sick model. After their plane crashes the men attempt to hike to a more likely search area only to find that a male Kodiak bear is stalking them. They elude it but later the bear attacks their camp and kills Stephen.The angles of the movie were spectacular it made you feel like you were out in the woods. Seeing the actors in this environment makes you want to put on a coat to watch the movie. A very strong performance by all the actors in a film that deals with using bare instincts on fighting wild animals staying alive from the elements and morality. I can understand why some of the more modern audience might find that to be a turnoff. The sets and locations alone are worth a rental. The photography is beautiful the landscape comes alive and sometimes it steals the picture away from the characters.Very strong performances by Anthony Hopkins Bart the Bear and Alec Baldwin Not only were they great but they were troopers with the set. Anthony Hopkins got a severe case of pneumonia while filming out in the cold I'm a huge fan so his performance was fantastic he can go from a city guy to survival and make it believable. His character was well portrayed and a flawless performance. Alec Baldwin also did a great job in this movie. And I can't say that I was a big fan of Alec before this movie I have only seen him in comedy but I have a better opinion of him now. Elle McPherson has a small role which she played well and portrayed her character very well.A gripping storyline fantastic scenery and a real sense of drama and survival it delivers as an actionadventure film by giving some heart stopping sequences and it never slows down. The Edge also delivers as a dramatic film with an ending that is painfully sad yet satisfying. They portray their characters with honesty and with a realistic nature that only great actors can accomplish. As the plot twists and the pace picks up you start to become so involved that you forget time is passing by. I strongly suggest this one to action lovers and to anyone who enjoys a good story.";

The bear is simply awesome how can they make them act like this its almost impossible.

	schema:reviewBody "I would place this film in the top five of Abbott and Costello's films and the best film they made in the 1950s. It gets very good marks for excellent special effect as well as a clever story. It's one of several monster films Bud and Lou made for Universal Studioshaving also done movies with Dracula Frankenstein the WolfMan Dr. Jekyll and the Mummy. All of these films were among their better filmsgreat fun and a nice break from the usual Abbott and Costello formula. And speaking of formula since this was made later in their careers the original formula including lots of song and dance numbers and a side romantic plot was abandoned and the film was pure comedy.The film begins with the boys graduating from detective college. When Lou wonders how he managed to graduate Bud says that he slipped them a few bucks! Their first case involves a desperate man that comes for help. Tommy is a boxer who is accused of murder. He's on the run from the police and hopes Bud and Lou can help. Bud is only concerned with turning him in for a reward and Lou is his usual nice but wimpy selfhe just wants to stay out of trouble. Just before the police nab Tommy he injects himself with an invisibility formula. Now it's a matter of the doctor coming up with an antidote before the formula drives him made. It's also a matter of proving his innocence so he's able to once again show his face! The movie has a lot of excellent invisibility special effects and these are done very well. About the only thing that is rather cheesy are the effects at the very end as well as the plot involving Lou posing as a pro boxer with invisible Tommy taking pokes at his opponent. They didn't even try to do these scenes well and Lou obviously wasn't doing much of the punching. People said wow he punches fast but I just thought that looked a bit dopey. Still considering how well made the rest of the film is I can't complain. It's yet another one of the team's excellent Universal monster films and one any fan must see. Others probably will have a few laughs as well.".

A dinner sequence with the Invisible Man quite drunk and a card game later which itself is mindblowing how well they were pulled off in the time stand as highlights as well. A couple of very humorous wordplays at the beginning provide some more laughs especially an interrogation scene that is falldown funny. The effects are topnotch as well and easily steal the show from the comedy. Whenever we see the Invisible Man we are treated to showstoppers. Here we are allowed to see the transparent pugilist through steam leaking out of a radiator and the effect is very impressive for one main example. A later sequence at the end which was echoed to similar results in Hollow Man are just as effective and mindboggling as they were back then. The fastplot doesn't get too complicated and serves as a backdrop for their brand of gags and wordplay and it easily entertains because of it.The Bad News I really didn't find much not to like here. Sure the fastmoving plot is pretty similar to The Invisible Man Returns but it's easily forgiven. It's not one to think to hard about to figure out and it's been mistakenly called as such. The main thing I can tell from this is that it follow in the footsteps of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and while any film that would follow that one have big shoes to fill this one is unjustly criticized because of it.The Final Verdict This is a refreshing return to the fun and fantasy that buoyed their earlier features.

He's Arthur Franz promising heavyweight fighter accused of killing his manager. Franz is innocent and he hasn't any time to look for references.Franz himself has a scheme.

But there sure are a lot of laughs.The funniest scene is of course the prize fight where Costello aided by Franz goes into the ring with the fighter Franz was supposed to take a dive against. Second funniest is mob moll Adele Jergens trying to seduce Costello. Other good performances are Sheldon Leonard as the mob boss and William Frawley as the investigating detective on the murder that Franz is suspected of.

Following their enormous success where Abbott and Costello met Frankenstein 1948 along with Dracula and the Wolf Man from that same movie it seemed natural that they should eventually get to meet up with past Universal monsters. While meeting The Mummy came later much later 1955 to be exact the team followed their Frankenstein encounter with a worthy followup meeting with an Invisible Man three years later. Not actually a monster nor a mad scientist and with no actors from previous efforts reprising their roles it involves a prizefighter accused of murder using a remedy that makes him invisible in order to clear his name.As for the plot the scenario opens quite amusingly as Bud Alexander Bud Abbott and Lou Francis Lou Costello are introduced as 1951 class graduates from the Dugan Detective Training School Lou This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. How did I ever graduate? Bud I slipped the instructor twenty bucks. No sooner after setting up their own detective agency Bud and Lou the latter sporting Sherlock Holmes hat and smoking pipe acquire their first client Tommy Nelson Arthur Franz a middleweight champion boxer wanted for the murder of his manager O'Hara. Having just escaped jail he wants to clear himself of the murder charge. Instead of getting Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson Tommy gets the next best thing in regards to amateur detectives. However it is Lou who believes Tommy innocent while Bud makes every effort to collect 5000 reward for his capture. Tommy has Bud and Lou drive him to 823 Maple Street the residence of Helen Gray Nancy Guild his fiance and Dr. Philip Gray Gavin Muir her scientist uncle working on a serum for invisibility which was passed over to him by the original invisible man John Griffin Claude Rains whose photo is seen hanging on the wall. When Detective Roberts William Frawley and the police arrive with a search warrant Tommy injects himself with the serum whose disappearance into thin air being witnessed by none other than Lou himself. When asked how Tommy got away Lou replies In installments. Because his story is so unbelievable Lou is taken to Dr. James C. Turner Paul Maxey a psychiatrist to be analyzed. As Bud and Lou team up to assist the invisible man Tommy has Lou posing as champion boxer Louie the Looper while Bud acts as his manager in order to learn whether or not mobster Morgan Sheldon Leonard and Boots Marsden Adele Jergens had anything to do O'Hara's murder.Released at the time during their declining years at Universal's top comics ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET INVISIBLE MAN is not only a pleasant surprise but one of the team's finer efforts of the 1950s. What's even more surprising is seeing how Costello still playing a dopey guy at one point stepping out of character by seriously punching out one of the bad guys for throwing a knife on Tommy. Aside from the team's well written verbal byplay and some injokes Lou looking through his magnifying glass and getting a closeup on Tommy Nelson's face telling Bud he saw Frankenstein the gags involving invisibility work quite well with the story thanks to David Horsley in the special effects department. Great comical moments find Lou in the Bubble Room restaurant attempting to eat his spaghetti dinner while strings of it end up over the direction of his transparent client Boots convincing Lou to take a dive through her love making and the highlight set in the boxing ring where Lou's punches never hitting his opponent Rocky Hanlon John Day but by an invisible fist of Tommy Nelson. This scene is well staged and quite amusing. The only debit in general is where Lou finds himself walking the wrong way because his feet are on backwards. Don't ask.Unlike the last installment THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE 1944 this edition is actually consistent with both THE INVISIBLE MAN 1933 and THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS 1940 in fact a partial remake to the 1940 sequel involving an innocent man Vincent Price becoming invisible to clear his name with the help of a scientist but minus the assistance of a couple goofy detectives.Distributed on video cassette by MCA Home Video in the 1990s and later on DVD a decade later ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET INVISIBLE MAN had its share of cable TV revivals notably on the Comedy Channel 1990s American Movie Classics 20012002 and Turner Classic Movies 20042005. Though a worthy conclusion to The Invisible Man series this is not the finish of Abbott and Costello meeting somebody something or just simply anybody. Their next horror spoof was them meeting Jekyll and Hyde 1954 featuring Boris Karloff. While Abbott and Costello were recently failing to recapture their success from the early 1940s due to weak and tired material their encounter with The Invisible Man is certainly no disappointment by any means.

Costello is quite a bit thinner here than he is was in 1948 in their Frankenstein monster classic. Typical AC routines abound. As usual almost everyone thinks Costello is seeing things and is imagining an invisible man. As always Lou is taken advantage of by the pretty woman and Bud gets ignored completely. The film is so wellcast that it is superior to many Bud and Lou movies. Supporting actors include William Frawley Sheldon Leonard and Arthur Franz. A lot of fun for all. Cute ending as Lou disappears for a short time and reappears with his feet on backwards.Note no playback problems in this 2015 four movie reissue.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me this is arguably the best of the AC Meet series. The boys get mixed up with a prizefighter accused of murder who escapes the cops and gangsters by turning invisible with the help of an experimental serum. Naturally this leads to an array of amusing hijinks.The comic potential here is greater than in other AC monster entries Meet Frankenstein  Meet the Mummy etc. because the menace here has the power of invisibility. That means the menace can challenge the boys in public without the public knowing it. On the other hand the other monsters can't mix in public without being seen which narrows the comic potential to haunted houses or other nonpublic spaces. For example take the punching bag scene. It looks like Lou Costello has lightning speed rocking the bag when in reality it's the invisible boxer Tommy Franz who's doing it. There're a number of setups like this where the public is astonished by Lou's apparent powers while actor Costello milks the comic potential.That's not to say the other monster entries are not funny to varying degrees. But the monsters are restricted in these movies to scaring everyone in overthetop fashion whereas being invisible greatly expands the possibilities such as the nightclub scene with the poor flummoxed waiter Syd Saylor who can't figure out who's doing what.Anyway the movie's consistently amusing and inventive. However I wish we saw more of that great flashy blonde Adele Jergens Marsden and that great phony gangster Sheldon Leonard Morgan. Seeing them together here resembles a match made in some cheap nightclub heaven. All in all this is one of my AC favorites among their many comedies.".

One of their followup monster meetings after the monsterrally parody Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein 1948 Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man besides borrowing from the H.G. Wells inspired Invisible Man horror films also mash together the boxing detective and gangster genres. The story involving a boxer becoming invisible to clear his name and uncover a murder mystery and divetaking corruption in the ring is throwaway.Costello is practically the entire show this time with most of the humor revolving around his reactions. He's also the first character to see the Invisible Man and he's the only one to see the invisible camera as he repeatedly looks directly into it at least in the early scene in their detective agency office. Dressed in a Sherlock Holmes getup he even throws a quick wink at the camera. Additionally he tries to be invisible in committing a couple scams or slight of hand involving taking money from Abbott and cheating at cards. My favorite gag however is when Lou ridiculously hides the Invisible Man under a table cloth.Compared to Universal's prior Invisible Man films the visual effects this time indeed appear more flawless but I think that's largely because they avoid some of the more difficult ones such as those involving the covering or uncovering of his face such as the mirror shots in the 1933 The Invisible Man and the 1940 The Invisible Man Returns. John as opposed to Jack Griffin is mentioned here with a portrait of Claude Rains on the wall and the blood transfusion business from The Invisible Man Returns and The Invisible Man's Revenge 1944 is reused. Anyways the ending here is distasteful and especially nonsensical with Costello being naked for no reason during a blood transfusion then becoming invisible and committing a series of sexual assaults on nurses before his legs reappear backwards. Why?Which brings me to some other nagging questions I have from watching Universal's invisibility films. For starters why do invisible men not wear underwear like Claude Rains in the 1933 film when this one strips he also doesn't include them? Also why would a man sit naked playing cards just because he's invisible? And why would a woman stare an his invisible face while talking to him? It doesn't add up.".

In the early 1940s Universal sponsored a series if films relating to The Invisible Man after their initial offering in 1933. These include The Invisible Man Returns 1940 The Invisible Woman 1940 The Invisible Agent 1942 and The Invisible Man's Revenge1944. I haven't yet seen any of these but The Invisible Woman is generally classed as a comedy along with the present film which includes a serious plot sprinkled with typical AC shenanigans. A related topic is free ranging ghosts and other types of spirits whose bodies have been permanently lost through death. In contrast The Invisible Man has a body and soul but has achieved invisibility through human inventiveness or perhaps the dark arts. Furthermore his invisibility is usually reversible. Being present in spirit but not body is a common human fantasy. Such a power could be used to escape from a bad situation or to achieve a good desired result. On the other hand it can be used to facilitate the accomplishment of evil deeds. This was true of Griffin the invisible man in Well's novel who became a true monster. In contrast in the present story Tommy is not a monster. Mainly he wants to use his invisibility to help solve the murder of his trainer manager.. Toward this goal he also enlists the help of AC recent graduates of Dogan's Detective Training classDDT. In Wells' novel it is Griffin who both discovers the formula and uses it for evil deeds whereas in this film Tommy obtains his specific serum from his girlfriend's father who is a doctor and experimenter. Expect AC's standard repertoire of verbal humor sight gags and slapstick. An example of sight humor Abbott tells Lou holding a gun to Let him have it. Lou gives the gun to the bad guy! An example of verbal humor In a restaurant Abbott pulls invisible Tommy's Champaign glass toward himself. When the waiter queries Abbott says I'm a two fisted drinker. Probably the climax of the film occurs with the boxing match between Rocky and LouLouie the Looperplus invisible Tommy. Nobody can believe what they see with Rocky being knocked around by a seemingly invisible force emanating from Lou. Tommy seemingly abandons Lou for periods during the fight but comes back to finish off Rocky whereas Lou was supposed to throw the fight as pressured by the gangsters sponsoring Rocky. They come to 'get' Lou after the fight but get taken themselves.Sexy blond but bad Adele Jenkins as Boots Marsden flirts with Lou trying to get him to see things from the Gangster's viewpoint. The other woman in the story is bland Nancy Guild as Helen Gray Tommy's girlfriend... Sheldon Leonard plays Gangster Moran Boots' boyfriend... William Frawley is occasionally present  as detective Roberts who is looking for Tommy and doesn't believe various tales of an invisible Tommywhy should he!.

Having said that the story  while it perhaps lacked the action that modern scifi viewers have come to expect  was not bad. Essentially there's a mystery involving a number of Maritime disasters that have occurred in the Arctic Ocean and the atomic submarine Tigershark is sent to investigate. Upon its arrival it discovers that the disasters are being caused by a flying saucer with a somewhat ridiculous looking alien on board who has plans for his species to colonize the earth. If that sounds familiar it's probably because it's the plot for about 75 of the episodes of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea! The Tigershark doesn't seem as advanced as the Seaview was but you can certainly see this as a direct ancestor of that movieTV series. The performances here were all right if at times a little dry. The attempt to create tension between Reef and Nielson didn't work that well primarily because I just never understood the level of antipathy Reef seemed to have the ultimate solution as the submarine faced off against the flying saucer seemed in the end a bit too simple and easy and the last scene was a little bit too corny quite frankly. Overall though this was an enjoyable enough experience. 710".

Yeah this could have been a VOYAGE episode. And in fact eventually IT WAS! VOYAGE did an episode that adapted ATOMIC SUBMARINE pretty much straight just changing the sub the crew names and a few details and ditching Joi Lansing's character alas!. While ATOMIC SUBMARINE does look frightfully low budget compared to VOYAGE let alone today's superbloated budget busters it works pretty well for a product of its time. And the minimalist barely illuminated alien saucer interior is surprising effect. I know it creeped me out when I first saw this late one night in '66!".

VOYAGE did an episode that adapted ATOMIC SUBMARINE pretty much straight just changing the sub the crew names and a few details and ditching Joi Lansing's character alas!. While ATOMIC SUBMARINE does look frightfully low budget compared to VOYAGE let alone today's superbloated budget busters it works pretty well for a product of its time. And the minimalist barely illuminated alien saucer interior is surprising effect. I know it creeped me out when I first saw this late one night in '66!";

It has an interesting premise no doubt about it and must have been a real draw back in 1959. Unfortunately the rest of the components of the movie doesn't come close to delivering on it.The story is simple enough the newest atom sub investigates terrible disasters befalling ships and subs in the arctic only to discover it may well be an alien intelligence at work. We get lots of bombastic narration a sure sign of a poor screenplay and it's slapped over lots of stock footage of several submarines which in no way resemble the models or sets. The model work is uncommonly poor probably due to the difficulty of simulating underwater and under ice vistas on a budget smaller than a kids allowance. It's charming and interesting to look at but still poor and never conveys any real scale.As for the acting and script we have several faces familiar to 50's B movie fans and they do what they can with a sub par script. The supposed conflict between the 'hero' and the son of his mentor is so forced that you wonder why no one just slaps him or sacks him on the spot. They actually look a little embarrassed delivering the lines. The sets are pretty sparse too both in looks and number. You could count the locations on one hand not including the fish tank used for the special effects with the UFO being particularly minimalist. The scene with the young guy piloting the mini sub in particular stands out as there are no controls for him to work so he plays with a graph pen while 4 guys in frogmen gear stand around watching him struggle to improvise.All things considered it's no classic but that won't stop genre fans watching it to the end. It's a bit slow and a bit rubbish but it's heart is in the right place and you want to like it despite it's flaws. Go see it for free at the Internet archives and see for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew very little about THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE as the opening credits rolled . I was led to believe it was grade z rubbish with a cult following and it's very easy to see how this reputation came about The film starts in the recognisable future where atomic submarines are used as vehicles of commerce and we're shown via some laughably unconvincing special effects of a submarine meeting its doom . Words fail me as to how bad the footage is as a toy submarine in a fish tank is destroyed and this stock footage is continually used throughout the film . It should also be noted that shipping mysteriously disappearing as the first stages of an alien invasion had been used as a premise for John Wyndhams watery masterpiece The Kraken Wakes from a few years earlier and you can't help thinking that TAS was heavily influenced by this intelligent apocalyptic classic Unfortunately both director Spencer Gordon Bennet and screenwriter Orville H Hampton also seem to have been inspired by Ed Woood . Early into the film we're hit over the head by the most intrusive  melodramatic and badly written voice over possible . In screen writing classes you'll be informed that obvious voice over is poor voice over but the narrator goes well beyond bad by referring to things we never see happen on screen . For example we're told that the crew are apprehensive as they sail towards the North Pole which is strange considering most of the crew are unaware what their mission is and are under the impression that it's a routine mission and that problems involving irritation makes themselves felt amongst the crew which is not something that ever appears on screen . Note also the pythonesque map that shows lots of squiggly lines of the submarines route When the sub gets to the bottom of the mystery that a flying saucer is responsible for the sinkings the story does pick up and shows some imagination on the part of the film makers . The basic set of the saucer interior is so effective simply down to the simplicity of the set and Bennet does manage to manage to bring an eerie other worldliness to the mis en scene . The alien itself might seem some what laughable resembling a cross between a penis and a sock puppet but its mission to either kill or kidnap the crew in order to experiment upon them does again mirror the aims of the aliens in The Kraken Wakes and despite the grade z production values these scenes are relatively chilling and one wonders why the rest of the movie couldn't reach this standard All in all this is a very flawed SF adventure . It is very memorable but frequently for the wrong reasons which makes THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE one of the most uneven films you will see . It's very good in places but if you're not a fan of scifi B movies you'll not want to watch this but if you're a fan it's a pleasant time waster".

The whole crew has been brought aboard all leaves canceled.The Executive Officer Arthur Franz has a heavy duty date with Joi Lansing so you can imagine it didn't put him in the best of moods.

I guess the producers felt they needed something to occupy the time before we found out who's sinking the polar shipping of earth.Of course it's a particularly nasty alien creature and it's a flying saucer that goes underwater that's doing the job. What he's on earth for and how they deal with it you'll have to see The Atomic Submarine.Remember at the time The Atomic Submarine was considered the cutting edge of technology. Now practically our whole fleet is nuclear powered so it's not as big a deal as in 1959. The film is set in the futuristic date of 1968 and that's interesting to see what the film's creators take of the near future would be.Also remember that this is Allied Artists which used to be Monogram Pictures. No great original special effects here just decently edited clips from other submarine and science fiction films.The Atomic Submarine is a decent enough B film and I'm sure it was big hit with the kiddie trade back in the day.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's not much to be said about Atomic Submarine. It's an inexpensive SF thriller about a nuclearpowered submarine that's sent to the North Pole to find out why ships have been disappearing so often in northern latitudes. The Tiger Shark with Dick Foran as the commanding officer and Arthur Franz as his exec finds out. It's a giant undersea UFO. They ram it and are locked with it. A party is sent out in a kind of diving bell to free the sub. The men enter the beastly thing and find it contains a rather large and repellent monster who intends to kidnap them and the colonize Earth  and so on. The monster is dispatched.I remember seeing this years ago on TV but I could only remember one scene. Arthur Franz is standing in the doorway of the UFO staring goggleeyed at the monster within which resembles a hairy octopus with one huge Cyclopslike eyeball. At last we meet face to face says the monster. That's a face? replies Franz.The plot's all over the place. It's festooned with icons of the genre. There's atomic power. An undersea mystery. A UFO. A repugnant monster. A plan to colonize earth. A seatoair missile. An argument between Lieutenant Commander Franz and the civilian Peacenik aboard. The Peacenik argues that peace is better than war or something like that. A couple of the men give their lives bravely.It's hard to imagine that this entire film cost more than would be spent on a TV episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. The special effects are perfunctory. I would have to see proof that there was more than one take of each shot before I believed it. The Tiger Shark seems to have a crew of about three men.One of the men is Bob Steele who had a successful matine series in the movies during the 1940s. He has one expression  a scowl. When he cracks jokes with the other two crew members he scowls. Dick Foran floats through his part weightlessly. It's hard to believe that he was a cowboy in an Abbott and Costello movie who introduced a pretty and tuneful pop song I'll Remember April. Arthur Franz another New Jersey kid probably does the best acting job. He's at least identifiable as a seasoned professional. He wasn't bad in the original The Sniper. Many of the others notably Brett Halsey as the Peacenik give performances that you or I could beat. Halsey blandly handsome does nothing but pout. Throughout. Oh there's Tom Conway as a British scientist on the sub too. He looks pretty good considering that booze had made a considerable inroad into his life space by this time. He was soon to become so abjectly alcoholic that his brother George Sanders cut off communications with him the cad. And there's still another scientist a Russian guy. The best thing about him is his accent. When he tries to pronounce wonderful it comes out VONdairfool. I guess they didn't have enough of a budget to hire a technical adviser because their naval protocol is sometimes off base in the most elementary of ways. The captain Foran gives an order to his subordinate the executive officer Franz. And Franz says Very well. He's not supposed to say that. A subordinate when addressed by a superior officer says Aye aye. It's only when a subordinate reports information to a superior that the superior replies Very well. None of that is important in the context of this sublimely shoddy production. I kind of enjoyed it for its tattiness. But even with a minuscule budget a good director can do better. I doubt that The Thing From Another World had much of a budget either but it's light years ahead of this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although pretty much forgotten these days lost in the vast and crazy whirl of similar budget science fiction of its era The Atomic Submarine makes a creditable effort at something slightly different to is fellows albeit not too different. Though the title suggests modernity technical innovation and perhaps nuclear fear what we really have is an encounter with an entity from beyond our world the difference being that it takes place beneath the Arctic in the cold depths of the North Pole. See something is out and about down there destroying submarines and so the greatest submarine of all and its crew are sent on a search an destroy mission before subArctic travel is rendered a nonviable trade route. The film and its cast do an okay job of brewing up some low grade tension a mixture of stock footage and model work doesn't always succeed in passing off affairs of taking place where they are claimed but neither is either inept enough for me to be actually displeased and the focus tends to be more internal anyway with the submarine tracking its quarry and conflict between the mission commander and a doctor he pretty much despises as a yellow bellied liberal. Political discourse isn't exactly high grade in this one but Arthur Franz has the right airs and a certain compelling stature as the commander and Brett Halsey conveys a smart but slightly offended dignity as the doctor. Further acting is pretty sound I'm not familiar with any of the other players really but Tom Conway gives a fun showing as a British scientist Victor Varconi is stereotypical but interesting as his European counterpart and assorted other folk have appropriate mixtures of duty and derring do in their supporting roles. The trouble with the film is that for a lot of the time it simply isn't that interesting. The general execution lacks the verisimilitude to maintain constant interest in proceedings the pacing is a bit slow and the writing is neither smart enough nor overcooked enough to make up for these lacks. As a result vacant watchability flecked with fun is about the highest that the film achieves until it actually gets to the crunch some twenty minutes before the end. Here the film finally becomes a bit of a winner repaying audience patience with some nifty effects and a fearsome antagonist handled by the FX team of Jack Rabin Irving Block and Louis DeWitt who also worked on the classic Kronos that I suspect freaked out more than a few kids back in the day and are still quite striking now. Its a solidly enjoyable final block and memorable in its way but even so it's still pretty conventional and after the build up and given the unusual setting I was really hoping for a slightly more offbeat payoff. Still good fun though and as far as my viewing of these movies has gone an entry in the win column. 610 from me worth a look for genre enthusiasts.".

When the submarine's torpedoes prove worthless against the Cyclops' defenses the decision is made to ram the strange craft. The Tiger Shark appears to have been successful in killing the other craft but it's now stuck in the Cyclops' outer hull. A team is sent to enter the dormant looking craft to try to free the submarine. But the Cyclops isn't as dormant as it first appears. The men find an alien being very much alive and still determined to take over the world.Overall The Atomic Submarine is a fun little movie. I see that a lot of people focus on the less than realistic looking miniatures. Why let something like that ruin the rest of the movie? As I've stated any number of times I find a certain charm to the low budget special effects found in movies like The Atomic Submarine. I'll cut 'em more slack than I will today's big budget heartless CGI effects. Instead of the effects my problems with the movie lies in the very slow first act and a controversy between two of the characters that feels forced. But once the submarine enters the Arctic waters things pickup and it moves at a good entertaining pace form here on out. The interior shots of the alien ship are especially creepy. It may all be lights shadows and noise but that doesn't make it any less effective. It's downright spooky! The acting is about what you expect from a mostly veteran cast that includes Dick Foran Tom Conway and Arthur Franz  nothing terrible but nothing outstanding. The exception is Brett Halsey whose constant pout is a bit much at times. I was excited to see Joi Lansing's name in the opening credits but soon discovered that her screentime was limited to about 5 minutes. Finally I appreciate the chances screenwriter Orville Hampton took with the plot. The idea of an undersea UFO is quite novel as far as I know.".

Between this flick THE ANGRY RED PLANET and PLAN 9 1959 was a banner year for spaceships and bizarre critters from outer space.";

Joi Lansingneed I say more and another man against alien scenario where fighting for humanity and the American way of life is treasured above all. Before I get too gushy I do need to mention that this film has lots of faults too...big ones. The special effects are anything but. The sub looks like a model the whole time. The saucer looks like one too and just wait till you see the alien. Whew! The acting though solid is nothing more. Nobody gives a standout performance and the leadsparticularly Arthur Franz and Brett Halsey are a little on the weak side. The direction is competent yet not dazzling or spectacular in any way. This is just a good oldfashioned science fiction film from the 1950s. It isn't one of the best from the era but it does stand up well nonetheless today.".

That was sheer genius and I would like to see more like that... it was like a contemporary modern dance performance but just with hands arms and props. Also the scenery around Gdansk was nice. And it was fun to see a few shots of a very young Roman Polanski. If you are looking for a complicated plot or something very deep then this is not the film for you. But if you are looking for some light artsy entertainment on a rainy afternoon it's perfect. I think the overall message is to enjoy life while it's happening and not worry about making things stay the same way always. This is a theme that comes up in the girls conversation repeatedly as the boy is always talking about marriage and she says if we say it's forever it will become boring. Well I have a soft spot for old black and white Polish movies so I'm giving it a 7.".

I think the overall message is to enjoy life while it's happening and not worry about making things stay the same way always. This is a theme that comes up in the girls conversation repeatedly as the boy is always talking about marriage and she says if we say it's forever it will become boring. Well I have a soft spot for old black and white Polish movies so I'm giving it a 7.";

And the matching trench coats  so cool! And the farewells at the train station  so epic. Beautiful! Is this a Nazi movie? All films are ideological. Germany  in this film  is clearly associated with ROOTEDNESS  all else everywhere else with rootlessness. But while the film critiques this rootless life can we imagine a disenfranchised segment of a contemporary German audience noticing how attractive this rootlessness is made what with groovy music sexy women lots of drinking and dancing...?

The Good German Christoph is such a submissive weak character  steadfast OK but so bloodless! But maybe that's ideological too REAL men are wanderers no matter where they wander.

In the last half hour the film proceeds towards its ending towards the only overtly Nazi scene. Various possible outcomes arise especially when at the fourth train station leave taking Franziska and Michel keep missing each other. I guess we could quote the great Douglas Sirk You don't believe the happy ending and you're not supposed to. But what other ending could there have been in Germany in 1941 anyway?I've been watching a lot of Katner lately. Fascinating. He is really due for a serious revival. A Criterion box?

	schema:reviewBody "Following his artistic divorce from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu writer Guillermo Arriaga whose Tarantinoinspired interlocked storytelling also formed the basis of Tommy Lee Jones' magnificent The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada makes his debut as director with The Burning Plain another recount of connected fates.Whereas his previous screenplays were maledriven The Burning Plain stands out for having three women at the center of things Sylvia Charlize Theron is a restaurant owner who despite what appears to be a relationship with one of her employees John Corbett is deeply unsatisfied and spends all of her free time smoking cigarettes and sleeping with other men Gina Kim Basinger is your typical housewife except she's survived breast cancer and is cheating on her husband Brett Cullen with a Mexican man named Nick Joaquim de Almeida Mariana Jennifer Lawrence Gina's daughter is probably the most messed up of the three especially after she starts dating Nick's son Santiago. And finally remaining on the female front there's also a little girl Maria who travels from Mexico to the United States with a family friend to find her long lost mother.As always with Arriaga these stories are linked by a tragic event in Amores Perros and 21 Grams it was a car crash while in Babel it was a gunshot wound. This time the connection though not that obvious is a burning trailer seen in the first scene of the film. The twist is that the writerdirector has gotten more ambitious in telling yet another human tragedy instead of having a geographic separation between the three plot strands like he did in Babel he goes for the most classic of choices namely time shifts only those aren't proper flashbacks and therefore as one can expect it takes a while before all the pieces fit together. By choosing this narrative solution Arriaga is trying to tell us he can do just as fine a job as his former collaborator Inarritu behind the camera but it's hardly a surprise to find out he doesn't always succeed being a firsttime director he prefers to keep things safe with a classic style rather than adapting some of Inarritu's tricks most notably the chromatic link between character and mood to his own vision. And it must be said that a more experienced filmmaker would have known how to avoid the emotional flatness that comes from the few scenes two or three at the most where Arriaga panders to the genre's most idiotic clichs three words hospital coma confession.Overall however the narrative is very solid and having learned a valuable lesson from his past creative partners Arriaga has set up a cast that doesn't really include any big names Theron notwithstanding but delivers a string of compelling performances the most touching turns come from Basinger always good when playing vulnerable damaged women and de Almeida whose tenderness comes off as a real surprise given his fame in the US at least as rough crime lords in Desperado and the third season of 24. Lawrence pulls off her tricky role with a maturity that justifies the Mastroianni Award i.e. Most Promising Newcomer she won at the Venice Film Festival. Cullen Corbett and Danny Pino impress despite the limited screen time at their disposal and Theron still partially recovering from the Aeon Flux fiasco portrays Sylvia with the kind of understated intensity that characterizes her best work.Verdict if you were unmoved by Inarritu's films this is not for you. Otherwise give it a try it's not as mesmerizing as 21 Grams but in its best moments it comes close enough.".

	schema:headline " Consequences of an Extramarital Affair";
	schema:reviewBody "Guillermo Arriaga was the writer for Inarritu's films Amores Perros 21 Grams Babel and here dons the director's mantel for the first time on a major film project. The Burning Plain is an intense story that plays out over thirteen years although all the action is squeezed into two segments at each end of the time span. The film relates how an extramarital affair has repercussions which echo down through the following years. The chain of events is initiated when Gina a housewife and mother embarks on a passionate romance with Nick a Mexican with a family of his own. After a gas tank explosion kills the lovers while they make love in a remote desert trailer Gina's traumatized teenage daughter Mariana becomes friends with Nick's son Santiago. Arriaga focuses on the mother daughter and granddaughter at the story's center. He uses four actresses for their roles  two being required for the teenage Mariana and her 30something persona  and all of them Kim Basinger Charlize Theron Jennifer Lawrence and Tessa la give exceptional performances. When Mariana first notices evidence of her mother's infidelity she remains silent and carries the burden alone. The breach between them widens as Mariana's investigations confirm her suspicions  and the youthful beauty of her face transforms into a mask as she conceals knowledge which could destroy her family. Arriaga portrays her dilemma with a delicacy that amplifies the girl's pain  showing the silent spread of the poison its contagion first claiming the motherdaughter relationship and then creating new ripples of damage which will ultimately infect the next generation.The narrative is tighter than Arriaga's work with Inarritu  a tale illustrating how one transgression can set in motion the engine of fate. He relies on classic cinematic techniques rather than Inarritu's flashy ones  but as in his previous work Arriaga breaks up the story's chronological flow by chopping back and forth between two time segments. One can't help wondering if it was necessary here since the story possesses such a strong arc. However this is just a quibble  The Burning Plain results in something close to a masterpiece which shares many thematic elements found in the work of Shakespeare Thomas Hardy and Dostoevsky.".

After a gas tank explosion kills the lovers while they make love in a remote desert trailer Gina's traumatized teenage daughter Mariana becomes friends with Nick's son Santiago. Arriaga focuses on the mother daughter and granddaughter at the story's center. He uses four actresses for their roles  two being required for the teenage Mariana and her 30something persona  and all of them Kim Basinger Charlize Theron Jennifer Lawrence and Tessa la give exceptional performances. When Mariana first notices evidence of her mother's infidelity she remains silent and carries the burden alone. The breach between them widens as Mariana's investigations confirm her suspicions  and the youthful beauty of her face transforms into a mask as she conceals knowledge which could destroy her family. Arriaga portrays her dilemma with a delicacy that amplifies the girl's pain  showing the silent spread of the poison its contagion first claiming the motherdaughter relationship and then creating new ripples of damage which will ultimately infect the next generation.The narrative is tighter than Arriaga's work with Inarritu  a tale illustrating how one transgression can set in motion the engine of fate. He relies on classic cinematic techniques rather than Inarritu's flashy ones  but as in his previous work Arriaga breaks up the story's chronological flow by chopping back and forth between two time segments. One can't help wondering if it was necessary here since the story possesses such a strong arc. However this is just a quibble  The Burning Plain results in something close to a masterpiece which shares many thematic elements found in the work of Shakespeare Thomas Hardy and Dostoevsky.";

Past and present are so mixed up that it isn't until quite far into the movie that you realise how all the characters are connected. And in this connection you'll find the big difference between the two movies. Whereas Babel shows the stories of people that are only connected by coincidence The Burning Plain goes much further than that. When almost in the end you find out what really happened you cannot but acknowledge the genius of the person who wrote the story and the stylish way the movie was directed.Once the 'big twist' is revealed it was like an 'ahaErlebnis'. From beginning until ending you are wondering about the connections between the characters. What does Sylvia have to do with Mariana and Santiago or with Gina and Nick?

	schema:reviewBody "I had recently become a fan of both Guillermo Arriaga and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's work through their previous four films Amores Perros 21 Grams The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and Babel in order of release. In hearing of their creative breakup it certainly stirred in my own mind a possibility of double the good films... or a filmmaking battle accomplishing nothing. The Burning Plain by Guillermo Arriaga is the first of these fruits. Good or bad? You decide. I think good... but missing something.The Burning Plain follows the story of several different people separated by time and space  Sylvia a woman in Oregon who must undertake an emotional odyssey to rid herself of her past Mariana and Santiago two teenagers trying to piece together the shattered lives of their parents in a New Mexico border town Maria a little girl who goes on a bordercrossing voyage to help her parents find redemption forgiveness and love and Gina and Nick a couple who must deal with an intense and clandestine affair... because they are both married.Charlize Theron leads the ensemble cast. Theron I have previously seen in a consortium of roles from Sleepwalking and Monster to The Italian Job. I am glad to say she brings a much more subtle feeling to Sylvia the central character in the film without going over the top. The sides we see from the past and present also reflect Sylvia's personality a side of professionalism brought in by a new skin in the present while her notforgotten past hiding deep within but brought out by her sexual trysts and selfmutilation.Also leading the present side of the story is newcomer Tessa Ia in a challenging role she takes at face value despite her young age. With Mexican actor Jose Maria Yazpik in a gentle role along with Theron the three are arguably the best actors in the film. Ia's performances hails true talent and not nearly enough credit. With a fierce look in the eyes of a child trying to obtain forgiveness in her own soul Ia is an actress mature beyond her years. The present stories take on these subtleties that audiences will figure out after the film has ended. This is where the second half figuratively speaking of the film suffers.Focused too much of what is going on in a certain time in the past the characters of Gina and Nick suffer due to a lack of development. We know of their affair we know what is going on and we are given too much of that without enough understanding of who they are on their own. Kim Basinger does her best in the role but ultimately is too flat with her delivery. Gina is a sympathetic character because of the screenplay and where the writing takes her not because of Basinger's performance. Joaquim de Almeida's Nick is more interesting despite a lack of screen time also due to the lack of development.The story of Mariana and Santiago is much better because it escapes from this problem and we are given a beginning middle and end to their story per se. JD Pardo gives a nice understanding to Santiago and allows for a much better look at the character as an adult when you finally realize who it is I will not give anything away. However Jennifer Lawrence as Mariana is probably my most disliked actor of the group. Despite winning the best newcomer award at the Venice Film Festival her delivery is monotone and lacks any sort of true feeling for what has happened. This also counts for in between two sections of her life... but a nice reaction to a certain event ultimately saved her entire performance.The film has amazing undertones that audiences won't figure out until later. There are several different themes played on such as the theme of love which is included not only through relationships though this is the main ingredient but from children to parents siblings and great friendships. The latter is what genuinely seals this aspect of the film as Jose Maria Yazpik and Robin Tunney's characters bring their perspective leads to a connection. Another underlying theme was that of scars. Whether through selfmutilation or a past surgery Sylvia Santiago Mariana Maria and Gina all end up with literal scars by the end of the film that they cannot forget about eluding to the main theme of the film that the past effects the present.I was hoping that it wouldn't be just a carbon copy of what Inarritu has done before in an attempt to win an audience. I felt the same way about Three Burials which is why I have rated it with only 8. This is going to be the first major problem for Arriaga on his own creative path. While unfortunate it is inevitable audiences will go in expecting the same intense fair Innaritu has been giving them and will see a more tame version of that. Luckily the wonderful production values and gorgeous cinematography by veteran Robert Elswit and John Toll tacked on with a beautiful soundtrack ultimately send the story flying.With a number of events occurring through the story you are never left bored. Piecing together the puzzle isn't really as difficult as it may seem. For Babel it was all about figuring out which story was in what time period. In The Burning Plain it's about who is who and how time has taken it's toll on the characters which makes it much more interesting in a more creative way. This is where direction suffers as it is obvious Guillermo Arriaga was more focused on the story than he was his actors but it all falls together without disrupting anything. Hopefully the creative split will allow audiences to realize there is a large difference between directors and Arriaga and Innaritu are no exception.".

This dispassionate earthy and very dry aesthetic that filmmaker Guillermo Arriaga applies to the world of his first major directorial outing is king between the barren desert landscapes that permeate within the backdrops of his strangely distant and outofsync characters and the sparse narrative that intertwines it all together The Burning Plain views life as a series of scarscold and unrepresentative of the pain that brought them to the surface but a firm reminder as such that nothing ever quite goes away no matter how far you run. For the characters of Arriaga's story a central catastrophe of sorts serves as the unfortunate catalyst that will bring them all together whether they like it or not. A burning trailer housing two lovers sharing a passionate affair behind their families back exploding in a rage of flames seemingly caused by accident. For them the movie opens with their death thus absolving them from living with their irrevocable actions but for those they leave behind the past stays as a constant and dictates largely how each of their futures will develop.Serving as a somewhat humbled character piece that centres on a small group of intertwining stories between the two conflicted families The Burning Plain is an unassuming and dry landscape of drama. For the majority of the feature the movie is split between three narratives most of which take place over different timelines told in a backandforth manner which informs but never confuses the viewer as to where each of these characters are going and where they have been. This multilayered and contorted style that Arriaga implements here can obviously get a little confusing at times yet enough care is taken to allow each of the stories to have their own breathing room. As a result the characters which take centre stage feel nicely developed and humansomething integrally important to a story such as Arriaga's. In the end while it seems that some plot developments never seem to be heading to any sort of meeting point there exists a sort of catharsis and closure to the movie that ties everything together nicely but perhaps too nicely. The ending is somewhat dubious but nevertheless feels like the logical step when taken in retrospect.As mentioned in the opening paragraph a central theme to Arriaga's feature here is the suppression of emotionof a cool collected and strangely alien approach to relationships with other people. While there are plenty of moments where the director opts to balance such instances out with moments of palpable passion most of which occur between the two burning lovers the dominant motif here is that callous and introverted sense of misdirection and ambivalence that plays such a major part in a few of the central characters' stories. The performances then which can be hard to grasp on to as a result nevertheless do well to keep things human without ever sacrificing that uniquely cold tone. This isn't a feature that will immediately grasp you with its story or characters and the performances from the cast are very much the same. Instead The Burning Plain opens up as it goes along eventually climaxing in a series of finely performed expulsions of emotion. It is in this final act that much of Arriaga's story comes together and pieces fall into place so it's appropriate that much of the movie's most cathartic and warmer shades transpire here.For The Burning Plain to truly come off the screen however one has to feel for the characters that dominate the screenplay from the getgo which unfortunately is not the case. While it is certainly evident that Arriaga's crafts an interesting and somewhat unique presentation to an otherwise familiar story thanks to his callous approach to much of the proceeding drama the movie too often falls a little short of its intended destination thanks to the overly cold opening and unsurprising ending. The result is a feature which definitely succeeds in offering two hours of finely plotted drama but which also fails at making any more of an impression. The characters are compelling in their own strange way the narrative complicated but not to the extent that all hope is lostfor those two elements alone I could recommend The Burning Plain to viewers and that's not even taking into account the performances and imagery in twine. In the end however Arriaga doesn't quite reach where he tries to The Burning Plain is and enjoyable and rewarding experience but it lacks the extra zest needed to carry it on through to something more profound and memorable.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

We don't figure out until midfilm that this character is actually the grown up version of that character and so forth. This is a rather slow drama saved by the acting talents of two professional actresses Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger. I find it pretty weird that I didn't discover until 2010 this film starring these two superstars that was made in 2008. It's a statement about how hard it is for indie movies to get any exposure in this market dominated by big budget blockbusters. The theaters are owned by a monopoly and the little movie simply doesn't have a chance these days. It is sad and it is killing the art of filmmaking. Jennifer Lawrence is simply astonishingly beautiful which doesn't make watching this movie any less pleasant. We never get a clue about exactly how the White breast cancer survivor gets involved with the Mexican farmer thus putting into play the tragedy that ultimately occurs and at times the interaction between characters is unrealistic. I mean really if a group of white kids came to a Mexican funeral and started shouting wetback I hope you rot in hell are we really expected to believe there wouldn't be some conflict following at least a few nasty words exchanged? But the brooding mood is quite consistent and watching The Burning Plain won't leave you cheated in any way. If you like serious drama this will be your cup of tea.".

It was a bit disconcerting the way it is edited because the first 40 to 45 minutes it skips back and forth and you have to guess what period you are in and who the characters are and what their relationships are. But if you stick with it all becomes clear.Charlize Theron is Sylvia she is the manager of a restaurant on the Pacific in Oregon. She seems very tough and very efficient knows her foods and knows her wines. But her weakness is a promiscuous lifestyle performed in an almost matteroffact way. It is as if she has a low selfesteem in spite of being smart and pretty.Kim Basinger is Geena a seemingly happily married mother of several healthy children. Her husband has a job that takes him on the road often and since her surgery for breast cancer he seems unable to make love to her as he once did.Their oldest child is Jennifer Lawrence as Mariana probably 17. She was actually 17 during filming. She loves her mother but doesn't like her at all when she starts to suspect she might have something going on on the side.John Corbett Northern Exposure's Chris in the Morning is John a chef at Sylvia's restaurant married and having an affair with Sylvia.This is a very good movie with an interesting and moving story of redemption.SPOILERS follow First off when all is revealed Sylvia in modern times is the grown up Mariana 12 years later. Her promiscuity is a result of seeing her mother's affair then being responsible for her death and the death of her lover a man also with a family. Mariana suspected something so on her bicycle followed her mom's car to a remote area in desertlike terrain in New Mexico and found their love nest an old trailer they had fixed up. She loosened the gas supply and set fire while the two lovers were in there to scare them out and destroy the place but it blew up and she killed both of them. Then she started an affair with the man's son they had a child Mariane ran away when the child was 2 days went to Oregon and changed her name to Sylvia. But they eventually found her and she went to Mexico to be reunited with her daughter and her lover now in the hospital recuperating from an injury form a crop duster crash.Tessa Ia who plays her 12 year old daughter Maria is cute and also a good young actress.".

Maria Tessa la is a young girl living in Mexico with her father Santiago Danny Pino and his coworker and friend Carlos Jos Mara Yazpik.

The match that ignites the story is a fire that ends the lives of Gina and Nick and after this tragedy the children of the two lovers  Mariana and young Santiago J.D.

Once again Guillermo has proved his gifts as an artist  both as a writer and now as a director. One of the finest films of the year. Grady Harp".

Once again Guillermo has proved his gifts as an artist  both as a writer and now as a director. One of the finest films of the year. Grady Harp";

	schema:headline " Human Redemption on a Smaller Plain in Arriaga's Tentative Directorial Debut";
	schema:reviewBody "Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's bigscreen collaborations with director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu have produced a trio of highly accomplished films  Amores Perros 21 Grams and Babel  that juxtaposed several story lines all tied together by characters who were damaged souls in search of redemption and connection with one another. Although the two had a very public fallingout Arriaga still appears to be strongly influenced by his former partner's jumbled filmmaking style as he takes over the director's chair with this 2009 drama. The chief problem however is that Arriaga doesn't really show Irritu's passion and audacity as he attempts to pull off the considerable demands of a nonlinear narrative with conviction. Moreover Arriaga the screenwriter lets down Arriaga the director with a script that ultimately feels too predictable and contrived despite strong performances from the cast.There looks to be four separate stories at the outset which eventually transitions into two. The first involves Sylvia the manager of an upscale seaside restaurant in Portland an extremely pained woman who prefers casual sex followed by selfinflicted punishment. She is obviously anguished over something that motivates her erratic behavior. The second thread takes place in New Mexico near the Mexican border where Gina an unhappily married mother of four is carrying on an affair with a local man named Nick also married with children. The complication here is that her daughter Mariana finds out about the affair and embarks on a relationship with Nick's son Santiago. Meanwhile in Mexico a cropduster plane crashlands on an open field as his twelveyearold daughter Maria watches in horror.Arriaga's fractured approach works for a little while albeit in an emotionally draining humorless way. However when the moment of revelation arrives and much too early the plot unravels into a Lifetime TVmovie level of sanctimony obscured by the fiery explosion that gives the movie its name. Proving yet again that a beautiful woman can convincingly expose the torment of a soul under fire Charlize Theron successfully makes the nihilistic Sylvia an ultimately sympathetic figure. Kim Basinger looking entirely too stunning and wrinklefree at 55 to be a KMartshopping housewife manages to get to the heart of a guiltridden woman even as she shows Gina going through the predictable machinations of her illicit actions.The standout performance however comes from Jennifer Lawrence a Jewellookalike as the troubled teen Mariana the dramatic pivot for the whole movie. Tessa Ia makes a strong impression as the pensive Maria while the men barely make a ripple  John Corbett as a smitten souschef in Sylvia's restaurant Joaquim de Almeida as the passionate Nick Jos Mara Yazpik as the gobetween Carlos and Danny Pino as the pilot. The one exception is J.D. Pardo who plays Santiago as the impetuous Romeo to Lawrence's Juliet. Robin Tunney shows up in a smallish role as Sylvia's one true friend. Robert Elswit and John Toll share cinematography responsibilities here and they do an excellent job capturing all the locales. At the end of the movie I couldn't help thinking that Arriaga's yin was fundamentally missing Irritu's yang.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a quiet leisurely film about the tragedies that unite and divide two families over three generations in the American Southwest. It's the sort of deeply serious drama where the audience is told more through the actors' expressions and tone than through any bit of dialog. That also means The Burning Plain is the sort of movie that bores many people to tears. I am usually one of those viewers left weary and fatigued but not this time. Partly that's due to some nonliner storytelling that avoids pretension and trying too hard to be clever. Mostly it's because Charlize Theron gets buck naked.Yes I realize that's a fairly crude and crass reaction. It also happens to be true for me and I would guess it would also be true for other folks who normally can't stand this kind of tale. The beautiful Miss Theron is completely nude at the very beginning and then gets topless before the film is halfway over. The nudity being nongratuitous actually showing us something important about Theron's character each time certainly elevates the experience. Regardless if she hadn't taken it off I probably would have spent most of this movie annoyed and waiting for it to end. By so immediately grabbing my attention and then doing it again I was pulled into this very human conflict more effectively than a billion fancy words or a rainbow of histrionic performances every could. The whole point of telling a story is to engage the audience and it's not always necessary wise or even appropriate to do that exclusively at the highest level.It also helps that none of the characters in The Burning Plain are annoying or aggressively foisted on the viewer. Mostly in silence and sometimes in action they're allowed to unspool on the screen with each scene taking you further and further into who and what they are. But it's mostly Theron taking her clothes off.This motion picture jumps back and forth among three different time periods and three sets of characters. There's Gina Kim Basinger a desperately unhappy woman who slinks away from her husband and children to the arms of Nick Joaquim De Almeida a similarly adulterous husband and father who is consumed with unconditional passion for her. Things move ahead in time a bit to Gina's daughter Marianna Jennifer Lawrence and Nick's son Santiago JD Pardo who find their souls intertwined after violent death shatters both of their families. Many years after that there's Sylvia Charlize Theron an emotionally wounded woman who selfmedicates with joyless promiscuity and Maria Tessa Ia a young Mexican girl who sees her cropduster father crash in front of her eyes and is taken on a journey to find the mother she's never known.Now if you pay any attention at all you'll quickly figure out how all these people fit together where their lives are going and how they'll get there. Fortunately experiencing the voyage is more important that arriving at the destination. The Burning Plain isn't about watching a plot unfold. It's about recognizing other human beings in moments of pain joy selfishness nobility and fear. You hope these people get a happy ending the way you want one for yourself.In addition to baring it all and once again demonstrating the principle of Producer SelfNudity Theron is marvelous as a profoundly sad woman who deadens herself with sex and almost can't stand it when she must acknowledge her own feelings. Kim Basinger is equally wonderful as an equally sad woman who finds not anesthesia but liberation in her affair. Jennifer Lawrence and JD Pardo are also captivating as two teenagers whose unprocessed anger propels them forward when they don't have any idea what they're doing.The Burning Plain isn't for those who want something quick and loud and distracting. If you're looking to ruminate for a while this isn't a bad object to focus on. And that's not a reference to Theron's bosom.".

	schema:headline " The performances stand on their own merits providing interesting conflicted characters who continue to suffer because of their choices and their desire to be loved";
	schema:reviewBody "The Burning Plain presents three very different women living in the USA and in Mexico. The first is Sylvia Charlize Theron who works in a restaurant and is having an affair with her married coworker. They have casual passionless sex but he does not want her talking to other men. The other two women are Gina Kim Basinger and her daughter Mariana Jennifer Lawrence. Gina who has recovered from breast cancer is married but is still having an affair with a Mexican man. Mariana finds herself particularly responsible for looking after her siblings but she is also continuously suspicious of her mother and is determined to find out what she is doing. Mariana also forms her own romance with a Mexican boy despite the objection of his friends and family. In addition to these women the film also focuses on a Mexican crop duster and his daughter Maria Tessa Ia who works in the fields with him. Her life is turned upside down when his plane crashes and he is left in the hospital with a leg injury.For almost a decade Guillermo Arriaga has been a consistently prolific screenwriter involved with mature adult cinema that centers on the fragments of time and place. His collaboration with Tommy Lee Jones on the film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada as well as his partnership with director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu through the pictures Babel and 21 Grams represents his most noted efforts. After having a disagreement with Irritu though Arriaga insisted on writing and directing The Burning Plain himself. As with his previous works this is a slow burning and sometimes confronting film but the separation in time however has not been made as obvious as it was in the past. It is difficult to discuss this without revealing the way that these seemingly disjointed and unrelated stories connect. Initially it seems as though there are too many characters and stories obstructing the audience's accessibility to the most interesting portions of the film with Sylvia. By the end the stories do intersect and relate in a deeply personal manner revealing how the past can haunt and shape the present. Perhaps on a second viewing it would be a much more rewarding film in having a greater understanding of where these characters came from and how they grew from the mistakes of their past.The heart of this film is the contrast between two women Syliva and Gina who are both searching for happiness in the most irresponsible and selfish manner. Sylvia remains content with exposing herself to almost anyone in a pursuit to find some kind of connection or physical relationship. Her affair with her coworker is followed by a brief encounter with a client and then her failed attempt to seduce a man who simply offers her a ride home in his car. By contrast Gina is a much more secretive and tentative individual still unhappy with the life she has managed to hold onto. Her reluctant exposure of her scar from where her breast was demonstrates her discomfort with herself and proves to be one of the more painful scenes throughout what is a particularly moving film. Some may only realise the connection between these two characters by the end but it at least justifies their commonalities as much as their differences. Charlize Theron is particularly touching as Sylvia who grows from considering all means of escaping her past to realising that she must take responsibility for the choices she has made. Theron skilfully presents Sylvia as a charming employee but contrasts this with vulnerability as she stands on the edge of a cliff or strips down to physically and emotionally reveals who she really is. As the fragile Gina Basing is also impressive conveying the emotions of being caught in a largely joyless marriage as well as the temporary happiness and suspense of having an affair.Although it commences in a convoluted and perhaps frustrating manner The Burning Plain is a rare film that would greatly benefit from a second viewing.

	onyx:emotionText "The Burning Plain presents three very different women living in the USA and in Mexico. The first is Sylvia Charlize Theron who works in a restaurant and is having an affair with her married coworker. They have casual passionless sex but he does not want her talking to other men. The other two women are Gina Kim Basinger and her daughter Mariana Jennifer Lawrence. Gina who has recovered from breast cancer is married but is still having an affair with a Mexican man. Mariana finds herself particularly responsible for looking after her siblings but she is also continuously suspicious of her mother and is determined to find out what she is doing. Mariana also forms her own romance with a Mexican boy despite the objection of his friends and family. In addition to these women the film also focuses on a Mexican crop duster and his daughter Maria Tessa Ia who works in the fields with him. Her life is turned upside down when his plane crashes and he is left in the hospital with a leg injury.For almost a decade Guillermo Arriaga has been a consistently prolific screenwriter involved with mature adult cinema that centers on the fragments of time and place. His collaboration with Tommy Lee Jones on the film The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada as well as his partnership with director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu through the pictures Babel and 21 Grams represents his most noted efforts. After having a disagreement with Irritu though Arriaga insisted on writing and directing The Burning Plain himself. As with his previous works this is a slow burning and sometimes confronting film but the separation in time however has not been made as obvious as it was in the past. It is difficult to discuss this without revealing the way that these seemingly disjointed and unrelated stories connect. Initially it seems as though there are too many characters and stories obstructing the audience's accessibility to the most interesting portions of the film with Sylvia. By the end the stories do intersect and relate in a deeply personal manner revealing how the past can haunt and shape the present. Perhaps on a second viewing it would be a much more rewarding film in having a greater understanding of where these characters came from and how they grew from the mistakes of their past.The heart of this film is the contrast between two women Syliva and Gina who are both searching for happiness in the most irresponsible and selfish manner. Sylvia remains content with exposing herself to almost anyone in a pursuit to find some kind of connection or physical relationship. Her affair with her coworker is followed by a brief encounter with a client and then her failed attempt to seduce a man who simply offers her a ride home in his car. By contrast Gina is a much more secretive and tentative individual still unhappy with the life she has managed to hold onto. Her reluctant exposure of her scar from where her breast was demonstrates her discomfort with herself and proves to be one of the more painful scenes throughout what is a particularly moving film. Some may only realise the connection between these two characters by the end but it at least justifies their commonalities as much as their differences. Charlize Theron is particularly touching as Sylvia who grows from considering all means of escaping her past to realising that she must take responsibility for the choices she has made. Theron skilfully presents Sylvia as a charming employee but contrasts this with vulnerability as she stands on the edge of a cliff or strips down to physically and emotionally reveals who she really is. As the fragile Gina Basing is also impressive conveying the emotions of being caught in a largely joyless marriage as well as the temporary happiness and suspense of having an affair.Although it commences in a convoluted and perhaps frustrating manner The Burning Plain is a rare film that would greatly benefit from a second viewing. With the knowledge of the revelations at hand one might be able to see how these various stories have influenced each other in a more complete way. Regardless of the issues with time though the performances stand on their own merits providing interesting conflicted characters who continue to suffer because of their choices and their desire to be loved.";

The story threads we are asked to follow seem unconnected.But if any movie rewards patience a clich I know but true in this case it's The Burning Plain.The movie has a big secret that becomes apparent gradually about halfway through. At first what we are watching seems to be happening concurrently. The revelation is that some scenes are about two decades apart.We are watching in some cases we learn the teenage and adult versions of the same people played by different actorsactresses at different points in the characters' lives.Once this dawns on us the movie becomes totally engrossing.The basic plot is simple. Two families one American and one Mexican become linked by an adulterous relationship. There is a tragic fire causing two deaths. And it's not an accident.Recriminations. Bitterness. Hatred. Years and years worth of ugly feelings. These two families hate each other. Yet there's these two teenagers one from each family. They find each other. Sound familiar? Charlize Theron carries this movie all the way to the last scene. Kim Basinger playing the adulterous mom is also poignant. There's a scene where she reluctantly displays her breast cancer scar and her lover kisses it. Puddle city boys and girls.I docked this movie a point for a totally gratuitous nude scene that doesn't even make sense plotwise. Who tries to seduce a stalker? I am not that savvy about Mexican filmmakers and I gather this is the product of a team of young Mexican writers and helmers. All I have to say is go for it guys! Let's see some more.".

It is not fast moving I agree doesn't need to be. I am also of the opinion that the title does have a double meaning in the context of 'burning plain' where the mobile home burns and also the 'burning plane' crashes in the Mexican desert with Santiago. Terrific film don't think the critics do it enough justice. As I say in a year 2009 when movies have been generally way below standard this movie is an eye opener and a winner.

Originally called 'Spirit Warrior' and hoping to cast loads of English baddies among them Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons the film is a horrid example of far too much creative control given to one man too blinkered by his own agenda to bother giving us anything resembling decent storytelling.There is nothing significant or exceptional about Seagal's direction. Nor is the action very well done. It's cut too lazily and not shot for maximum viewing clarity. But what reeks about the story is that some big oil magnate called Michael Jennings a completely hammy Michael Caine wants to build a really shoddy oil rig in Alaska made out of dodgy parts because the rights to the land are about to revert back to the Eskimos after 30 years of nonuse. So why wait 30 years to build the bloody thing?Seagal plays Forrest Taft an oil rig fireman who suddenly develops a conscience and is promptly eliminated from the payroll by way of being blown up. Only he is rescue by the Eskimos and this is where the film just goes insane goes on a spiritual journey in which he wrestles bears and turns into eagles and stuff. I mean what the hell is all that about??? Don't even get me started on the scene where he makes a fullygrown hardass redneck cry in a bar full of similar stereotypes when the philosophy touches his soul. Then he gets his old self back together and sets about righting all the wrongs of Aegis Oil and saving the environment by littering it with dead bad guys. Jennings hires a bunch of mercenaries including R. Lee Ermey and Billy Bob Thornton to take out Taft but of course they all prove to be useless since Taft is revealed to be an exCIA Agent oh dear God..Nothing much really happens apart from shooting and dying and Seagal beating up nameless extras. We've seen all of this before and it's no different this time round.I do appreciate his environmentally friendly attitude but it could have made it a little less obvious and campy. Seagal's tacked on speech at the end originally ran for 30 minutes Jeezuz sufferin' but Warner finally stepped in and said a big nono. We could have had an Oliver Stone or Insider amount of paranoia and conspiracy but this just ends up as the worst of Seagal's Hollywood movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well as the IMdB reviews show not everyone is a fan of this film.  It's true that the philosophising and Eskimo mystique in the midsection of the film do slow it down.  It is also true that the closing environmental speech may be a tad heavyhanded.  Yet I find it refreshing to see a largebudget action movie that actually tries to be about something.  To his credit Seagal's films have generally struck an antiEstablishment tone in contrast to the complacent Republicanism of Schwarzenegger.  Of course having said all this the tactics of Seagal's hero Forrest Taft in blowing up large quantities of Alaska are not perhaps what Greenpeace would recommend!  As to the qualities of the film there are some strong savage action scenes a stylish if overthetop villain in Michael Caine and wonderful photography. After all those Die HardUnder Siege efforts with characters running around claustrophobic buildings in semidarkness the panoramic views of Alaska make a nice change.  Another good score by Basil Poledouris.".

It is also true that the closing environmental speech may be a tad heavyhanded.  Yet I find it refreshing to see a largebudget action movie that actually tries to be about something.  To his credit Seagal's films have generally struck an antiEstablishment tone in contrast to the complacent Republicanism of Schwarzenegger.

	schema:reviewBody "What drew me to On Deadly Ground was that it had a few new ideas in its locker that I hadn't come across in many other action movies. The setting was Alaska which sounded intriguing. The action was backed up by an environmental message which also sounded intriguing. The hero was played by a wooden martial arts actor while the villain was played by a prolific Oscarwinning superstar which sounded like an irresistible pairing just for the novelty value of seeing them on screen together. Add to that the fact that the music was by Basil Poledouris whose scores for Conan the Barbarian and The Hunt For Red October are alltime great pieces of film music. On Deadly Ground seemed to have the promise and the potential to be something pretty interesting. Alas the film fulfils very little of its potential. It's a particularly inept action flick.Troubleshooter Forrest Taft Steven Seagal works for an oil company in Alaska fronted by the unpleasant Michael Jennings Michael Caine not in his worst ever film but certainly providing his worst ever performance. Taft gradually begins to realize that the company he works for is responsible for appalling environmental damage but he can't get them to approach their business with a more environmentallyfriendly outlook.... so he does the next best thing  he kicks some butt! Taft goes on a worthy crusade against his callous singleminded bosses. Hired mercenaries are brought in to stop him but Taft either evades or kills them in the Alaskan wilderness and ruthlessly closes in on Jennings.Seagal made a major mistake in directing the film himself. He lacks fluency as a director and has little grasp of how to link scenes correctly. Nor does he seem capable of coaxing decent performances from his surprisingly good cast. The film stumbles with nearrandom carelessness from one badlyacted scene to the next diverting occasionally for the odd expensivebuttotallysoulless set piece. There are flashes of pretty cinematography and in parts the action is crisply and competently choreographed but generally the film is a disappointment. After the roasting that it received Seagal's box office appeal took a permanent dip and Michael Caine stopped prostituting his talents in every film that was offered to him and actually started looking for scripts worthy of his ability.".

	schema:reviewBody "After making a name for himself with his string of late '80searly 90s action thrillers  mainly dealing with corrupt cops and tough city life  Seagal went on to bigger thing with UNDER SIEGE. However after a while something bad happened. Seagal an environmentalist got it into his head to include outofplace messages to the viewers about the damage we're causing the earth and this influence can be seen in ON DEADLY GROUND FIRE DOWN BELOW and even in his 1996 crime thriller THE GLIMMER MAN. ON DEADLY GROUND is an odd film  a typical action fest with some hugely inappropriate content seemingly tacked on in the middle and at the end of the film. The perpetrator of this crime is none other than Seagal himself unwisely given directorial control for the first time and probably the last judging by the poor reception this film received at the box office. While I did enjoy moments of ON DEADLY GROUND as much as Seagal's best work there are many problems to contend with.The first is the pacing. For an hour the action content is kept to a minimum with a single bar fight being the sole beating that Seagal delivers. Happily he's up to his usual habit of breaking wrists and beating up on bad guys who are bullying an Eskimo for fun. The whispering hard man veers close to torture at one point as he repeatedly humiliates and forces bonebreaking blows down upon his unwilling opponent. The rest of the hour's time is a literal whirlwind no scene lasts for more than a few minutes with the exception of one notable moment which I'll come to in a second of corruption and pretty scenery and a silly moment where Seagal injured by an explosion is brought back to life by the Eskimos and goes on a 'spiritual journey'. What a load of rot.Now I'm one of Seagal's biggest fans at least of the films he made in his heyday but this sentimental stuff is hugely out of place in a film like this. In fact it's laughable and ruins any fun we might have been having as it's just so darned boring. And pointless. Happily once it's over Seagal gets down to shooting and breaking up the baddies and this time around he has more than his fair share of enemies to combat the body count reaching the mid 30s and being surprisingly high for a film of this kind. In the final act he infiltrates an oil rig and blows everything up. This part feels a lot like UNDER SIEGE and follows the basic pattern of blow something up kill some baddies blow something up kill some baddies. I love films like this and the deaths are all varied and quite creative some guys burn a guy is thrown into the rotors of a helicopter someone dies in a car crash other guys are beaten to a pulp. Seagal makes traps for his enemies just like in the UNDER SIEGE films and these are bits I love too. The best bit was where he used a plastic coke bottle as a makeshift silencer for his gun.The acting ranges from the hilariously inept to completely over the top courtesy of Michael Caine as the stereotypical comic booktype villain who constantly swears and rants at people. He's great. I know how people hated to see this fine actor lower himself but over the top acting is one of my secret loves over the top acting that is not wooden acting. Seagal is his basic self let's face it he plays the same character in every film while Joan Chen is virtually unnoticeable in a supporting role. John McGinley lends solid support as a fellow bad guy as does R. Lee Ermey as a crewcut mercenary. ON DEADLY GROUND is by no means a good film and it's seriously marred by Seagal's selfrighteous speech at the end about pollution. Yes man we agree but not here! There is some good action and good fun to be had if you can overlook these flaws. A classic example of a sobadit'sfunny film.".

When the rig foreman comes to Taft with tales of faulty equipment Taft looks into it and finds Jennings is rushing the rig compromising safety in order to drill within a 13 day deadline before the oil rights revert to the Eskimos. Jennings kills the foreman and frames Taft for industrial terrorism bringing in mercenaries and the FBI to stop him.  With Taft saved by the Inuits and taught the way of the bear he arms himself to stop the rig drilling.In Seagal's debut as director he is given clear reign to base a story on a muddle of mysticism and environmental concern.  The story is pure cod but it allows him to not only battle evil oil corporations but actually do physical battle with them.  For half the film Seagal dances with wolves' before he dumps all thoughts of spirituality arms himself with a cabin full of weapons and does battle with the mercenaries as he tries to blow up the oil rig  he conveniently ignores the environmental damage done by this!The action is the usual unimaginative stuff where Seagal does moves on baddies who come at him one at a time.  He's starting to look a little old and out of shape here but if you like his fighting generally then this is OK.  It's a little hard to swallow when he takes on a elite group of soldiers but I suppose that if you're watching this type of film then you're happy with whatever you get!  Once the film ends we are treated to a straight lecture on the environment and big business  it is full of open statements and sweeping requirements with no real practical solutions. Unlike his fights he doesn't hit the target once.Seagal is as usual a terrible actor  only one facial expression terrible oneliner delivery and generally no talent.  Here he shrouds himself in smugness and native American mysticism making it even harder to accept him. Caine has a laugh hamming it up as the oil baron but it's not a performance one could describe as good in any sense of the word  his American accent keeps changing to Cockney and back again!  The rest of the cast are neither good or bad  they don't really have the material to do anything with  but it has a load of name' actors.  John C McGinley is alright Ermey does what he always does but has done better and Billy Bob Thornton is in there if you keep your eyes open!Overall it's slightly worse than most Seagal's films because of the environmental message being unsubtly rammed down the audiences throats.

I recommend this film to all Seagal fans and even people who don't necessarily like him. if you like non stop action with a great plot and good cast watch this movie.This movie is about a greedy business who owns an oil company in Alaska. Seagal works for him but fights back once they kill his best friend and try to kill him. The Eskimo's take Seagal in and show him how things are going wrong because of the oil company. Michael Caine plays the villain and plays the part the quite well. So watch this movie and take it for what it is...a great action flick with a good message.".

I recommend this film to all Seagal fans and even people who don't necessarily like him. if you like non stop action with a great plot and good cast watch this movie.This movie is about a greedy business who owns an oil company in Alaska. Seagal works for him but fights back once they kill his best friend and try to kill him. The Eskimo's take Seagal in and show him how things are going wrong because of the oil company. Michael Caine plays the villain and plays the part the quite well. So watch this movie and take it for what it is...a great action flick with a good message.";

There's a nice mix of action star selfindulgence and political commentary on the evils of oil. Seagal is Forrest Taft ? a no nonsense renegade who plays by his own set of rules for some sort of oil rigging company owned by some guy named Michael Jennings Michael Caine playing a character who is so evil that he has jet black hair!. That is until Forrest's friends start accusing him of turning his back on the environment. Forrest doesn't like that much. Nobody calls him a 'whore' and gets away with it. After twenty minutes and a random bar fight Forrest reads a fourth gradelevel computer screen that pretty much spells out how economically dangerous oil rigs can really be and how his boss is making sure that silly things like the environment don't get in the way of a profit. Rather than develop complex protagonists and antagonists we get a clear black and white split Big corporations and oil companies are evil and Eskimos are goodas they help Forrest become spiritually reborn as a 'manbear' and regain his sights on kicking ass.Chances are you weren't watching for plot anyway. But the guilty pleasure parade just keeps on going dialogue that'll make you smile best line 'You didn't find Flint but you managed to kill an unarmed Eskimo!' lots of explosions horrible supporting actors and a chance for Steven Seagal to play 'the slap game' with one of his judgmental oil workers. On Deadly Ground gives Seagal plenty of opportunity to kick ass and arch his eyebrows in a suspicious manner but the same can't be said about poor Michael Caine. As the film's antagonist Caine turns in a two dimensional performance that may have been modeled after a villain from Captain Planet. There's something sad about watching a two time Oscar winner grit his teeth for two hours of screen time. Just laugh at him. He sleeps on a nice pile of money. All and all horrible film that will keep you laughing with it's misguided attempts to make an action film about more than just explosions.I for one would suggest that Seagal update this film to reflect the events of the Iraq war. He could start off as an Iraqi hiding the weapons of mass destruction. Then realize Weapons of Mass Destruction cause harm to society. And along the way get really ped off when he finds out it was all about exploiting the Iraqis out of oil. Summary Come for the heavy handed ecological commentary and laughable acting Stay for a wonderfully overthetop Michael Caine.".

Caine at an all time career low plays a completely evil person so completely over the top it's actually pretty laughable. My guess is Caine signed on before he read the script. When he realized what an abomination he was doing he decided to overplay it as much as possible in an attempt to save the movie. Sadly it doesn't work.I had the pleasure of seeing this in a theatre back in 1994. It was just so incredibly TERRIBLE. I wanted to leave but I just couldn't stop watching! People were walking out in great numbers after the first hour and the few that were left by the end made a bolt to the exits when Seagal started giving an environmental speech at the end!

The fightscenes and actionscenes are as explosive and violent as ever in On Deadly Ground but this movie gives us some important messages about the environment.  The openingcredits are fantastic as is the soundtrack composed by Basil Poledouris.  I dont really understand why people dont like this movie as its a very good one. 910";

But On Deadly Ground is truly awful not even worth having on the TV in the background while you do something else it's badness seeps from it in an unholy miasma that taints your soul.   I cannot be sure but I would venture that this was the moment in time where you can see Seagal's career just take a huge nosedive into vile obscurity. On a related note I caught the first 5 minutes of Half Past Dead on WOWOW the other day... couldn't watch anymore as it was so laughable but not in a Plan 9 from Outer Space way more in a my God they paid him MONEY to make this way.

	schema:reviewBody "The Cannonball Run has been vilified by many critics over the years but I love this movie and have been watching it ever since I was little. This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun. The plot is simple enough race from one end of the country to the other for a million dollars and avoid the law on the way. The cast is jammed with big names and just about everyone in the movie that has a speaking part is a star of some stature. This movie is simply great fun and has a lot in common with the rest of director Hal Needham's filmsi.e. Smokey and the Bandit. I can't really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie. Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos. Don't expect a lot in the way of plot or acting or effects or anything like that and just enjoy the ride. The outtakes at the end of this and Cannonball Run II are hilarious and it makes it more fun for me anyway to know that this movie was just like a big meeting of old friends. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. are great as Blake and Fenderbaum respectively. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise anchor this film they're the main charactersand the give and take between these two make them one of the best comedy teams I have ever seen. Bottom Line Buy this flick drag it out every once in a while and have fun watching it with family or friends. A truly fun movie to watch.".

The Cannonball Run and the original Smokey and the Bandit are my favorites. Made back when Reynolds was hitting box office gold The Cannonball Run auto race begins in Connecticut and features the goofy allstar cast passing each other up until they get to their final destination California. In addition to Burt Reynolds the movie also stars Dom DeLuise as Reynolds partner Roger Moore pretending to be himself Farrah Fawcett as the woman Reynolds and DeLuise pick up at the beginning of the race and two late great entertainers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. as two phony priests driving a red Ferrari. All are involved in the race and its a wild ride all the way to the finish. Adrienne Barbeau Jackie Chan Jamie Farr Mel Tillis and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw also star.

There are a lot of good stunts and chase scenes in this movie as well as a long brawl towards the end with all the Cannonballers against a gang of bikers led by Peter Fonda!To quote the Brain Gremlin from Gremlins 2  Check it out one time won't you!

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing people get away with some of the most ridiculous actions in comedic fashion is always tantalizing. How do they get away with such foolishness? That doesn't happen in the real world as often as this. If only I as in the viewer could be that crazy with no problems. This is exactly what this liveaction version of Boomerang's Wacky Races 1968 is. It's a movie where rules don't apply to main characters as well as physics gags and mindset. The movie just can't be taken on a literal level otherwise the viewer will not enjoy it.Joining director Hal Needham in this racecar comedy is veteran actor Burt Reynolds who has also completed several projects in the past with him so it's no surprise they are in this project either. Costarring Reynolds is a slew of other wellknown actors singers and models. Playing Reynolds right hand companion is Dom DeLuise who also has an alter ego whom no one seems to understand of how he shows up and exits. Together they ride in an ambulance as a disguise to help them win the race. Accompanying them is their doctor played by Jack Elam who was cast perfectly because of his unmoving left eye. To name a few more Farrah Fawcett Sammy Davis Jr. Dean Martin Jackie Chan and even Roger Moore who pretends he's Roger Moore all play funny characters.This is the real strong point to this movie it's an ensemble cast and if you're a viewer who likes seeing movies with lots of star power this is one of them to see. The story however written by Brock Yates isn't anything special. The plot is about a bunch of wacky racers doing what they can to win and really that's all this movie needed. It does give a backstory to Reynolds' character and DeLuise's alter ego but it's nothing to be real interested in. As for the comedy parts of the writing that is a slight bit stronger than the story itself. However that also doesn't mean every joke was funny. There were some places there just were not funny enough when it should have been.Each actor has their own thing going for them and it's because of that that they all don't rely on the same thing to make a joke. Again my favorite was Jack Elam playing the doctor. God he was a laugh! And surprisingly the score provided by Al Capps did a decent job as well. His tunes may have not been longer than a good 30 seconds but it did evoke the right feeling of the movie which was lightheartedness. One thing that did bug me was how politically incorrect and sexist everything was though. I understand that it this time it wasn't taken seriously and I also understand that this is partially what helps make the film effective in a comedic sense but unfortunately in today's age it can be offensive to some who are closed minded individuals.There isn't a story to fall back on which can leave some people feeling empty. But if you're looking for a film with a lot of star power fast vehicles and various sparks of clever comedy then this goofy car race just may hit the spot.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cannonball Run is a comedy where a group of adventurers played by an allstar cast including Burt Reynolds Dom DeLuise Farah Fawcett Roger Moore Dean Martin Jackie Chan and Michael Hui participate in a crosscountry car race and will resort do nefarious tricks to win.A friend of mine told me that this is a plotless nonsensical comedy which isn't something I am a big fan of. However this turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have seen. While there is really no basic plot to the movie except for the wild car race theme and while there is nonsensical stuff Hal Needham's direction really made this movie an attention grabber from start to finish from the car racing at light speed at the beginning to the allstar fight scene toward the end.Seeing each of the characters' physical comedy and quick humor as they compete in the race is what makes this movie entertaining. Burt Reynold's calm and collected demeanor as he cracks his jokes and his facial expressions toward the weirdness and oddball events that take place are humorous and his frustrating partnership with the superherowannabe Dom DeLuise is fun to watch. Roger Moore did a great job in spoofing his James Bond character bringing with him his suave charm refined British accent and his acidic wit. Jackie Chan and Michael Hui brought with them their classic Hong Kongstyle comedy humor quick wit fasttalking and martial arts action. Rounding up all the physical comedy are some evident but harmless political puns and ethnic stereotypes.It's just interesting seeing all these wellknown legends in a wild comedy it's screwball stuff but they aren't done childishly or overboard. Filled with surprises it is a really fun movie I just wished that there was a little more action scenes and also comedic stuff from Roger Moore Jackie Chan and Michael Hui. And I would have liked to see the other Cannonballers emphasized more. But I still highly recommend it! Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe it but when this film was released back in 1981 Burt Reynolds was the world's no.1 box office movie star. In this totally mindless chase comedy Reynolds is supported by a cast of high profile actors in extended guest roles all of whom play entrants in a wacky coasttocoast illegal car race. The film has little plot to speak of just a series of stunts crashes and broad comedy moments. Much of the time it misses its targets but from time to time there are genuinely funny vignettes and laughoutloud oneliners. Noone could ever seriously place this film on their list of alltime classics but it's not as bad as critics like Maltin have claimed.Mechanic J.J. McClure Burt Reynolds and his schizophrenic buddy Victor Dom Deluise  who occasionally loses it and transforms into his deluded alterego Captain Chaos enter a car race from New Jersey to California. Fellow entrants include a suave Englishman who thinks he's James Bond Roger Moore two conmen disguised as priests Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr a womanising sheik Jamie Farr a Subarudriving Japanese stuntman Jackie Chan and a couple of busty bimbos in a Lamborghini Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman.Scenes that work e.g scenes that ARE funny include J.J and Victor landing an aeroplane in a busy street to purchase more beer the Japanese racers almost crashing because their driver is busy watching porn movies on the inbuilt TV the Lamborghini babes repeatedly dodging speeding charges by flashing their considerable cleavage at the prosecuting cops and any of the hilarious outtakes shown over the closing credits. Jack Elam also has some amusing scenes as a very unreliable doctor with a penchant for injecting anaesthetics into people's asses! In other parts the film is less successful with rather a lot of lazy performances and scenes that don't tickle the funny bone because they are too immature or just too stupid. The Cannonball Run is loud broad fun very easy to watch and even easier to forget!".

Whenever J.J. and Victor  Reynolds and Delouise  would get into it and be crackin' up everyone else would too. Now here is the original we are all on strike The actors and this is where we are gonna hang out and party while being in this movie! The actor's strike what an uprising! This is one of those non ' Politically correct.' you gotta love this one type of movie. Jackie Chan in his early days before many knew who or even what he was....talented. From Roger Moore playing himself no identity crisis there you gotta love him to the tree lovingFarrah Fawcett and her new beau the 'Wild Bull' marching on Washington D.C. to ban the sale of colored toilet paper due to irritation! But the best being all the speed hungry degenerates looking to qualify and get into the race. The major major running crosscountry from sea to shining sea in the shortest amount of time. The cast is heavilypacked with oldschool 'giants' that came together and made the race more fun altogether. Two priests in a Ferrari 308. An English agent in an Astin Martin. A big man and a suave guy with a crazyeyed doctor in an ambulance along with a female hostage passenger from an auto wreck to an all female team in a black Lamborgini that can get to a sailing pace of 220 miles per hour! Whoa. A Japanese racing team with night scope glasses and a rocket powered Subaru. This band of unpoliced roadrange nuts are out in full force and flying down the highway!! If you catch a glimpse I'm sure it will be accompanied by a deranged smile. Forget Jimmy Carter and skyrocketing gas prices this feature delivers more laughs per mile than a hybrid gets good mileageIn the whole simple plotbased laugh road rally this is a fun and intoxicated comedy for the undiscriminating comedy viewer. The fun and hilarity is infectious!! The actors since being in the middle of the actor's strike had time to hang out and throughout the movie you see the uninhibited lunacy that putting all these personalities together with a lot of alcohol will do. Then at the end credits its role 'Bloopers' more enjoyment with the ones who couldn't keep their lines straight! This is a staple comedic kill the 55' mile per hour speed limit and blow away the other racer out and out good time! A classic for decades to come. Sheer madness but all in good company!Recommended oh yeah... ".

In that film you had a number of really fast exotic sports cars being driven full bore on everything from Interstate highways to LA's concrete riverbeds whereas in Cannonball what we get mostly are the film's numerous stars mugging for the camera each trying to be funnier than the next. The problem of course is this leaves little time for the actual racing. So the bottom line is this  if you're looking for a decent comedy with a bunch of 70's Hollywood stars this film is quite good.

	schema:reviewBody "Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke  mean moody dirty. But this film gives you much more  and you don't want most of it.First and foremost  this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.However when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster Bates  looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for 50000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest Hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.A wealth of things arise here which just don't add up  1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls  these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? 3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off  without protection I may add  to take confession? No way.4. Rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder  immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? 7. Why get Rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately  even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him? Again  utterly ludicrous. And besides  she falls in love with him in record time  a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and I say that in jest along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house  but yet will bed a blind girl.12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is  and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing  the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.13. Hoskin's priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy scene.I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.Oooppps  I have just mentioned them.Overall  a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in Rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.410.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke  mean moody dirty. But this film gives you much more  and you don't want most of it.First and foremost  this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.However when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster Bates  looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for 50000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest Hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.A wealth of things arise here which just don't add up  1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls  these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? 3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off  without protection I may add  to take confession? No way.4. Rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder  immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? 7. Why get Rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately  even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him? Again  utterly ludicrous. And besides  she falls in love with him in record time  a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and I say that in jest along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house  but yet will bed a blind girl.12.

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Mickey Rourke's third best movie the first being Angel Heart and the second being Year of the Dragon.Rourke teamed up with Mike Hodges the director of such classics as Get Carter and the more recent Croupier in April of 1986 in London.The whole movie was filmed on location in London the Irish scenes at the beginning were filmed probably in Herts.  The actual church is in Canning in London near the ill fated Millennium Dome and still stands today.  It wasn't being used as a church at the time and the roof damage was real due to a bombing in the second world war. The church still stands and is currently used as a community centre.Rourke plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist with a heart who recently bombed a school bus by accident and fled to London to evade the IRA and start again.  He is taken on by local kingpin Jack Meehan played by a very camp Alan Bates whom has a day job of a funeral director and by night a nasty villain who wants Fallon to do one last job and he will pay him well and give him a passport and ticket to the US.The mark Fallon is to kill is another local kingpin whom Meehan wants dead so he can take over his drug business.  The mark he has to kill always visits his mother in a local church where Fallon shoots him but is seen by Father Da Costa played very well by Bob Hoskins.  Da Costa won't cooperate with the police after hearing Fallon's confession and the whole movie then is based around Jack Meehan trying to kill Fallon and the Da Costa.Rourke's accent is spot on maybe not to a true Irishman but certainly to most it is very good and his acting is on top form.Hoskins is believable and carries of being a vicar fairly well and the script also tells he is an ex army officer which gives him a bit of reason to be little rough on some of the villains.Look out for a young Anthony Head from Buffy and a blind Sammi Davis whom was very popular in a lot of Ken Russell movies from the early 90's.".

	schema:reviewBody "A bizarre rather disappointing choice for nearly all involved. The film is essentially an action movie although it certainly makes an effort to rise above its lowly fate as such and make a statement about the ability to forgive others and ultimately to forgive yourself. Mike Hodges' biggest mistake is not letting the film be what it was meant to be a thriller.It begins with Irish Republican Army operatives Martin Fallon Mickey Rourke and Liam Docherty a game Liam Neeson overseeing the bombing of an English army transport truck. The bombing goes awry however and a schoolbus carrying a handful of children is detonated instead. In the ensuing chaos Martin and Liam are separated. Guiltstricken Martin goes on the run. Liam is sent by his IRA superiors to find Martin and either bring him back or kill him.Martin wants to drop out of the terrorist business and go to America. In order to get the papers he needs from creepy crime bossundertaker Jack Meehan Alan Bates he agrees to one last job the assassination of a rival gang leader. Martin goes to a cemetery to do the job but is witnessed by Father Da Costa Bob Hoskins. In order to prevent the priest from identifying him to the police Martin confesses his crime to Da Costa.And that's when things get complicated. Meehan wants Martin to off the priest but Martin says he's done killing. Da Costa is uncomfortable with keeping Martin's secret but as a Catholic priest he has no choice. And Liam is closing in on Martin every day.There are moments of genuine pathos mostly thanks to Mickey Rourke who does his absolute best with the material at hand. The more I see of him the more I'm reminded of what Marlon Brando was like in his youth. Aside from a significant facial and physical resemblance they share a vulnerability on screen that's very unusual. For the most part however this is silly stuff especially Fallon's romance with Da Costa's blind niece a godawful Sammi Davis. That was just unnecessary.I should probably mention that Alan Bates makes a pretty terrific villain and he's almost worth the price of a rental all by himself. Not quite but almost. There's also some fine cinematography. The score got on my nerves though in fact you could say the score is a perfect metaphor for the film. It weaved from mournful evocative Irish folk music to typical actionadventure crap often within heartbeats of one another.Overall an uneven occasionally dull effort. Huzzah for Alan Bates for keeping it interesting though.".

	schema:headline " Not one of Mickey's finest films";
	schema:reviewBody "Already a quarter century has passed since A Prayer for the Dying was first released and I don't think age has been kind to either Mickey's character portrayal of an IRA bomber named Martin Fallon nor to the films story line. I believe Mickey Rourke to be a fine actor whose body of work has been solid decade by decade. He is an actor that I look forward to seeing what he plans to do next. I just don't think this particular screen play was very realistic so first rate actors such as Mickey Rourke Bob Hoskins Liam Neeson and Alison Doody who had thought they had ordered top grade steak were served ground beef instead for the screenplay. The movie is about Martin Fallon a cold hearted IRA bomber who hangs up his TNT after accidentally blowing up a school bus of children which was intended for another IRA target. Of course Martin Fallon is forced to come out of retirement for just one last hit which he completes for another mobster appropriately at a cemetery. Unfortunately Martin fails to see the priest Father Michael Da Costa who witnesses his assassination. The priest is played by the very versatile actor Bob Hoskins. Yes there was a steady stream of IRA villains planning other hits the London Bobby's were continually chasing after the elusive IRA bomber Martin Fallon the Irish mob wanting their own way and the film even had a blind damsel in distress named Anna played by Sammi Davis who Martin Fallon falls in love with. Even with all this potential and actors of the highest caliber the film lacked any depth of true characters or continuous suspense. Instead I felt the movie just plodded on through out and left me half way through the film expecting little more to come of it other than a disappointing ending which was the case.I give the film a rare 5 out of 10 only on the strength of Mickey Rourke and Bob Hoskins otherwise my rating would have been even lower.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke  mean moody dirty. But this film gives you much more  and you don't want most of it.First and foremost  this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a busload of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.However when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster Bates  looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for 50000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest Hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.A wealth of things arise here which just don't add up  1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls  these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing. 2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off  without protection I may add  to take confession? No way. 4. Rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder  immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? 5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular for days afterwards without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid. 6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? 7. Why get Rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous. 9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately  even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him? Again  utterly ludicrous. And besides  she falls in love with him in record time  a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates point of view. 11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and I say that in jest along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house  but yet will bed a blind girl. 12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is  and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing  the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked. 13. Hoskin's priest is an exarmy guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalledfor and yet another cringeworthy scene.I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.Oooppps  I have just mentioned them.Overall  a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in Rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.410.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Prayer For The Dying is a melodramatic romantic action thriller following IRA assassin Martin Fallon Mickey Rourke a man with a brutal path in life whose long buried conscience surfaces after an explosives mission goes awry resulting in the death of schoolchildren aboard a bus. It's a bold scene to start a film with and in every instance after it Fallon has a haunted frenzy about him clearly damaged by what he did and saw. As if that weren't enough he now finds himself compelled to murder a priest Bob Hoskins who witnessed one of his militant crimes. Fallon spends a lot of time hesitating and in that hesitation he strikes up a romance with the Hoskins's blind daughter Sammi Davis finding sanctuary and a modicum of redemption with the two of them. A lot of nasty people from his past are looking for him though including his amoral former partner Liam Neeson an evil British crime kingpin the great Alan Bates and the kingpin's murderous brat of a son Christopher Fulford. Obligatory shootouts personal and religious angst sappy sentiment and dodgy accents particularly from Rourke ensue. He can blend into a lot of roles and pull off a lot of different characters but it seems an Irish accent is a stretch and it shows. As the character of Fallon himself ethnicity aside he does a bang up job though. Bates is razor focused in playing anyone and his villain here is a spidery creepo. Neeson is young and doesn't get much to do except hassle Rourke but their confrontations are nicely done by both parties. Director Mike Hodges whose other work I've never really seen seems to like slow and deliberate action scenes very old world and sometimes repetitive but entertaining nonetheless. Not the best IRA thriller out there most of the events here have little to do with the movement anyway and focus more on Fallon but a decent way to spend a couple hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1986 actor Mickey Rourke was riding out the crest of the wave created by performances in films like 9  WEEKS and BARFLY. But after those films his star seemed to be falling and it wouldn't be until the mid2000's that he would be considered somewhat bankable again. Most of this was due to his personal life and not the performances he gave. This film was proof of that.Rourke stars as Martin Fallon a top IRA assassin wanting to get out of the life. It seems his last mission resulted in the deaths of a number of children and he's had enough killing. Escaping to London he's looking for a way out and one is provided for him by gangster Jack Meehan Alan Bates. Kill his rival and he gets a new passport and passage to America.Fallon falls through with the contract but is seen by a local Catholic priest Father Da Costa Bob Hoskins. In an attempt to force the priest to remain silent he confesses the killing to him hoping that the oath he took to never reveal what is said in confession will do so. In talking to the priest he also makes the acquaintance of his blind niece Sammi Davis.While this may have worked it doesn't satisfy Meehan whose brother saw that Da Costa was a witness. Meehan reneges on the deal unless Fallon agrees to kill the priest. With both the mob and the IRA who fear his betrayal to the cause after his leaving them on his tail Fallon must try and find a way out as well as insure the safety of both Da Costa and his niece. The odds are against him and it isn't until the last few minutes of the film that a resolution is found.Critics at the time slammed Rourke's Irish accent but that seems to be something they tend to do far more often than not. The same thing happened to Kevin Costner when he chose not to fake an English accent in ROBIN HOOD. The reality is that this is not something most will notice nor will it change the overall performance here. Rourke's Fallon is exactly what he is intended to be a man whose conscious troubles him for past deeds faced with the potential to commit more of the same in an effort to save himself.Hoskins is what he always is a top notch actor who gives his all to the role offered. He too is a character faced with a dilemma remaining faithful to his oath to God or going slightly off center to report the fact that Fallon is a murderer. It's not an easy choice and has been used in more than one movie using confessional revelations for this purpose.The film is well made well acted and well directed even if director Mike Hodges complained when the film was released that it wasn't what he intended and that the studio took the reins from him before it was completed. Even with that being the case the movie remains interesting and entertaining.Twilight Time once more presents the film in a clean bluray transfer that make it the best out there. Extras include an isolated score track with some effects director Mike Hodges on A PRAYER FOR THE DYING director of photography Mike Garfath on A PRAYER FOR THE DYING and the original theatrical trailer. As with all of their releases Twilight Time is limiting this to just 3000 copies so if interested make sure you buy one today.".

I played Fallon in the park meeting with Liam Neeson's character played by another student. Our fellow thespians loved the intensity but were a bit perplexed by the slow pacing.Secondlythe scene with Fallon and the priest at the pulpitafter Docherty is shot by his female partner.Maybe it's partly because of my Irish heritage but I LOVED this film.The soundtrack features some lovely pennywhistles and a bittersweet melody. Ialso enjoyed the Bach Fugue sic though Fallon's organ playing didn't look that realistic to me I play.Liam Neeson is wonderful as always. The look on his face as Fallon turns away from him in the park is priceless.He knows he just signed his own deathwarrant.Secondly the previous scene where he announces Herehere I'll not go near this place to the funeralworker informer. What authority! Some memorable quotes I once saw some writin' on a wall in London Derry ... that said is there a life before death? and I don't wanna keep wakingup hearing the screams of young children I lost somethin a long time ago...everything and the ending when Fallon asked God to Pleasepleaseplease forgive me then dies in the arms of the grateful priest. Wow! Also Bates is terrific as devilangel crimeboss and that line I don't think you quite know who I am Father. It truly could have been written about a mafioso or a gangbanger who is curved back in by people who believe he knows too much ally or not The IRA wants him back in their fold or dead.Trust me  it happens daily in this country.In my humble opinion Like Mel Gibson's Hamlet  Rourke is surrounded by some of the best actors in GB and gives a nearly perfect performance. Nuanced and understated yet with a quiet intensity that should have earned him an Oscar or at least a nomination.Who did he anger to be so vilified by Hollywood's honchos?Lastly Bates was said to have chewed up the scenery by a critic. Does anyone know what that means? Love to all all over this blue planet !!!".

I'm not sure what issues they had with this formulaic but suspenseful adaptation of Jack Higgins' novel but I thought it was a good thriller. Rourke plays Martin Fallon a seasoned IRA gunman who prefers a sawed off shotgun but abandons his IRA convictions after he witnesses a dreadful but senseless accident over which he exerts no control. Fallon and IRA associate Liam Docherty Liam Neeson watch in horror as a school bus minivan transporting children accelerates past two British lorries hits a tripwire meant for them and detonates an explosion that wipes out the kids. Everybody flees and Docherty is sent to break Liam back after Fallon has fled country. In London Martin encounters more trouble. A murderous mortician Jack Meehan Alan Bates of Zorba the Greek wants to hire Fallon to knock off an adversary. Meehan is prepared to forge Fallon a passport and pay him 50thousand to eliminate his opponent. Fallon kills Meehan adversary but things go awry here too. An unsuspecting priest Father Michael Da Costa Bob Hoskins witnesses Fallon's execution style killing. Instead of shooting the priest on the spot Fallon turns and walks away. Later Fallon confronts the Da Costa in the confessional and Da Costa refuses to identify him. The police question Da Costa but he refuses to divulge his knowledge about Fallon. This is where A Prayer for the Dying lifts part of its plot from the Alfred Hitchcock movie I Confess. As it turns out Da Costa has a relative Anna Sammi Davis who falls in love with Fallon even though she cannot see him. Meanwhile Docherty and his woman Siobhan Donovan Alison Doody of A View to a Kill track Liam down with order to bring him back or kill him. Docherty cannot bring himself to kill Fallon but Donovan cherishes no such convictions. She kills Docherty as he is sitting up in bed blowing his brains out. Meanwhile Meeham's sleazy brother tries to assault Anna but she stabs him to death with a pair of scissors. Fallon's death scene is memorable. The performances are all superb especially Hoskins who plays priest who was once a soldier. Like I wrote I'm not sure why Hodges and Rourke didn't like this atmospheric thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "In his youth Rourke looked like a lion a big feline he was extremely leonine and robustthe way BrandoDe NiroCagney and Gabin were leonine. Then all the directors began casting him as a freak or a brute or a CroMagnon. It seems that from a certain moment on he has found only imbeciles to cast himas there certainly can be no rational explication for this chronic miscasting.Very seldom one finds such a freshness integrity sincerity and inspiration as could be seen in Rourke's youth roles. He was among the best.

I was very touched when I've read such things for the first timethen I saw that it was a routinea clich the journalists used periodically for every new talent. The journalists did this with Cruise with Hanks with everybody with every newcomer that showed some talent and that promised. But with Rourke these comparisons were true. He was the new Brando the new De Niro not as good as Clift and Pacinobut better than Nicholson.Like those already mentioned here and like some others like Widmark and Robinson and Crowe and Fresnay Rourke was one of the actors really deserving being seen. I remember with emotion the era of my intense admiration for him and for his rolesthey were unique magic matchless unequaled. I know his blazing dazzling beauty. He was made for things infinitely greater than the crap that recently has again brought him successa crap success this time. I have seen the whole art of the actor in his intense and virile performances. He was greatin an intensely romantic and blazing way.His class of movies were the action dramasYear of the Dragon 1985 A Prayer for the Dying 1987 Johnny Handsome 1989 Desperate Hours 1990.But even his more genre movies were in fact no genre movies at allthey were merely Rourke movies. Nine 12 Weeks 1986 showcases his great roleand also Mrs. Basinger's. It is really unimportant that he detested herhe used to detest everybodyMrs. Basinger Gibson CruiseCostnerDe NiroNicholsonthe blockbuster stars etc..His youth leonine look had a very exciting human dimension. He was above all his colleagues above all the competitors of the '80s. He began with declarations a la Gibson Gibson has begun earlier but not better Gibson was very vocal about his independence and not selling himself to the Hollywoodian industry. Rourke tried the same thingextremely angry but also quite imprudent. At the beginning of the '80s we find Gibson protesting against Hollywood speaking loud against the system etc. I still have my old almanacs from the early '80s were Gibson's declarations were picked and then towards the end of the decade we find Gibson perfectly integrated in the Hollywoodian machine and industry and making one blockbuster after another. Gibson changed I do not know why or if he ever spoke about his conversion to the system he hated and abhorred and rejected. Rourke continued his career through the mid '80s much better than Gibson from '82 to '89 he received very advantageous roles. He is a great '80s actor. Practically he did not pass the '80s he did not enter as an actor in the following decades. Some of his roles in the '80s are true creations. They really are somehow wild masterpieces of artistic intelligence and of unfailing instinctall those Stanley White Harold Angel Martin Fallon Henry Chinaski John Sedley and Michael Bosworth of his. The movies themselves mightor might not bevery good the scripts were sometimes crap rubbish stupid. Yet all his characters were very well made as if he had a huge reservoir of power to spend and to deployit is very impressing. Writing these lines about Rourke's career in the '80s I do not target any one of his films from that period in particular rather I speak about all of them.In the '90s Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man 1991 was a piece of funof honest and quite manly fun not as ridiculous as it is thought by many. But then he began to be cast mainly as a character actorwhich he isn't. He was an actor of leonine strength not a character actor.He looked like a lion they cast him as to make him look like an idiot or as a freak.Rourke naturally belongs to another sphere that of a psychological cinema very method acting oriented the same way Newman Brando Pacino Clift De Niro belong. He is not from this spoofing parodying deconstructive cinemahis roles of Marv etc. are horrible miscasts. And the only interesting directorsShyamalan and Christopher Nolan and Michael Mann or Woo Cohen or a few others do not seem to have approached him.To me Rourke means much of what was good in the '80s in a certain mainstream cinema. And not only means but concretely is. He was the only leonine young presence in the '80s cinema. He has no American successors that I know of Depp and Pitt may give appropriate or elegant or strong performances and are often interesting but they never show Rourke's leonine quality the same goes for some of his most gifted friendslike Roberts and Penn . To be entirely fair it must be admitted that later Gibson did develop this virile force on screen. In his own way Rourke was during the '80s larger than life but without betraying his roles. They were compact blazing straightforward roles .Being so much of a fan of his and accidentally reviewing only some of his crap new movies since I have started writing on IMDb I felt the desire of giving here this more synthetic take on his early career and speak my mind here about who do I think he really was. Thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a nurse for 20 years and have been around many patients who must contend daily with what normal people would consider to be adversities and handicaps. I've always looked upon them with 1 great admiration for their personal strength and determination and 2 a pervading sense of sorrow and an aching heart for their misfortune in having been denied the opportunity to interact in the world with the benefit of an intact healthy body.This movie really struck an emotional chord with me and made me realize how my feelings for these unfortunates' could be construed as condescending and insensitive. I've often wished that I had the power to heal the handicapped or to make them whole and normal. The idea that they could feel totally satisfied complete and happy despite their limitations  and that it is presumptuous of us to think otherwise  was intelligently brought to light in this screenplay. This film is based upon a true story of a man who had come to terms with his blindness and who instead of wallowing in bitterness and selfpity had learned to use his remaining senses of hearing touch smell and taste  along with a delightful sense of humor  to become a happy positive and resourceful human being with a keen sensitivity toward  and appreciation of  the world and the people around him.  This is very much like handicapped patients I have cared for through the years who left me in wonder at their strikingly positive attitudes and warmth toward humanity despite the obstacles they face on a daily basis. One of the reasons that I enjoy Val Kilmer's performances so much is that he has the uncanny ability to capture the subtlest nuances of the characters he is portraying whether it's Virgil Doc Holliday Jim Morrison etc. and then is willing to bare his soul to bring the role to fruition for public enjoymentcritique.  It's a risky daring thing to do  and I applaud him for his courage!    I appreciate the effort he makes to hone his performances by extensively researching the people and situations he is contracted to portray instead of just showing up on the set spewing his lines picking up the paycheck and moving on.  His portrayal of a blind man was COMPLETELY believable and I forgot for two hours that he was a sighted actor playing a part.  One reviewer criticized him for smiling too much when his character interacted with people.  I have to ask whether that person has ever watched Stevie Wonder Ray Charles or Jose Feliciano while they are interacting in social situations.  Kilmer nailed this part and beautifully expressed the gamut of emotions experienced by Virgil in the transformations that took place in his life. Other issues that have been mentioned by reviewers  1  A supposed lack of chemistry' between Kilmer and Sorvino  I have to wonder if we were watching the same film!  2   Yes  as a warning to households with young children  there is nudity but their intimate scenes were enacted beautifully with sensitivity and tenderness there was nothing raunchy or sensationalistic about them.  However some might take offense at the scene in the strip club  it wasn't essential to the plot development and could have been omitted.  3  The only bad language' in the film were rare scattered expletives which conveyed the understandable frustration of the main character when he was confronted with overwhelming emotions and tribulations and 4  the scene of confrontation between Virgil and his father which some people thought unnecessary but which I felt was very appropriate since their relationship and the father's abandonment of the family had been such traumatic devastating events in Virgil's life.This film is an emotional rollercoaster ride but WELL worth the trip  LOVED it!  o P.S.  If you haven't seen Kilmer as Doc Holliday in Tombstone' RUN don't walk to your nearest  video store and grab the Vista Series DVD  it's absolutely one of the best performances EVER recorded on film!  The Academy must have slept through 1993!!!!".

	schema:headline " I believed in their love. I cared for their love. I feared for their love.";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie. I adored it I felt it was one of the more genuinely touching and real love stories that I had seen in a long long time and even now more than twentyfour hours since I saw it for the first and I promise you not last time I am still haunted by its emotional power and how it drew me in with its passion. Inspired by a true story and starring a very real actor and a very real actress At First Sight touched my heartstrings and yanked on them all the way through. It also contained a very humanistic touch apart from its romantic elements one that I think everybody can appreciate in one way or another.As the movie opens Amy Benic Mira Sorvino an overworked architect is essentially booted out of her office and sent to the winter land countryside resort on a vacation by her coworkers. During her stay there she befriends a blind therapist Val Kilmer with whom she begins a slowlydeveloping romantic bond. Despite his condition they grow closer to each other and become passionately devoted up to and past a surgery that they hope can restore his eyesight.At First Sight is a fictionalized adaptation of Shirl and Barbara Jennings a couple who passionately loved each other even though the former was completely blind. Their story was documented by Dr. Oliver Sacks. Adapted from his account by Steve Levitt and directed by Irwin Winkler the movie becomes a powerfully dramatic love story that contains so much of that reallife passion from the people that inspired it.It is easy to criticize At First Sight for being too conventional too derivative of other Hollywood love stories. But I don't think this picture falls under those categories and those type of films such as Hope Floats. First of all sometimes it's not about plot twists or breaking the mold. Sometimes a movie can strike with just as much power or more as in this case simply by utilizing those conventions and building upon them in a way that is fresh. And they do that here. The two central characters are very wellwritten characterized as thinking caring human beings who love and hunger for each other. A commendable move on the filmmakers' part was the casting. Instead of placing the typical romantic leads who are more body than personality they cast two very real performances. Gifted and goodlooking as they are Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino I've always felt were very real. They aren't merely putting on a convincing act they transition something very real into their performances and you can sense that. And as a defining example I want to cite the scene in here that I usually gripe about the sex scene. Whereas with most erotic scenes in movies I tend to get the feeling that my time is being wasted or that the director is losing faith in his own picture and using a cheap gimmick to stimulate my interest I did not feel that here. There is a brief and very visceral erotic moment between Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino  and I know people are going to start laughing at this point  and I did not get a negative reaction because this scene was not lustful. I wasn't thinking about the sex I wasn't even thinking about Ms Sorvino's body. I was thinking about the passion and the love that was emanating from this scene. Here comes the one that I'm sure will get the biggest laugh yet.I was not turned on I was moved.That's the core of what I loved this movie. Unlike so many of those contrived excuses of love stories that I see in so many movies I believed in the love between these two characters. I was convinced they were two people who adored each other. I believed in their love I cared for their love I feared for their love. But what also makes the movie so good is the way the subject matter of blindness is treated. I imagine that for some seeing or merely knowing about the subject matter of this movie can be a comforting reminder that lack of eyesight is not lack of humanity. For me it was a reminder of just how thankful I am to not only have my eyesight but my health. These two very authentic emotional elements stirred a great passion in me as I watched the film and kept me in play clear to the end.Can I criticize anything in the movie? Well yes two short moments. One was a superfast zoom upon Val Kilmer's eyes accompanied by a whooshing sound effect. The other was a jump cut montage of Ms Sorvino imitating emotions. These two scenes were a little out of place and seemed to be from other movies. But it's a two hour and nine minute movie and these two bits add up to what less than a minute? You do the math.At First Sight is a wonderful movie with a strong emotional chord. Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino are absolutely wonderful as are the underrated Kelly McGillis as the jealous troubled sister Bruce Davison as the optimistic surgeon Nathan Lane as the unorthodox and deliberately comical vision therapist and Steven Weber as the lascivious fellow architect. It's an incredibly touching love story that I'm telling you I cannot be satisfied with after just a first sight. I'm going to need at least two more before I could possibly even come close to being too familiar with this genuine little jewel of a motion picture.".

	onyx:emotionText "I loved this movie. I adored it I felt it was one of the more genuinely touching and real love stories that I had seen in a long long time and even now more than twentyfour hours since I saw it for the first and I promise you not last time I am still haunted by its emotional power and how it drew me in with its passion. Inspired by a true story and starring a very real actor and a very real actress At First Sight touched my heartstrings and yanked on them all the way through. It also contained a very humanistic touch apart from its romantic elements one that I think everybody can appreciate in one way or another.As the movie opens Amy Benic Mira Sorvino an overworked architect is essentially booted out of her office and sent to the winter land countryside resort on a vacation by her coworkers. During her stay there she befriends a blind therapist Val Kilmer with whom she begins a slowlydeveloping romantic bond. Despite his condition they grow closer to each other and become passionately devoted up to and past a surgery that they hope can restore his eyesight.At First Sight is a fictionalized adaptation of Shirl and Barbara Jennings a couple who passionately loved each other even though the former was completely blind. Their story was documented by Dr. Oliver Sacks. Adapted from his account by Steve Levitt and directed by Irwin Winkler the movie becomes a powerfully dramatic love story that contains so much of that reallife passion from the people that inspired it.It is easy to criticize At First Sight for being too conventional too derivative of other Hollywood love stories. But I don't think this picture falls under those categories and those type of films such as Hope Floats. First of all sometimes it's not about plot twists or breaking the mold. Sometimes a movie can strike with just as much power or more as in this case simply by utilizing those conventions and building upon them in a way that is fresh. And they do that here. The two central characters are very wellwritten characterized as thinking caring human beings who love and hunger for each other. A commendable move on the filmmakers' part was the casting. Instead of placing the typical romantic leads who are more body than personality they cast two very real performances. Gifted and goodlooking as they are Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino I've always felt were very real. They aren't merely putting on a convincing act they transition something very real into their performances and you can sense that. And as a defining example I want to cite the scene in here that I usually gripe about the sex scene.

But here comes At First Sightwhich is not quite so lifeand death but it's just as determined in its modest way to milk those tear ducts dry. In this case though the scientific context of the movie  about a blind man who regains his sight with unexpected repercussions  makes for a subject considerably more interesting than the romantic drama to which it is attached.At First Sight is based on the writings of neurologist Oliver Sacks the movie Awakenings was adapted from his work as well. It tells the true story of a 50year old blind man named Virgil who works as a YMCA masseur. On the eve of his wedding he has cataracts removed which allows him to see for the first time in 40 years. The experience however turns out to be more painful than joyful. As Sacks notes the questions raised are profound and have interested philosophers from John Locke to George Berkeley. Is sight a learned activity? What is the relationship between a world understood through touch and one understood through sight? The basic facts have been moulded into a trite romance that could easily fit between a pair of Harlequin covers. Unfortunately the film glosses over the science and deliberately avoids some of the odder aspects of the original case. Virgil on gaining his sight also managed to pack on about 50 pounds stress made him eat. Somehow though you don't expect a star of Val Kilmer's magnitude to take the Raging Bull route to character authenticity through poundage.Instead what we have is a story of a woman who discovers the perfect man almost loses him and then regains him. Mira Sorvino plays Amy Benic a hotshot New York architect who heads off for a spa weekend in a charming New England village. Before she knows it a hunky masseur has her calf muscles in his hands and has her melting like warm butter under his probing fingers. Entranced she returns for further rubdowns until one day she approaches Mr. Magic Fingers as he's getting on a bus and discovers  omigod!  he's blind.After a brief Internet search Amy discovers that Virgil doesn't necessarily have to be blind and she lands a top surgeon Bruce Davison to cure the problem. It turns out that Virgil is a bit reluctant and his sister Jennie Kelly McGillis is downright hostile to the idea of improving her brother's lot. Love wins though and Virgil agrees to undergo the treatment. Soon Virgil and Amy are sharing her New York apartment. But Virgil who has accommodated himself quite well as a blind man is now a very inadequate sighted man who can't read or write or interpret even the most basic social signals. He's miserable trying to learn how to see again and the relationship goes into a tailspin.Much of the dialogue during these dreary lovers' quarrels focuses on blindness in love and living with one's blind spots and limitations she has a toosymbolic chunk of unfinished sculpture she started in college. Nathan Lane pops up in the role of a wise and funny counsellor the sort of part that usually goes to Robin Williams. Isn't seeing wonderful he says to Virgil when he takes him to a strip club. Seeing sucks says a disconsolate Virgil. Roll over George Berkeley and tell John Locke the news.Director Irwin Winkler Night and the Cityis rarely better than pedestrian in handling this story. At worst the dramatic elements are plain clumsy.The most interesting moments in At First Sight have nothing to do with the love story but rise instead from Virgil's struggles with the social rules of seeing. What do facial expressions mean? How do we learn to look away from the homeless? There are a few moments that try to capture Virgil's viewpoint  lights glare moving shapes  that are as useful as anything the movie has to say about the conventions of seeing. Given the rich visual opportunities of such a topic it seems a great waste the movie wasn't directed by someone with a more astute eye. Benjamin Miller Filmbay Editor.".

He showed great dimension to make me realize that sighted or not he was a complete person. There is much to be appreciated about this movie and everyone can learn from it. On the basis that this is a true and important story and Mr. Kilmer's performancethree plus stars.";

The movie plodded along a bit more and I felt like we'd NEVER see him have the operation to get his sight.During the operation there are boring scenes which go on much too long between Sorvino and the sister.  AFTER the operation it begins to get interesting again.BUT BUT BUT... they don't spend enough time on the interesting stuff. The movie skims over everything.  The romance is going stale he's learning to see and there's that absurd father storyline but none of the storylines are fully developed.

	schema:reviewBody "AT FIRST SIGHT 1999 Starring Val Kilmer Mira Sorvino Kelly McGillis Steven Weber Bruce Davison Nathan Lane Director Irwin Winkler     124 minutes    PG13 for sexuality and nudity and some language By Blake French based on comment by Lynda French and Faye BlinkIn many ways At First Sight is not a good movie. For instance It does not do a good job of explaining the inspiration for the plot the blind man's optical surgery. That is unfortunate because I really was interested in that concept.The film based on a novel called To See and Not See is centered on a man who has gotten used to being blind. He knows his entire way around New York. He then falls in love with an architect. Her name is Amy. Virgil the blind man is hired by complete coincidence to be her massager. The minutes he touches her she knows that this man is different for other men she has formed relationships with in the past. The plot is strong but thin at the same time. For instance the film takes heed in developing the characters but never the conflict or villain or subplots. If the director would have decided to focus on those things a bit more or a lot more in that matter the film would have been wonderful. After all it is well written and performed. There is a supplot however that is detailed. The filmmakers throw in a false break up between two characters and how Vigirl deals with the misguided  presence of his distant father. This incidence is only in existence to create sappy melodrama to further the movie's running time.My main recommendation comes only from the first rate performances from Kilmer and Sorvino. Val Kilmer The Saint 1997 Heat 1994 delivers is outstanding as the blind man. He brings to life the confusion of lack of sight. Mira Sorvino Mimic 1997 Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion 1997 plays Amy with boldness and verve. She also captures the wonder and creativity of the audience's imagination. The subcharacters including Steven Weber Sour Grapes 1998 The Shinning 1997 Bruce Davidson and Nathan Lane Mousehunt 1997 are also very suburb in their roles. That said this film is not all that original. Think about it for a minute two people fall in love who have many differences and problems. Does this sound familiar? The truth this is just another romance story with a gimmick. The film works but only by the skin of its performances.".

He steps gingerly forward without his stick in to what? Could have been an old uncover well and that would have been the end of him and the film.

	schema:headline " Very interesting movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Val Kilmer The Saint is Virgil Adamson who lost his eyesight at a young age. Val Kilmer does a great job playing the part.This is not an easy role. I think that I read somewhere that he wore contact lenses that blocked his vision. This is a very interesting character. Virgil is a really sweet person. Amy Benic  Mira Sorvino Mighty Aphrodite has to take a vacation at a resort because of her job and as she drives by in the night she sees this guy playing hockey. Jennie Adamson Kelly McGillis Top Gun is his sister and has taken care of him all his life. Dr. Charles Aaron  Nathan Lane The Bird Cage helps Virgil to cope with the temporary gain of his eyesight. The problem is that not even the doctors know much about how to help Virgil. He has no sense of depth no sense of  perspective can not read the world as a person who can see is very treating to Virgil. I felt during this movie that most of us do take a lot of what we are and have for granted.  I am very nearsighted and cannot see in the mirror and have to ask for help when I lose my glasses. To me contact lenses and the highlight lenses are two of the most valuable inventions of this century. Most people do not realize that I am so nearsighted because of the nice lenses in my glasses and the contacts that I wear but without those I would really in be trouble. As an adolescent I had problems because I thought that it was ugly to wear glasses. But I had no problems with contacts at that time. I have been wearing them since I was fifteen. My contact lenses are called Toric and have to be custom made. I could never change my eye color with those lenses because that they do not come that way.  Thank GOD for the scientific advancement of this century. I could not have laser surgery because my eyes have not stop getting worse. I have a real appreciation for Virgil. What I have is nothing compared to him! The ability to see the world the beautiful color our loved ones understand people's expressions on their faces. That is all wonderful and a wonder! I was thinking  how difficult it is not to see and the special effects helped to comprehend the problem even better.  Amy tries so much to help but after trying so hard as Virgil did it is difficult to have hope. He lost his sight but did not lose his heart. This is a nice movie! Moreover especially because it is a true story.  I recommend this movie.Favorite Scenes Virgil skating with Amy. Virgil playing hockey in the middle of the night. Watching or listening to a hockey game. Amy asked Virgil Are they losing?  He said  I prefer to think that they are not winning. What a positive attitude. The cotton candies! That is awesome. Favorite Quotes  I wanted to behold not to be whole.  I am having a bad eye day!".

	onyx:emotionText "Val Kilmer The Saint is Virgil Adamson who lost his eyesight at a young age. Val Kilmer does a great job playing the part.This is not an easy role. I think that I read somewhere that he wore contact lenses that blocked his vision. This is a very interesting character. Virgil is a really sweet person. Amy Benic  Mira Sorvino Mighty Aphrodite has to take a vacation at a resort because of her job and as she drives by in the night she sees this guy playing hockey. Jennie Adamson Kelly McGillis Top Gun is his sister and has taken care of him all his life. Dr. Charles Aaron  Nathan Lane The Bird Cage helps Virgil to cope with the temporary gain of his eyesight. The problem is that not even the doctors know much about how to help Virgil. He has no sense of depth no sense of  perspective can not read the world as a person who can see is very treating to Virgil. I felt during this movie that most of us do take a lot of what we are and have for granted.  I am very nearsighted and cannot see in the mirror and have to ask for help when I lose my glasses. To me contact lenses and the highlight lenses are two of the most valuable inventions of this century. Most people do not realize that I am so nearsighted because of the nice lenses in my glasses and the contacts that I wear but without those I would really in be trouble. As an adolescent I had problems because I thought that it was ugly to wear glasses. But I had no problems with contacts at that time. I have been wearing them since I was fifteen. My contact lenses are called Toric and have to be custom made. I could never change my eye color with those lenses because that they do not come that way.  Thank GOD for the scientific advancement of this century. I could not have laser surgery because my eyes have not stop getting worse. I have a real appreciation for Virgil. What I have is nothing compared to him! The ability to see the world the beautiful color our loved ones understand people's expressions on their faces. That is all wonderful and a wonder! I was thinking  how difficult it is not to see and the special effects helped to comprehend the problem even better.  Amy tries so much to help but after trying so hard as Virgil did it is difficult to have hope. He lost his sight but did not lose his heart. This is a nice movie! Moreover especially because it is a true story.  I recommend this movie.Favorite Scenes Virgil skating with Amy. Virgil playing hockey in the middle of the night.

The characters are unrealistic the emotions are overdosed to the maximum and the screenplay throws in so many standard story cliches that you stop counting when passing 100. Just a few examples1. The Sorvino character needs an eternity to even recognize that the man who gave her a massage and talked to her for ten minutes is blind. 2. Val Kilmer is the baddest screenblind I have ever seen. And for the first hour of the movie he is permanently smiling in a way that makes me want to smash his face. 3. What the hell is the father doing in this movie anyway? Here you got the greatest standard plot device ever and it serves absolutely no purpose.I could go on and on but I got better things to do than talking about this crap.".

Mira Sorvino plays an architect named Amy who strolls into town establishes a friendship with him. She tells him of an eye surgery back home that may help him. This leads to a depressing conclusion in an attempt to get a tear from viewers who should realize that the screenwriter is cheating them. Director Irvin Winkler is at best when exploring Virgil's senses as when he listens to the rain. His previous film The Net dealt with sense also but from a different perspective. Kilmer is at the mercy of romantic clichs when more about his dealings with his condition would have been more interesting. Sorvino labours under cardboard basically acting as the love interest. Kelly McGillis is wasted as Virgil's concern sister. Then there is Bruce Davison as a doctor out to give Kilmer sight so that he can see what a piece of junk he has been cast in. Is this film taking the whole blind condition and surgical possibilities seriously? Perhaps but it is more likely that it is dull to the senses when factoring its giddy delivery. Score 3  10".

The trouble is our good guys realize that the bad guys have holed up in a mountaintop lair and will be able to see most anybody that's coming. Then Jim hits upon inspiration hire a hang gliding team to perform as an impromptu rescue unit taking lessons from them himself. The hang gliding sequences give this actionthriller something extra. Directed extremely well by Douglas Hickox Theatre of Blood Zulu Dawn this is a genuinely exciting movie that can actually keep a viewer watching. It's breathtaking with the expected impressive aerial stunts and lots of amazing Greek scenery. The music by Lalo Schifrin is just perfect as it's quite rousing and the movie just steadily builds the whole time towards a fantastic action climax. The acting is fine from most everybody involved with Coburn making for a rugged and engaging hero Culp the picture of grim determination York a feisty victim and Charles Aznavour solid as the intrepid Inspector Nikolidis. The people playing the hang gliders include John Beck Barbara Trentham Henry Brown and Steven Keats and they're a very likable bunch. Werner Pochath and Zouzou are appropriately odious as two of the terrorists. This is clearly not a movie that's too well known which is too bad as it deserves better.

Coburn lines up a travelling troupe of circusact type hang gliger performers to teach him how to fly. These are the early design of hang gliders with a rogallo wing design. The rogallo wing consists of fabric stretched out in a triangle over two leadingedge hollow aluminum spars with another aluminum tube for a spine and another for a cross bar and a lower metal loop for the dangling pilot to grip and steer by. Very much like a modern deltastyle steerable kite. These were dangerous but beautiful designs which are capable of going into a stall and nose dive straight into the ground from a thousand feet up if you are not careful and experienced but a delight to watch in flight. Before he approaches them Coburn watches the travelling aerialists' circusstyle openair act as the heartstoppingly colorful hang gliders perform aerial maneuvers with breathtaking poise and beauty. There's a pretty girl in the troup. One flyer pretends to lose his grip and plummets dozens of feet into a nearby body of water while his pilotless hang glider drifts lazily down without him. So Coburn approaches them and asks to be taught how to pilot one. Somewhere along the line while learning to fly Coburn gets casual and cozy and proposes to the performers that they join him in the rescue. If we fail you get your money back the teacher volunteers. Right! Coburn grins skeptically and knowingly to which the others laugh. Coburn isn't bitter but he's no fool and suddenly they have all been won over to his side and looking at the challenge as a team. Like I said Coburn at his best.

The opening the kidnapping and closing sequences the in and out rescue at night do manage to rally plenty of tension especially during the climax set against an isolated medieval monastery in the mountains but in between that it's somewhat mechanical in its elaborate structure. A waiting game and plans being formulated with some preachy inclusions. Well we have revolutionary terrorists fighting imperialism. Gladly Coburn's hardy presence keeps you hooked for the ride. Director Douglas Hickox paces it rather well and his streamlined handling offers numerous nitty gritty passages despite some stagy moments. Music composer Lalo Schifrin gives the presentation a bit more oomph with his grand luxurious arrangement. A tough but breezy 70s drivein action adventure.".

It would have been very interesting indeed to see what the actors would have said about their roles in Sky Riders for here we have some of the most shallow characterisation ever seen in a mainstream film. Quite why talented stars like James Coburn Susannah York Robert Culp Charles Aznavour and Kenneth Griffith were needed for these roles is beyond explanation. It is a movie built solely around a novel action gimmick hanggliding rescue mission  in terms of plot and characterisation it doesn't even make it to first base.American industrialist Jonas Bracken Robert Culp lives with his wife and kids in a Greek villa. While he's out on business a group of masked terrorists raid the villa ruthlessly executing the staff and abducting Bracken's nearest and dearest. Later the terrorists establish contact and demand a huge sum of money and various arms for their vague militant cause in return for the safe return of their prisoners. Bracken's wife Ellen Susannah York used to be married to adventureloving mercenary Jim McCabe James Coburn. When he learns that she has been taken hostage by the terrorists he quickly steps in to offer his services. When it becomes apparent that Ellen and her two kids are imprisoned in a mountaintop monastery which cannot be approached unseen from below McCabe comes up with the audacious idea of flying in by hangglider and attempting a nearimpossible rescue against formidable odds.Sky Riders is the penultimate film of director Douglas Hickox Zulu Dawn would be his last. He handles the dizzying aerial action quite well especially in the film's final quarter. However the film overall is a dispirited and utterly routine nonevent it's brief running time is either the result of a heck of a lot of postproduction cutting or else the script which unbelievably is the product of four brains simply misses out on a whole host of potentially interesting developments. The performers really don't stand much of a chance when they're asked to work with such threadbare material  Coburn smiles a lot and gets to perfect his cool macho posturing York is totally wasted as the woman with two men in her life that genuinely love her Culp spends almost the entire film wearing an anxious grimace. Harry Andrews and Kenneth Griffith turn up in a couple of onescene cameos that could've easily been played by any halfcompetent bit player. Lalo Schifrin's score is at least suitably flavoursome and the Greek locations look gorgeous but you'd be right to expect a lot more from Sky Riders. Sadly all it leaves you with are a few morsels of decent action besides that there's virtually nothing else.".

It contains a few name stars James Colburn Robert Culp but let's face it the action is supposed to be the star. On that score the film is not bad. The problem is it takes much too long to get to the action.Colburn stars as a pilot whose exwife and child along with another child fathered by Culp are kidnapped by mercenaries for ransom. While Culp works on raising the money and cooperating with authorities Coburn hires a band of expert gliders to aid in a rescue. All of this could have been told in a clean quick manner but it takes forever to get to the rescue. We even have a silly montage of the skydivers training Colburn. Not necessary. We want the action! Contrary to the first comment the skyrider scenes are not too dark even though the desired effect is for it to night time. Actually I think it was shot during the day and a dark filter superimposed on the film to make it look like night. If you look closely at the rocks you can see the shadows of the gliders. I never saw such pronounced shadows at night.The gliding scenes are well done and thrilling up to a point. My biggest problem is that the escape plan seems all too easy seeing where the kidnappers are located. Of course it's not all done without a hitch but there are no real twists to keep things exciting. The last part of the film becomes a standard shoot em up film that you have scene hundreds of times before.The film is mediocre at best. The good talent is pretty much wasted in an action film with not enough action or a smart script.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the old stripper in Gypsy says Ya gotta have a gimmick! This action film's gimmick is that the only way to stage an imperative rescue is via hang glider! Culp plays an official living in Greece whose wife York and their two children are taken hostage by a sketchy band of terrorists and held for ransom atop an abandoned monastery. The remote building sits high on a pillar with only similar pillars around it and deep valleys and cliffs as the surrounding terrain. Culp works with the police led by an almost Clousseulike Aznavour while York's first husband and the natural father of one of the children Coburn takes a different tack. He pairs up with hang glider expert Beck and his team of specialists to stage a rescue. Coburn isn't bad in his role though he's hardly challenged by the lame script. York whose low voice is down there with Vanessa Redgrave's at this point hasn't got much to do but act worried and ludicrously stand up to her captors. One scene has her sliding to the floor in fear while her terrified preschool daughter lies alone on a cot! Culp tries to convey concern but his transformation from diplomat into guntoting savior is rather unrealistic. At least Coburn was already portrayed as a man of action from the start of the film. Even more preposterous is the presentation of the circus performers in Beck's troupe suddenly becoming firearmtrained mercenaries and SWATlevel hostage rescuers in a matter of hours! Always likable Beck has the misfortune of being shown in a silly grey sideshow leotard in his first appearance. One of his gaggle includes Orsatti best known for plummeting from a table to the lighted ceilingfloor in The Poseidon Adventure and appearing in numerous Irwin Allenproduced films before gaining stature as a noted stunt coordinator. Aznavour is sometimes unintentionally funny in his role as the diminutive but exacting police chief. Andrews despite his billing barley appears at all as a grizzled seafarer. Folks expecting him to figure into the story mustn't hold their breath. Notable 60's personality Zou Zou also barely appears. The chief asset of the film is the spectacular Grecian scenery and the proliferation of location shooting. Also the shots of the hang gliders in action do provide a modicum of excitement. Unfortunately a pervading sense of inanity hangs over the film. The opening capture sequence is ridiculously shot. The boy hilariously mouths while the terrorists are killing virtually everyone on the estate They're wearing hockey masks. Since the terrorists kill everyone but the captives why bother wearing them? They take them off anyway once they reach the monastery!! Then when the big rescue comes wouldn't someone in charge have noticed that the escape route takes the participants DIRECTLY OVER the place they've just escaped from thus exposing them to just as much danger as before?? This sort of stupidity goes a long way in decreasing any points the film has scored in the way of star power interest level or excitement. Still if one checks his brain before viewing the film can provide a modestly entertaining diversion.".

We get to know the millionaire Robert Culp and the kidnapped wife Susannah York because they are familiar figures. We also get to know the local chief of police Charles Aznevour a Greek with a French accent. Except for John Beck who heads the circus troupe and teaches Coburn how to fly and whose chin seems to be a granite massif the other flyers are faceless and nameless although they too are risking their lives in a daring assault on the ex monastery where York and her two kids are being held.The opening scene has the villains bursting into Culp's Greek mansion and shooting down all the servants before making off with York and the kids. The ransom is five million dollars. Culp a nice cooperative guy is willing to pay but hasn't got five million bucks. No matter because the whole ransom business is dropped from the plot anyway eclipsed by a long and chaotic shoot out at the monastery.The editing really is execrable. So is the screenplay. Coburn seems to learn how to fly a hang glider in five minutes under Beck's tutelage. York doesn't get any lessons at all but can still take the controls during the escape when her companion is wounded. Oddly enough the movie is built around the use of the hang gliders which were a novelty at the time. Earlier novelties included wet suits and Scuba diving viz. The Wreck of the Mary Deare Thunderball. Later there were sky divers. Yet the shots of the hang gliders aren't thrilling as they should be. Much of it is at night. And the images of mountainous landscapes are jumbled and rolled about carelessly.After the escape is effected and the monastery is under assault from a horde of Greek astynomia led by Aznavour who has even given Robert Culp a rifle and dragged him along some of the hang gliders circle back to the monastery when they could easily head straight away from the area of danger. The gliders are unarmed but they keep flying around and providing convenient targets for the villains' machine guns.However for all its flaws it's a thoughtprovoking film. The thought it provokes is that no power on earth could ever get me to leave the ground in one of those flimsy contraptions.".

James Coburn of Our Man Flint fame stars as a smuggler who struggles to rescue his exwife and two children from the clutches of a treacherous group of triggerhappy kidnappers that call themselves World's Activist Revolutionary Army. This swiftlypaced PGrated 91minute suspense thriller draws its title from the hang gliders that Coburn employs to snatch Susannah York and two children from a mountaintop monastery. Robert Culp costars as wealthy industrialist Jonas Bracken who married Susannah York's character after she divorced the Coburn hero. Sky Riders was the first time that the picturesque monastery was used in a Hollywood actioneer. Several years later producer Albert R. Broccoli used the location in the Roger Moore James Bond thriller For Your Eyes Only. The aerial assault on the monastery is spectacular stuff and Coburn appears to be performing his own stunt when he clings to the skid of a helicopter in flight. Unfortunately despite its scenic settings dazzling cinematography and bigname cast Sky Riders suffers from the absence of a strong villain. Scenarists Jack DeWitt Greg MacGillivray and Stanley Mann penned the screenplay from a story by Bill McGaw Hall T. Sprague and Garry Michael White. Two problems plague this aerial actioneer. They don't have an intimidating villain and the dialogue remains pretty bland. French singer Charles Aznavour plays a Greek police man who wants to arrest the bad guys. Lalo Schifrin's music enhances the bloody violence".

	schema:headline " Whacked out but pretty imaginative kids flick";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those kid's movies that is either a charming  imaginative and original or b disturbing enough to scar you for life.  Either way it's well worth a look. There's some Norwegian cultural  touchstones that make me believe it's taken from source material well  known in it's homeland but works at face value level as well.  The storyline involves Simon a kid with 2 expressions and a magic  teddy bear whose Grandfather seems to be getting very sick. Of  loneliness diagnoses the kid at every opportunity.  At the urging of the frankly creepy teddy Simon ingests a magic potion  and shrinks himself down to go and help Grandpa.  Once inside he hooks up with Mapster the young white blood cell  cute  piece of lung matter Alvaoli.

There's some Norwegian cultural  touchstones that make me believe it's taken from source material well  known in it's homeland but works at face value level as well.  The storyline involves Simon a kid with 2 expressions and a magic  teddy bear whose Grandfather seems to be getting very sick. Of  loneliness diagnoses the kid at every opportunity.  At the urging of the frankly creepy teddy Simon ingests a magic potion  and shrinks himself down to go and help Grandpa.  Once inside he hooks up with Mapster the young white blood cell  cute  piece of lung matter Alvaoli.

Perhaps its the design which is just neat to look at and the sense that there is something behind the story beyond just being a live action Osmosis Jones for kids it is very clever a good deal of the time. This is a kids film that just tells its story and so it becomes something more than just a kids film.No its not perfect. I find the talking teddy bear oddly done the real world stuff just misses and the pacing is off I'd have liked it move not so much faster as differently the rhythm seems off somehow. Still I liked it. I'd give it a 6.5 myself with a 6 for the IMDb since in many ways its better in the parts than as a whole.Definitely worth trying if you run across the film especially if you are open to good but not great kids films with really cool looks to them.".

Despite his anguish he does what all good bears do for their humans...he helps. Simon gets a dose of magic potion to help him go inside his ailing grandfather to try to help him get better.The scenes inside grandpa are DELECTABLE starting with the grabby taste buds who cant decide if he is bitter or sweet so they use their phone to call the Cerebral Nerve Center who is already overwhelmed with calls from other parts of the body and not too keen on taking silly questions from taste buds.The costumes and cinematography are luscious and so sumptuous they are practically edible. It is a feast for your senses. So much glory for your eyes you will be rubbing them every 5 minutes and wondering if you are really seeing what you are seeing and also checking your tongue for acid residue because this movie is so unhinged and surreal you will think you took LSD. By the time you get to the love police standing guard at The Palace Of The Heart your whole world will explode with the wonder of what is possible.This movie is for EVERYONE who believes in magic and light and love and beauty and shadows and imagination  it will pump CREATIVITY out of your ears like hormonal pterodactyls...wait I am sorry ENDORPHINS come out of your ears not hormones oh well at least I got to say pterodactyls which doesn't come up in a lot of reviews you know so count yourself lucky I could squeeze it in. I'd bring up halitosis dancing and a bilious fat phobic witch with an atomizer but don't want to spoil the adventure that comes with discovering this masterpiece for yourself.Chasing the Kidneystone is beautiful  glorious and your life will be better by embracing it with your whole soul.

They're the ones who provide the funniest moments. The chemistry between Douglas and Turner shines on screen. They seem to have a good rapport off screen which might explain them doing so many movies together and looking good on screen. Turner is incredibly sexy. 'The Jewel of the Nile' has some wonderful shots of Africa and the comedic action sequences are enjoyable. The African dances are fun to watch. I was quite disappointed by the ending and what exactly was the point of the holy man being the 'jewel'? Why is this man so important to the people? There's also a terribly done pointless scene where the 'Jewel' walks through the fire. All in all it does have a feeling of adventure which would have worked better if the pacing was a little tighter.

It's funny although the slapstick sometimes is a little over done but good wins out over evil and leaves you satisfied at its conclusion. It reminds me of the On the Road movies made by Bob Hope Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour during the forties but with better if not sometimes outlandish special effects and chases e.g. the F16 chase and just as many if not more one liners.However the movie is more than just comedy. It pits secular evil against a spiritual goodness the Jewel albeit a spiritual goodness which on the surface seem naive and comic...but which in reality achieves its goals through that apparent naivty. That is a serious overtone which many of the previous comments on the movie seem to have overlooked. The Jewel does not perform miracles but his presence and comic actions create an aura of the miraculous.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Jewel of the Nile is a followup to Romancing the Stone. It lacks the greatness of the original but it keeps the same spirit. This one has lots of adventure and action even more than the original and is also far more violent.Robert Zemeckis didn't return to direct this one but 4 of the same actors reprise their roles Michael Douglas who also produced it Kathleen Turner Danny DeVito and Holland Taylor. The rest of the cast is entirely different. There are plenty of new characters and new villains.As the title says this movie takes us not to Colombia again but to the Egyptian deserts in Africa close to the Nile river. Exotic like the original's but a completely different scenario than the original's.The main villain in this is Omar Khalifa well portrayed by Spiros Focs. He is just as treacherous and dangerous as Zolo from the original film. Like Zolo he fools Joan Wilder so that she falls in his entrapments. He pretends to be a good person but he's a brutal dictator. But I do like Omar's Egyptian accent. He speaks with a charming accent. Funny that he plays an Egyptian when the actor is Greek but then Demis Roussos is a Greek who was born in Egypt.Avner Eisenberg does a nice portrayal of The Jewel but the character has a mix of charm and silliness and isn't always lovable.This film has some really funny and great sequences but also has a large number of faults and does not possess the charm of the original. Therefore it doesn't match the original's greatness.Apparently Michael and Kathleen only made this movie because their contract forced them to. Kathleen even attempted to back it out but was threatened by 20th Century Fox to be sued with a 25 million lawsuit. Geez that is just so wrong! They shouldn't have been forced to do something they didn't want. I sort of can see why they didn't want to do it and why Robert Zemeckis refused to make the sequel.I used to like this movie almost as much as the original. But now it doesn't seem that great to me anymore. Looking at it now many things about it don't make much sense. The original is a great blockbuster and a timeless classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Romancing the Stone. I was quite amazed when I knew that it has a sequel. For a long time I didn't come upon it at all some channels hate it ?!. It took me 13 years to get to watch it. And did I love it? Yes. But lesser than the first. So why is that ?! First of all the script. Compare Romancing.. to this one and you'd know the difference between the Hollywood perfect script and the Hollywood draft. Simply the first had more emotions being like a romantic comedy about the opposite attract more talk about the dreams which makes the characters humans to be related to before heroes to cheer on more hard choices there was a scene where the lead had to decide between a gem and a girl and more twists namely  more heat. This one is only a fine skeleton for all of the above however empty. Looking to the movie as a whole assures that it's not the matter of the actionwithmore movie and its pureaction sequel rather the memorable B movie and another B movie !True after the jungles in the first they went to the desert in this one and after pursuing a gem this time the gem is a man but that was it concerning any changing ! The movie is enjoyable but hyped. Everything runs very fast. In one scene  Joan is at a book signing engagement meets Omar a charming Arab ruler he offers her the opportunity to live at his palace while she writes about him she agrees leaves Jack and travels with OmarJUST LIKE THAT ?!! The characters don't think they just do. There is no gag thrown inbetween or special emotional moment. And it lacks the surprises along the way. To say the least  It's tangible that the time spent in writing The Jewel.. was less than the time spent in writing Romancing...The title character The Jewel is extremely pathetic! Who is that man anyway? Sometimes he's a very poor street magician sometimes he's a man of miracles and all the time he seems like Aone fool ! And more than that I was forced to believe that this fool is a religious leader and beloved icon ???!!! It mirrors dumb writing for sure especially when he uses naive tricks to rescue Jack at one moment while  at another  we discover that he can walk into fire with no harm whatsoever!! Or it's part of many Hollywood movies' dogma while dealing with Arabs whereas they're pictured eternally as throng of idiots the movie this round resorts to giving them a funky look sometimes to change the flavor of the pretty old idea though !. Or maybe it's the way things work in a movie about American adventurous leads where the American must be the cowboy and the rest must be Red Indians !Then THE MUSIC ! Jack Nitzsche produced electronic weak thing that doesn't live up to what it expresses of nonstop action and adventures. It's a major letdown which almost turned the movie into a cheap hasty and cheesy TV episode. And take it from me don't beat a dead horse by comparing the first's music by Alan Silvestri to this it would sound like a comparison between Charles Chaplin and Tom Arnold ! The special effects took a lot from the movie's personality as something done by big production company. They instead fit a B movie from independent destitute company! The walking into the fire scene is clear example.The 3 stars Kathleen Turner Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito aren't playing their roles inasmuch as playing at them with not much of fun. However Kathleen Turner is still a treat to watch apart. She reminds me with that husky voice of hers with Lauren Bacall. Back then at her young nonfat phase she was so sexy. And since her long legs couldn't be resisted they have been put exactly like the previous movie in always torn skirts so with a lot of running and jumping around you might have a pretty sight indeed. Even at one moment DeVito calls her LEGS and obviously he has a point. By the way for every male viewer who missed it its color was white You know well what I'm talking about !. The character of Omar Khalifa is none other than a handsome version of Muammar alGaddafi see how the smallest details refer to him the picture with the commander's white suit. At the time alGaddafi was a favorite laughingstock in the American movies. Albeit the Nile doesn't flow in Libya.The stars' glow not glee and the action sequences are the sole facts in this movie. Director Lewis Teague who made many TV series mastered a good comic book. He was as vigorous as Robert Zemeckis the director of Romancing the Stone yet with less saturated script and more speedy pace. I bet with not much time between the 2 movies they quickened the sequel. Overall The Jewel.. made money as huge as the first rarely when a Michael Douglas production goes wrong it works in terms of being flashy flash and it shows the nature of the initial scripts in Hollywood and the initial ideas at understanding other nations in the same city too !".

In one scene  Joan is at a book signing engagement meets Omar a charming Arab ruler he offers her the opportunity to live at his palace while she writes about him she agrees leaves Jack and travels with OmarJUST LIKE THAT ?!! The characters don't think they just do. There is no gag thrown inbetween or special emotional moment. And it lacks the surprises along the way. To say the least  It's tangible that the time spent in writing The Jewel.. was less than the time spent in writing Romancing...The title character The Jewel is extremely pathetic! Who is that man anyway? Sometimes he's a very poor street magician sometimes he's a man of miracles and all the time he seems like Aone fool ! And more than that I was forced to believe that this fool is a religious leader and beloved icon ???!!! It mirrors dumb writing for sure especially when he uses naive tricks to rescue Jack at one moment while  at another  we discover that he can walk into fire with no harm whatsoever!! Or it's part of many Hollywood movies' dogma while dealing with Arabs whereas they're pictured eternally as throng of idiots the movie this round resorts to giving them a funky look sometimes to change the flavor of the pretty old idea though !. Or maybe it's the way things work in a movie about American adventurous leads where the American must be the cowboy and the rest must be Red Indians !Then THE MUSIC ! Jack Nitzsche produced electronic weak thing that doesn't live up to what it expresses of nonstop action and adventures. It's a major letdown which almost turned the movie into a cheap hasty and cheesy TV episode. And take it from me don't beat a dead horse by comparing the first's music by Alan Silvestri to this it would sound like a comparison between Charles Chaplin and Tom Arnold ! The special effects took a lot from the movie's personality as something done by big production company. They instead fit a B movie from independent destitute company! The walking into the fire scene is clear example.The 3 stars Kathleen Turner Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito aren't playing their roles inasmuch as playing at them with not much of fun. However Kathleen Turner is still a treat to watch apart. She reminds me with that husky voice of hers with Lauren Bacall. Back then at her young nonfat phase she was so sexy. And since her long legs couldn't be resisted they have been put exactly like the previous movie in always torn skirts so with a lot of running and jumping around you might have a pretty sight indeed. Even at one moment DeVito calls her LEGS and obviously he has a point. By the way for every male viewer who missed it its color was white You know well what I'm talking about !. The character of Omar Khalifa is none other than a handsome version of Muammar alGaddafi see how the smallest details refer to him the picture with the commander's white suit. At the time alGaddafi was a favorite laughingstock in the American movies. Albeit the Nile doesn't flow in Libya.The stars' glow not glee and the action sequences are the sole facts in this movie. Director Lewis Teague who made many TV series mastered a good comic book. He was as vigorous as Robert Zemeckis the director of Romancing the Stone yet with less saturated script and more speedy pace. I bet with not much time between the 2 movies they quickened the sequel. Overall The Jewel.. made money as huge as the first rarely when a Michael Douglas production goes wrong it works in terms of being flashy flash and it shows the nature of the initial scripts in Hollywood and the initial ideas at understanding other nations in the same city too !";

	schema:reviewBody "The Jewel of the Nile is a good follow up to 1984's Romancing The Stone as it continues the adventures of romance novelist Joan Wilder Kathleen Turner and her boyfriend Jack Colton Michael Douglas. The last time we saw them they were sailing into the sunset together actually 5th Avenue in NYC but close enough. Spending 6 months on the Angelina Joan wants to go back to NYC but Jack wants to go to Greece. While at a party Joan meets Omar Shareef Spiros Focas and she travels with him to South Africa Morocco to write a novel about him but she stumbles on his plan to become a powerful leader and start a war. Jack meanwhile travels with Ralph Danny Devito who has escaped his Columbian jail to find the Jewel of the Nile. That is the main plot. The acting is good not as good as in the first movie but I think Danny Devito has some terrific oneliners and the different tribes and groups the trio encounter are pretty funny. The villain stinks however. Omar is a pale imitation of Zolo from the first movie. The audience doesn't really know what he wants to do. Start a war? Bring together different people? Imitate a magic man? His true purpose doesn't seem to be explained. Also the romance between Jack and Joan doesn't seem to be developed as well as in the first movie. One minute they fight the next they make love the next they argue. What gives? All in all this is a great sequel to Romancing The Stone with some clever characters great locales and music to match. You don't need to watch the first one to understand this one but it is recommended. Rent it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Short review Dumb fun not as good as Romancing The Stone.Longer review It's not that this is a bad movie. It's a pretty average adventure film. But there lies the problem  it's pretty average.First off the script seemed hastily done. The general story line was easy enough to follow but every once in a while I would find myself thinking  now why was that being done. For example I'm sure there was a reason for having a British rock  roll technician involved in the story...but the reason escaped me totally irrelevant to the story line a distraction.On the other hand the acting was fine. Michael Douglas Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito were a charming trio as we had already learned in the first film. Douglas was just really coming to my attention in a series of 3 films including this one. I thought he was very promising and then Fatal Attraction sealed the deal. Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses where when I see her in an old film I remember just how good she was...and then wonder what happened to her turned out her health sort of defeated her star career. Danny DeVito  well he has had his ups and downs in films I don't feel this is one of his better roles although I thought the script or the director let him down here. Spiros Focs as the Khadaffilike dictator does nicely though it's nothing memorable. And Avner Eisenberg as the jewel was good for some laughs in a very subtle way.What can I say? If you watched the first film you'll want to watch this sequel but you'll surely decide it isn't the quality of the first. But it's not okay.".

But there lies the problem  it's pretty average.First off the script seemed hastily done. The general story line was easy enough to follow but every once in a while I would find myself thinking  now why was that being done. For example I'm sure there was a reason for having a British rock  roll technician involved in the story...but the reason escaped me totally irrelevant to the story line a distraction.On the other hand the acting was fine.

First off the jewel of the picture isn't some fabulously expensive gem but a person Avner Eisenberg who represents the spiritual power of his people. And then instead of giving you Omar Sharif as the wouldbe emperor you get a lookalike character portrayed by someone named Spiros Focas who I never heard of before but is apparently one of Greece's finest and most respected actors. Who knew? You know if I'm flipping through the cable channels and come across Romancing the Stone I'm liable to stop right there and tune in. I always enjoyed watching that one. Jewel of the Nile doesn't quite capture the same magic for me as the Jack ColtonJoan Wilder romance balancing act gets a little tedious at times and Danny DeVito is reduced to playing the Wile E. Coyote character of all those Roadrunner cartoons. Some of it's funny but a lot of it seems forced as well.What I didn't get was the convoluted resolution to the whole 'Jewel' premise. Recall at the finale that the crowd was wildly chanting for 'Omar Omar' right before the wouldbe emperor went over the side and then they quickly replaced it with 'AlJawhara AlJawhara' in a split second when the kidnapped Jewel was freed. Just how loyal were the Omar followers supposed to be anyway? Well I guess it was never intended to make much sense. As a vehicle to reunite Michael Douglas with Kathleen Turner and capitalize on RTS it looks like this was a moderate success. They make for an attractive on screen couple as far as that goes and the film offers some light hearted if mindless diversion. One bit of trivia I learned watching the story this time around who knew that Joan Wilder wrote 'Return of the King'?".

Where as Stone was a wellpaced funny action movie in this one there are many periods of dullness.  Danny DeVito is the only highlight to this one as once again his character is great.  The plot really kills this one though as it just isn't as fun as the originals.  It involves some sort of ruler of a Middle Eastern country who wants Joan Wilder to write about him or something.  She agrees and parts company with Jack Coltan.  For some reason the ruler tries to kill Jack by blowing up his boat and this only sends Jack after them.  Once in the country Joan begins to realize that the ruler is not as good a guy as he wants her to think.  She runs into a guy called the Jewel of the Nile who I think is supposed to be the real ruler of the country.  Meanwhile Jack and DeVito's character learn of the Jewel of the Nile from this people and mistakenly think it is some kind of real jewel worth money like in the first movie.  Some good sequences here and there but really nothing all that great.  A good scene involving a jet and anther with Jack and Joan hung over a pit are pretty good and for me the highlights of this one.  This movie just didn't appeal to me though like the first one...who knows maybe I prefer jungles to desert.".

The script is all down hill from there and trust me it has to dig its way though the gravel for it is already at the bottom of the barrel.Then there's the dialogue in which the subtext quality of the characters' conversations explains how they feel an almost certain suicide for any movie's structure showing the character's feelings is the right way of development telling the audience about them is the wrong way.How about the film's disappointing false second act. In which we first learn that the characters will be searching for a certain jewel then half way though the production the problem is solved and a new one then opens a villain named Omar wishes to take over the world. There we have it two conclusions neither of the two related to one another leaving the audience to only wish that there was an actual storyline basis here.

In another he devises a trap that not even Einstein could have concocted. And the Jack and Joan characters who seem to look like they can take care of themselves are saved in every danger scene by a natural complexion rather than their own smarts. None of the explained characters contain anything of interest to the viewer.The performances are about as good as anything else in the film. Kathleen Turner looks like she'd rather be in bed than on the set. Douglas seems to have very little confidence in the screenplay and Danny DeVito is nothing but a pesky little goofball.How about the romance in which Joan and Jack argue one minute and make love the next. There is no imagination in the scenes developing chemistry between their relationship. Thus we never care about what goes on between them.There is some comedy in The Jewel of the Nile that is colorful and energetic. Most of which isn't all that laughable however.

Apart from Albers likable German actor Heinz Rhmann also in his early 50s here is on board too and this is far from the only collaboration of the duo. Another would be their Sherlock Holmes film. They may have been the most known German actors of their time. Unfortunately this popularity does not transition into a good or even great film in this very case. It is a bit disappointing because the director Liebeneiner and the two writers Braun Kampendonk have made several somewhat known German films back in the day so they certainly did not lack experienced. But it is all too undefined. The characters are not really interesting the comedy is not too funny and the crime story is not really dramatic either. As a whole this is maybe only a good watch for huge AlbersRhmann fans or for people who have a really strong connection to the city of Hamburg. Otherwise you really shouldn't care what happens at the Reeperbahn at 030 am. I do not recommend the watch 105 mostly forgettable minutes.".

Like his character due to unruly and conspicuous behavior Krug was soon expelled from school. From this point on the biographies of Krug and Martin Hoff part ways. At the farewell party from the school Hoff meets a young woman. She fascinates him completely especially because she does not immediately give in to his bold charm but simply gives him the coldshoulder. He simply cannot take this treatment especially after he makes a bet with some friends. He sets out to look for the unknown woman and actually manages to find her on a construction site.

Childhood traumas mold her and make the fact that Theresa allows herself to be strong and fallible all the more powerful and endearing.Tired of her father's unyielding rule Theresa moves into the apartment building owned by Katherine's next attempt at a husband. As the women's freedom movement is underway Theresa is caught in the position of questioning the traditional roles for women roles against a new woman in control of her body and her sexuality. By day she teaches at a school for the deaf. By night her nightly jaunts into New York's seamier nightlife scene expose the dichotomy of being a professional woman by day who must maintain credibility and responsibility especially with young children while trying to be sexually active experimental and suffering the stigma attached to both  as whore and as a free woman  wanting purely physical experiences much the same as men yet realizing the label is different.Throughout this film Brooks explores Theresa's perpetual search for acceptance by men but a need to maintain her own identity. From a failed affair with a Prof. she was a TA to to her fling with Tony a local hustler Theresa is perpetually in question of her sexuality and her allure for men making poor choices in her partners only to endure their violence and possessiveness  much like her father. That she meets up with a homicidal drifter the New Year's Eve night she has decided to quit drugs and cruising is the irony of her selfdiscovery.The only positive male in her life appears to be is LaVar Burton's character Cap Jackson the sullen brother of one of Theresa's students. He is the only male presence in the movie that is not malevolent or trying to extract something from Theresa and during her altercation with Tony at the school he is the only person to defend and protect her.While the scare of AIDS stole later generations' promiscuity this tale still resonates for viewers especially for women on their own looking for intimacy yet craving isolation.While the ending tends to drag with one too many drug scenes the movie still packs a wallop for a finale.".

I appreciate this masterpiece as I was intrigued by Theresa's story. So much so that I read Judith Rossner's book and searched the internet for the truth behind the story. It is no secret that this tale was about Roseann Quinn and the tragic end to her life. I hits home as that the main character is really not too much different than some of the women that I knew in my young adulthood. It only took one bad decision to end it all. Diane Keaton did a wonderful job in this role. She seemed so sad because she never really did find what she was looking for. Or did she? I recall that she said she never cried despite the pain she had gone through as a child. She did not even cry at the end of the film. I think that she accepted her fate because she realized that she would never find that father figure that she desired. Very sad story and so real.".

	schema:headline " Diane Keaton 's haunting performance is unforgettable";
	schema:reviewBody "So much has been written about this film it's hard to imagine what anyone could add to the discussion. But having finally seen the uncut film after thirty years I'm going to make a few comments about it.I also recently read the novel by Judith Rossner that the screenplay was based on and one thing stands out definitelyIn the movie adaptationall of the men Theresa gets involved with are negative destructive characters in one way or another. The most striking difference from the novel is in the portrayal of James the conservative traditional man who would like to marry her. The film's James played by William Atherton is ultimately a creepy kind of guy who turns out to be pretty unstable and not the nice if dull man he is in the book. Tony is also portrayed in a more negative light by Richard Gere. He is much more sleazy and vaguely sinister than in the novel. The relationship is built up more too probably for contrast with the conventional marriage and family offered to her by James. Theresa's difficulties at mutual understanding with her angry father are clearly at the root of all her later struggles with malefemale relationships. This too is emphasized much more strongly than in the novel. Diane Keaton is convincing as a serious young woman with high ideals who finds herself leading a double life as a bar hopping party girl by night. The essential contradictions of her character are never really resolved but are certainly echoed by her sister Katherine's succession of failed marriages and affairs. Both stand in contrast to the third sister Brigid who has assumed the role of the traditional Catholic housewife and mother.There's a really moving quality about Keaton's portrayal of a seemingly fragile yet tough young woman who has had to cope with physical disability rejection by those she loves and being casually abandoned by a man she thought really loved her. Her insistence that she is  alone not lonely is not convincing ultimately. She has chosen this life of thrill seeking and playing by her own rules in contrast to the way her family would like her to have turned out but her decision near the end of the movie to quit drugs and stop hanging out at bars is a strong indication of a new resolution to find a more meaningful life. Whch leads us to the problematic ending. This film has been criticized for thirty years now for apparently showing that sexually liberated young women deserve to end up dead. Many viewers have interpreted it that way especially when it was new and the ending continues to trouble people today. I am unable to come to a definite conclusion about this. On one hand it seems arbitrary and out of left field and yet we know that the real life tragedy that inspired the novel occurred pretty much like what is shown here. For what it's worth I don't feel that the movie is suggesting that she deserved it or somehow she had it coming. One might assume that she could end up being killed by either the increasingly unstable James or the small time criminal Tony both of whom have shown jealousy possessiveness and a violent streak especially startling coming from James. But her death as the result of a sudden attack from a total stranger doesn't seem to fit the possible ending one might have expected. It's as if she were to be struck by lightning while walking home from the bar. One could even say that it has very little to do with her but is the result of the uncontrollable self hatred of the man who kills her something foreshadowed by his angry response to the man who was flirting with him earlier at the bar. This man was a stick of dynamite waiting to go off and anyone could have been the victim but it just happened to be her. The movie has its flaws but the overall impact is powerful and Diane Keaton is lovely and heartbreaking in the role of a lifetime. I only wish Theresa's story could have had a happy ending but then it wouldn't be the thought provoking and moving story it is. Well worth seeing but a very sad film about a sad life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Theresa Diane Keaton is the daughter of a very rigid catholic father and has a serious trauma with a scoliosis she had due to a congenital problem. When she was a teenager she suffered a lot to heal the scoliosis being immobilized for one year after many surgeries. When she graduates in teacher for deaf people she decides to get free from her father and to live alone in a rented apartment. She finds a job in a specialized school where she is a lovely and affectionate teacher with her kids during the day. However in the night like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde she searches for sexual freedom cruising bars having sex with the most different men having a promiscuous and very low life. James William Atherton is the only distinct man she meets and she despises him. Her promiscuous life ends in a very tragic way. I watched this movie in 1977 and I was very impressed with the role and the performance of Diane Keaton. In the same year Diane Keaton was the star of Annie Hall and I found this actress fantastic capable of acting in the most different roles. Unfortunately Looking For Mr. Goodbar has never been released on VHS DVD or BluRay in Brazil and I have not had the chance to see this movie again. However last month a cable TV channel presented it I recorded it and yesterday I watched it again. The story is still good but has aged. Although being a long movie the reason why Theresa is promiscuous is not clear enough. There is oppression of her catholic family specially her father guilty problem due to the religion there is the trauma of her congenital disease explaining why she does not want to have babies the sexual liberation of the woman in the 70's but some explanation is missing. There is a scene that is very funny in the present days with AIDS when Theresa laughs of James because he used condom for having sex with her. Richard Gere has a performance very similar to his characters in 'American Gigolo' and 'Breathless' having the same movements of his body hitting objects with his fingers like a drum etc. It is amazing the resemblance of his face at that time with the Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro. My vote is seven.Title Brazil ' Procura de Mr. Goodbar' 'Looking For Mr. Goodbar'Note On 17 February 2015 I saw this movie again.".

It's a glib apt approach the material has elements in common with women's films' of the Thirties and Fortiesnarratively it details a woman who chooses a socially unacceptable' method of living largely out of disenfranchisement from her family and society and the inevitable spiral through a dimlylit Purgatory.In those films female destiny was decided by severe social delineations determined by whether or not the male characters forgave socialsexualeconomic transgressions in Goodbar' the era's different and superficially the milieu has changed.  It's the postsexual revolution as Richard Brooks hoarily points out in unsubtle references to the women's movement.  The character's still straitjacketed by her oppressive family structure and internal demons and there deceptively appears a way out physically and psychically new apartment new life a room of one's own'. Theresa Dunn's freedom and selfdetermination will not go unpunished.The first halfhour's riveting because we see a young woman's transformation from nave emotionally hungry romantic to tough cynic.  Even more chilling is that it's not entirely an act of will in the face of an abusive father and a first love who treats her like a sexual cesspool detachment becomes a weapon of survival.  Brook's script adds greatly to the psychosexual claustrophobia of these moments as it adheres so strongly to Theresa's consciousness that the spectator views not just what she experiences but also what she imagines desires dreads.  This appropriation of Theresa's thoughts and fantasies woven into the structure of her physical existence draws and binds the audience to her journey into Hell but is also problematic and disingenuous on Brook's partas the film delineates her descent Brooks' script appears to validate the integrity of her dilemma but also implicates female sexual selfdetermination in her downfall.  That is Richard Brooks implies that Theresa's sexual freedom her insistence on subverting traditional modes of feminine sexual behavior in the film's love' scenes she is frequently filmed on top or on the right side of the screen an unusual powerposition for female characters in this context is as much or more to blame than the mental damage sustained from her messy classically dysfunctional upbringing.  This is thematically the film's greatest weakness the filmmakers' moral indecisiveness which severely undercuts the narrative thrust and focus of the filmwho are we to blame Theresa's emotionally screwy perpetually indenial familysociety for going down a moral spiralor is Theresa both protagonistantagonist in this schematic arrangement?Problematic but this ambivalence and ambiguous thematic structure also makes this film infinitely more interesting.  The anxiety provoked by these elements in conflict produces an unexpected morbidly enticing drama.  Most of the credit for this film's power goes to Diane Keaton's presence.  Her work is perfectly modulated at times repulsively real and raw and at other times devastatingly poignant in the ways she lies to herself and others about the implications of her character's actions.  She glows with dark energy gradually becoming one with the film's descent into what seems like a long long communion with Night.  Keaton nearly singlehandedly prevents the film from transmogrifying into an antifeminist diatribe by imbuing Theresa with qualities which seem infinitely flawed and human.  Amazingly she does this without descending into dramatic grandstanding or exploiting her character's weaknesses.  Flawed but full of conviction even if it's misguided seething with misdirected anger Diane Keaton is overwhelming in the film's silent sequences alone in Theresa's dim cavernous apartment suffocating in her loneliness.  Regardless of how the writerdirector or her fictional family chooses to judge her it's in the amalgamation of moments like these alone in bed with just her pillow to gratify herself no words are needed to show the turmoil she's feeling that Keaton subverts the moralistic scheme of the film and shows us something infinitely more wonderfula persona in conflict with herself unable to find an easy resolution within and without her dimly lit surroundings.  What the audience takes away are fragments of Theresa's ruptured psyche that add up to a very beguiling human drama. Keaton won the Oscar for the wrong film in 1977.In the end Theresa Dunn finds the resolution to her journey.  It's horrific.  It's even more of a shock because by that point the confused morally disjointed film has gathered into a coherent portrait of a soul in transition.  She's struggled and does she earn her fate?  Seen as a moral judgement on her lifestyle' the climax might be seen as a punishment' justified by the character's behavior and lack of morals.  In a sense it's true that the film offers up Theresa as an example of when Good Girls go Wrong and what happens when you're not what's construed as a good woman' despite the goodies and freedoms that society periodically offers up.An alternate reading of the resolution Theresa finds her Animus her male side embodied in a sexually ambiguous stranger who represents the impossibility of psychic reconciliation with the fragments of her divided spirit.   Theresa exploits and uses men as physical revenge for her childhood and the psychic wounds inflicted by her father and first love but in doing so creates a psychosexual monster of injudicious power.Theresa meets and embraces her shadow.".

I can also say that I don't wholeheartedly agree with some of the conclusions the film seems to make.To those that have said that Keaton's character is in some part responsible for her own fate well you're right. But then we all are. If you get rear ended on the highway on the way to work tomorrow it could have been avoided if you had never gotten in the car or took a different route or called in sick.I don't think she went out looking for trouble. She was lonely very lonely. She was trustful too trustful. She was naive and looking for acceptance and a whole bunch of things that I too have been at some point in my life and in some cases still am. These things made her vulnerable. But just because someone is vulnerable does not give another license to take advantage of them. Or worse.Can I be honest for a moment? I've been down that path. I encountered some of that dark side. And though I in no way was as hurt by it as she was I was still hurt. How scary to look back and realize that it could have been me. There but for the grace of God go I.But it bothers me that this is a morality tale. Perhaps it's the idealist in me that just doesn't want to accept that bad things happen undeservedly. Perhaps I just want to think that we've moved on from the way society looked upon unfettered women in that time period. Those are the things I want but then there is reality too.I was also bothered by some of the overthetop stereotypes.But still wow. Just wow.".

The screenwriting takes us on a path that has been travelled many times before protagonist goes out to find herself but only few movies struggle with it so skillfully on these levels. It tries to go down the road of the sexual revolution and women's rights but finds that at the end of that road free love is not as free as it might seem. It praises their achievements and condemns them at the same time. Even love is not painted in its traditionally positive color  in fact it is part of the culprit that throws Theresa into her decision to leave behind her traditional life in the very beginning. A painful dark movie really.Talking about darkness... the lighting design is innovative and absolutely noteworthy but extremely low at times  so make sure you watch it on a quality screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a little kid my parents let me watch most anything back in the early days of cable TV. The Blues Brothers Caddyshack Alien...I saw a lot of grownup stuff in the late 70searly 80s barely out of kindergarten. But not this one. The night my mother was planning to watch this I was sent to bed. After finally watching the whole thing its easy to see why. Looking for Mr. Goodbar is a sexedup misogynistic tale of a young teacher Keaton raised in a strict Catholic home now on her own and eagerly diving into the swingin' 70s singles bar scene. After a rugged affair with her jerk of a teacher she moves on to a series of increasingly intense affairs and drug use. As one would expect it can be difficult to be an effective teacher of hearingimpaired students if you're living such a raging lifestyle every night. Clearly something has to give. After seemingly seeing the light Keaton makes the mistake of going home with the wrong guy with terrifying results.The biggest problems with this film are the likely exaggerated scene she falls into and the lack of any kind of likable male character. William Atherton the jerk in so many 80s movies is a sensitiveseeming lover. Every time it seems Keaton is making anything deeper than a superficial connection with him she pushes him away. Though they weren't yet major stars you wish we would learn more about Richard Gere Levar Burton and especially Tom Berenger's characters. You'll see why if you watch this. You'll want to know their backstories to see what made them either dangerous or impenetrable. Keaton is terrific. She went all out for this role at a time in her career when it probably made more sense to play it safe. Even though she is making such terrible decisions but you end up feeling sorry for her since most men in her life treat her worse than dirt. The disco soundtrack is outstanding. And how about hearing legendary broadcaster Johnny Most talk about Boston Celtic basketball in the background of the family home? A nice touch. Also it was interesting how we see detailed teaching techniques for hearingimpaired kids. This film could have merely glossed over that but they didn't. The film is difficult to watch at times but you won't likely turn it off. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Theresa's fear of transmitting to her children the disease that she was suffering from and that left her emotionally as well as physically scared since she was a little girl Congenital Spinal Scoliosis the curvature of the spine. This revelation came out when Theresa had a violent spat with James William Atherton the only man in the movie who really was in love with and wanted to marry her. The other two men that Theresa had affairs with in the movie Martin Alan Feinstein and Tony Richard Gere looked at Theresa as a piece of tail who was only good for a one night stand. Who after having their way with her with put Theresa away in the drawer until the next time they felt like having a romp in the woods.Being brought up in a strict IrishCatholic home but with a dark fear of getting married and having children Theresa choose the life that she led as a 1970's swinger by night and a teacher of deaf children by day in NYC. Her younger sister Katherine Tuesday Weld was also not what her father Mr. Dunn Richard Kiley thought a nice Catholic girl should be. Even though she kept it from her father Katherine had at least one abortion and married a man out of her faith BarneyJoel Fabiani who was Jewish and who her father openly resented. It was Barney who later introduced Katherine into a sex and drug lifestyle and in the end left her for a much younger girl who he was shacked up with. Theresa's father was obsessive but very sympathetic in his wanting Theresa not to leave home and move in with Katherine and Barney in New York City. Still he could do nothing to stop her since she was an adult. Working as a teacher for young deaf children seemed to give Theresa the family that she was longing for but at the same time denied for herself by not wanting to be a wife and mother. The two lovers that Therea had before James were just what she wanted persons only to have sex with and really nothing else. Martin who after he had sex with Theresa couldn't even look at or talk to her and Tony who was both a 1970's studtype and cokehead not only got her turned on to coke but got her fired from her job as a teacher for being arrested for drug possession. The only man who could have turned Theresa's life around and who Theresa's father looked upon as his own son James a social worker in NYC was rejected by Theresa when he unlike Martin and Tony showed that he really loved her and wanted to marry her and not just spend the night with Theresa and leave her the next morning. On New Years Eve Theresa was at the singlesbar celebrating the coming of the New Year when she picked up Gary a male hustler. Gary was just attacked by a gang of thugs together with his roommate for being in drag. The very disturbed young man was a ticking time bomb ready to explode and it was his affair with Theresa that New Years Eve night that set him off. Feeling inadequate because he couldn't preform sexually with Theresa probably because he was almost dead drunk at the time Gary took out his frustrations on Theresa who realized only too late what an unstable and dangerous person she was involved with and brutally slashed and strangled her to death. Looking for Mr. Goodbar is a dark and depressing film but it honestly reflects the world of the 1970's drug and swinging generation and the story of a young woman who's psychosis played right into that world. The movie is based on the true story of Roseann Quinn who was murdered by John Wayne Wilson whom she picked up at the Tweeds Bar on New Years Eve 1973. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell on May 5 1973 some five months later while awaiting trial. It was later reported that a jail guard who was sick and tired of Wilson's threats of committing suicide provided him with the bed sheets that he ended up hanging himself with.".

You can view it that way depending on your own personal beliefs. But I view Looking for Mr. Goodbar as a movie about repressionespecially by religious beliefs.Diane Keaton plays Teresawatch for Keaton's comedic handling of this character especially in the scene at her sister's swinger party. Teresa is trying to find her way in a world that is experiencing a huge cultural shift. She transforms from a student staying at home with her hypocritical strict Catholic family to a teacher of deaf students living on her own in the city cruising the singles bar scene of the '70s. She yearns to have a life as she watches on TV the feminists march on Washington as she spends New Years alone babysitting her sister's child. Next year she'll have a much more different but tragic New Years.There are some problems with Looking for Mr. Goodbar though that turn it into something less than a classic movie. Teresa's quest for independence turns into selfdestructive behavior that seems to stem from the fact that her father is dying. Melodramatics overthetop dialogespecially Richard Gere'salso make it a tad campy. But that might be all right. I also absolutely hate the scene where she oversleeps from a night of partying and is late for school. She finds the kids running wild in the classroom and blaming her for not caring about them. I guess they never heard of substitute teachers. A lot of her school scenes slow the movie down.Looking for Mr. Goodbar has a great guilty pleasure disco soundtrackDonna Summer's Could this be Magic the O'Jay's The Backstabbers Boz Scagg's Lowdown Diana Ross' LoveHangover and Thelma Houston's Don't Leave Me this Way.

I always felt that Diane Keaton won her Oscar for the wrong movie this was released the same year as Annie Hall. The entire cast is great  a young Richard Gere Tuesday Weld and William Atherton to name a few.  All of Richard Brooks' movies have interesting casts and this is no exception.

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this film on AMC last week and it still holds up. I first saw this film in 1977 as a college student living in a one room apt away from home for the first time and it had a major impact on me. Diane Keaton made the move from the comedic heroine to the troubled Theresa Dunn a sensitive caring teacher by day looking for love in all the wrong places at night. Her inner turmoil from her childhood disfiguring disease to the relationship with her hardnosed Notre Dame loving Irish Catholic father to subsequent lovers is heartbreaking. Her search for the male attention and acceptance that she didn't receive at home is portrayed with honesty and depth by Keaton. Richard Kiley skillfully plays her father who is of a different generation where women knew their place. He would rather turn and look the other way than face some hard family truths. It's evident that Teresa has a lovehate relationship with him when she refuses to accept the nice guy social worker James as a suitor mostly because her father admires him. She would rather engage in deadend conquests than have a committed romantic relationship. Tuesday Weld was nominated for a Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role as Kathryn Teresa's highflying stewardess sister who can do no wrong in her father's eyes. Richard Gere's energy is electric and frightening during his scenes with Teresa. He has the raw male sexuality and danger Teresa finds exciting yet she is clearly his intellectual superior. Interesting stuff. Tom Berenger is great as the sociopathic loser and look for a splitsecond role for Brian Dennehey as a doctor. This movie can serve as both a cautionary tale and a history lesson....the sexual revolution never seemed so scary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Diane Keaton is a charming and attractive performer but she is not up to this role. She is visibly uncomfortable in the sleazesex scenes and often resorts to mannerisms familiar from her Annie Hall character watch this film and think of Annie Hall. It's obvious she is not immersed in the Theresa character. On the other hand Keaton does well in the scenes where she is a teacher and is quite convincing. Despite the allaround histrionics she is not bad in the family scenes with sister and father. But this film fails for a few reasons. It has a dark depressive atmosphere that is not justified by its outcome poor Theresa is damaged emotionally by her physical 'defects' and by a toostrict Catholic upbringing this is believable. And it's believable that a person lacking selfconfidence would seek out acceptance and affirmation from promiscuous sex a fairly common scenario actually. But the film really does seem to say that Theresa deserves her fate in the end. She blows off the one man Atherton who would have made sense as a partner and feels compelled to continue a descent into debauchery. Doesn't this film seem to say keep up with this kind of lifestyle and you'll end up miserable and bitter like Theresa's sister  or brutally murdered? This film seems to indulge us in its sleazy world yet it seems to judge Theresa for immersing herself in it in a vain attempt to ease her pain. Note the way director Richard Brooks chooses to end the film on Theresa's face as the life blinks out of herthere is no requiem no final coda expressing pity or remorse. We have been shown the brutal murder of a sympathetic character as if it were a scene from a cheap horror movie. Diane Keaton is not solely to blame for the ultimate failure of the film the writers and director are more responsible. Still it's hard not to imagine Keaton and Tuesday Weld exchanging roles Weld has a much wider range as an actress and certainly would have handled the 'secret life' with more conviction.".

As a kid I always wondered what my teacher's did after school and I think this show's a realistic vision on what a teacher may do after school. This film has a lot of sex or sexual moments. The weird thing is while there is a lot of sex scene's in the movie it was actually the rape scene at the end of the film that really got the movie into hot water and it's not even that easy to see. The thing that annoyed me was the damn flashing blue light at the end. I guess this was the filmmaker's way of passing censorship if the rape and murder at the end was hard to see by the flashing light but it really strained my eye's and if you suffer from photosensitive epilepsy this is a seizure waiting to happen. Also what happened to Tony? The last time you see him he shout's at Theresa a little and then just goes away. And the same goes for James. During and after the New Year's scene the movie start's to drag on a little. Over all if your old enough see the movie and if your not well too bad your missing out. Oh one last thing when Diane Keaton blows into the condom it is really funny thought I'd slip that in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Richard Brooks Looking for Mr Goodbar stars Diane Keaton as Theresa Dunn a school teacher who seems prim and proper by day but has clandestine sexual encounters with men by night. Brooks offers a number of trite explanations for Theresa's obsession with sex but only one is interesting as she suffered from Polio as a kid Theresa believes that she is unable to give birth to a healthy child. Denied motherhood she thus embarks on a kind of hedonistic nightlife. When it was released 1977 many viewed Looking for Mr Goodbar as a supremely reactionary film. This is a flick about sexually liberated women who turn their backs to Catholic and conservative values have lots of sex and are then beaten and stabbed to death by men. Gay men meanwhile are portrayed as sexually confused brutes who stab women as a means of assuaging their impotency around women. The supposed message don't sleep around and stay away from crazy gays!Indeed upon release a number of Catholic priests praised Looking For Mr Goodbar and took out newspaper spreads promoting the film. To believers Goodbar was touted as a stern warning! Brooks himself structures the film as a descent into hell Theresa's basement apartment becoming increasingly dark and dingy as the film progresses. The film then ends with Theresa being killed in the shadows Brooks focusing on a creepy freezeframe of her darkness shrouded dead face. It's like an image out of The Exorcist.But whilst Goodbar may be reactionary in some regards Brooks also complicates things. His male characters are uniformly violentdisgusting and several sequences seem designed to bash conservative America see Brooks' masterpiece Elmer Gantry. The film seems less like a condemnation of the sexual revolution than a nihilistic repudiation of everything including sex any of the men Theresa encounters could be killers.Elsewhere the film undermines anyone who might embody a traditional normality. University professors cheat on their wives and exploit female students Theresa's own family unit is fractured sustained by repressive illusion and her father is a brute. Meanwhile the men Theresa sleeps with dance with phallic switchblades or are ignorant of her needs. The film's gay murderer is himself not crazy because he is gay but because social forces won't allow him to be gay he juggles a wife and an offensively portrayed stereotypical gay lover. Theresa also echoes the gay character in complex ways. She is excluded from a normal life because of a hereditary disease and is the victim of a society that assigns people xed roles imposing on them notions of what a real man or real woman should be. For Brooks normality seems like a ideological construct and violence arises more out of a cultural situation than individual responsibility. Complicating things further the film's love scenes are shot to emphasise Theresa's pleasure and the bars she frequents are positively portrayed and not hive's of debauchery.Regardless of the film's message Looking for Mr Goodbar is a dull repetitive film. It features a number of jarring flashbackfantasy sequences is sensationalistic flaunts its grime is overly proud of its sleazier elements and wastes a strong performance by Diane Keaton.610  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some negative critiques that I've read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! And it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time we put this one up on our monitor ALL the copies we had went out fast with waitlist requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! YES I did buy this film for my own video library!. I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child'  J. L. Reate  but after looking at his profile in IMDb I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad because he definitely had an onscreen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong who played the Old Man I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China'  1986. At any rate this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny but it still was out of sync. OK so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mindset of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!".

There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.Yes it's silly but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where Hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends.

I have never been much of an Eddie Murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass. Charlotte Lewis is to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable luminously gorgeous. Some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation. Through it all Murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp. Like that movie we have James Hong the incomparable actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of Derek. Since 1955 Hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession. The Golden Child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching. After four years I have seen The Golden Child again I enjoyed it even more! It truly is great fun.".

So NaNa to you Mr Jarrell.Jarrell is fast talking hip and irreverent but well meaning  in other words everything that summed up Eddie Murphy in his relevant phase which ended around the release of Boomerang when Murphy got all serious and introspective and sht.Kee on the other hand is poised deliberate sombre and calm but surprisingly well equipped at unexpected times  and I'm not just referring to the scene where she gets her white blouse soaked for no good reason... well two good reasons.After the two team up the trail takes them to the lair of a bikie gang then Chinatown where they meet Kala the Oracle of sorts who informs Chandler of the magnitude of his quest  being that he is the Chosen One after all...Chandler also learns that the Golden Child is a once in a thousand generations birth born specifically to rescue humanity capable of restoring life with a touch wise beyond reason and with the ability to make a Pepsi can dance to classic 1950s songs...So there's that.There is a cool oddball dream sequence and a trip to Tibet to obtain the sacred dagger that can free the imprisoned Golden Child and a pretty hilarious scene where Chandler and Kee have to bluff the airport security to escape from Tibet.When finally meets his nemesis Sardo Numspaa Charles Dance formally to discuss the dagger for child swap things heat up before a good quickie 80s finale in which everything builds to a crescendo the figureheads of good and evil have a showdown and all is resolved in about 6 minutes.Perhaps The Golden Child doesn't move quite as fast as films do today and the FX  which were pretty cool in the 80s  don't hold up quite so well now it is fun and enjoyable while it lasts and also has a few quotables including One of her ancestors was raped by a dragon which is a line you don't hear every day.Final Rating  6.5  10. Not often listed among Eddie Murphy's highlights but The Golden Child is a very solid and worthwhile  if a little dated  relic from the 80s.".

So NaNa to you Mr Jarrell.Jarrell is fast talking hip and irreverent but well meaning  in other words everything that summed up Eddie Murphy in his relevant phase which ended around the release of Boomerang when Murphy got all serious and introspective and sht.Kee on the other hand is poised deliberate sombre and calm but surprisingly well equipped at unexpected times  and I'm not just referring to the scene where she gets her white blouse soaked for no good reason... well two good reasons.After the two team up the trail takes them to the lair of a bikie gang then Chinatown where they meet Kala the Oracle of sorts who informs Chandler of the magnitude of his quest  being that he is the Chosen One after all...Chandler also learns that the Golden Child is a once in a thousand generations birth born specifically to rescue humanity capable of restoring life with a touch wise beyond reason and with the ability to make a Pepsi can dance to classic 1950s songs...So there's that.There is a cool oddball dream sequence and a trip to Tibet to obtain the sacred dagger that can free the imprisoned Golden Child and a pretty hilarious scene where Chandler and Kee have to bluff the airport security to escape from Tibet.When finally meets his nemesis Sardo Numspaa Charles Dance formally to discuss the dagger for child swap things heat up before a good quickie 80s finale in which everything builds to a crescendo the figureheads of good and evil have a showdown and all is resolved in about 6 minutes.Perhaps The Golden Child doesn't move quite as fast as films do today and the FX  which were pretty cool in the 80s  don't hold up quite so well now it is fun and enjoyable while it lasts and also has a few quotables including One of her ancestors was raped by a dragon which is a line you don't hear every day.Final Rating  6.5  10. Not often listed among Eddie Murphy's highlights but The Golden Child is a very solid and worthwhile  if a little dated  relic from the 80s.";

	schema:reviewBody "A sassy AfricanAmerican who finds missing children for a living is hired to locate and retrieve The Golden Child who's really important to both sides in some ancient battle between good and evilfortunately the latter is easily identified by frequent use of black clothing and the music cues. Apparently his skepticism towards and disrespect of the magic and all the culture and such was deemed the best material because they sure don't waste a single opportunity for making fun of that. The plot is fine and develops reasonably throughout. Pacing is OK. I can't claim this ever really excited or gripped me though it did occasionally entertain me. The fights have their moments. Jokes and gags vary but if you're into Murphy's schtick as it were in the 80's you'll probably enjoy it. With some of these you almost have to wonder if all of it was in the script or if they just let the camera run sometimes when it was on him and didn't yell 'cut' until he seemed unable to think of more for that scene. The special effects are terribly dated and you can tell exactly where they begin and end here as well as where the budget forced them to take a shortcut. Design and creativity is fair though this doesn't hold a candle to countless others in the genres. The acting is good. Charles Dance gets to ham it up more in Last Action Hero but he's still a decent villain here. Editing and cinematography are standard. There is moderate to strong language in this if it's somewhat infrequent. Violence is mild. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Eddie. 610".

	onyx:emotionText "A sassy AfricanAmerican who finds missing children for a living is hired to locate and retrieve The Golden Child who's really important to both sides in some ancient battle between good and evilfortunately the latter is easily identified by frequent use of black clothing and the music cues. Apparently his skepticism towards and disrespect of the magic and all the culture and such was deemed the best material because they sure don't waste a single opportunity for making fun of that. The plot is fine and develops reasonably throughout. Pacing is OK. I can't claim this ever really excited or gripped me though it did occasionally entertain me. The fights have their moments. Jokes and gags vary but if you're into Murphy's schtick as it were in the 80's you'll probably enjoy it. With some of these you almost have to wonder if all of it was in the script or if they just let the camera run sometimes when it was on him and didn't yell 'cut' until he seemed unable to think of more for that scene. The special effects are terribly dated and you can tell exactly where they begin and end here as well as where the budget forced them to take a shortcut. Design and creativity is fair though this doesn't hold a candle to countless others in the genres. The acting is good. Charles Dance gets to ham it up more in Last Action Hero but he's still a decent villain here. Editing and cinematography are standard. There is moderate to strong language in this if it's somewhat infrequent. Violence is mild. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Eddie. 610";

But thankfully Eddie Murphy is downright hilarious in this film making jokes and acting goofy in every scene.  This movie contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. While most people may just consider them.....whatever they want....I crack up just thinking about them.  For example the scene where Chandler Eddie walks into the bar and starts harassing the customers to tell him where Tommy Tong who works for Sardo the demon makes me laugh hysterically every time I see it.  And the first scene where Chandler is on a talk show trying to tell the public about a missing girl and the flakey host keeps interrupting him also tickles my crazy bone.  Hmm lemmie think of one more AHA!  The dream scene where Chandler meets Sardo and his henchmen is making me laugh right now as I think about it while typing.  There are just too many other funny scenes that make me chuckle uncontrollably to list here.If you decide to rent this you'll be in for some good laughs even if you're not an Eddie Murphy fan.

Eddie Murphy is known for doing a lot of action or comedy movies. This movie ends up being a mix of action comedy and fantasy. Some people will mention this movie was a low point in his career.

But in its favor it at least does not try for intentionalcomedy and fall flat on its face like the loose American remake Chatterboxit's actually kind of dark at times kind of disturbing but above all very weird. It's also unusual as an XXX porn film in that I think both the female leads use body doubles for the hardcore sex and even then the sex is really somewhere between hard and softcore. The sex scenes are short and numerous without the traditional money shot but that's one of the things I really like about 70's Euroticait usually tried to be something more than tedious zerobudgeted masturbation fodder.The main lead Penelope L'Amour has a nice body although I suspect her breasts are somewhat less than authentic but she's not a great actress even by porn standards and not a particularly compelling sexual presence. The best scenes are when she falls asleep and her um bearded clam regales her husband with tales of her jaded youth. The younger L'Amour is played by the very sexy Beatrice Harnois who actually appeared in other movies besides this. In short order Harnois' mischievous overgrown schoolgirl unwittingly seduces her stepfather with fatal results! wittingly seduces a naive male school chum joins with another girl to seduce a wellendowed teacher and for the capper humps her fatherconfessor right in the confessional booth a Catholic priest being molested BY a young GIRLnow that's a new one!.At the opposite end of sexiness Silvia Bourdoin the ugliest woman in 70's French porn who later went on to become the ugliest woman in early 80's Hollywood porn shows up as L'Amour's artist aunt looking like she'd severely lost control of her blue eyebrow pencil and judging from the headscarf may have been undergoing chemo at the time. She has sex with two young guys who I actually felt sorry for and then later two young girls in completely gratuitous scenes apparently added just to amp up the skank factor. Then there's the end which is just plain bizarre and threatens a sequel that never materialized featuring a talking schlong although I'm sure it would have been better than Me and Him with Griffin Dunne. This is not any kind of masterpiece few porn films are and sexiness is pretty inconsistent but it's entertaining enough I guess".

Then there's the end which is just plain bizarre and threatens a sequel that never materialized featuring a talking schlong although I'm sure it would have been better than Me and Him with Griffin Dunne. This is not any kind of masterpiece few porn films are and sexiness is pretty inconsistent but it's entertaining enough I guess";

	schema:headline " A road movie about two lovable losers";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a soft spot in my heart for road movies that feature lovable losers surviving in the midst of the odds stacked against them. Or perhaps I find this subject matter a guilty pleasure. This genre of drama has been done before and Back Roads wasn't the last movie to do this although most of them are buddy movies where we have two unlikely male protagonists Thunderbolt and Lightfoot Scarecrow etc. Some films may have segments of this plot within their stories but Back Roads is pretty much entirely set where our two main characters Amy a cheap hooker and Elmore A lowlife exprize fighter are out on a lamb trying to make their way to California. Back Roads offers something more special than the usual buddy film for we are treated to the possibility of romance and a deep look into humanity.Whether you like this movie or not depends entirely on how much sympathy and love you can afford to our main characters. If there is anyone to ever be able to pull off this genteel and earnest feat it would be Sally field. Yes Sally Field had the girlish charm with her dolllike big eyes her tiny figure and endearing pout. She is a hooker with a heart of gold who for some reason has fallen on the fringes of society due to unhealthy and bad life decisions. There was a time in Hollywood when a hooker's character was treated with much more scorn and shame. But at this time in cinema the early 1980's Hollywood cast a more fair light on these subjects while treating them with pity and more likability. It's true that prostitutes and low lives are more charming on screen than in real life and we accept this by our own consent. Strangely and perhaps intentionally Back Roads was marketed as a screwball romantic comedy. What those few viewers saw on screen was a bit more sad and serious with some dark comedy intertwined. Tommie Lee Jones does well and the chemistry between him and Sally is correct. As much as they bicker make up break apart and get back together it all seems so right if not predictable. We root for them. They are not the winners of society but they win our hearts.The montage of Amy traveling alone on foot on buses or hitching rides is accompanied by the melancholy ballad as we see our forlorn heroine looking defeated blue and lonely. The director allows us to peer into her lonely and desperate soul. Tommie Lee is nothing more than a hapless bum who loses his job but still has a chance to make a quick buck in a low stakes boxing ring. Sometimes love happens in the worst of circumstances and forces people to address what matters most whether it's from inner desperation or just the innate need for a partner. This is a humble tale of two drifters who through their personal journey learn about love and the need for friendship.Some people may be turned off by the grubby lifestyle and the sleazy misadventures these two go through. We are treated to the seediness of the redneck south with all of its cheap diners truck stops motels and how it looks from a lowbudget traveler's perspective. There is also some corny dialogue I've seen some squirrel's in my time but you are at the top of the tree exclaims Amy when she expresses her disapproval of Elmore's uncouth character. Typical dialogue of this era seems outdated but it doesn't detract from the overall theme.The one downfall to this movie is that they couldn't construct a good ending because the story doesn't really promise that these characters are going to strike it rich once they reach California. The movie simply ends as they stand there hitchhiking while making a poetic statement of how they accept themselves and their love for each other. What matters is not the outcome of their journey but how they arrive at a personal state of selfacceptance. Movies like Back Roads endear us to the down and out losers. Their illfated lives are a not treated as a result of their ignoble character but rather as a byproduct of their vulnerability and weaknesses.".

We are treated to the seediness of the redneck south with all of its cheap diners truck stops motels and how it looks from a lowbudget traveler's perspective. There is also some corny dialogue I've seen some squirrel's in my time but you are at the top of the tree exclaims Amy when she expresses her disapproval of Elmore's uncouth character. Typical dialogue of this era seems outdated but it doesn't detract from the overall theme.The one downfall to this movie is that they couldn't construct a good ending because the story doesn't really promise that these characters are going to strike it rich once they reach California. The movie simply ends as they stand there hitchhiking while making a poetic statement of how they accept themselves and their love for each other. What matters is not the outcome of their journey but how they arrive at a personal state of selfacceptance. Movies like Back Roads endear us to the down and out losers. Their illfated lives are a not treated as a result of their ignoble character but rather as a byproduct of their vulnerability and weaknesses.";

The acting is solid and both Fields and Jones look the part of someone living on the edges of society. Jones is a twobit club boxer with a reputation for losing. He comes across in a less then positive light yet down deep there's a heart of gold. Fields as a street hustler looks beatup in this film. He rarely cracks a smile and it's one of here meaty roles. However the film is a somewhat depressing look at life at least from the standpoint of street people. It's a fairly entertaining movie and if you're a fan of either Sally Fields or Tommy Lee Jones then Back Roads is a film to see.".

This all might be just a fantasy in my head but Tommy Lee Jones felt obligated to apologize to Sally years later for something he did while filming this with Sally. Probably a good thing too. Here's a theory. Maybe all Tommy Lee Jones wanted at the time was a sweet girl like Sally and perhaps all Sally Field ever wanted was a wild heart like Tommy but neither one had the knowhow to admit to it. Just a theory. Back Roads is so under appreciated and over analyzed. Just enjoy it. It takes place in the South and it's really down country home living and back road loving. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally field make a great couple on screen. That much is clear. I love these two guys. Jones is a pistol and Field is a firecracker. I'm deeply in love with them both but mostly Sally. Yea mostly Sally. Back Roads' theme song 'Ask Me No Questions I'll Tell You No Lies' is a beautiful song and it fits the movie like a glove.

	schema:headline " Harris  Roberts Take Us On A Emotional Ride";
	schema:reviewBody "It's funny the more this story went on the more the two lead characters went 180 degrees in the other direction. Frank Machin went from a roughbutquiet and considerate rugby player trying to befriend a single mother to a complete boor and a pig. Margaret Hammond was a rude dour woman with a real attitude problem regarding life. It takes her a long time to crack a smile and show some twinges of happiness. It's nice to see but it doesn't last.Margaret preferred to wallow in past pain. Except for her kids which she doesn't dwell on anyway she didn't want to have much to do with life. Even in the end a doctor notes something about her will to live being weak. You'd think having two nice kids would be motivation to live. Anyway she does slowly began smiling and opening up and being a nice person. However Frank and Margaret are rarely on the same page. When they were they made a nice couple.The film also went from a tight actiondrama in the first half hour to a straight drama the second half hour to a melodrama over the last hour. It had a tightness in the beginning an edgy feel to it whether it was Frank on the playing field or trying to make headway with Margaret and her two small kids. Then it slowly got almost into a soap opera mindset but still kept my interest if only to find out what wound happen to this couple.Kudso to Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts Margaret for keeping it interesting because it's a fairly long film and there is a long segment where very little happens. Both Harris and Roberts were up for Academy Awards. I thought Harris was the standout here. It's hard to be a loutish rugby jock on one hand and a tender caring guy at the same time but Harris pulled it off. He made Machin a very believable character with that toughsoft combination. He even looked the part a rough guy who could and did in real life muck it up with the best of 'em in a very physical sport. Harris was so good that one minute you really rooted for him the next minute you'd think the hell with this moron. Roberts evoked similar emotions. You wanted this bitter and angry woman to be happy yet sometimes you thought she didn't deserve someone who seemed to care. As a man I felt Frank's frustration in trying to get to this lady who might have a lot to offer besides sex if she'd just let go of the past and her anger. She's also upset about being a kept woman something this generation doesn't understand. In Margaret's day you didn't stay in the same house with a man unless you were married. The neighbors were talking and she was shamed. Roberts I am told had many demons in her life and didn't have the career of her costar but she was a fine fine actress.Both these man characters were simple and complex at the same time. This is why I looked at this film as a character study of two people instead of a depressing melodrama which some have labeled it. Yeah it's not Mary Poppins but I didn't find it that depressing. I also enjoyed William Hartnell as Dad Johnson. I wish his role had been bigger. He was a very intriguing guy. The rugby team's owners were portrayed  as many were back then  as nothing but exploitive.Another big part of the reason I basically enjoyed the film was the excellent direction and photography and the fantastic DVD transfer given to us by Criterion. This is a pristine print no spots now flaws  just a fabulous picture. If you enjoy the cinematography of film noir you'll like this. If you appreciate powerful human dramas you'll find it worth your while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Machin is an amateur rugby league player in Yorkshire. Ambitious within the sport Frank pushes himself in front of the local scouts and soon is signed to one of the professional clubs and able to hold out for 1000 down to join. As he rises within his own world Frank has more resources and more opportunity but a strained affair with his landlady Margaret and his inability to shake off his basic roots see him frustrated and pained with his journey.Like many others have said in relation to this film British cinema did have something at one point. The Free Cinema movement of the 1950's gave a home to a slightly more realistic form of cinema and although I do not like all within that movement that I have seen I do think that Anderson's work with that paved the way for this. At times the film is too keen to revel in the depiction of working class England but this isn't too much and perhaps if you think of the context of the period where such views were not the norm then you can perhaps understand why. However the power of the film is less in its depiction of the working class work although this is indeed of value but more in the convincing exploration of the character of Frank.Here is a man who has aspirations but seems unable to reconcile these goals to be better with the fact that he is from the working classes and doesn't fit with those above him. Likewise he needs affection love and intimacy but his outward emotions are much cruder and he is quick to lose his temper and resort to violence as the simplest reaction. It is a well written script and it doesn't push the characters or emotions past where they would naturally go for the sake of the film you can see this in the conclusion which is meaningful and ultimately quite downbeat. Anderson's direction is suitably gritty and natural for the material but it was Harris that impressed me most.His performance can be mistaken for being a bit showy and loud and some viewers have made that call. However for me this was his character's boorishness a quality that he sinks into with ease. However where Harris really does his best work is in the moments just before this happens or immediately afterwards where without words we can often see this struggle this conflict within himself. It is hard for me to describe here in words so think how difficult it must be to do as an actor but Harris pulls it off. He is well supported by Roberts and they share some excellent scenes. Smaller roles are also well filled with natural turns from the likes of Hartnell Lowe Blakely and others but the film is Harris'.Not perfect and perhaps a little longer than it can sustain this is an impressive film. The working class depiction does seem a bit heavy at times through modern eyes but in the emotion and development of the characters the film is hard to really question. Engaging well written and well delivered  like others have said where are the British classics like this now? Four Weddings? Do me a favour...".

Shades of the mind are so aptly blended with interiors and every feeling convincingly underlined by many but never one too many closeups. By my account the only moment which was superfluous happened in the fancy restaurant Frank taking Margaret and her new furcoat to dinner to a place that was never intended for them. Frank's rawness in the situation was a bit over the top movie could have well done without it or at least with having it toned down. Nevertheless poetry is inevitable.

	schema:reviewBody "You know the more I watch English movies from the 1960's the more I fall in love with them Films like I'm all Right Jack Darling Alfie and now This Sporting Edge always feature the U.K. as this gritty place where living is tough and the people are tougher. Now whether that's true to life I'm not sure though I'd be interested to find out but I sure get a kick out of these films and I'm glad to add This Sporting Life to that list.Richard Harris just acts the hell out of his role as a Miner who finds his forte as a star Rugby player. Let's stop here. Why aren't there any more Rugby movies? Soccer and Boxing are always popular sports in movies but Rugby seems to be sadly neglected. Perhaps they thought this was the definitive movie on this subject? Anyways Richard Harris's character Frank Machin maybe is a brilliant rugby player but sort of not so in life but that doesn't stop him from trying to succeed with what he has. The rich people who of course have control over the teams give him some opportunities to move up in the Rugby world.. Some which he's comfortable with like dropping his Father like a hot potato other conditions he's left wondering how low he has to go to make it big. Oooh.So while Machin is trying to move up in the Rugby world at home he's trying to make the the move on his INCREDIBLY repressed landlady played by Rachel Roberts. Who's that? I've never heard of her up to this movie and seeing her in this makes me want to see more of her because she's fabulous in this.All in all a great view.".

Call me a Philistine but on a 20inch screen this Resnaislike Is it or isn't it? is hard to follow.That said it is a beautiful movie overall. The lead performances have rarely been equaled. Richard Harris as a headstrong rugby player is convincing 100. Rachel Roberts plays the rather dour confused and grieving widow from whom he lets a room and whom he loves. She was not conventionally beautiful but she had extraordinary screen presence. Their every scene together is chilling and poignant.The structure is there. The movie is finished and could never be properly well made. It is a sort of angry young man meets French New Wave. Anyone reading this who might be put off by my confession about finding it a bit rough to follow on a TV screen Please do not be put off. This is a very serious insightful movie well performed all around. And you are unlikely to see Harris better in anything else and sadly unlikely to see Ms. Roberts in much else at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a small Welsh mining town there is little to do outside of patronizing the local pubs and watching the city's rugby team demolish whichever opponent is visiting. Frank Machin the late Richard Harris is a miner turned rugby player rooming in the home of Widow Margaret Hammond Rachael Roberts also passed. It's a simple life that is turned dramatic as the thickskulled Frank spends his time grating those around him with his ambitions for the high life and for the stillgrieving widow Margaret. This is a cautionary tale which Director Lindsay Anderson draws to a razor sharp point from David Storey's script adapted from his novel by the same name.A rugby game is interrupted as Frank has his front teeth knocked out and broken. The delirium of his night of pain opens Frank's past to the audience in flashbacks. He has worked in the mines. He lives in Margaret's home while put off by her standoffishness as she tends to chores and her children. He plays amateur rugby aggressively and goes out of his way to pick fights with the lead player of the other team when they win. He meets a proteam scout Dad played effeminately by William Hartnell who gets him a shot on the team owned by the Weaver Mining Company. Even after he gets picked up with a lucrative contract Frank continues to rent a single room from Margaret as he flaunts his newfound wealth. He is an enviable picture of financial success and his strong playing keeps him popular with everyone in town. Frank takes Margaret and her children on outings in his new car. Frank is JohnnyontheSpot when it comes to money and gifts and he certainly appears well enough to outsiders as he gives pointers and signs autographs for children after games. When Mrs. Weaver Vanda Godsell the wife of the team owner makes open sexual advances on Frank he turns her down out of concern of how it would impact his relationship with Margaret.What really drives Frank is the belief that when he sees something he wants he must simply go out and get it. The one thing that he wants and cannot seem to understand how to get is Margaret. Nearly every thing he does is in pursuit of her and his perceived pushes him ever closer to madness. This is where Richard Harris's performance can be greatly admired as he deftly and gradually opens the inner workings of the leadskulled Frank to the audience. In scene after scene throughout the entire film Harris illustrates Frank's thoughts with small indignant or puzzled looks at Margaret or with a slight toss in his tone which tells of the contrary nature of his egodriven motives over his actions.During a picnic outing his ball playing with Margaret's children isn't attracting enough of Margaret's attention so Frank accidentally kicks the ball out into the stream mounts Lynda Bernadette Benson on his shoulders wades out to hipdepth get it and returns her safely to shore just to get closer to Margaret. Without the single articulate look from Harris at the start of his charade any of the subversive motives would be lost to an otherwise pleasant afternoon in a church park. Even with such calculations Harris shows Frank having doubts being hurt by rejection and pulls in the audience's sympathies when he genuinely weeps to a teammate in frustration and confusion. Eventually the darker side of humanity fully overcomes Frank and his relationship with Margaret becomes physically abusive as their story pushes slowly to its tragic end.Rachael Roberts's portrayal of Margaret is a monumental testament to the steadfast homemaker. Margaret is regimented in her chores and seems to have few if any friends. The value she places on her life is held entirely in her home and her children performed simply and believably by Bernadette Benson and Andrew Nolan in their only screen credits whom she treats with the only genuine warmth to emerge through the grief for her husband. There is a simple certainty in her actions. Whether it's hanging laundry polishing her late husband's shoes or walking away from Frank it's clear that she knows the world is turning without her and she simply isn't interested. She struggles but remains detached at Frank's first physical advance and when a strike finally does come from him late in the film she doesn't even cry out because Frank is still so far from touching any part of her that she values. All she gives him in return is a calm and bitter description of his lonely reality.The production is a precisely measured one. Anderson's direction of cinematographer Denys N. Coop's black and white compositions make for stark illustrations of this world. It is beautiful in its bleakness. Transitions between flashback and present are simple and effective often employing matching movements in scenes or resorting to a fade when necessary. Rugby games are up close and involving. Every thing effectively focuses and showcases the actors. This is the work of a mature director who never considers any selfaware showmanship and has a deathgrip on the story. Never once does it flinch away from the terrible trials the protagonist endures and inflicts.As a work of art this film is fiercely successful. It garnered several award nominations most significantly Academy nods for its two leads. It is a brutal portrait of an alltoo human man who fails to grasp the human value of those around him. However as entertainment it has little enjoyment factor. The story is so hard and its main character so impervious to all but the most obvious losses it would be hard to imagine anyone who actually needed to be bludgeoned with so heavy a lesson actually watching this film. Absolutely see this for all of its clear value of workmanship but be prepared for a very rough ride.9 out of 10".

He treasures a defeated guttersnipe who's mad at the world for no more convincing reason than because the movie desperately needs some 'drama.' Harris starts conflicted and ends conflicted. The movie just repeats the same scene over and over. The preirritating Harris hasn't yet become the ham he destined to be Tarzan Camelot etc. but he's still not really up to the task of making this character threedimensional. His acting in this is flat and unaffecting he's the very absent center of all the activities. Whatever situation is handed to him Harris responds with the same numb stupefied expression a half opened mouth and slow eyes. Awww isn't he sweet making confused puppy eyes at the camera? If he wasn't an attractive guy this movie would be much more easily perceived as the flimsy piece of boilerplate that it is. As presented Frank is not worth exploring. He's ninety percent of unexceptional western men he's boorish he gets drunk he fights he burps he sings badly he wrestles his buddies naked in the lockerroom tub. And the movies big point? He doesn't have the depth to solve his own problems  boo hoo! I was watching it thinking that sports and war are just sociallyaccepted ways for closet cases to touch each other. The movie is bad long before it's concluding scenes which somehow deflate it even more with about five scenes of low bathos.Harris clearly wants to become the British Brando in this. A dental complication even allows him to mumble for a few scenes often in the back seat of a car On the Waterfront...?. I know in context TSL was revolutionary but there's nothing here to return to. There are other movies that revolutionized film which still retain their impact. Rachel Roberts and Colin Blakely will be rejoined in the ensemble cast of 'Murder on the Orient Express.'".

The angry young man in this film is Frank Machin Richard Harris who rooms in the home of a young widow Margaret Hammond Rachel Roberts and her two small children. She lives in the poor workingclass district of town in Northern England and is forced to let out a room to a boarder Frank when her husband is killed in a mining accident.Margaret lives in a constant state of mourning over her late husband's death. She seems psychologicallyand physicallytrapped by his loss as shown by the fact that she still polishes his boots every day and never wants to leave her home. She clings to the memory of her love for her late husband and only remembers their marriage as perfect. What she doesn't realize is that he had actually committed suicide by purposely setting up the mine 'accident' that killed him. Frank feels trapped in his deadend mining job and is anxious to better himself. To climb into a higher social status he wants to try out for the local professional rugby team. When an old rugby scouting agent 'Dad' Johnson William Hartnell notices his spirit he arranges to get Frank a trial with the local team owners and managers. They are impressed by his skills and spirit and offer him a contract to play on the local team. Driving a hard bargain Frank asks to be backed for 1000 pounds. They accept and he is given the 1000pound check. Flaunting his new money he buys a fancy new car and nice presents for Margaret and her kids. However in spite of local fame and fortune among the townspeople and in the newspaper he fails to win over either Margaret or the other people in the district. Although he succeeds in rugby by advancing to upperlevel teams he is never able to win over Margaret. In the end Margaret tells him that she feels like a 'kept woman' and that Frank makes her feel cheap. She asks him to leave and find a new place to live.".

They're not the meek and demure ones that maybe he would emotionally feel comfortable with  and preferred  and their truths hurt him as much as the injuries he gets on the pitch.I find the film riveting and memorable but also hard work and some might say it's a little melodramatic at times.

But that was the style back then and the character is certainly able to support it. I feel I should have given it ten stars but then that would diminish albeit very slightly those few I do.";

The black and white photography as well as the editing are all excellent. The pace is perfect with each scene being significant and revealing and building nicely upon the other. The rugby sequences are gritty and realistic and the narrative structure jumps interestingly back and forth between the present and the past. Harris is terrific in the lead and at times he looks acts and even sounds exactly like Marlon Brando. His scenes with Roberts and his frustrations at being in love with a woman that cannot return his affections are almost as riveting as the rugby scenes. Overall it ends up being a fabulously profound piece of viewing as it details a man's struggles at striving to get ahead in society only to find that his life is just as empty.THE NEGATIVE The only drawback is the film's length. Some of the scenes could have been shortened just a little while still conveying the same message and having the same impact.THE LOWDOWN For fans of intelligent cinema this is for them. The film at first may seem to be a bit of a relic of it's time period but the characters and story are universal and timeless. Overall it's a flawless effort.THE RATING 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Sporting Life is in some ways a sinister version of Rocky  a tale of a toughguy athlete taking his best shot at the big time. But while Rocky presents a fairly optimistic view of the world this film is definitely of a darker nature.Dark. Yes that's the key word for This Sporting Life. The movie weaves a sad tale of poverty unrequited loves and human failings. It's not entertaining to watch by any means but if you brace yourself for the film's depressing impact you will probably find it rewarding.Several commentators on this site have suggested that the movie doesn't work because the central character Frank Machin  played by an excellent Richard Harris  is too thuggish and unsympathetic. I can't agree with that perspective however. Machin is a bit of a beast sure but he also demonstrates sensitivity he likes kids! and tremendous loyalty to the people around him. He makes mistakes and behaves cruelly sometimes but I think that it's a bit snobbish and bourgeois to dismiss him as a mere thug.Harris' performance as Machin certainly helps to ground a film that is perhaps too weak on the plot side to be a true fourstar classic. The rest of the cast is excellent as well ranging from Rachel Roberts as the tragic landlady Mrs. Hammand to William Doctor Who Hartnell as the lonely old man Johnson. The acting all seems naturalistic and believable to me though I suppose I'm not qualified to judge whether everybody got their regional accents right.Director Lindsay Anderson meanwhile gives the film a bleak cold and very realistic look. Somehow he manages to make shadowy suburban streets look like the eeriest settings imaginable and he also directs the rugby scenes with tremendous violence and energy.I just wish that This Sporting Life was a bit stronger on plot. I'm not exactly sure what it's missing but I think it's merely excellent rather than a classic. And it's tough to watch such a dark movie that's not quite perfect. Still I would definitely recommend this to cinema buffs and casual viewers who wouldn't be too put off by the bleakness.".

Apart from that this seems to be another entry in the 'we can do gritty too' phase of the UK film industry. There seems to be little point other than echoing a far greater film Citizen Kane and saying that money doesn't bring happiness.

The unpleasantness of the film wouldn't bother me so much if the script was actually interesting  but unfortunately the first half an hour which tells in flashback the story of the main character getting signed up to the rugby team is by far the most interesting part  and even that is only mediocre. The second part of the film is nothing more than a series of redundant events that add nothing to the story  the wedding being a good example. It is only in the last section that the story really gets going.The problem with this film is that until the last section there is nothing to maintain the viewers' interest. One could switch the film off halfway through and there would be no questions left hanging except for the rather uninteresting issue of whether or not Frank will have it off with Margaret. If the outcome of the story had been revealed earlier in the film then at least we would wonder what had happened to cause it. The script is less a story than a series of events in a man's life. You could skip the whole first hour of the film without missing anything important and without any difficulty picking up what's happening  after all what is the film about? It's about a rugby star's pursuit of a woman  nothing more.There is some suggestion that there is more to Frank's character than meets the eye and Frank himself says that he feels unwanted and unfulfilled but I found it impossible to have any sympathy for this utter thug. Similarly I found his supposed love for Margaret to be unconvincing  it seemed to me that he was simply after a sex toy especially considering the scene in which he tried to take advantage of her. Thus I found the final drama completely unaffecting. Furthermore the ending seemed tacked on as though the writer didn't know where to end and needed a drama to finish the story off.There are a few artyfarty flashback scenes which seem to suggest some deeper meaning which are accompanied by the beating of a drum as if to make it clear to the audience that we are witnessing something poignant but their meaning was lost on me  as was the whole film. This is an overlong overrated and very unpleasant piece of cinema which tries  feebly  to compensate for its lack of a story by the use of meaningless flashbacks dramatic orchestral stings and heated argument scenes. Just like its main character the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.".

Mark also played by Gibson has purchased the home at a steal because of its disturbing past which he isn't aware of. Of course this is the stereotypical haunted house film setup. Dead Dudes in the House combines its supernatural haunted house horror with a slasher plot and entities that are a cross between zombies and ghosts. The story progresses as you'd expect given those elements. Yes it's derivative but anyone who knows me well knows I do not subtract points for that. The Cult of Originalitywhich valued the unprecedented over all else and which really only came to the fore in the later 1800swas a mistake in my opinion.Still when astute readers notice that my rating for a film like this is higher than or the same as my ratings for films like Constantine 2005 Mulholland Drive 2001 Predator 1987 Ichi the Killer Koroshiya 1 2001 and Donnie Darko 2001 they maybe rightly wonder What is going on? How can you say that Dead Dudes in the House is as good or better than fill in your favorite film that you think I underrated here? It's important to remember that my ratings as well as many other critics' I suspect are not meant as comparative to other films as if they're all on an even playing field trying out for shortstop on the same team. My ratings are comparative but to a number of other factors. First I consider how well the film managed to do what it set out to do making concessions only for unavoidable limitations these include budget constraints and historicaltechnological limitations I see the film itself as defining what it wants to do. Secondly I consider the value I got from the filmincluding entertainment value other aesthetic value and so on. The last factor is importance in a historicalcultural milieu. This is given far less weight partially because it's not so directly related to what's on the screen and partially because this is impossible to measure for most newer films this last factor also only tends to help ratings I don't really subtract any points for culturalhistorical unimportance. It's also helpful to remember that I begin all films at a 9 an A and then score up or down accordingly.Understanding this I believe that Dead Dudes in the House does a very good job accomplishing what it wants to accomplish although there are a couple small blundersenough to subtract a point. I also got a lot of value out of it. It's entertaining often funny sometimes unintentionally there is some surprisingly good cinematography the premise is handled meaning directed written and so on extremely competently the death scenes are well done and creative and the performances range from bizarrely good in this context to entertainingly bad often from the same actor.Writerdirectorproducercoffeemaker James Riffel who unfortunately only recently managed to complete another film 2004's BlackEyed Susan knows exactly what he's shooting for and easily gets it. The goal was to create a slightly tongueincheek 1980sstyle the film was actually made in the late 80sthe copyright date on the end credits is 1988 and the title of the film is given as The Dead Come Home gorecomedy slasher achieving the necessary isolation by locking the ten little Indians in the haunted house and gaining ghouls to enable variety by letting dispatched characters become zombielike menaces.Partially because of this setup the dialogue tends to be ridiculous well written unintentionally hilarious and scathingly satirical often all at the same time. Most of the major characters fit that set of adjectives as well especially Bob Victor Verhaeghe the carpenter and Abigail Leatherbee the old lady. Bob is usually given the best lines and Verhaeghe turns in one of the most entertaining performances. The extended scene when the kids first arrive at the house and try to start fixing it is a gem. The funniest aspect perhaps is that Bob is not that far removed from a couple carpenters and construction workers I've known in the past.But the gore is also very well done. In a movie like this that is extremely important. The only other important aspect that Riffel misses is gratuitous nudity but there isn't a huge female cast and it's not always easy to acquire gratuitous nudity for lowbudget filmmaking like this I'd suspect this was more akin to a guerilla film.As for cinematography Riffel actually anticipates a number of more recent genre stylistic tendencies such as monochromaticism and chiaroscuro night scenes. There's also an extremely important and attractive shot that breaks the monochromaticism in the dnouement right before the obligatory and welcomed doomladen tag. This is using cinematography as symbolism in a way akin to such wellrespected films as Equilibrium 2002something less broad minded folks act surprised to encounter in a clichd little shocker like Dead Dudes in the House.By the way Dead Dudes in the House was recently released on DVD through Troma's Toxie's Triple Terror series. It's interesting to note how many films in that series feature transvestite characters. Is it time we ask just what kind of undergarments Lloyd Kaufman is wearing? Does he have something in common with lumberjacks?".

A fun time up in Cherry Valley NY at a great location shooting a low budget horror flick. It was a very tight cast and crew. I remember doing some horseback riding and going to the Baseball Hall Of Fame with some of the cast and crew...And we had a gourmet cook who did all of the cooking and desertsSome of the best food I have had on ANY set since...OK'Buffy The Vampire Slayer was close behind!".

This was the first feature film that I stunt coordinated almost 20 years ago!!!!!!!!!!! I had a great experience shooting this film. A fun time up in Cherry Valley NY at a great location shooting a low budget horror flick. It was a very tight cast and crew. I remember doing some horseback riding and going to the Baseball Hall Of Fame with some of the cast and crew...And we had a gourmet cook who did all of the cooking and desertsSome of the best food I have had on ANY set since...OK'Buffy The Vampire Slayer was close behind!";

In fact it revels in its origins and goes for the shock grossout and gore from frame one to frame last.  Gotta appreciate that not all movies have that kind of conviction.But in the end it all is just kind of left there on the screen.

What I did appreciate however was the fact that a bunch of guys with cameras little money and an idea got something filmed produce and distributed.Bless 'em.

It sounded interesting enough  a group of people get trapped in a old house with something nasty which is usually a sign that I might see some cool gore.  However when I read on the video box that this was a Troma movie I almost passed on it.  I was kinda burnt out on Troma's cheesy approach to horror.  This movie has it's share of cheese too but this film was acquired by Troma not produced by Troma so there's not as much of it.  Actually I was quite surprised by this film.  It's very lowbudget but like most horror films the lowbudget adds to the creepiness of the film.  Good gore effects some decent acting a cool location kinda reminded me of Night of the Demons and a warped sense of humor adds up to one bizarre little film.  It's got some boring parts but for a Troma movie it was very enjoyable!".

It's one of those horror films where you can't say what's gonna happen even when the movie it's about to end. I watched this film for the first time back in 1993 on cable those where the days where the slasher era was dead. This movie tried to bring to life a more than dead genre.What it seemed to be an average fun weekend for eight friends turned into a carnage that could be described as one of the most freaky and horrible massacres ever seen. These dumb dudes buy and old house to have a place to chill out have premarital sex and drink some beers. While fixing and cleaning the old house one of these dumb teens smashes the headstone in the backyard just to immedieately awaken the owner of the house from the dead.The owner is named Abigail a woman who murdered her husband back in the 1940's as seen in a flashback. Now 100 year old or so Abigail is very pied off and she will murder these teens one by one with no mercy.After getting murdered these dudes return as zombies just to wander in the house and increment the horror atmosphere.  To make things worse the house seems to have own life and it won't let these dudes escape in fact the house will provide help to Abigail in order to kill them. You have to watch to believe. Ms. Abigail Leatherby seems to be wiser and stronger than these dudes. Who will survive from this weird carnage? What's going on with the dead daughter of the owner? Follow the dudes and the dead dudes in this slasher film that starts with a terrible murder and ends a la Evil Dead.DEAD DUDES IN THE HOUSE provies lots of slasher fun! it's your average slasher to watch on midnight. The movie contains gruesome murders creepy settings a creepy atmosphere and an effective score. As a hard core horror fan I plenty recommend this movie to any horror fan. The body count is ok and maybe unexpected. I wonder why there wasn't a sequel to this hidden gem.6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Its been called Troma's unsung masterpiece and the best Troma film ever made. No it's not The Toxic Avenger its the silent Troma film Dead Dudes in the House! Released in 1991 Dead Dudes in the House is a unique and very dark literally horror film that's campy style I can compare to Open Water. Both films take place in a simple setting this one in a house and Open Water in an ocean. 90 of the film takes place in the house and I've always loved movies like that. Its a claustrophobic put yourself in their shoes movie. If you don't pretend you're one of the characters in a movie like this then you wont enjoy it. Teens locked in a house yawn. Imagine you're one of the teens locked in the house cant escape gasp! The movie was without a doubt very poor in the production area with some scenes being shot so dark it's hard to see anything thank God for the brightness on my computer. Same goes with movies like Albino Farm and H2 Halloween 2. So dark whats going on is a mystery. One thing that also makes me laugh is the characters on the cover aren't the ones in the movie. Which leads to my assumption that they shot the posterbox art for the movie before they shot the actual movie and they had no idea who would play the dudes in the house so they rounded up a few no names and boom had themselves a poster. There's also three girls in the movie and their not on the cover. Plus they referred to the kids has hiphop teens when no references to hiphop are made.Anyway the story is about a group of adolescents that go to a seemingly abandoned house to fix it up and use it to their needs. After encountering a stubborn door that wont open they try escape the house but all of the windows aren't glass and the shutters close trapping them in the house. They learn a suspicious and unusual old women still lives in the home and she kills the teens off one by one. Its up to the teens themselves to escape the house or been the women's next victim.For what ever minor budget they had on this film they used it wisely because all the gore effects all practical of course are so realistic and very gruesome looking. Its amazing a low budget movie has more appealing gore effects than ones done by CGI because isn't CGI supposed to improve matters in films? Not in the 21st Century hell no. All CGI does is loosen the reality and the fun of Horror films nowadays. We finally see practical effects that are very much realistic and almost like they could be real blood.The actors in the movie are less than professional so are the punches they throw. But thats the fun of it. I love cheesy low budget no rules Horror movies. Indie films are taking over. Their now the closest to originality and style that we are gonna get. So we better take what we got. Dead Dudes in the House is a throwback to the 90s all out gore fest that has some cool dialog shots and different character personalities. Some shots of dialog are great and I love the different types of teens shown in here. The jerk the nerd the jock and the girls. Very strange and odd Horror film. Troma's best.Starring James Griffith John Dayton Cerna Sarah Newhouse Douglas Gibson Victor Verhaeghe and Mark Zobian. Directed by James Riffel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to watch Dead Dudes almost every month on USA NETWORK. It aired on Fridays at 12 a.m. I regret for not taping it. The early 90's craziness is present all the way in the movie. Funky music colorful clothing cursing premarital sex etc. are the basic elements plus Troma's style. Where else could you find a movie about a defunct old lady killer?! Now this is a whacked up slasher with zombie movies elements. Bizarre is the word to describe this Troma effort.There's nothing much to know about the plot. Eight friends buy a house for a very low price but they have to fix it in order to set on it. Soon after they arrive before getting beers and music one of these idiots smashes a gravestone on the backyard for no reason and suddenly awakens the owner of the house. The owner is a blood thirsty 100 year old woman named Abigail Leatherby. We are first introduced to her in a very creepy scene where one of the dudes watches her upstairs walking slowly and entering a room. The dude follows her and becomes the first victim. Then one by one the dumb dudes get killed by Abigail but later return as zombies! Evil Dead style. Seven dudes plus an intruder are violently slaughtered by Abigail. One of the dudes decapitates Abigail and that's when the nightmare seems to be over but the ending obviously copied Evil Dead set the chance to a sequel. The deaths are original and fun to watch. The now infamous window kill is a perfect example. Not satisfied for cutting a guy in two Abigail impales his chest and laughs wickedly. There are some creepy scenes that fit perfect with the movie's dark atmosphere. There's plenty of gore black humor and cheesy dialogue. It's your typical horror Bmovie that has no intentions to become a classic in the genre but still delivers expectations and somehow it generated a small cult. A year ago i mailed one of Troma's execs. and he replied that a future DVD release it's on it's way... probably in early 2005. Let's keep our fingers crossed!610 A sentimental favorite.".

There are a few plotholes some of the dead that return don't go on the hunt for the living humans while most do...why?  Also a bit of reason as to why anybody comes back could have been added.  Other then that for the budget involved it's quite enjoyable.  A silly 30 second introduction to the old lady at the beginning of the movie could have been left out as it does nothing for the film and only made me laugh.  If you are looking for a film to scare you this just might do it but don't expect anything too glossy.  Especially good to watch with your girlfriend as she will be clinging to you almost right from the beginning.  Rating 6 out of 10.  Not too bad.".

The soundtrack is flawless and adds to the ambiance.This movie is about 5 friends who decide to fix up an old house. For some reason they hire a carpenter who seems to be an alcoholic and a jerk to all of them and his carpenter friend. They come across an old lady played by one of the males in the movie who starts killing them off. Whoever she kills off then comes back as a ghost zombie who then attack other people accept for the jerk carpenter's friend who dead or alive always seems to be pretty mutual no matter what. Due to the house's history it apparently is a legend in the town because two more teens come to join the household for even more fun!!! I was fortunate enough to have recorded this on VHS back in '91. The tape got a lot of usage so once DVDs became all the rage I was excited to have found in in one of the Troma 3packs. I believe it was the 3rd 3pack which everyone needs to go out and get one borrow one obtain one in someway. And no I had nothing to do with the filming production of this movie. It just happens to be one of my all time favorite movies of all time and not enough people have heard about it but every other horror fan I've shown it to has loved it. The only bad thing I would say about this movie is some of the acting is sub par. I also wish that I had been lucky enough to have been able to have obtained one of the earlier copies because now the cover has all characters who aren't in the movie and it's even billed as a bunch of hipsters buying a house. I've never met anyone who knew why. I'd try to ask Lloyd Kaufman himself but I doubt he even know. In fact LK and Troma had nothing to do with the film. It was created independently and then Troma just produced it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a group of constantlysquabbling young adults drive out to a creepy old house for an attempted renovation job they don't realize they are in for a night of horror. It turns out the house was owned by the Leatherby family the matriarch of which was a coldblooded murderess back in the 40's. When one of the moronic kids breaks her tombstone which lies on the property the malevolent old lady comes back to life and begins not just killing the kids but turning them into some sort of zombie that will do her diabolical bidding. And they're trapped in the house. Will any of these onedimensional houseflippers make it out alive? Dare to find out...The House On Tombstone hill is a nice lowbudget regional effort that's a little bit better than you probably think it is. It was released around the time when AIP had some sort of deal going with Troma. So the tape under this title was a joint release from the two companies. Later when it was wholly owned by Troma they changed the name to Dead Dudes In the House and found a picture of unrelated homies to put on the front cover. Just why they thought misleading people into thinking there are homies involved in this movie when there clearly aren't any remains a mystery. Where are the promised homeboys today? Were any viewers disappointed when said homies never materialized? Why did they think that of all approaches was superior to the movie as it was? All unanswered questions. But back to the movie at hand...So despite being an AIPTroma corelease the whole venture feels very CITY LIGHTS and anyone who has seen their horror output such as Epitaph 1987 or Hollow Gate 1988 would likely agree. One of the main highlights of THOTH are the makeup and gore effects. They were created by Ed French and his team wellknown in the practical effects world. And they are indeed effective. Without these highquality gore effects the movie as a whole would greatly suffer. So while the whole Old Dark House theme is certainly wellworn ground French spices up the proceedings sufficiently enough. Director Riffel does pull off some intense moments but the pace overall is slow and there are way too many scenes of characters banging on doors and windows attempting to get out of the house.The fact that the entire movie was shot at one location  the house  does provide some claustrophobic moments but it also leads to unneeded repetition. A couple other settings would have been welcomed. As for the cast they get absolutely no character development or backstory whatsoever. For those keeping track Bob is the jerk who smokes and drinks and isn't likable Mark is the blonde nerd Steve is the redhead nerd Jamie is the darkhaired girl Linda is the blonde girl Ron is the normal guy and Joey goes out on a beer run. That's literally it as far as character development goes. If we knew these people just a bit better we might care about their plight more than we do. But the moments of horror are what THOTH is all about and they are duly delivered.The House on Tombstone Hill is not a bad little horror movie and worth picking up if you can find it cheap. But where are the missing homies...? For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

But how did director James Riffell convince so many people to finance and work hard on something so poorly thought out? I mean some of the staging and early dialog is so awkward and bad.

Person 1 Hey this door is stuck fails to open it Person 2 Let me try fails to open it Person 3 Here let me try fails to open it Person 4 Let me try fails to open itI'm terrified when I see scenes like this. I mean I hope and pray that wasn't written out in script form. Another example you have a scene where the group is walking together and one person stops to see their missing boyfriend in the room. They stand there and talk and the person never says Hey I found Joey. Yes I actually want consistency in a movie with DEAD DUDES in the title.

Some of the murders are offscreen others you do get to watch happening as the old woman who haunts the mansion uses all sorts of sharp instruments to kill them.Beware of the Troma DVD release I bought it thinking it had some kind of special feature like behind the scenes or audio commentary it doesn't and the quality is NOT good.".

I own a copy under its other title  The House On Tombstone Hill which if you ask me I like better than Dead Dudes In The House.Two gals and five guys plus two teenagers who appear in the last 30 minutes enter a big old creepy mansion where soon they find themselves trapped. Doors won't open windows are unbreakable and soon they begin dying one by one. Some of the murders are offscreen others you do get to watch happening as the old woman who haunts the mansion uses all sorts of sharp instruments to kill them.Beware of the Troma DVD release I bought it thinking it had some kind of special feature like behind the scenes or audio commentary it doesn't and the quality is NOT good.";

The plot is somewhat original for a horror movie...Eight friends spend the weekend fixing an old house little they know that it's owner is still living there. That may sound normal just ignoring the fact that the owner is already DEAD murdered 50 years before.   One of this teens has the great idea of smashing a grave in the backyardas a reaction the owner instantly awakens from the dead!! The fun begins. One by one this teens get brutally killed by the owner a creepy 100 year old woman! then they return to life as zombies. In order to get out of the house the survivors have to kill the old woman and the rest of the non living habitants.The creepy house the effective score plenty of gore and some scary situations make this a fun slasher. Check out the scene where this guy tries to escape opening a window in the second floor when he's about to jump the window closes chopping him in two. Apparently watching the old lady throws him a stick pole from the second floor impaling this guy's torso to the ground.I recommend this movie if you are a fan of the genre you will not be disappointed.

Many years later having lost each other that night both are engaged to be married. Still neither can shake the need to give fate one last chance to reunite them.

Likewise she makes him write his number on a banknote which she promptly spends telling him that if fate decrees it the note will find its way back to her. A few years on Jonathan and Sara are both engaged to other people but each keeps thinking about whether the other is their true soulmate and then they start to see signs which they interpret as the fates trying to tell them somethingThis is a charming romantic comedy  a heavy suspension of reality is required but that's surely part of the point. Sara's willingness to leave her future to fate slightly beggars belief but Beckinsale manages to make Sara appealing enough. It's prettily shot and perfectly paced  the movie never flags but everything pitches along perfectly towards the inevitable but agreeable conclusion it also keeps itself to a restrained 90 minutes which seems increasingly unusual among modern movies.

	schema:headline " Cusack and Beckinsale Make It Work";
	schema:reviewBody "Magic happens if you let it and sometimes even fate or destiny or whatever you want to call it steps in to lend a hand.  But when it concerns love and finding that special person you're going to spend the rest of your life with should you risk tempting fate with a test of that love or what is seemingly meant to be or should you just follow your apparent destiny and embrace it?  Such are the questions two people must face and answer in the romantic comedydrama Serendipity' directed by Peter Chelsom.  Jonathan Trager John Cusack is shopping for a gift for his girlfriend and Sara Thomas Kate Beckinsale is looking for something for her boyfriend when they reach for the same pair of gloves on a rack at Bloomingdales.  And the wheels of fate are quickly turning.  Or are they? Jonathan and Sara proceed to spend the next few hours together including a romantic interlude skating in New York's Central Park and there are definite sparks flying between them.  For Jonathan it's a significant emotional experience and he realizes something has happened that something has changed in his life Sara feels the same but being a true believer in destiny she needs a sign that this is meant to be before she'll consider pursuing whatever it is that's just happened between them.  So she puts it to the test.  And for Jonathan knowing only that her name is Sara it's the beginning of an odyssey a quest to find true love with the woman he already knows in his heart of hearts that he wants to share his life with. For Sara it's the beginning of a search for love and for that one special person she knows is destined to be her soul mate forever.  They both find however that the path to pure love is filled with every obstacle the known universe could possibly place in their way.  And is the journey worth it? Well in the end it all comes down to what fate has predetermined.  Or does it?In the tradition of such films as Sleepless In Seattle' and You've Got Mail' Chelsom has fashioned a truly romantic tale of two people who are absolutely destined to be together no matter what.  And as the audience knows early on nothing less will be acceptable.  Hanks and Ryan may be missing but the charismatic Cusack and the beguiling Beckinsale more than make up for it carving out their own niche in the genre with this outing and Chelsom has just enough of that Nora Ephron touch including the use of music matching the perfect song with every situation to make it work.  The chances of things ever happening in real life the way they do in this movie are about twice as remote as winning the lottery but who cares?  This is a heartwarming fable about love about the way we want' love to be and it's delivered with an endearing care that makes it emotionally involving entertaining and a thoroughly satisfying experience.  And there's not a whole lot more you can ask of a movie I think.Cusack is so likable and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning.  You want things to work out for this guy and Sara as well and of course you're pretty confident from the outset they are going to.  But along the way they make you feel something they enable you to share the frustration as well as the elation that comes with discovering love and perhaps finding that better part of yourself at the same time. And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable and someone with whom you can identify has more than a lot to do with it.  It's a quality performance from an actor with the flexibility and range to do just about anything and who never disappoints.The other half of the equation for success of course belongs to Beckinsale who is not only beautiful but a good actor who infuses her character with a touch of mystery and complexity that makes her winsome and interesting.  Like Cusack's Jonathan Sara is someone you can root for you want to see her get what she wants and what she deserves.  This isn't a perfect world we live in and we all know it but for Sara and Jonathan you want it to be.  There's a chemistry between the two of them and they make it so easy for you to project your own feelings and desires into their situation that there's no getting around it.  If they win you win.  It's that simple.  And even though they take you over some rough spots along the way it's a fun trip and Beckinsale and Cusack Sara and Jonathan make it a journey worth taking.The supporting cast includes Molly Shannon Jeremy Piven Bridget Moynahan and Eugene Levy who is terrific and hilarious as a sales clerk at Bloomingdales.  A handsome film that touches all the right nerves and pushes all the right buttons Serendipity' has a gentle sensibility about it that addresses the notions of romance and love that reside within us all. And it's refreshingly presented in a way that is pure and inoffensive and as such it allows you to open up and embrace something of value without having to apologize for it and without implying you have to be hip' to appreciate it.  Because it's all about love and sharing love which is something we can all use a little more of in this world we live in today. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

And it's refreshingly presented in a way that is pure and inoffensive and as such it allows you to open up and embrace something of value without having to apologize for it and without implying you have to be hip' to appreciate it.  Because it's all about love and sharing love which is something we can all use a little more of in this world we live in today. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.";

	schema:headline " Enchanting romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This charming romantic comedy has all the right ingredients and serves up a bouillabaisse of schmaltzy romance and slapstick fun.  Jonathan John Cusack and Sara Kate Beckinsale meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well almost never.Years go by and both of them are about to be married but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was hisher one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together after about a dozen near misses as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.The fate angle is plowed mercilessly almost to the point of nausea but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional and it plays much better than his previous two characters in High Fidelity' and America's Sweethearts'.  Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.All in all this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack because I'm a sucker for this slush and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 910.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick but if serious drama is your preference stay away.".

In accordance with Webster' dictionary it means 'an apparent aptitude for making accidental fortunate discoveries'. The character of Sara believes on it but regrets for her belief in the end of the story. This is the typical predictable and commercial film but supported by a very charming actress Kate Beckinsale and actor John Cusack. I am a suspicious viewer to make any comment in this regard since I love Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack. But I really believe there is no way that any viewer dislikes this movie. The cover of the DVD is also very beautiful. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Escrito ans Estrelas Written in the Stars".

Despite their obvious chemistry Sara insists on leaving their future up to fate she turns out to be a therapist so you'd think she'd know better but more on that momentarily whereupon they get separated in the WaldorfAstoria. Years later Sara and Jon are both engaged to other people but can't stop thinking about one another so they each take a last stab at finding each other again before their respective nuptials.  Knowing what a big John Cusack fan I am a friend of mine recommended I rent SERENDIPITY. Between a parade of people phoning us and our own busy schedules however I had almost as much trouble getting to finally sit down and watch the DVD from start to finish as Jon and Sara did trying to get back together in the film itself!  But it was worth the effort  even though I was growling at Sara under my breath for being so stupid as to leave their budding romance up to fate instead of running off with Jon when she had the chance and was Sara so new to NYC that it never occurred to her that other people might take Jon's elevator in the WaldorfAstoria during their decisive elevator race? Do fate and common sense have to be mutually exclusive? I found Cusack and Beckinsale so endearing and so full of romantic chemistry and they both looked yummy I might add that I found myself forgiving a lot and rooting for them to get back together.  Marc Klein's script is so chockfull of funny and frustrating nearmisses that at times I found SERENDIPITY as suspenseful as a Hitchcock film!   NYC and San Francisco locations are used wonderfully I was pleased to see that although the second floor of Serendipity III as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week! .  Cusack and Beckinsale are surrounded by a delightful supporting cast too particularly Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon as their respective best friends and the scenestealing Eugene Levy as an officious selfserving Bloomingdale's salesman.  I also found it refreshing that the filmmakers didn't take the obvious route of making the leads' current Significant Others so horrible that you can't imagine what attracted Our Heroes to these creeps in the first place that sort of thing always makes me lose respect for both the protagonist and the screenwriter.

His hysterical 'don't step behind the counter!' is what we have all encountered so often with neurotic sales people. Of course one 'understands' while laughing uncontrollably at them. This film is funny warm lifeaffirming ironical strange disturbing comforting and licks your face like a puppy. Its theme is the invisible tapestry and connecting threads of fate which lie behind the events of the visible world especially as they relate to True Love. In other words 'serendipity' or fortunate chance. Cusack and Beckinsale find each other are eternally meant for each other lose each other and  well I don't want to spoil things  but let us say search for each other for years with results to be discovered by the viewer. It is all so charming and just right that rather than find another romantic film one might just as well watch this one again over and over with a steadily increasing and delighted smile. Above all it is Cusack who makes this as he is the ideal romantic male lead for such charming and elfish fare. His slightly pixielike looks are just quirky enough not too much to make him look truly odd but enough to mark him on the brow as 'an innocent at large' who can have these adventures and really mean them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to this with the full expectation that I was going to see a chick flick and had come to terms with that by the time it started.This however is not a chick flick. This is a romance film about two individuals who whilst both in perfectlygoodbutnotquiteperfect relationships with other people take a fancy to a random stranger they meet in a department store one evening and so spend the rest of the night flirting outrageously like a cheap tart with them.This done off they both go to continue their extant relationships. Unfortunately instead of realising that they could do better and bringing the relationships to a neat end they only decide to make a run for it on the eves of their coincident weddings. How serendipitous.We then have the pleasure of watching them each drag their best friends one of whom's marriage is destroyed in the process across the planet in order to try and find their oncepotential philanderer whilst their nice bridegroom stands rather forlornly alone at the altar. As any plot line following the jilted spouses is abandoned at this point I am surmising that they were stood up. Perhaps they died. Who cares.Man finds girl some snow falls some kissing ensues and our happy couple realise that the fortyfive minutes they spent together in a restaurant six months ago are more than enough to base their everlasting happiness on. Audience feel warm and fuzzy inside. Speaking for myself I was certainlyclose to tears.The idea that this film could be billed as a romantic comedy is quite extraordinary. Certainly the leading characters appear to share the moral outlook of a badger on heat and in that respect I'm very glad they managed to find a likeminded mate. Every other character featured in the film is quite laughably twodimensional and the only deliberately comedic fragment I managed to spot was a quite nicely done best man's speech  made at the weddding subsequently destroyed by our lovably lustfuelled hero and heroine.I am secretly hoping that the joke is on me and Mr. Chelsom is treating us to a wonderfully dark satire on morals and romance in modern times. Somehow though I just can't make myself believe it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went to this with the full expectation that I was going to see a chick flick and had come to terms with that by the time it started.This however is not a chick flick. This is a romance film about two individuals who whilst both in perfectlygoodbutnotquiteperfect relationships with other people take a fancy to a random stranger they meet in a department store one evening and so spend the rest of the night flirting outrageously like a cheap tart with them.This done off they both go to continue their extant relationships. Unfortunately instead of realising that they could do better and bringing the relationships to a neat end they only decide to make a run for it on the eves of their coincident weddings. How serendipitous.We then have the pleasure of watching them each drag their best friends one of whom's marriage is destroyed in the process across the planet in order to try and find their oncepotential philanderer whilst their nice bridegroom stands rather forlornly alone at the altar. As any plot line following the jilted spouses is abandoned at this point I am surmising that they were stood up. Perhaps they died. Who cares.Man finds girl some snow falls some kissing ensues and our happy couple realise that the fortyfive minutes they spent together in a restaurant six months ago are more than enough to base their everlasting happiness on. Audience feel warm and fuzzy inside. Speaking for myself I was certainlyclose to tears.The idea that this film could be billed as a romantic comedy is quite extraordinary. Certainly the leading characters appear to share the moral outlook of a badger on heat and in that respect I'm very glad they managed to find a likeminded mate. Every other character featured in the film is quite laughably twodimensional and the only deliberately comedic fragment I managed to spot was a quite nicely done best man's speech  made at the weddding subsequently destroyed by our lovably lustfuelled hero and heroine.I am secretly hoping that the joke is on me and Mr. Chelsom is treating us to a wonderfully dark satire on morals and romance in modern times. Somehow though I just can't make myself believe it.";

Likewise an implausible premise requires abundant fictions to keep the story goingoften into even more absurd realms. The premise of Serendipity is that it is not you who determines your own destiny rather it is fate that makes the determination as to how your life will play out. Consider Sara's retort to Jonathan just after they meet and he wants to get her name and phone numberJonathan I just had a really great time and for all we know I wouldn't be able to find you again.Sara Well if we're meant to meet again we'll meet again. It's just not the right time now. Now how does Sara know what the RIGHT time is? She doesn't so she's going to let fate decide. How droll!The doctrine of fatalism is a flawed doctrine which states that all events are fixed in advance so that we are powerless to change them. People are merely pieces on a chessboard manipulated by some supernatural powerall choice has been removed from the equation and we have no recourse but to submit ourselves to the will of some external agency. At one point in the movie Sara's friend Courtney told her as much and that was the closest we come to ANY truth in this movie. But the premise must be maintained at all costs and so once the two main characters part all kinds of fatalistic events occur as if on cue to help them find one another againthe five dollar bill with Jonathan's name on it the book with Sara's phone number in it etc. The list of improbabilities increases as the movie descends into utter ludicrousness.One particularly distasteful aspect of this movie was the shallowness of the lead characters. When Jonathan and Sara first met they were both involved with other people. And those other people we come to find out are very nice people who are in love with our main characters. Well it seems to me that Jonathan and Sara can't be too happy with their respective relationships if they are flirting with one another! And if they had any misgivings then it would have been honest of them both to let their significant others in on the secret instead of leading them on in such a disingenuous fashionespecially since those significant others were good and decent people who truly loved them. To string someone along to the point where you've convinced that person that you want to marry him or her but to pine away for someone else and then end the relationship at the last moment is not only cowardly and dishonestit is cruel. But why settle for second best when fate has decreed otherwise? Given the above it was impossible for me to like Jonathan and Sara. All I felt was contempt for their willingness to submit to fate and to not take the responsibility for their actions into their own hands. If I had met a girl whom I thought could be the love of my life and I sincerely doubt such a thing would happen during a brief interlude in a department store as it did in the movie! you can bet your bottom dollar that I would NEVER EVER leave anything up to chance! I would have asked that girl for her phone number and would not have left her without it. Unless of course she was a girl like Sara in which case I probably would have had no choice but to let fate decide. After all she did say it's just not the right time now. Sure babe. Sure.To cap off the succession of absurdities there was no emotional payoff at the end of the movie. Jonathan and Sara shake hands when they finally meet followed by a weak and unconvincing kiss. You would think after two years of constantly thinking about one another and trying desperately to reconnect that our lovers would have rushed into each other's arms and shouted for joy. But no! They simply stand next to each other on the ice rink looking cold and bemused. But then considering the flawed script and all the fatalistic occurrences that permeate every inch of this ridiculous movie I can only believe that it was fated to be this way.".

Serendipity is your typical boylosesgirl story where you know from the beginning how it's going to end but anything but typical because it's actually romantic and actually funny. As with any romance it's the journey that matters. It's what Jon and Sara discover about themselves while they're looking for each other.   Serendipity reunites John Cusack with Jeremy Piven who again plays the best friend role. Pound for pound the Grosse Pointe Blank scenes are better but there aren't as many. Piven's Dean has a lot more screen time here. Some of the funniest scenes feature these two sleuthing their way through New York City and SF briefly searching for a girl Jonathan can't forget. The story is very nicely scripted. There's never a dull moment really. Act II which typically is the middle longest portion of the story is the parallel stories of Jon and Sara longing for each other while not completely into their respective future spouses. For both of them it's as if they're both trapped in the wrong life. Then comes the search with Jon using a more clinical approach sales receipts addresses phone 's and Sara using gut instinct. The whole time you're thinking 'it's not going to work because they're trying too hard' and you're right. They keep missing each other sometimes only by inches. Writer Marc Klein convinces the audience that they are meant to be together even as he convinces Jon and Sara that maybe it wasn't meant to be after all.I wasn't surprised to see The Mighty one of 1998's best films among director Peter Chelsom's credits. One minor folly on Serendipity was casting Molly Shannon who I'll never be able to take seriously as Sara's best friend. Her character mirrors Piven's but the role is noticeably smaller. Much of it was likely cut. Chelsom's direction coupled with John de Borman's understated cinematography make this film like a valentine to New Yorkers. Big Apple be proud. Odd that two films set in NYC the other being Don't Say a Word ended up opening the same weekend with that locale being crucial to the story.  Grade A".

OK that might fly given the whole soul mate destiny motif of the movie. But then he becomes engaged to a sweet attractive woman who obviously loves him very much and even the night before his wedding to this innocent and utterly charming lady he STILL chooses to chase after this rather frigteningly stubborn memory he has of the English girl. Why does this movie think that dumping and hurting such a nice person is somehow overlookable or OK in the ridiculous and insulting pursuit of plot?And then there is is frustration comedy element. Endless sequences of nearmisses and other cosmically crossedwires are irritating. The main characters are also joyless apparently suffering from some form of advanced anhedonia or at least profound ingratitude. We are supposed to think this is poignant? Romantic? Funny? I really can't guess what on earth was going through the writer and director's minds when they concocted this hurtful mess.In real life if you ever encounter anyone as stalky and obsessed as the character John Cusak plays here call the police at once!

I liked the actors the story and for gosh sake stop being so cynical everyone!!!";

It's great as a date movie as one the whole family can enjoy and to watch with a group of friends. My only minor criticism is the amount of time it takes these two to get together but the ending makes it worth it.Beckinsale and Cussack have a limited amount of time together on screen with most of that time happening at the beginning of the film. But in that short amount of time they are able to display more believability and chemistry to the falling in love aspect then many on screen pairs who get triple the amount of screen time do.I give this between an 8.5 and 9 of 10. When your in The mood for a romantic comedy and don't just want the same tired old cookie cutter stories check this outor better yet buy it and watch it every so often when your in the mood for a sweet snow filled fairy tale.".

Although both are promised to others...oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A little sappy in some places but viva la love. Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling. The finale is almost too sweet but most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Watch this with your soul mate.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies where it doesn't matter how many times you watch it more than 20 in my case you'll enjoy it just as much the next time as the first. Yes the plot has the writer pulling all kinds of destiny strings to weave a fun light romantic story. That is forgiven for the joy I get at every viewing. The basic premise is of two starcrossed lovers who are meant to be together with their human beliefs pushing them apart while the rest of the universe is trying to push them back together where they belong. It is so much fun watching this special pairing of John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale at their alltime best.This is classic John Cusack  the tortured intelligent soul who falls for the perfect girl then watches her disappear by her own destiny devices which crushes him. Five years later he's engaged to someone else but can never get his perceived soulmate out of his mind. There are times where Cusack whom I adore will overactappear schizophrenic and sociopathic in some romantic comedies. This however is one of his best. He's simply believable and sympathetic in his quest to put right what went wrong so many years before.Kate Beckinsale  With the exception of her character's destinyspeak at the opening she's the most perfect leading lady in which Cusack will drop anything and actually everything if you think about it to finally track down and begin a life together. Charming beautiful intelligent flawed strong... She's exceptional.Now add Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven as the equallyneurotic best friends of both our heroes plus the added joy of watching the everreliable funnyman Eugene Levy stealing every scene in the Bloomingdale's search... The casting director deserves an honorary Well done! for their choices. Throw in the amazing New York skyline and Central Park in all it's splendor...This movie may not be perfect. But if you are thinking of watching a movie with your significant other to make you laugh cry hold onto one another in a romantic embrace so they never ever go away... This is that movie. It never gets old. It seems fresh every time I see it. A great example was my 14yo foster daughter watching this for the first time. Her reaction as the lead characters miss each other by inches once again was  I HATE this movie!!!... Only to have her at the end tell me how much she LOVED the movie. It was awesome!!It isn't perfect but compared to all the recent The Notebookknockoffs filling up movie theaters and video rentals at an alarming rate considering they are neither good NOR romantic I'd recommend renting this again simply for the feelgood factor. 9 out of 10 for sheer pleasantness and simplicity that makes me smile at the end every time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you believe in fate? How about destiny or the fact that everything happens for a reason and there are no coincidences in life? In the romantic comedy Serendipity it is a story of two New Yorkers Jonathan Trager John Cusack and Sara Thomas Kate Beckinsale who meet by fate in a Bloomingdale's department store over a pair of black cashmere gloves and spend an odd yet nice night together then leave it all to chance as they write their phone numbers on a five dollar bill and a used book. If the bill or book is found then they know that they were meant to be and that fate has brought them together. Years later after neither have found each others phone numbers the two are close to getting married to different people basically on the same date. While both are having second thoughts about their current situation and can't get the other off their minds try one more time to find each other. This hopeful romantic film is a great date movie and highly recommended. If you don't believe in fate now you will once you have watched this movie.Serendipity means a fortunate accident. I personally think that everything happens for a reason and that there are no accidents or coincidences in life. So this movie was right up my ally. A little frustrating at first though to see a couple hit it off so well and then leave everything to chance but if it was meant to be then it will happen right? The two go through some pretty suspenseful twists and your left thinking if they're going to end up finding each other. The lengths that they both endure are so sweet you just want them to find each other and fall madly in love again.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have amazing on screen chemistry and when put together they make the perfect pair. John Cusack is a very witty guy in this film and is always there for a good laugh. His character Jonathan Trager is your typical hopeless romantic that you end up rooting for in the end to find the girl and sweep her off her feet. He is a very talented actor and is nothing short of in this flick. His character is also paired with best friend Dean Kansky Jeremy Piven an obituary writer for the New York Times. Together these two are the dynamic duo. Jeremy Piven with his oneliners and comedic timing is a perfect side kick for the uneasy and confused Jonathan Trager. Both are in the race to find the girl of Jonathan's dream running all around New York pulled in a million directions and fighting over obstacles in order to have one last chance with the one that got away two days before his wedding. Opposite John Cusack Kate Beckinsale is also an amazing actress to watch. She sparkles on screen with her beauty and grace playing the perfect girl for Jonathan to chase. She too is linked with a best friend Eve Molly Shannon who is by her side the whole time tearing through New York to try and find Jonathan. Molly Shannon's character owns a newage store in San Francisco and has just the quirky style and comedic support to balance out Kate Beckinsale. They are the perfect best bud match and are fun to watch interact with each other. With the wonderful setting of the beautiful New York and these four talented actors this movie was sure to attract all those hopeless romantics out there.Serendipity overall is a fantastic movie with an interesting storyline talented and well known actors all to a backdrop of the beautiful New York skyline. This is a great romantic comedy that will keep you in a pleasant suspense until the very end and left wondering if there is a certain person out there that you are meant to spend the rest of your life with. Will you meet by fate by chance is it your long time best friend or the person sitting next to you on the subway? This movie leaves you questioning your every move and second guessing your life choices. Give fate and destiny a chance you never know what they will bring to you.".

A similar stereotyping is done in Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition in the part called Samuel Goldenberg and Schmyl. However instead of satirizing two Jews Werfel was making fun of the differences between an antisemitic Polish aristocrat and a bourgeois Jewish Pole who has the gift of being a survivor. Perhaps because of this the reception of the film has been cool. It has never been released on laser disc or DVD in the U.S. and is seldom seen on television.

The familiar setting also gives this movie more of a timeless feel than some of Danny Kaye's camp films such as The Court Jester which I nonetheless put in my system recently while testing new connections and then sat down to watch to the end.I'm a great fan of Danny Kaye the entertainer including the shtick usually but I like this movie precisely because it shows a side of his talents that we saw in only a handful of films and perhaps on his television show. So sit back and relax and stop worrying the movie will dissolve into one of those camp musicals  it won't.This is a wonderful role for Curd Jrgens as well though almost anything I say would be telling too much.

It was also Werfel's last work as he died in 1945 as the play was running on Broadway. Werfel when fleeing France and the onrushing Nazi occupation traveled the same route from Paris to southern France and I'm sure his real life experiences verbatim would make an interesting story.The play starred another refugee Oscar Karlweis as the philosophical Jewish refugee Jacobowsky and Louis Calhern as the stiff necked Polish colonel who among other things is antiSemitic so typical of his class in those days. On screen the colonel is played by CurtJurgens and he has a mission to get to the United Kingdom and give the new Polish in exile government a list of contacts. Naturally the Nazis want to get their hands on him and the list. The colonel wants to also get his French wife Nicole Maurey out of France as well and his orderly Akim Tamiroff.The film is their journey through France along the same path Werfel took to get out of Europe. In Jurgens mind Kaye is annoying Jew but he gradually learns to both respect Kaye's resourcefulness and see a Jewish person as a human being. All too human as Maurey also starts to develop feelings for him.For this role Kaye dropped a whole lot of his usual shtick and his performance is simple and restrained. The humor and there is a bit there is of the whimsical and ironical kind. He does it well. Two other performances of note are that of Alexander Scourby as the Nazi colonel who also has designs on Maurey and Martita Hunt as a helpful make that very helpful Mother Superior of a convent.For a different and refreshing Danny Kaye I highly recommend Me And The Colonel.".

	schema:headline " Agreeable and pleasant Western actioner about a scout who leads an Oregonbound wagon train through Sioux territory";
	schema:reviewBody "Simple and acceptable Indian Western compellingly starred by Kirk Douglas and decently directed by Andre De Toth . It deals with an explorer called Johnny Hawks Kirk Douglas leading a wagon train through hostile Indian country to Oregon  1870 . Johnny unwittingly gets involved with a Sioux chief's Edward Franz daughter Elsa Martinelli . But unscrupulous whisky traders Walter Matthau  Lon Chaney Jr are after the gold on Sioux land  as they blackmail Indians and subsequently originate friction . Hawks attempts to make peace with the Indian leader but a secret Sioux gold mine causes dispute and treason . Johnny tries to warn a fort of an imminent raid by the Sioux and the detachment mistake him for one of the renegades . In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath . This exciting picture tells the story of a upright scout called Johnny Hawks  finely played by the great Kirk Douglas . The film packs the sweep of Red River the drama of High noon  the violence of Shane and the might of Kirk Douglas as a twofisted Indian Fighter. Noisy action  romance between DouglasMartinelli  thrills  fights  wonderful outdoors  all of them keep things lively . Interesting as well as stirring screenplay by Robert Richards  Frank Davis and prestigious Ben Hecht  Billy Wilder's usual . This undemanding western is plenty of suspense as the dreaded final Indian attack approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone against impossible odds and nobody is willing to help him but they pursue him  while he attempts to clear his name as wrongfully accused as traitor . This enjoyable tale is almost rudimentary though full of clichs  a good guy come to narration is almost adjusted in real time from the starring arrives in the fort commanded by a tough Captain  nicely performed by Walter Abel  until the ending confrontation  when they are besieged by Indians  as DouglasHawks is given a limited time to resolve the accusation as a Sioux's friend  and consequently a treacherous . The highlights of the film are the facing off between Douglas and his enemies  Walter Matthaw and Lon Chaney Jr  and the climatic confrontation on the final . Phenomenal and great role for Kirk Douglas as tough guy  he's the whole show  he plays a scout hired to lead a wagon train to Oregon . He gives a perfect acting as craggy  violent and uncompromising figure . Kirk did most of his own horse riding and at one point  broke his nose attempting a stunt that called for him to make his horse fall . The casting of Onahti  the Indian girl  resulted out to be much more difficult than first anticipated . Though there were a number of unsuccessful auditions  it wasn't until Kirk Douglas' wife spotted a model in Vogue magazine that the production knew they had their leading lady  her name was Elsa Martinelli . Very good support cast  many of them usual in Western  such as Walter Matthau  Diana Douglas who married Kirk Douglas  Walter Abel  Lon Chaney Jr.  Eduard Franz  Alan Hale Jr.  Elisha Cook Jr.  Ray Teal  Frank Cady and Hank Worden in a doubl role as Crazy Bear  Guardhouse Keeper  likewise  Harry Landers plays both Grey Wolf and also one of Captain Trask's attachs . Made in enough budget by producer William Schorr  it is an efficient film and very entertaining . The picture contains an excellent cinematography in CinemaScope  print by Technicolor by Wilfred Cline  being shot on location in Bend  Oregon  including gorgeous landscapes . Thrilling and appropriate musical score by Franz Waxman . This typical Western was professionally directed by Andre De Toth . Being first feature from Kirk Douglas' then new production company Bryna named for his mother . At his beginnings De Toth entered the Hungarian film industry obtaining work as a writer editor  second unit director and actor before finally becoming a director. He directed a few films just before the outbreak of WW II when he fled to England . Alexander Korda gave him a job there and when De Toth emigrated to the US in 1942  Korda got him a job as a second unit director on Jungle Book 1942 . Andre De Toth was a classical director  Western usual Indian fighter Man in the saddle  Ramrod  Last of Comanches  The stranger wore a gun but also made Peplum Gold for the Caesar and adventure The Mongols  Morgan the pirate  Tanganyika .

	schema:headline " De Toth's Best Western";
	schema:reviewBody "At the heart of De Toth's oeuvre lies an interesting contradiction. He has an abiding interest in suspense action and the wellspring of violent events a fact underlined by the number of thrillers frontier yarns and dramas he helmed during his career but as a director characteristically disassociates himself from their process. This 'distancing' effect has been noted by a number of viewers creating some critical debate about De Toth's engagement with his material. In my view his detachment is not to be confused with aloofness  an interesting comparison can be made with Stanley Kubrick's alleged 'coldness'  but is rather De Toth's way of resolving what really 'matters'. It is this intelligence revealing itself sharply in his best films that makes him such a worthwhile study. Along with De Toth's assured debut 'Ramrod' 1947 and the austere 'Day of the Outlaw' 1959 'The Indian Fighter' is probably the finest of his Western films revealing a characteristic response to the demands of the genre. In 'Ramrod' the moral questing springs from a noirish plot that is unsettled and full of tension. In 'Day of the Outlaw' issues are resolved more formally played out against the stark landscape of Winter. In 'The Indian Fighter' De Toth's concerns manifest themselves in his most lyrical and sensuous work. He thereby creates a film which in emphasis is in direct contrast to most other 50's Westerns.This is ostensibly a tale of a famous frontiersman Johnny Hawks played with usual lusty gusto by Kirk Douglas back from the wars. Ultimately he has to redeem his reputation discovering balance within the indigenous people he has previously  warred against. Gold has been discovered on Indian land and the bad guys a marvellous performance by Walter Matthau ably supported by Lon Chaney Jnr are out to kill and cheat to secure the riches. This and the related fear of a tribal uprising provide the main action point of the film. As the Indian fighter of the title ironically the first thing we notice about Hawks is his reticence. In fact he hardly fights at all  only when he is obliged or when called upon to at the climax of the film. For him combat is not a prerequisite although he is not slow to react when needs be. A comparison with the bitterness of Ethan Edwards say in Ford's 'The Searchers' is revealing. Edwards loathes the Commanches with a bitterness entirely absence from De Toth's hero. As Hawks' opponents observe he is more of an Indian lover than fighter. And of course in the most obvious way they are right. Almost more important to the hero than his professional reputation is his preoccupation with the Indian maid Onhati. His singleminded pursuit and later dalliance with her initiates the main crisis of the film as he leaves the wagon train to be by her side after taking it 'two days out of my way and half way up a mountain'.This is a film full of sensuality placed in contrast to 'duty' the calling of action. We are constantly reminded of the cool pools green foliage closeness of the earth just as much as of the teachery and turmoil of the frontier. Franz Waxman's score is lyrical and evocative frequently idyllic. The glorious cinematography gives nature's perpetual garden a pantheistic gloss sometimes intense and always resplendent. Just as the main film captures these images so in mimicry does Briggs a supposed protg of civil war photographer Matthew Brady who frequently accompanies Hawks. He is eager to capture the grandeur around him. His camera is as significant to us as it is to Hawks who makes a point of rescuing it at one point during the battle at the fort. An important minor character Briggs emphasises the appreciation of the sublime and beautiful that the film invites. A couple of times De Toth pauses the action once at the fort and then at the wagon train to pan his camera for long seconds along sets and people recording their place in the Oregon landscape. Like Briggs he wants to admire and record.A circular film 'The Indian Fighter' begins with Hawks gazing at Onhati bathing naked in a pool. It ends with him joining her in the water forming a happy couple. The whole world of action is thus enclosed by their bonding their sensual preoccupation usurping the violent demands of Indianwhite conflict. The scenes between the two lovers caused a murmur at the time. Considered 'risque' for the conservative 50's Western De Toth simply inserted them and their sexual selfabsorption as entirely fitting his plan of things. What is more eyebrowraising today is how he allowed the encounters between two lovers to backstage the expected intrigues of masculine action and actually assume greater significance reversing regular audience expectations. This stress an essentially feminine one. is completely uncharacteristic of the Western at this time. Add to that a sympathetic view of Indians and nature conservation the Indian Chief's environmental concerns are a main reason for his refusing to exploit the land with mining and you have an excellent film  a career highlight of this greatly underrated director.".

His singleminded pursuit and later dalliance with her initiates the main crisis of the film as he leaves the wagon train to be by her side after taking it 'two days out of my way and half way up a mountain'.This is a film full of sensuality placed in contrast to 'duty' the calling of action. We are constantly reminded of the cool pools green foliage closeness of the earth just as much as of the teachery and turmoil of the frontier. Franz Waxman's score is lyrical and evocative frequently idyllic. The glorious cinematography gives nature's perpetual garden a pantheistic gloss sometimes intense and always resplendent. Just as the main film captures these images so in mimicry does Briggs a supposed protg of civil war photographer Matthew Brady who frequently accompanies Hawks. He is eager to capture the grandeur around him. His camera is as significant to us as it is to Hawks who makes a point of rescuing it at one point during the battle at the fort. An important minor character Briggs emphasises the appreciation of the sublime and beautiful that the film invites. A couple of times De Toth pauses the action once at the fort and then at the wagon train to pan his camera for long seconds along sets and people recording their place in the Oregon landscape. Like Briggs he wants to admire and record.A circular film 'The Indian Fighter' begins with Hawks gazing at Onhati bathing naked in a pool. It ends with him joining her in the water forming a happy couple. The whole world of action is thus enclosed by their bonding their sensual preoccupation usurping the violent demands of Indianwhite conflict. The scenes between the two lovers caused a murmur at the time. Considered 'risque' for the conservative 50's Western De Toth simply inserted them and their sexual selfabsorption as entirely fitting his plan of things. What is more eyebrowraising today is how he allowed the encounters between two lovers to backstage the expected intrigues of masculine action and actually assume greater significance reversing regular audience expectations. This stress an essentially feminine one. is completely uncharacteristic of the Western at this time. Add to that a sympathetic view of Indians and nature conservation the Indian Chief's environmental concerns are a main reason for his refusing to exploit the land with mining and you have an excellent film  a career highlight of this greatly underrated director.";

The film presents a pretty aggressive Indian point of view without becoming overly depressing or preachy. Red Cloud and the Sioux are placed in historically accurate context except for the Oregon location.There are several very strong Civil War tieins.Nice bit about the photographer. Probably only time this idea was ever used as part of a passing of the West theme.Absolutely stunning outdoor locations. Very little sound stage filming.Elsa Martinelli is HOT. Excellent use of child actor Michael Winkelman later of The Real McCoys TV series as comic relief.Here are some of the things that detracted from the film's qualityWalter Mathau is badly miscast as the heavy.Overall the plot is too bland and cookie cutter. The heavies aren't very menacing. There's no really compelling character or dramatic tension.In many places the plot is implausible and contrived especially the actions of the heavies Civington and Todd. The same is true of the romance between Hawks and Onahti. This is the chief's daughter she has the pick of any brave in the tribe yet she falls for a white guy who rapes her.Kirk Douglas is a legit star and has a great screen presence but he is very smug and overacts.".

It did seem well balanced AND featured mostly Indians in Indian parts though oddly they chose an Italian lady to play the female leading Indian!.The rest of the film while entertaining and having the usual great performance by Kirk Douglas also is very simplistic and poorly thought out at times. For example the motivation for why Douglas saved Walter Mathau's sorry butt at the beginning of the film is unclear. It defied common sense not to just let the Indians kill Mathau. Plus at the end of the film Douglas' confrontation with Douglas and Lon Chaney Jr. was a long time coming but was resolved awfully quicklymaking it seem very anticlimactic.

Much to my surprise it turns out not to be Natalie at all but someone far more unusual Elsa Martinelli someone it seems I know best as Charlton Heston's love interest in The Pigeon That Took Rome the slim but pleasant comedy from 1962.In fact this film is introducing Elsa Martinelli a fresh import from Italy at the time. Bell' Italia indeed. Elsa introduces herself to us in the opening scene by undressing completely to go for a quiet dip in the river. So it's going to be la dolce vita along the riverbank it seems...As the beautiful longhaired Indian maiden Elsa finds herself teamed with Kirk brandishing his chin and his triangular physique. The Wild West lives up to its name not only with the Indians' fiery attack on the army fort the film's climax but also with the steamy roll in the surf by our two principals a couple of years after From Here to Eternity.The film offers Elisha Cook an unusual part to play a photographer who had worked with Matthew Brady during the War and who now wants to immortalize the West with his camera as advertising to attract settlers. The film understands the dichotomy of preservation and destruction that his character represents.Walter Matthau and Lon Chaney are the bad white men while Alan Hale Gilligan's Skipper and Frank Cady Green Acres' Mr. Drucker round out a nostalgic supporting cast.Produced by Kirk Douglas's own production company Bryna The Indian Fighter can't help but have a social conscience. It does show the strong influence of the message Western  in its interracial romance Cook's protoAnsel Adams character and so on  but without sacrificing the adventure elements of the story.The film boasts some spectacular Oregon scenery. It's not the Monument Valley desert landscape we're used to seeing in so many other epic Westerns when directed by John Ford but rather mountainous and riverine terrain more like what Ford showed us in How the West Was Won 1962.Andr De Toth provides good solid Cinemascope direction letting the widescreen process work its own wonders on the audience. The film however does betray more brutality than I would have expected especially for its day.All in all an adventure story intelligently and attractively handled with some depth for those who care to look.".

It was interesting to me that Johnny Hawks didn't attempt to stop Briggs realizing that the sweep of civilization was inevitable and that he couldn't delay it's coming. As a pioneer Hawks certainly wasn't in denial over the future of his frontier.Johnny's first encounter with Onahti Elsa Martinelli puzzled me somewhat. Taking her by force didn't seem to be the wisest thing to do right in the middle of Red Cloud's camp. I don't think that's something a white man could get away with no matter how honorable his long range intentions.Even with some great cinematography and majestic landscapes I found myself only nominally interested in the story. There seemed to be something just a bit missing to the plot development perhaps it was Johnny Hawks' disconnect from the villains of the piece Lon Chaney and the oddly cast Walter Matthau. Maybe only odd in hindsight as most of my experience of Matthau has him in somewhat comedic roles. It seemed to me that the early set up of Wes Todd's Matthau save in the Sioux camp would have put Hawks in closer proximity to the two gold seekers but then it appeared like Onahti distracted Hawks from a lot of things. I wonder if anything was going on off camera.With a title like The Indian Fighter the picture doesn't seem to dwell on that preoccupation much. Kirk Douglas does go one on one with warrior White Wolf early on and plays a part in the attack on the Army fort later in the story. Overall however his role in the story makes him a much more even handed character someone who values the Native way of life as more honorable than most of the white brothers he has to deal with throughout the picture.".

Kirk Douglas does go one on one with warrior White Wolf early on and plays a part in the attack on the Army fort later in the story. Overall however his role in the story makes him a much more even handed character someone who values the Native way of life as more honorable than most of the white brothers he has to deal with throughout the picture.";

	schema:reviewBody "This first film released by Kirk Douglas's Bryna Production Co. begins with luscious Italian actress Elsa MartinelliOnahti slipping out of her clothes in a forest and taking a bath in a river. Kirk Douglas comes moseying along on a horse takes a peek and continues on. But he'll make his acquaintance more forcefully in the future always when she is alone and near or in the river. They will end the film floating together in the river. In between these sensual interludes which are what most people most remember about this film is more traditional frontier western fare including bad white men who want to steal the Indians' gold mine a bad Indian who's willing to tell them where the mine is for a jug of whiskey and a bad wagon train guide who leads the train into the heart of Sioux territory just to have a tryst with the chief's daughter. The later is of course Kirk Douglas as Johnny Hawks. In his absence from the wagoners bad things happen which might have been averted if he had been present. These launch a full scale military response by the Sioux and a panicked retreat of the wagoners to the fort from wince they came. Shirking his duty even for a few hours of pleasure made him partly responsible for the travesties that occurred in his absence and made him vulnerable to the charge of being an Indian lover rather than an Indian fighter. After all he usually verbally minimized the chance of a seemingly unprovoked Indian attack saying that he liked Indians and white folks equally well and saw no reason why they couldn't get along peacefullyI'm afraid he was a little overoptimistic in this regard. Thus Johnny Hanks had to redeem himself in the eyes of the whites by taking a leading part in the defense of the fort and inhabitants during the all out charge of the Sioux who unwisely staged their attack in broad daylight. In reality Indians very rarely launched a full scale attack even at night against a well built fort with an adequate number of defenders. It was simply too lethal in most cases. They were less able to absorb a large loss of life than the whites. But such an attack especially if accompanied by a partial burning of the fort as in this film was hard to resist as the climactic 'action' event. Of course such an attack is also seen in certain other films. Hawks finally ended the battle by escaping the fort to parley with Red Cloud trying to convince him that further bloodshed wouldn't bring back brother Gray Wolf. Also he promised that he would bring in the assassin of Gray WolfWalter Matthau as the greedy Wes Todd to be dealt with in Indian fashion. Lon Chaney Jr. played his partner Chivington in the quest for gold. Chivington killed several other Indians that added fuel to the animosity of the Sioux toward the whites.......Diana Douglas Kirk's exwife played Susan a widow with a son. She tried to get Hawks to accompany her to Oregon but no dice. He preferred Onahti and his accustomed lifestyle......Veteran actor Alan Hale Jr. played a wagoner who tried to interest Susan in joining him in Oregon citing his experience growing apples. Walter Abel played Captain Trask of the fort while sternfaced Edward Franz played Red Cloud........Ironically the film was about people moving to Oregon and was filmed entirely around Bend Oregon but the story takes place entirely in eastern Wyoming........I'd like to return to the HawkOnahti romance. When Hawks first accosted her she struck back with a knife which he took from her. Ignoring her water jars she ran toward the encampment. Surprisingly she didn't tattle on Hawks suggesting possible interest in him. In the second most memorable incident again she was initially hostile including when he pulled her down in the river shallows and lay on top of her. But suddenly she smiled and stopped resisting. Later they relaxed under a tree and talked about Hawks need to continue with the wagon train vs. his desire to be with her. Hawks' defeat of Grey Wolf in a staged duel may have influenced her perception of him. Next they independently cooperated in subduing Gray Wolfkiller Todd and bringing him in to stand Indian justice. Lastly of course they are floating together in the river........In all one of the most memorable westerns you will find. See it at You Tube.".

	schema:headline " The Indian Peacemaker";
	schema:reviewBody "The Indian Fighter of the title is Johnny Hawks a man who made his name fighting Indians. The film however does not deal with this part of Hawks's career. The Hawks we see here is more of an Indian Peacemaker a man determined to prevent war from breaking out between the Indians and the white man. He is tasked with leading a wagon train to Oregon and this promises to be a difficult task as the wagons must pass through Sioux territory at a time of tension between the Sioux and the whites. Gold has been discovered on Sioux land but its whereabouts is currently known only to Indians themselves. Worried about the prospect of an influx of white American gold prospectors the Sioux leader Red Cloud has decreed death to any of his people who dare reveal the secret of the gold to the whites. Hawks's task is made more difficult by the facts that his party includes two unscrupulous goldhungry individuals Chivington and Todd and that some of the Indians particularly the whiskeycrazed Crazy Bear are prepared to defy their leader's edict even at the risk of their lives. A complicating factor is Hawks's love for Red Cloud's beautiful daughter Onahti. Hollywood's traditional view of the American Indians were that they were primitive bloodthirsty savages and that the opening up of the North American continent to settlement by the white man was simply part of the march of progress and of the triumph of civilisation over barbarism. Films were still being made from this viewpoint in the 1950s the Gregory Peck vehicle Only the Valiant is a good or bad example but occasionally Hollywood did acknowledge in Westerns such as Broken Arrow or Apache that there was another side to the story. The Indian Fighter which was produced by its star the politically liberal Kirk Douglas is another example. When Hawks points out that the Indians could exchange the gold for things that they value such as horses and blankets Red Cloud retorts that to do so would mean losing things that they value even more highly such as the right to live undisturbed on their ancestral land. Although there are bad Indians such as Crazy Bear the general message of the film is that westward spread of white settlement may have represented Manifest Destiny and the advance of civilisation to the white man himself but to the red man it represented an unwelcome intrusion into his world and the loss of all that he held sacred. The use of the name Chivington for one of the villainous whites is significant the Chivington of this film is a fictional character but his name is borrowed from the reallife John Milton Chivington a US Army officer infamous for his obsessive hatred and brutal treatment of Native Americans. As in Broken Arrow the main Indian characters are played by white actors. In the case of Onahti played by the Italian Elsa Martinelli this may have been to keep the censors happy the Production Code officially banned the depiction of what it called miscegenation but there seemed to be an unofficial rule that relationships between white men and Asian or Native American women were tolerated if the woman was played by a white actress. Broken Arrow also features a romance between a white man and an Indian maiden played in that case by Debra Paget. In the case of the male characters however I could not understand why Native American actors could not be found especially as the white actors who play these parts were not unlike Jeff Chandler in Broken Arrow major boxoffice names. I would not rank this film as highly as Broken Arrow which is one of the seminal Westerns of the fifties. Douglas made a good number of Westerns but apart from the modernday Lonely are the Brave and possibly Gunfight at the OK Corral I would not regard any of the ones I have seen as falling among his really great films like Champion Lust for Life and Spartacus. There is nothing wrong with his performance here but he never really catches fire as he could do when he was at his best. The action scenes are wellhandled but the plot is not the most exciting and the Onahti subplot is a bit of a distraction. This is perhaps a middleranking Douglas Western rather better than say The Big Trees but not as good as Along the Great Divide and certainly not as good as Lonely are the Brave or Gunfight at the OK Corral. 610".

	schema:headline " Lust in the dust or is it lust in the river.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Indian Fighter was a good western for Kirk Douglas to show his stuff. Apparently he did his own stunts riding his own horse even falling from a horse and breaking his nose in the process although that wasn't part of the script.We got to see Kirk Douglas with his teeth fully clenched and of course we got see Kirk Douglas flexing his biceps and shirtless. But the best parts were the passionate scenes between him and Elsa Martinelli. Boy they were hot. I can see myself now back in the 1950's at a Saturday afternoon matine and the theater is packed mostly with kids and there would be a lot of hooting and hollering especially when they rolled in the water. You could call it lust in the dust except they were in the water so lust in the river. But us impressionable young lads weren't supposed to know things like that but it would still have been great fun. Or as some would say darn there they are smooching again. Howls of laughter. I watched this film recently and given how hot the scenes were between Kirk and Elsa it was not surprising to learn afterwards that the two of them were having a torrid affair on the set. Making it more bizarre was the fact that Kirk was married at the time to Anne Douglas and it was with her that they found Elsa Martinelli and got her for the part of the Indian maiden.Further the other love interest in the film was Donna Douglas playing Susan Rogers a single mother travelling west with her young lad but she was also Kirk's ex wife from 19431951 and the mother of Michael Douglas. Boy the intrigue and relationships behind the movie were better than the movie itself. Not that the film was bad as it was a pretty good duster even literally as a lot of dust was kicked up in the battle scenes. On the plus side this film did a good job of trying to present the Indian in a positive light Hollywood was starting to figure it out that the Indians were not always the bad guys and not as godless savages or some such thing as the baddie Lon Chaney declared at one point.Indeed there was a lot of that as the white men and women would literally go into a panic at the thought of the Indians coming anywhere near them. After all don't the Indians just want to rape am I allowed to say that? and pillage and scalp? No they were presented in a positive light and of course poor Kirk was accused of being an Indian lover. But the film turned on the baddies Walter Matthau and Lon Chaney both plying the Indians with drink and looking for the gold. But it's OK as they get theirs in the end after they were responsible for breaking the peace treaty and of course blaming it on the Indians and everyone runs around like chickens with their heads cut off screaming the Indians are coming or some such blather. There was a pretty good battle scene and overall this film wasn't bad with great fun and some regular western actors like Ray Teal Walter Abel and Allan Hale. And a great little turn by film noir icon Elisha Cook Jr. The CinemaScope was great even on my 42 inch Samsung with a clear picture seen in its full glory on YouTube. Great fun with the best fun with Kirk shirtless flexing his biceps and frolicking with Elsa in the river. Lust in the river.".

You could call it lust in the dust except they were in the water so lust in the river. But us impressionable young lads weren't supposed to know things like that but it would still have been great fun. Or as some would say darn there they are smooching again. Howls of laughter. I watched this film recently and given how hot the scenes were between Kirk and Elsa it was not surprising to learn afterwards that the two of them were having a torrid affair on the set. Making it more bizarre was the fact that Kirk was married at the time to Anne Douglas and it was with her that they found Elsa Martinelli and got her for the part of the Indian maiden.Further the other love interest in the film was Donna Douglas playing Susan Rogers a single mother travelling west with her young lad but she was also Kirk's ex wife from 19431951 and the mother of Michael Douglas. Boy the intrigue and relationships behind the movie were better than the movie itself. Not that the film was bad as it was a pretty good duster even literally as a lot of dust was kicked up in the battle scenes. On the plus side this film did a good job of trying to present the Indian in a positive light Hollywood was starting to figure it out that the Indians were not always the bad guys and not as godless savages or some such thing as the baddie Lon Chaney declared at one point.Indeed there was a lot of that as the white men and women would literally go into a panic at the thought of the Indians coming anywhere near them. After all don't the Indians just want to rape am I allowed to say that? and pillage and scalp? No they were presented in a positive light and of course poor Kirk was accused of being an Indian lover. But the film turned on the baddies Walter Matthau and Lon Chaney both plying the Indians with drink and looking for the gold. But it's OK as they get theirs in the end after they were responsible for breaking the peace treaty and of course blaming it on the Indians and everyone runs around like chickens with their heads cut off screaming the Indians are coming or some such blather. There was a pretty good battle scene and overall this film wasn't bad with great fun and some regular western actors like Ray Teal Walter Abel and Allan Hale. And a great little turn by film noir icon Elisha Cook Jr. The CinemaScope was great even on my 42 inch Samsung with a clear picture seen in its full glory on YouTube. Great fun with the best fun with Kirk shirtless flexing his biceps and frolicking with Elsa in the river. Lust in the river.";

In my opinion De Toth was just an average director that will probably be remembered for his earlier work in House of Wax 1953 when aided by an interesting plot and an excellent Vincent Price he achieved a little classic in the horror genre but he never reached the mark later.As for The Indian Fighter you can rescue Kirk Douglas undeniable strong screen presence one of Walter Mattau's early roles as a villain and the sensual Italian actress Elsa Martinelli as an Indian squaw that gets mixed up with Douglas.But there's not much more in this average and common film only for fans of the genre or good old Kirk in his late thirties back then.Just for the record in Argentina The Indian Fighter was renamed as A un Paso de la Muerte something like Just One Step Away from Death.".

However for whatever reason Kirk Douglas has populated his movie with some ridiculous casting choices  Eduard Franz as a Sioux chief? Harry Landers as Grey Eagle?? Hank Worden as Crazy Bear?!!!!? and Elsa Martinelli as an Indian maiden??!!!!!!!???. The first time Martinelli delivers that thick Italian accents I started giggling. Come on Kirk you produced this. Couldn't you have found some REAL Indians or at least an actress that didn't sound as if she's just come off the boat at Ellis Island. Hank Worden also plays a white character making things seem even more ridiculous.Hey my wife is Italian so I wouldn't dare take cheap shots at Martinelli. Actually when she keeps her mouth shut Martinelli is  pretty darn good. Had the script be rewritten so she only spoke Sioux Martinelli would have been MUCH more believable. Oh well.To it's credit the movie neither exploits or downplays the interracial relationship between Douglas and Martinelli. That's daring and commendable on the part of producer Douglas particularly given the era of both the story and race relations in 50s America.No one seems to have commented on the DouglasMartinelli courting ritual. It looks more like rape than romance. I thought feminist reviewers would be outraged. However I've been told this ritual was common among the Plains Indians though it is not clear to me whether this applies to the Sioux.Some comments should be made about the performances of Walter Matthau and Lon Chaney. Matthau comes across as WAY too contemporary and Chaney still seems to be playing Lenny from Of Mice and Men'.   Elisha Cook seems to have wandered over from the set of Shane.' Nonetheless Cook is still pretty watchable. Michael Winkelman The Real McCoys' who played Diana Douglas's son is terrific.The Technicolor photography is very good the editing only OK. For example the wagon train has traveled at least one full day but seems to get back to the fort in a couple of minutes.  The Oregon landscapes are spectacular.Given its shortcomings The Indian Fighter is STILL a pretty decent western. I give it a weak 6'.".

Abdul and Mustafa separate the Jewish and Marine passengers and they are transported to Beirut while twelve other terrorists embark on board.

The results were some of the most palpable incarnations of the antihero ever put to film.Alas in the eighties something changed.

Watching it in the ultraliberal post911 21st century it's hard to believe this film even got made.

The editor and director could sure have used a few lessons in pacing notably around the totally extraneous character development scenes where we have it reinforced beyond any doubt that Jewish Americans are beyond reproach.

I can just imagine this being George Bush's favourite movie...Chuck Norris is in many ways the ultimate American hero ruthless but virtuous kind hearted yet badashell the underdog yet the victor. After saving American soldiers from those nasty farEasterners in the 'Missing in Action' series Chuckie truly outdoes himself here. Taken with a large pinch of salt or as a very shrewd satire a la 'Team America' 'The Delta Force' delivers in ways Bruckheimer and can only dream of.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Delta Force begins in the darkness of the Iranian desert at Desert One on April 25 1980 with the disastrous attempt to rescue the US hostages in Teheran. The movie then goes ahead to the summer of 1985 where a passenger plane with some 200 persons mostly Americans is skyjacked on a flight from Rome to Athens. It's there where the Delta Force redeems itself from what happened to it that dark April morning five years before. Based loosely on the TWA 847 skyjacking and brutal beating and murder of Navy diver Robert Stethem Delta Force takes some liberties on the historical facts of that event. Like the movies of WWII that were made to uplift the American public Delta Force far more succeeds then fails in it's message that it's was trying the bring to those here in the USA and elsewhere on Americas as well as the free worlds War on Terrorism back then in 1986. Admittedly overthetop heroics by the Delta Force especially Maj. McCoy  Col. Alexender Chuck Norris  Lee Marvin. Who I think is the real hero in the movie and in what really happened in real life on that plane is the planes German stewardess Ingrid Hanna Schygulia. Ingrid in real life showed more courage as well as kindness and humanity under pressure from the terrorists on the plane then the whole Delta Force combined showed in the make believe of the skyjacking and phony action scenes in the film. High tension and terror in the sky as well as on land as a passenger plane is skyjacked by a gang of Arab terrorists. The Terrorists are led by their leader AbdulRobert Foster who threatens to blow up the plane and passengers inside unless the Israelis releases hundreds of terrorist that they have incarcerated.Trying to get the terrorists to let at least the women and children go free the Delta Force tries to storm the plane when it lands in Algeria for refueling. At the same time there's a new group of terrorist entering the plane to reinforce those that are already there. Navy diver Pete Peterson William Wallace who was brutally beaten to the point where he was almost dead is shot in the head and dumped on the tarmac in retaliation of the Delta Force attempted rescue. It's when the plane lands in Beirut that the real action begins and it's there where the Delta force with the help of Israeli commandos save the day and in the end rack this one up for the good guys. Heart pounding and effective movie about the good guys giving it back to the terrorist in a movie that was made some 15 years ahead of it's time September 11 2001 that shows if you mess with Uncle Sam you'll only get burned in the end. Chuck Norris  Lee Marvin are great as the Delta Force teamleaders in some of the most enthusiastic action scenes you've ever seen in a war movie since WWII. Lee Marvin looks too old for the role of a hard as nails Delta Force soldier he was 62 at the time and looked like he was about 80 but his reputation as a tough guy easily made you overlook that fact. Delta Force was Lee's last movie.Chuck Norris was at the top of his game with his martial arts fighting chopping up the terrorists and his unbelievable motorbike that has machine guns mounted on it and rocket launched from it's front engines and back exhaust do they really have something like that in the US military? Chuck  Lee made the terrorists see what real redblooded American hero's can really do when they gets really psed off. George Kennedy was very good as Father O'Malley one of the passengers on the plane who showed the terrorists that his faith can withstand anything that they believe in any day of the week. There was so much Ham Acting on the plane it made the movie in spite of most of it's subjects political and religious feelings Arab and Israeli look treyfe unKosher in Yiddish. You just can't dislike Delta Force despite it's overthetop and unbelievable heroics on the part of the good guys because you just can't help rooting for them. As for the terrorists their so bad and vicious in what they do in the movie and so unlikeable that even their mothers would have a hard time finding anything good to say about them.The movie has a feel for that time the 1980's with the terrorist praising as well as having posters and pictures of the Ayatollah Khomeini who was the 1 enemy of America back in 1986 like Osama BinLaden is now. In fact it seems now after the tragic attacks of September 11 2001 that the movie Delta Force has gotten rediscovered by thousands of movie fans who want to see the terrorists who engineered that assault on America get theirs even if it's only in the movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Delta Force begins in the darkness of the Iranian desert at Desert One on April 25 1980 with the disastrous attempt to rescue the US hostages in Teheran. The movie then goes ahead to the summer of 1985 where a passenger plane with some 200 persons mostly Americans is skyjacked on a flight from Rome to Athens. It's there where the Delta Force redeems itself from what happened to it that dark April morning five years before. Based loosely on the TWA 847 skyjacking and brutal beating and murder of Navy diver Robert Stethem Delta Force takes some liberties on the historical facts of that event. Like the movies of WWII that were made to uplift the American public Delta Force far more succeeds then fails in it's message that it's was trying the bring to those here in the USA and elsewhere on Americas as well as the free worlds War on Terrorism back then in 1986. Admittedly overthetop heroics by the Delta Force especially Maj. McCoy  Col. Alexender Chuck Norris  Lee Marvin. Who I think is the real hero in the movie and in what really happened in real life on that plane is the planes German stewardess Ingrid Hanna Schygulia. Ingrid in real life showed more courage as well as kindness and humanity under pressure from the terrorists on the plane then the whole Delta Force combined showed in the make believe of the skyjacking and phony action scenes in the film. High tension and terror in the sky as well as on land as a passenger plane is skyjacked by a gang of Arab terrorists. The Terrorists are led by their leader AbdulRobert Foster who threatens to blow up the plane and passengers inside unless the Israelis releases hundreds of terrorist that they have incarcerated.Trying to get the terrorists to let at least the women and children go free the Delta Force tries to storm the plane when it lands in Algeria for refueling. At the same time there's a new group of terrorist entering the plane to reinforce those that are already there. Navy diver Pete Peterson William Wallace who was brutally beaten to the point where he was almost dead is shot in the head and dumped on the tarmac in retaliation of the Delta Force attempted rescue. It's when the plane lands in Beirut that the real action begins and it's there where the Delta force with the help of Israeli commandos save the day and in the end rack this one up for the good guys. Heart pounding and effective movie about the good guys giving it back to the terrorist in a movie that was made some 15 years ahead of it's time September 11 2001 that shows if you mess with Uncle Sam you'll only get burned in the end. Chuck Norris  Lee Marvin are great as the Delta Force teamleaders in some of the most enthusiastic action scenes you've ever seen in a war movie since WWII. Lee Marvin looks too old for the role of a hard as nails Delta Force soldier he was 62 at the time and looked like he was about 80 but his reputation as a tough guy easily made you overlook that fact. Delta Force was Lee's last movie.Chuck Norris was at the top of his game with his martial arts fighting chopping up the terrorists and his unbelievable motorbike that has machine guns mounted on it and rocket launched from it's front engines and back exhaust do they really have something like that in the US military?

	schema:reviewBody "Lee Marvin was one of the ultimate tough guys of the screen but it rather sad to reflect upon his final film The Delta Force. This patriotic mindnumbing unrealistic action flick is basically a wishfulfilment fantasy  the kind of film that teenage boys just love but people who value diplomacy and sensitivity find embarrassing to watch. The main problem is that this is not Marvin's film but instead yet another in the sequence of Chuck Norris vehicles from the '80s. Norris might have been a martial arts master but he is not a master of acting. and in this one his wooden performance coupled with the effortless manner with which he disposes of Middle Eastern terrorists drags the film down to the level of gungho trash.A plane from Athens to New York is hijacked by terrorists led by the fanatical Abdul Robert Forster. The plane is diverted to Beirut where its passengers find themselves at the mercy of their captors. The hijackers are unsettled when they learn that some of the passengers are Jews and separate those with Jewishsounding names from the other travellers. Meanwhile politicians race to find a diplomatic solution to the hijacking but seem unable to come up with the answers. Eventually it becomes apparent that there is no hope of the situation being solved peacefully so an antiterrorist team known as the Delta Force are brought in to liberate the captives. The Delta Force is led by Major Scott McCoy Norris and Colonel Nick Alexander Marvin. Their mission is twofold  on one hand they must free those held on the plane but they must also track down and rescue some other hostages who have been moved from the plane and are being held in secret locations around the city.The first section of the film in which the hijacking plot is covered is quite intriguing. Some of it is a little overwrought but at least the story progresses in a relatively believable factual manner. When Norris and his Delta Force enter the story things get significantly worse. The whole thing slips off into idiocy  culminating in a supremely silly finale in which Chuck wipes out bad guys with a missileloaded motorbike. The film is underscored with Alan Silvestri's monotonous and irritating music and directed with competence but indelicacy by Menahem Golan half of the GolanGlobus production team who financed this and countless other inferior action flicks for Cannon in the '80s. The political angle of the film is not really worth mentioning  it doesn't do much for Middle EasternAmerican relations but the whole thing is so immature and simplistic that noone could be seriously offended by it. Norris fans will probably like this as they love to see their man kicking butt and he does plenty of THAT in the film Marvin fans will probably look on in disappointment as the man who redefined tough in films like Point Blank and The Dirty Dozen is reduced to cartoonish fantasy such as this.".

Some surprise that Chuck Norris karateying PLO hijackers with the help of Israeli commandos and Lee Marvin wasn't warmly received by the media and academia. To sum up the key rules of the Limousine Liberals that the Delta Force violates is 1. Movies about terrorists are perfectly acceptable as long as they're not from the Middle East. So that leaves the no less evil but somewhat rarer Tim McVeigh and Neo Nazi Skinheads breed.2. If rule 1 is for any reason violated at least communicate to viewers the legitimate grievances of the insurgents rebels guerillas freedom fighters never terrorists. See the episode of the West Wing immediately following 911in which schoolchildren are told that the Arab street is basically a counterpart to American innercity ghettos where teens are drawn to gangs because of the sense of pride and inclusion they provide amidst a place of poverty and racial injusticefor reference.3. It will be a wonderful day when schools have all the money they need and the military has to hold a bake sale to buy motorcycles with hellfire missiles and rearwardfiring mortars.4. For every 2 minutes of martial arts action at least 12 hour must be devoted to preaching nonviolence and respect for law and order. Or only 15 minutes if in the form of a Miyagistyle oriental wisdom scene. Norris finally got the message by Walker Texas Ranger.Not that this film is totally without appealing elements to those who didn't vote for BushCheney or Ariel Sharon. An especially bluestate friendly cast was prominent in several of the passenger sequences which one IMDb reviewer amusingly described as an episode of the Love Boat gone terribly wrong. I myself was waiting for Gopher to pop out at any moment! My girlfriend and I have a deal where for every 80s macho movie she sits through I have to watch 1 hour of Lifetime 1 episode of Gilmore Girls and her Friday night movie pick usually something with Meryl Streep or Sally Field.

Chuck Norris is the man that gets the job done opening up a can of W.A. for those nasty terrorists. Norris does a lot better when he's a part of a larger cast like this because his acting talent is not enough to carry a film by itself. The first half of the film is an exciting account of a terrorist hijacking aboard a plane characters being introduced and the illustration of the surrounding tension that would exist during such an encounter. Robert Forster effectively plays the menacing terrorist leader. The film deteriorates a bit in the second half when Norris along with his commander Lee Marvin in his very last film role enter the scene. Marvin lends an aura of credibility to whatever role he plays and there's no exception here. He balances Norris' bravado nicely limiting Norris' usual one man army routine to a few scenes. The action is good but turns cartoonlike somewhat with Norris so that any tension the film establishes in the first half dissipates in the second half. The soundtrack is annoying with the repetitive synthesizer typical of 1980's television. Still the film is consistently entertaining and it is one of Chuck Norris' better films. 12 of 4 stars.".

	schema:headline " Exciting!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Delta Force is an exciting action picture starring Chuck Norris in one of his best movie roles. The film is about an American airliner en route from Athens to Rome to New York that's hijacked by Middle Eastern terrorists which is loosely based on the reallife hijacking of a TWA jetliner in July 1985. This part of the film is terrifying. These hijackers mean business and they provide a lot of cruelty to some of the passengers and crew members. When the U.S. government gets word of the hijack they sent in The Delta Force a tough team of U.S. commandos led by Lee Marvin and Chuck Norris. Do they get the job done? You'll just have to see for yourself. The Delta Force is an excellent film because it delivers plenty of action plenty of suspense and plenty of realism. The movie also has an allstar cast. Besides Norris and Marvin The Delta Force also features Robert Forster a decade before winning an Oscar nomination for Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown in a very good performance as the lead terrorist Bo Svenson as the pilot of the hijacked airliner Hanna Schygulla as the head stewardess of the plane Robert Vaughn as a U.S. General who gives orders from the U.S. President to the Delta Force and Martin Balsam Joey Bishop Lainie Kazan Shelley Winters George Kennedy Susan Strasberg and Kim Delaney a decade before TV's NYPD Blue as terrified passengers on the hijacked plane. If your a fan of action movies you're going to like The Delta Force. 12 out of four".

Besides Norris and Marvin The Delta Force also features Robert Forster a decade before winning an Oscar nomination for Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown in a very good performance as the lead terrorist Bo Svenson as the pilot of the hijacked airliner Hanna Schygulla as the head stewardess of the plane Robert Vaughn as a U.S. General who gives orders from the U.S. President to the Delta Force and Martin Balsam Joey Bishop Lainie Kazan Shelley Winters George Kennedy Susan Strasberg and Kim Delaney a decade before TV's NYPD Blue as terrified passengers on the hijacked plane. If your a fan of action movies you're going to like The Delta Force. 12 out of four";

I think the fact that he was working with such a big cast his performance was rather inspired the actors probably would've given him tips to make his acting better maybe. Lee Marvin's last film but a film u will always remember him by. Good to see other famous old timers like martin balsam Shelley winters George Kennedy and Robert Vaughn. Robert Forster is suburb as the villain of the film. Steve James is also one of the greats who sadly died 7 years after the film. Its got a great background score that although at times is repetitive is never annoying and always raises spirits. In a way a think the film is a tribute to Lee Marvin he is a class act at playing tough guys and his final performance of his life shows that. The final seen where they arrive back in Israel is very emotional and when u see the friendship between Norris and Marvin as they take off and then u have the classic music to go with it. An All time classic.".

Delta force is charged with saving the passengers of a hijacked airliner who are transported from Greece to Middle East . Standard actionpacked picture  plenty of blowup  derringdo and fast moving . The film has frenetic action  shoot'em up and spectacular set pieces and for that reason is fun . This is a straightforward ActionAdventureDramaThrillerWar movie which is best described as Dirty Dozen in airport and based on the reallife hijacking of TWA Flight 847 on 14 June 1985 . It is tense and exciting  at time bemusing and with quite budget . Uneven picture  however being entertaining  amusing and never tiring . Extraordinary plethora of secondary actors such as Martin Balsam  Lainie Kazan  Joey Bishop  Shelley Winters  Robert Forster  Susan Strasberg  Bo Svenson  Robert Vaughan and Eric Norris Chuck Norris' reallife son is seen as one of the U.S. Navy divers taken hostage . Exciting rescue climax but realized in cartoon style  to say the least  with spectacular but silly action scenes . The film was originally to be produced with the cooperation of Delta Force's reallife founder and original commanding officer Col. Charles Beckwith  the producers wanted to tell the story of Operation Eagle Claw the failed attempt to rescue the American hostages from Iran in 1979 but they wanted to change the story so that Delta Force completed their mission successfully and Colonel Beckwith left the project in disgust . Atmospheric and functional cinematography by David Gurfinkel filmed in BenGurion International Airport Tel Aviv West Bank Israel  Ellinikon Airport Athens Greece  GG Israel Studios Jerusalem Haifa Israel  Washington District of Columbia Pentagon Exteriors . Commercial and catching musical score composed by means of synthesizer by Alan Silvestri including lively leitmotif whose theme was later used by ABC Sports for the opening of the Indy 500.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I do love 'The Delta Force' perhaps because it was a favourite of mine as a child or maybe because it's sometimes relaxing to watch a flick which is very rigid in dividing people into black and white good and evil and the main focus is providing the audience with plenty of action.Very loosely based on the truelife 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847 'The Delta Force' sees an airliner bound for America being taken over by Palestinian terrorists who demand the flight be diverted to Beirut. While the real life event led to the Israeli government being forced to release Islamic political prisoners to appease the hijackers the hostages on this flight have Chuck Norris to sort everything out. As the hijackers are threatening to kill passengers the US military send in the elite Delta Force a team of highlytrained commando led by Colonel Alexander Lee Marvin and his secondincommand Major McCoy Chuck to retake the plane by force.This is a film that won't win any prizes for being politically correct since the Islamic terrorists are blatantly depicted to have not one redeeming attribute and are instead nothing more than abusive greedy thugs who think nothing of slapping around women and hitting old men. That said surprisingly Hanna Schygulla and George Kennedy in roles as an air hostess and priest respectively do give good performances in portraying the idea that not all heroes show their might with guns and martial arts. And there is a saddening insight until Chuck arrives on the scene of what it is to be on a hijacked plane as loved ones are separated and people are left fearing for their life and the lives of their loved ones.However with Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin in the lead roles it's obvious from the start that this will be a film primarily involving gungho behaviour and overthetop action from the allAmerican heroes. Emotion is shoved to the side to make way for the guns explosions and karate. My favourite example is a scene that sees two or three cars carrying terrorists armed to the teeth and ready for killing only to be stopped by Chuck dressed in black on his motorbike with a brooding glare! That and how our team are able to rescue onehundredfortyfour people some of whom are strewn across various areas of Buirut with only two casualties lost on the good guys and Innocent's' team.Overall though this film can be quite enjoyable if not taking seriously and is instead treated like the Eighties action flick it is. And in these postSeptember 11th times there is something rather uplifting about the idea that there would be a crack team of specialists able to rescue hostages and shoot the bad guys without breaking a sweat. Certainly it's almost haunting to reminisce of the days when hostages onboard hijacked planes only had to worry about was when they would get home for dinner rather than whether they panicking over the fear their plane is going to be rammed into a building killing them and many others.".

After reading a couple of reviews and seeing it's neatlooking video cover I decided to watch The Delta Force.After watching I didn't get all that I expected. Well it does have the hardhitting action but it lacks the drama from the allstar supporting cast including Martin Balsam Shelley Winters George Kennedy Lainie Kazan and Susan Strasberg. I expected that since the film has an stellar supporting cast like a disaster film I expected it to have a dramatic turn. But since this is Hollywood and it has Chuck Norris on topbilling it just has to end with good ol' Chuck kicking some Lebanese terrorists' butt! But as it turned outThe Delta Force is corny cheesy 80's action entry with lots of cheese poured over it. Chuck Norris is not the onearmy he usually is. He teams up with Lee Marvin and the results are really compelling. The formula of two although not always as effective as the GibsonGlover partnership in Lethal Weapon is fun to look at. The first half is the only real thing you can take seriously as some of the depictions of hijacking oneminded as it is is actually frighteningly realistic. The secondhalf was allout cheesy that it should come with crackers. Alan Silvestri completes the lunacy with his cheesy 80's score that you might find yourself humming after you see it. Don't be so surprised. Rating  out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name but for those looking for the novel while waiting for the movie to reappear on television or on order from Amazon don't bother unless you're a fan of Elmore Leonard's work. While Mr. Leonard should be given more than due credit for his adaptation to movie the real work was done by Mr. Reynolds who plays the character true to form.I have to admit that one reason I love this film is because of its leading lady. Ms. Bergen seems to be able to play her own character in this film rather than playing off Burt's character. Two of the best scenes are the one where she sums up the movie producer's porposal as fraud and of course the intimate scene in her bedroom with Burt's character.I am old enough to remember when this movie came out in the theaters. One review in a popular men's magazine at the time panned the movie largely faulting Burt's performance as I interpreted the review.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name but for those looking for the novel while waiting for the movie to reappear on television or on order from Amazon don't bother unless you're a fan of Elmore Leonard's work. While Mr. Leonard should be given more than due credit for his adaptation to movie the real work was done by Mr. Reynolds who plays the character true to form.I have to admit that one reason I love this film is because of its leading lady. Ms. Bergen seems to be able to play her own character in this film rather than playing off Burt's character. Two of the best scenes are the one where she sums up the movie producer's porposal as fraud and of course the intimate scene in her bedroom with Burt's character.I am old enough to remember when this movie came out in the theaters. One review in a popular men's magazine at the time panned the movie largely faulting Burt's performance as I interpreted the review. Having been a fan of Mr. Reynolds films for many years I was glad to see that he didn't seem to take such reviews to heart at the time and continues to entertain us even today.";

Reynolds gives an excellent performance as always. Charles Durning is quite good as Chucky but is let down by the very obvious wig he is wearing for the part at least I HOPE it's a wig. George Segal and Candice Bergen are both good as well but it's strange how Reynolds and Bergen immediately get into a romance.Stuntman Dar Robinson also makes a memorable villain as albino hitman Moke. Since he was a stuntman I guess that means he did all his own stunts for the movie which makes it even more cool. Very few stuntmen are good actors but Robinson plays the part well. The only problem is we don't see enough of him. The BIG bad guy Nester is played brilliantly too but the actor's name escapes me right now. There's also a lovely song played over the end credits. I'm interested in reading the Elmore Leonard book this film was based on. I'm sure it and the film may be very different but I still give the movie STICK a thumbsup. I think it should get a DVD release.".

I admit that it has flaws like Candice Bergen's wooden performance. But it has two great acting jobs by Charles Durning and the late stuntman Dar Robinson as the albino hitman Moke. His performance is truly terrifying. It is terrific when Burt taunts him as Bunny Eyes. Durning is also great as a red haired drug dealer.

Whilst some of the comments are fair I think it's important to take into context the life of this film. Another user has already pointed out that Reynolds was suffering with TMJ at the time of the release and had a few flops before hand so his star was on the wane. However this movie was supposed to have been released in 1984 and initial filming judging by many scenes indicate Reynolds was in good health. Somehow the studio didn't like the first cut of the filmnot enough actiontoo slownot good for box office. However the film as a character piece may well have been quite interesting and judging by the first 15 minutes which were excellentless studio meddling would have more beneficial in this case. Reynolds did not want to make an all out action film but the studios panicked and asked for reshoots. By this time though Reynolds had lost a lot of weight due to the TMJ problems and was clearly neither in the physical or mental state to shoot these extra scenes. As a result we have a number of scenes where Reynolds is markedly thinner than in other scenes. This creates a very disjointed look and obviously doesn't help the film at all. It would be very interesting to see the original cut as Reynolds intended  i'm certain it would have ended up being a far better movie than the result we got. As it stands I think Stick has some very good moments and some very substandard moments. The good are the first 15 minutesespecially the scene with MokeyRainy and Stick in the van  nice tense atmosphere in the van well directed. Other good scenes are when Stick has to remove the exdriver from the party 'now say goodnight' as he poured gasoline over his face and flicks out a lighter the mokey death scene a superb stunt and not bettered for many yearsthe scenes with Candice Bergen and Burt i thought they quite effective. The substandard are the poor editing healthy Burt v.ill Burt..it's very obvious.Some of the action scenesespecially where sticks stops and waits for mokey to catch up? the training sequences  why show that is this Rocky..bit of vanity for Mr Reynolds there i think. The ending was a bit weak..i don't think it was originally intended to be like that  i haven't read the book so i could be wrong but again we had ill Burt in this scene. In conclusion this movie could have been a lot better that it was but due to a number of circumstances it turned out to be an fairly average Burt Reynolds thriller. Could have been another Sharkeys but not meant to be. A shame really now where is that original cut?".

At any rate the story I liked there was enough to keep me 'into it'. Even though I like a lot of different movies I don't like every movie I see. This was a rightcut for Burt Reynolds I thought. He pulled the character off in the manner in which he does in 'waves'. He's had monotone performances and out and out wild ones too. Whatever the critics think or say there was a great cast and the location was perfect as well. I can live with this Burtdirected story from 1985 heck why not it was the eighties.".

There's always something very satisfying about watching Burt kick ass so even if I was wondering why anyone would want to trade Leonard's smart and funny writing for a runofthemill action script I still enjoyed the finale of Stick.Still the Ernest Stickley from the novel called for the more lighthearted Burt from SemiTough Hooper and Rough Cut. I would have loved to have heard Burt deliver some of the smartass lines Leonard wrote for the character in the novel. Also some scenes just don't make a whole lot of sense now like Stick wanting to learn about investments from Kyle or the movie pitch scene. Both of these were pivotal in the book but just go nowhere in the film.There's a lot of good stuff though. The scene on the balcony is awesome the scorpions were a nice touch not in the book! and I liked the way the murder in the beginning was handled with Stick's subsequent getaway through the corn field.If you like Burt Reynolds Stick is certainly worth your time just don't expect a faithful adaptation.".

Can he survive or will his mouth get the rest of his body in a lot more trouble? Based on the book by Elmore Leonard this is a fair film for the mid 80's I only had two complaints with the entire movie. Complaint number 1 We had to wait until about the 40 minute mark before Candice even shows up! While I found her performance to be slightly sub par it was a treat to see this gem of a woman spice things up a bit. Complaint number 2 I did not like the way we went from tons of speedy action to virtually NOTHING! Then it picks up again. The very cool ending satisfies and makes it all worth while easily forgiving director Burt Reynolds from any of the imperfections the film has. Charles Durning makes a great performance as Chucky and Barry will sure to keep you laughing with his cheesy one liner jokes! I recommend an evening with Stick it's one of the buried treasures of the 80's and I think it's worth recovering.".

	schema:reviewBody "After failing to attract audiences with the comedies Stroker Ace and City Heat Burt Reynolds apparently thought that a tough and gritty movie based on an Elmore Leonard novel would help him make a comeback. But the movie didn't even gross a third of its budget back at the box office and Reynolds downward spiral continued. Seen today it's pretty easy to figure out why audiences weren't that attracted to the movie. It does get off to a decent start however. The first half hour though a little slow is mildly interesting as we see what events will influence the title character to get revenge. However after that half hour the movie slowly becomes slower and slower and eventually Stick seems to be doing NOTHING in order to get his revenge. There are other problems with the story as well. The love subplot with Candice Bergen could easily be cut out without harming the rest of the movie. And the character of Stick's daughter only seems to be in the movie so that near the end she can be... oh you guessed it?The character with the most problems however is Reynolds' Stick character. Certainly the writing makes the character inactive for much of the running time but Reynolds' performance is very bland and passionless. This is probably due to Reynolds in real life struggling to recover from grave injuries suffered during filming City Heat Whatever the reason he is not very compelling in his acting. However the movie is sparked by the performances of the supporting cast including George Segal Charles Durning Alex Rocco and stuntman Dar Robinson.In the end while I will say the movie is not as bad as many critics have made it out to be I will also say the movie is still not very satisfying whether you are a fan of Reynolds or novelist Elmore Leonard. I would only recommend it to very patient viewers who are interested in what a mix of Burt Reynolds and Miami Vice would play out like.".

We're not entirely convinced that it isn't a woman's jacket.But the real star of the show is Charles Durning as Chucky. In a role like no other we've seen Durning interpret he plays a Rip Taylorlike villain complete with loud shirts and bizarre makeup. Durning steals the movie but George Segal gives him a run for his money with his big boisterous role as Barry.While Burt is as laconic as ever in front of the camera he does a good competent job behind it clearly influenced by the popularity of Miami Vice. But the movie is a lengthy production with a very mainstream look. It needed more grit. It also should have been shorter and snappier.

The bulk of the blame must be rested upon Burt Reynolds' shoulders for in choosing to direct the film himself he has reduced it to the level of a vanity project. This is not Stick as envisaged by Elmore Leonard this is DIRECTOR Reynolds trying to make ACTOR Reynolds look as handsome tough and humorous as possible..... and in the process of doing so ruining the excellent potential of the source material. What makes matters worse is that other fine actors have been dragged down too. George Segal and Charles Durning are humiliated by the dumb lines they are asked to say the ridiculous costumes they are asked to wear and the overacting they are asked to indulge in. Spare a thought too for Candice Bergen  already a star in two of THE alltime clunkers The Magus and The Adventurers  who here finds herself yet again stranded in a film of unbelievable awfulness.Tough excon Ernest Stick Stickley Reynolds arrives in Miami soon after his release from jail. He reunites with Rainy Jose Perez a former Puerto Rican cellmate who is trying to make a little money by running errands for the local drug lords. Rainy persuades Stick against the latter's better judgement to accompany him on a dropoff in the Everglades. Stick doesn't like the look of the deal but he tags along anyway. His suspicions prove founded when Rainy is gunned down at the rendezvous point leaving Stick to make a desperate getaway. Upset at the brutal slaying of his pal Stick plans his revenge. His vengeance quest pits him against albino hitman Moke Dar Robinson paranoid drug dealer Chucky Charles Durning and voodooworshipping crimelord Nestor Castulo Guerra.A film with a plot like this and a gallery of slimy underworld characters should at the very least not be boring. However Stick is an absolute bore for virtually its entire duration. The opening ten minutes provide a very mild amount of wit and excitement but as soon as Stick escapes from Rainy's assassins in the Everglades sequence it's downhill all the way. Dar Robinson's character  the albino killer Moke  is quite interesting but is used far too infrequently he does at least have a spectacular death scene near the film's climax. The music by Barry DeVorzon is terribly dated and fails to add any dramatic impact to the onscreen action. Reynolds the director seems to have lost interest in the film somewhere along the way and the whole sorry affair limps towards its soulless conclusion without generating any interest that might relieve the sense of boredom. After this debacle Reynolds stopped directing his own movies for a period of 8 years eventually making a directorial comeback with 1993's The Man From Left Field. Stick this one on the trash heap!".

Maybe not as effective and complete but still acceptable time filler. The story is penned by the reliable Elmore Leonard who has a knack for building crime and character interactions within a busy framework. That's were I found it to peter out at times as there seems too be so much going on and from that it can get a little distracted. It starts off strong but then it goes wayward and stalls too often. Reynolds' sober direction seemed rather uneven in trying to balance out the explosively grimy moments with the uneasy comic relief. The film was more character driven likeable relationships are struck or quick fuses erupt and held together by its plot developments but the script just didn't bite hard enough and its ending is quite lousy. Gladly the performances standup namely that of the support cast. Where the bad guys are truly vile. Dar Robinson who's mainly a stuntman is magnificently threatening as the albino hired killer. A true scene stealer. While he hands out some nasty punishment and the gravel voice strikes fear. Alone just looking at him is frightening enough. Charles Durning playing a scummy lowlife crook sticks out with his loud bright Hawaiian shirts feathered hair and wild bushy eyebrows. It's hard to take your eyes off either one. Leading the way in the bad guys is a dashing Castulo Guerra. You know the man with the power the one you don't want to get on the wrong side of. To go with that he's quite spiritual but with a meanstreak. Burt Reynolds' character finds himself stuck in the middle of this trio when after getting out of prison he joins a buddy on job involving some of Miami's lowlife criminals. However it's a setup where his friend is killed and he is soon targeted. So he seeks payback but on the other side of the coin he wants to go straight so he can catch up with daughter. Reynolds plays it with that laconically tough shade and knowing attitude letting his charm carry him along. His weapon of choice seems to be his smartarse lines physical wise gasoline or matches that you only get disappointed when he can't get a hold of one of these objects. The next best thing was death by scorpion. Another scene stealer would be George Segal as a cheerfully nave millionaire that loves the company of criminals. Some sequences with him were priceless. Also showing up is Candice Bergen the love interest Jose Perez and Alex Rocco. Clunky but amusing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw this last night for the first time ever and it really brought back memories of South Florida in the early to mid eighties. The same memories when I saw Paul Newman's Harry  Son also filmed nearby in Fort Lauderdale. The soundtrack in Stick is the precursor for Miami Vice the series. Once Burt shaves off the bear he even conveys that Sonny Crockett feel and hey! he's rooming w his own black buddy. The Grove Tower condo building is the one and same used in the classic 80's Wham! music video with the closing shot being George Michael standing on the topfloor balcony lamenting his lost love or something.Having lived in Miami during the filming of Stick there are some funny lapses I noticed like when the Albino follows Burt as they drive East on the causeway but then they're at Miami JaiAlai which is located West of the causeway. Or earlier in the movie when Burt and his Boricua friend drive to meet Moxie one second they're at Nurty's in Fort Liquordale and then the next second in Coconut Grove the two places are twentyfive miles apart. Regarding the movie it's story is all right nothing groundbreaking but a good Elmore Leonard expose of the assorted types dealing drugs and living large in the 1980's South Florida.It's a shame George Segal wasn't part of a last act twist but the villain Burt goes up against was pretty creepy himself. The character of Stick's daughter Katie could have had some impact in the last scenes but she wasn't written that way. Durning as Moxie is a hoot! The red eyebrows and red wig are too funny! The rest of the Spanishspeaking cast gives good support to the story and a strong sense of place. Burt's direction is seamless and professional. Trivia note in 1989 BOTH George Segal and Candice Bergen premiered new series on TV. Segal's was Murphy's Law and if you blink you missed it. Bergen's ... well if you don't remember the iconic status her protagonist reached during the '92 presidential race courtesy of Dan Quayle then you must have blinked for eight years worth of time.".

Regarding the movie it's story is all right nothing groundbreaking but a good Elmore Leonard expose of the assorted types dealing drugs and living large in the 1980's South Florida.It's a shame George Segal wasn't part of a last act twist but the villain Burt goes up against was pretty creepy himself. The character of Stick's daughter Katie could have had some impact in the last scenes but she wasn't written that way. Durning as Moxie is a hoot! The red eyebrows and red wig are too funny! The rest of the Spanishspeaking cast gives good support to the story and a strong sense of place. Burt's direction is seamless and professional. Trivia note in 1989 BOTH George Segal and Candice Bergen premiered new series on TV. Segal's was Murphy's Law and if you blink you missed it. Bergen's ... well if you don't remember the iconic status her protagonist reached during the '92 presidential race courtesy of Dan Quayle then you must have blinked for eight years worth of time.";

	schema:reviewBody "The alwaysoverrated David McCallum is one of the few good things in this lowbudget World War II adventure piece yet another quickie from Oakmont Films.Sometime prior to DDay  probably early '44 or '43  a Mosquito Squadron is sent to bomb a V1 rocket installation in France when Squadron Leader Scott David Buck is shot down and presumed dead. His secondincommand Quint Munroe who just happens to be like a lifelong brother to him has to return to England and tell his beautiful blonde wife Suzanne Neve the sad news. As one would expect Munroe and Mrs. Scott slowly fall in love. But when Munroe is chosen to lead a mission to bomb a new V3 development center things will chance quite a bit  because Scott is a prisoner held at the target fortress!From start to finish Mosquito Squadron is a total hackjob  literally. The story is filled with enough contrivances and clichs to drive any mildly serious critic mad. Let us take a brief look at a 1964 film entitled 633 Squadron. In said film a squadron commander has a best friend shot down over Norway and falls in love with his sister. Later on he is assigned to bomb the fortress where his friend is being held. Sound familiar? And that's not all our title film steals! Virtually all of the aerial battle footage is directly lifted from 633 Squadron while the new footage is comprised almost entirely of horriblelooking miniatures hanging from fartoovisible wires.The writers have also directly copied another classic war film The Dam Busters. The feasibility of Munroe's mission revolves around a bouncing bomb which will skip along the ground and roll into an open tunnel leading to the V3 rockets. I won't even mention how convenient it was to leave a big open tunnel to drop a bomb into. The real bouncing bomb made famous in 1954's The Dam Busters was designed to skip on water to destroy Nazi dams  not the ground as is seen here! The idea of dropping a bouncing bomb on the ground is simply ludicrous and impossible. Introduction of this concept kills the storyline immediately.The low budget shows up in every action sequence the French resistance force is comprised of a halfdozen men in berets carrying Sten guns and only a handful of German guards enforce security at the fortress. The forests are obviously cheaply furnished soundstages and a faceoff with an imitation German tank is ludicrously shot. We never really see much of the Germanheld Chteau and when we do it never looks as though we're inside some hightech development center a la Operation Crossbow. The scenes set in England fare somewhat better with some excellent scenes set at airfields and a rather rowdy officer's club.David McCallum and the cast of littleknown English actors do a fair job even though the nofrills script doesn't give them much to do. McCallum is a fair actor nowhere near as great as his fans hail him to be though. He was better suited for television than cinema and that comes out in every scene. He often looks uncomfortable and awkward but delivers his often banal dialog convincingly and with conviction. His scenes with Neve are often touching even though audiences have seen this dozens of times before. There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film Diamonds are Forever a few years later.Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s Attack on the Iron Coast Hell Boats The Last Escape The One Thousand Plane Raid among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here  or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter  is in for a big disappointment. Check out 633 Squadron instead.".

There aren't any other actors worth mention among the ensemble besides perhaps Charles Gray who would go on to play Blofeld in the James Bond film Diamonds are Forever a few years later.Oakmont Productions financed a number of cheap British war films in the late 1960s and early 1970s Attack on the Iron Coast Hell Boats The Last Escape The One Thousand Plane Raid among them. These quickies were best suited for TV viewing instead of theatrical release but United Artists picked them all up and put them on the big screen. Anyone expecting a classic here  or in any of the aforementioned pieces for that matter  is in for a big disappointment. Check out 633 Squadron instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mosquito Sqaudron is a pleasant surprise. An unashamedly lowbudget WWII flick with some classically cheesy comedic scenes. The script for Mosuito Sqaudron closely resembles the Mosquitos themselves  wooden and full of holes. Hey but that doesn't really matter. Nothing quite puts a smile on your face like watching David McCallum and his costar driving through the English countryside without a brush of wind disturbing their hair in near perfect studiobound silence. Another giggle is the RAF pilot who is missing his right arm but has an alarmingly large bulge concealed under his shirt on the upper right hand side. However my personal favourite is the ultracamp photo of Qunit and Scotty in their tennis whites. This chummy photo appears throughout the film including Scotty's parents house and on Scotty's work desk in place of his wedding photo. Anyway asides from these cherry 60's subtleties there is a pulsing love triangle to follow and some impressive weaponry to be dazzled by Our man Quint is torn by his brooding love for Beth his best buddy's wife and guiltridden by the knowledge that he may have to drop a giant bouncing Indiarubber ball on Scotty's POW camp that may flatten his best tennis buddy for once and for all. So who will win out at the end of the day? Will Quint score his best buddy's wife as his new trophy? Or will Scotty serve his last ace in the POW camp? Will anyone care? Probably not. The action in the movie reminds me a little of a Ben Stiller  Owen Wilson action flick. Maybe it's the 'Zoolander' type head band that Scotty wears. The fighting is definitely as camp and clumsy and the tomato sauce is definitely overdone. Thankfully the real Battle of Britain was not entrusted to these bumbling few or else we'd all be speaking German by now.Anyone for tennis?".

Nothing quite puts a smile on your face like watching David McCallum and his costar driving through the English countryside without a brush of wind disturbing their hair in near perfect studiobound silence. Another giggle is the RAF pilot who is missing his right arm but has an alarmingly large bulge concealed under his shirt on the upper right hand side. However my personal favourite is the ultracamp photo of Qunit and Scotty in their tennis whites. This chummy photo appears throughout the film including Scotty's parents house and on Scotty's work desk in place of his wedding photo. Anyway asides from these cherry 60's subtleties there is a pulsing love triangle to follow and some impressive weaponry to be dazzled by Our man Quint is torn by his brooding love for Beth his best buddy's wife and guiltridden by the knowledge that he may have to drop a giant bouncing Indiarubber ball on Scotty's POW camp that may flatten his best tennis buddy for once and for all. So who will win out at the end of the day? Will Quint score his best buddy's wife as his new trophy? Or will Scotty serve his last ace in the POW camp? Will anyone care? Probably not. The action in the movie reminds me a little of a Ben Stiller  Owen Wilson action flick. Maybe it's the 'Zoolander' type head band that Scotty wears. The fighting is definitely as camp and clumsy and the tomato sauce is definitely overdone. Thankfully the real Battle of Britain was not entrusted to these bumbling few or else we'd all be speaking German by now.Anyone for tennis?";

	schema:reviewBody "I like this movie even though it is not the best air movie made.Contrary to what Sgt Slaughter has said the Highball bouncing bomb depicted in the movie did actually exist and was capable of being used against tunnels though its primary role was antishipping. The monochrome footage of the Mosquito test dropping a Highball on land which is used in the film is genuine footage from WW2.However the Highball could only be fitted to bomber versions of the Mosquito. The Mosquitoes used in the film were supposed to be FBVI fighter  bomber versions with nose guns and short bomb bays which could not be fitted with Highball. Also fitting of Highball necessitated removal of the bomb bay doors and the film Mosquitoes supposedly carry Highball inside their bomb bays.The worst feature of the filmas pointed out by other reviewers  was the excessive use of footage from 633 Squadron. Despite thisfour genuine airworthy Mosquitoes were used in the production. A fifth Mosquito which was in a damagednonairworthy conditionwas used in the crash scene at th end. This particular Mosquito can now be seen at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford. Three of the four airworthy Mosquitoes used in the film still exist while the fourth Mosquito T3 RR299which was the last airworthy Mosquito in the Worldwas destroyed in a flying accident in 1996.The credit sequences of the film feature four Mosquitoes flying in formation. This was the last time that four Mosquitoes flew together.I am always amused by the scene where David McCallum's character comments on the apparently large amount of flak defending a chteau when in fact it is one 20mm Oerlikon Twin mount and a single light machine gun.".

Character actor George Layton he of the famous British 'Doctor'comedy TV series mentions this was his first film role. Nice to see the pretty Suzanne Neve as Scotty's 'widow' Beth but not a lot to remember this for EXCEPT as I've said its stealing of 633 Squadron's scenes!".

So when I saw this on the queue for Netflix I thought I had to see itespecially since I am familiar with the famed fighterbomber the Mosquito. It was an amazingly able and agile planeone of the best of the war though it's seldom talked about today.David McCallum stars in this film. If the name isn't familiar he was one of the stars of the 1960s show The Man From UNCLE. Unfortunately he really wasn't given a personality in the filmhe was there but not much more.The story is about a Mosquito squadron. Their job will now be to bomb a rocket production facility. However it will take absolute precision bombing using very odd bouncing bombsmuch like smaller versions of the ones used to blow up the dams in the Ruhr Valley for more on that see the excellent film Dam Busters. But there's a hitchthe Germans are anticipating it and have moved all the shot down Mosquito crews to this locationdaring the Brits to carry out this raid and kill their own men.The action is generally good but due to a lack of availability the German fighters are actually slowmoving transportobservation planes. At times some of these planes are models and move in impossible ways.And considering how much better the flying sequences were in The Battle of Britain also 1969 I could see how this film might have been overshadowed. There also is a bit of predictability towards the endwith a few clichs among the escaped prisoners. Overall a decent movie that's worth watching but also one that is far from a mustsee.".

It was an amazingly able and agile planeone of the best of the war though it's seldom talked about today.David McCallum stars in this film. If the name isn't familiar he was one of the stars of the 1960s show The Man From UNCLE. Unfortunately he really wasn't given a personality in the filmhe was there but not much more.The story is about a Mosquito squadron. Their job will now be to bomb a rocket production facility. However it will take absolute precision bombing using very odd bouncing bombsmuch like smaller versions of the ones used to blow up the dams in the Ruhr Valley for more on that see the excellent film Dam Busters. But there's a hitchthe Germans are anticipating it and have moved all the shot down Mosquito crews to this locationdaring the Brits to carry out this raid and kill their own men.The action is generally good but due to a lack of availability the German fighters are actually slowmoving transportobservation planes. At times some of these planes are models and move in impossible ways.And considering how much better the flying sequences were in The Battle of Britain also 1969 I could see how this film might have been overshadowed. There also is a bit of predictability towards the endwith a few clichs among the escaped prisoners. Overall a decent movie that's worth watching but also one that is far from a mustsee.";

	schema:reviewBody "633 Squadron producer Lewis J. Rachmil let Girl Happy director Boris Sagal recycle exciting aerial combat footage from 633 Squadron for his generic World War II thriller Mosquito Squadron starring David McCallum and Charles Gray. This lackluster epic combines elements of 1964's 633 Squadron principally the plywood built De Havilland Mosquito fighterbombers with 1954's The Dam Busters with a bouncing bomb designed to destroy a top secret German weapons facility. The Germans are developing the V3 rocket and British Intelligence has located the site in the French countryside at the Chteau de Charlon. Air Commodore Hufford Charles Gray of The Rocky Horror Picture Show assigns Squadron Leader Quint Munro David McCallum of The Great Escape to bomb it with special ordinance. This lowbudget melodrama set in England and France has very little to recommend it. Again 90 percent of the shots of Mosquitoes winging their way over enemy country were appropriated from Walter E. Grauman's classic 633 Squadron. The prefabricated screenplay by Donald S. Sanford and Joyce Perry antes up one surprise but everything else is formula served up without verve.Our British heroes are streaking toward their target a V2 rocket launching pad on the French coast as Mosquito Squadron opens using footage from Michael Anderson's Operation Crossbow. Incidentally Anderson directed The Dam Busters too. The British destroy the missile launching ramp but a flight of Messerschmidts blow Squadron Leader David 'Scotty' Scott David Buck of The Mummy's Shroud out of the sky. Quint Munro spots no parachute and assumes 'Scotty' is kaput. Scotty's death elevates Quint to Squadron Leader. Worse our protagonist has lost a friend who was as close to him as a brother. Scotty and Quint grew up together because Quint's parents died and Scotty's parents raised him. Quint even handed off one of his former girlfriends Beth Suzanne Neve of Bunny Lake Is Missing who wound up marrying Scotty. After a reasonable period of mourning Beth and Quint take long bicycle rides in the country.Air Commodore Hufford sends Quint off on a reconnaissance mission to photograph the Chteau de Charlon where the British believe the Germans are developing a V3. V2 rockets are falling on London and wrecking havoc. Hufford shows Quint some film footage of a bomb that bounces on any terrain no mean feat. In real life the bomb was the genuine article and was called a 'Highball' and had been designed to use on battlewagons like the Tirpitz. Meanwhile now that the Germans know the British are interested in Chteau they drop a canister of film which shows that they have gathered British POWs as hostages against any bombing runs. The revelation that Scotty is among those prisoners shocks Quint. Security prevents him from telling Beth about it. Initially nobody wants to give the Germans a propaganda coup by killing their own men. Quint devises a way to kill two birds with one stone. Not only will they destroy the laboratory tucked into an underground facility with the 'Highball' bomb but also they will breach the wall at the Chteau so the French Resistance can storm the Chteau. The closest thing to a villain in Mosquito Squadron is a German Lieutenant named Schack Vladek Sheybal of From Russia with Love who suspects that the Allies prisoners are plotting something when they all turn out for mass on a Sunday especially when some of them aren't Catholic. The suspicious Sheybal shows his villainy when shoots a Catholic priest with a machine gun. The POWs overpower their guards and fortify themselves in the chapel as the Mosquitoes appear to bomb the premises.Quint and his Mosquito Squadron destroy the underground facility but our hero has to crash his plane. Once on the ground Quint runs into Scotty but Scotty cannot remember his own identity and he sacrifices his life heroically by blowing up a German tank with a bazooka after several others have tried and failed. A wounded Quint makes it back to England and reunites with Beth. As it turns out Beth never learned that her late husband survived the crash only to die in France as a casualty of a combined British  French Resistance operation. There is a subplot about Beth's younger brother who has to show the film that the Germans have dropped for the benefit of our heroes. When he threatens to spill the beans about Scotty the authorities lock him up for the duration.Mosquito Squadron qualifies as a hack attempt to cash in on 633 Squadron Operation CrossBow and The Dam Busters. Boris Sagal made a couple of memorable movies and television shows but Mosquito Squadron isn't among them. Worse Mosquito Squadron was cranked out by Oakmont Productions which ground out several cheapjack World War II thrillers including another Sagal saga The OneThousand Plane Raid The Last Escape Hell Boats and Submarine X1. These movies ranked as halfbaked epics with neither a shred of atmosphere nor credibility. Sagal has to stage several shots on a studio set principally the drive in the country that Quint and Beth take in his red roadster to see Scotty's bereaved parents has our stars seated in an automobile mockup with scenery back projected behind them. Sagal generates neither suspense nor sense of urgency. The cast walk through their roles like automatons delivering uninspired dialogue written by Sanford who went on to write the equally lackluster Midway and Joyce Perry who wrote teleplays for juvenile television shows like Land of the Lost. McCallum gets the best line in the movie when Hufford asks him about the odds of the mission succeeding About the same as spitting in an Air Commodore's eye from an express train sir. In Mosquito Squadron Suzanne Neve and McCallum never generate any chemistry so it is difficult to believe that they love each other. Mind you it is always a pleasure to watch David McCallum act but Mosquito Squadron gives him very little to do.".

Very odd. I suspect someone else with a more American accent like Cliff Robertson in 633 Squadron was supposed to have had the role and David McCallum was a last minute replacement.There is a scene where David McCallum actually crawl out of a wrecked and burning Mosquito  which at first I thought was also a scene lifted from the other Mosquito film. I do hope they didn't also wreck a Mosquito for this film as they did in the other film. What a waste!The film begins with scenes lifted from Operation Crossbow.Note There was actually a real and quite well known Mosquito raid in 1944 on Amiens prison in France to liberate important French resistance prisoners where they breached the wall as they did in this film  though not with BarnesWallace bombs.

Well I can truly say I found this movie uplifting inspiring and joyful.  Timothy Dalton Bancroft and Anthony Edwards Deck are wonderful in their respective roles of the two cancer patients who decide to enjoy themselves while they still can.

Granted it is not as good as Nest was however it is not nearly as horrid as Patch Adams so I say it is closer to Cuckoo's Nest than the other. I mainly compare it to Patch as the two lead gentlemen in this film have a terminal illness and they try to cope with it and do so in a humorous way at times. They are thankfully spared someone who is perfectly fine telling jokes and making light of the situation. The film is about two terminally ill guys who are in a hospital in I believe London. One is an American and the other does seem to be a resident of London. At first the American is kind of down in the dumps but the other guy named Bancroft and played by Dalton tries to get him to loosen up. At one point he even wheels him onto the roof of the building. They both finally get out of the hospitals clutches and proceed to live life to the fullest with the little time they have left. On the way to their final destination a brothel in Amsterdam they come across two ladies whom they attach to and the four begin to have fun. Unfortunately the American's illness does seem to be taking hold of him fast and so there is not the happiest of endings to this one. However it is not all that sad either.".

There are many memorable scenes that will stay with you long after you've watched the movie many quotable lines that are purposeful to bring up over and over.It is also a different pace for Timothy Dalton fans. He shows his comic chops in this role as well as his ability to remind the audience what's underneaththe more serious emotional turmoil of the terminal ill. The overthetop silliness of his actions is a way of dealing with his mortality and how people have treated him because of it. Tim puts it all out there but skillfully reels it back in when it's appropriate for the scene. One of Tim's best roles.I would give this film a 10 however I can't condone the needless swearing mostly in the beginning dialogue which decreases later on and the absurd topless women in the brothel scene. To me they only distract from what's really being said or the comedy and if removed would not effect the poignant story of the film.What I like is that after the two men get to the brothel they decide it's not really what they wanted after all. The relationship that builds up bt our two main guys and the two women stranded along the road with a broken down car is a refreshing addition to the plot.".

Having lost family and friends to cancer I so appreciated the theme of deciding your own end  vs being imprisoned by the health insurance industry. Bravo for tackling this theme in 1988alone! I'm so grateful to have seen this film enough times now that I have specific scenes and lines etched in my brain  every single scene Timothy's in of course he OWNS. And his work with Janet McTeer is just lovely. There's something about this guy though  besides being drop dead gorgeous and possessed of that Golden Larynx that makes the English language sound like the loveliest music on the planet he just exudes such a deep sense of loving what he's doing on such a profound level  it doesn't matter WHAT he's in or who he's with. In return how you can help but not love him back with all your heart and want to follow him to the ends of the earth? He's so generous with his fellow actors too  seems like such a great person to work with. Yes of course the film itself has its flaws  not least of which is Janet McTeer's character which was seriously underwritten but she is soooo good and soooo hilarious and heartbreaking that she nearly makes up for it. Plus it's great seeing two tall people get together  it's not something you see every day.".

And his work with Janet McTeer is just lovely. There's something about this guy though  besides being drop dead gorgeous and possessed of that Golden Larynx that makes the English language sound like the loveliest music on the planet he just exudes such a deep sense of loving what he's doing on such a profound level  it doesn't matter WHAT he's in or who he's with. In return how you can help but not love him back with all your heart and want to follow him to the ends of the earth? He's so generous with his fellow actors too  seems like such a great person to work with. Yes of course the film itself has its flaws  not least of which is Janet McTeer's character which was seriously underwritten but she is soooo good and soooo hilarious and heartbreaking that she nearly makes up for it. Plus it's great seeing two tall people get together  it's not something you see every day.";

The sad reality is that some people do not want to be bothered with disease or they think they could catch it and consequently abandon their sick family and friends. This is a horrible way to deal with sickness and eventually what goes around comes around but this should not be why a person shows compassion. Fear is awful when it hurts people who you care about.

The movie has all the important components required for a good story the actors too have done a commendable job and there is this elevating drama but the audience may hardly feel anything great about the film.It seems the directors have missed out on something to leave viewer feel good in spite of so many good factors of the movie.The story is all about as the name suggests by a couple a Hawks! which are played by Timothy Dalton Bancroft and Anthony Edwards Decker. Janet McTeer Hazel is a columnist writing about the Hawks in their natural environment and she dedicates her column to Bancroft and Decker and builds a rapport with them. Bancroft shoots up to fame and glory with Hazel's writeup. And due to Bancroft's mental ailment Hazel is demotivated to write further. But Bancroft continues to soar high in the sky.The mental sickness of Bancroft is depicted rather unconvincingly and probably the director was not quite sure of portraying this aspect in a rationale way. Bancroft's character is fluctuating and promiscuous but you may wonder how a good drama can be successful with such a loose element and this leads to a point when even Hazel's patience level is tested.It is difficult to criticise the performance by Dalton who is portrayed to be jittery perturbed and most likely he seems to be a schizophrenic. Dalton surely expected an awardwinning performance but he is badly let down by the director and the screenwriter of the film and they fail to make a serious and sensitive film on Hawks and their environment. The movie has lost track in between these two aspects.Still its quite a good watch.".

Despite the change in sets and costumes the story is the usual mishmash of kidnapped princesses evil tyrants feats of strength duplicitous noblemen etc. It's passably diverting for fans of this genre but no one really seems to have his heart in the proceedings.Fury doesn't make his appearance until the second reel and it takes him a bit longer to get his shirt off. After that he's frequently barechested. There's no background or depth to his character which gives him a vaguely cartoony quality but as one might expect he's subjected to a dose of beefcakebondage. In one scene he's chained to the wall of a dungeon and threatened with two sharpened points about to be rammed into his eyes. In a later scene he has to fight off six hulking warriors. The last of these warriors gives Fury seventeen lashes with a whip as Fury writhes on the ground but the whip is obviously just a piece of rope and so this torment has little impact. Finally Fury has to lift back into place a fallen stone obelisk. This isn't very plausible even for a Maciste but it is a unique moment in films.Fury performs with his usual offhand charm but he seems outofplace somewhat uncomfortable and occasionally bored. For those trying to follow the overlytangled story Ramiro is the Spanish plotter who's trying to take over the Dukedom of Malaga and Zuleima is the beautiful Arab girl who helps Maciste at a key moment.This review is based on alas a blackandwhite VHS tape which seemed to be missing bits and pieces of footage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I start this comment I might take a minute to state that I know very little about the country of Albania nor about the communist politics that go on in that state. Living in a big city in a capitalist country interpreting this film is somewhat difficult and can be called into question at least as far as I'm concerned. So bear that in mind as I write.The film Slogans is set in a remote Albanian village in a communist state. It is viewed primarily through the eyes of Andre a young teacher recently arrived in the town and hence under constant scrutiny from the citizens. The plot revolves largely around him and his fellow teachers as they lead their students in building huge slogans for the communist party in rocks on the side of a hill. If this plot intrigues you in a slightly whimsical kind of way you'll know what my motivation was to watch it in the first place.On the surface the plot seems to be nothing more than a tale of alienation and politics revolving around the somewhat tedious occupation of building these slogans from rocks and painting the rocks to make them stand out. But deeper down there are more inner workings.The way I see it the film is simply a satirical piece on the failure and hollowness of communism as a governing rule. The slogans are symbolic of this the whole job is done for the purposes of this supposedly wonderfully fulfilling pursuit but in the end all they are is just words. The fact that so much of the plot revolves around these words seems to suggest that in a similar way the communist system itself revolves around words and little more. The brave and inspirational words are supposed to incite the masses to enthusiasm and yet as the film illustrates the words are so fragile that a simple flow of rain or the trotting of goats can unsettle them and they lose all meaning.It's interesting to note the other ways in which the writers have stressed the importance of words ie. propaganda in the workings of the Party. It is done mainly through the use of single isolated aspects of the story. Firstly the fact that there is only one character who retains notoriety for being a detractor an enemy of the communist Party and that character happens to be illiterate in other words he can't read the slogans and therefore can't rally around them like the masses do. Secondly the fact that despite relying largely on school and teaching for its story there is only essentially one scene actually set in a classroom and it too involves nothing but reciting communist propaganda and when the boy in question makes an honest mistake his words are misinterpreted and an entire investigation is set up as a result.The pathos present in these among other aspects of this film is what gives it its comedy and hence its satire. That said while the examination of communism is very interesting the film itself fails a little to really engage me. The comedy is there but it isn't funny. The drama is there but it isn't moving. I just don't think the right atmosphere was created to actually captivate me there is very little music used to set the mood and the acting isn't quite good enough to compensate. Similarly the subplot of the romance between Andre and Diana doesn't quite work for me there just appears to be no development of this relationship and so when it is consummated there is very little chemistry between the two. It just comes off as incomplete.The only real drama is the subtle message of the sadness and worthlessness of this life Andre is used as contrast the voice of wisdom as it were between this essentially brainwashed community and the outside more civilised world. But in the end the schoolkids like the adults are simply forced to completely immerse themselves in a lifestyle that serves only the purposes of the party with free will eliminated from the equation and in more ways than one the film illustrates the fact that this is an endless cycle. And to an external viewer that's quite sad to see.In summary the film and script in particular are very cleverly worked to examine the life and politics of this isolated village. It is in the execution of the story where it fails to impress but as far as I can see that matters very little since I love a film with intricate underlying themes. As a political foray it's close to perfect. As a film it isn't. In very simple terms four stars out of five.".

The portraits of High Albania very unique in the post 1990 movies but in many corners of this country it is still a reality  it is not necessary to create something artificial. Ona of the rare cases in which Albanian film could be known wider than in the homeland country. And also it is a good way to understand what really was Albanian communism and how deeply was written in human souls.";

Much of the week is spent on the hillsides where the pupils whitewash stones and arrange them into huge letters with slogans like Long live international Communism.

Comic and tragic scenes are plentiful as the people struggle with the whims of the local communist party and the school principal's unrequited love for one of the female teachers.Postwar Albanian history is terribly strange weird and bizarre. Sandwiched between Christian and Moslem influences this mountaineous country was isolated for a very long time due to the paranoia of their leader Enver Hoxha. Sensing enemies revisionists all around him he closed the borders and nixed any international cooperation. This movie gives a fair account of what life must have been like in Albania at the time.

	schema:reviewBody "I read all the comments posted here and I can't hide the happiness that overwhelmed me when I saw people from different backgrounds being so deep and understanding about a culture that they don't seem to know. I am an Albanian myself but I can't say I experienced the communist regime in my country I was only 3 when the system was overthrown and I don't know if I should be sad or glad about that. Anyways I haven't seen the movie in quite a while but I remember that I was shocked when I first saw it although my parents have made everything possible to illustrate the environment in which they lived through stories and pictures. I couldn't believe all of that and like most people who saw it I thought it was exaggerated. When I asked my parents they told me that every scene of that movie was TRUE and it must have happened not only in rural areas but even in the capital. People were being put on trial not only for stabbing communism or for showing little effort in Marxism and Leninism and other bullshit like that but also for growing a beardhair wearing a sweater that is considered foreign show literally or even for not being present on a paradevolunteer actions etc. Somebody said that the love line between the two teachers Andre and Diana  was not satisfactory. It is my 'duty' to say here that this movie is really true to what actually happened. Don't expect a big Hollywood story with fireworks on the background and pink champagne on the ice! If they would show passion or whatever even if they would smile at eachother the villagers would start to talk and they would accuse you of behaving improperly they would transfer you and your family from the capital to a lost mountainous village on the North and even though you would have finished university you would be forced to work in agriculture. About the cast I know almost all the actors that play in that movie and they are definitely some of the best in my country. The way they acted was natural. This movie is supposed to be absurd. The lines are supposed to be stiff. They did an excellent job and I hope the director will do other hopefully with a different theme. For people that are really interested in communism and the absurd yet real way it's perceived and lived I would strongly suggest a book from a worldrenowned Albanian writer named Ismail Kadare. The title is Night without the Moon if I'm not mistaken something close anyway. It's an excellent book but unfortunately I'm not even sure if this one is actually translated in other languages. Anyways enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Slogans' is a wry and entertaining commentary on the excesses of Communist Albania in the early 1970s. Andre a new biology teacher posted to a school in a remote mountain village soon finds the staff and students there to be far more concerned about the upkeep of the Communist slogans they have depicted on the surrounding hillsides in large white stones than the Three Rs. Failure to devote one's full time to this endeavour will supposedly earn the wrath of district party officials although as the film progresses it quickly becomes clear that the village itself seems far more obsessed with the task than the rarely seen bureaucratic overlords themselves and failure to uphold the zeal for rearranging the stones becomes ammunition for the true believers to engage in witch hunts against anyone they have personal grievances. Andre and those of the village not fully enraptured with the community's purposeless raison d'etre find themselves forever treading through a minefield of contradictions paranoia and party dogma that could explode around them at any moment.The film is an excellent study in farce and claiming to be based on real events it is a very welcome and healthy progression for Albanian society to be able to laugh at the absurd almost Orwellian blind alley they once stumbled down. Indeed 'Slogans' takes many delighted pot shots at the futility of the locals' singleminded determination to pepper the hills with importantsounding slogans  the meanings of which they are unable to actually explain such as the declarative 'American Imperialism Is Only A Paper Tiger' and 'Finish Successfully The Campaigns Of Our Harvests And Sowings'. The loss of a generation of children so tired from spending their days building giant letters for phrases they cannot hope to understand that they have no energy left for actual studies is all the more tragic because of their excited determination and uncomprehending devotion to the task reminiscent of the first generation of the children who grew up in Mao's China becoming the most devout party members of all yet the most ignorant.'Slogans' also shows the way in which the real world continually steps in to foil the Party's designs and is punished for doing so. The giant letters are continually unearthed by fauna romances evolve and children play all resulting in stiff penalties for the unwitting transgressors. One of the most touching scenes for me features Andre and a dirtpoor illiterate herdsman who implores the teacher to help him convince the local government to provide him with better housing. The poor peasant whose lack of education precludes him from understanding anything of the local politics is ultimately destined to be condemned for his ignorance his plight an excellent metaphor for the absurdity and failure of the Communist ideologies which have been stripped away of every last scrap of meaning and do nothing for the people who actually matter. Ultimately any such efforts at normality are quashed and the final message of the film is clearly that the people are slaves to the system they themselves willingly perpetuate which is ultimately too powerful to resist. Thankfully history has proved this not to be the case.Yet it is important to remember that 'Slogans' is as much a comedy as it is drama and thankfully both writers and director have enough faith in their story to let the farce come organically from the events themselves with the humour often understated and capable of sneaking up on you. There is an almost Pythonesque quality to the absurd situations characters find themselves in exemplifying the old axiom that truth is stranger than fiction which will draw laughs of their own accord and indeed I found myself chuckling away several times at the inherent contradictions such as a scene in which the school Party leader condemns a child for accidentally referring to China as 'revisionist' and then proceeds straightfaced to make a similar mistake himself.While some may argue that you have to have lived through a Communist dictatorship such as that under Enver Hoxha to truly appreciate the fear uncertainty and for 'Slogans' in particular the sheer madness that occurs when purpose becomes a shell all societies are powered by these irrational drives to varying degrees and audiences should have no trouble appreciating that absurdity for what it is and seeing the funny side as the film intends. Touching amusing sad and hopeless 'Slogans' runs the gamut of emotions striking a fair balance between them in its efforts to be lighthearted while not diluting its core message.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is an Albanian film that talks about life in a village school in a Communist country. The teachers were suppressed by the Party officials. If the Party officials did not like a teacher then the teachers and their class of children would have to build longer slogans on the mountain using stones. Also it talked about the poverty of the villagers that they have no money to replace torn clothing or worn out shoes. Another thing it talked about is that if you have another political idea other than the Party officials' ideas then you would be punished very heavily.For the first time I see what Albania is like. For me Albania is very mysterious because it was closed to the outside world completely until a few yeas ago. From this film I understand that Albania is still underdeveloped and the villagers are quite poor and unhappy.I would like to elaborate on the political surveillance and punishment that the villagers received Possible spoilers. There was a little boy about 6 or 7 years old who had to give a short political talk about the world's political climate. He said that China is a revisionist country instead of a Socialist country by mistake. He immediately corrected his mistake and apologised. However on the following day this incident reached the Party officials and the boy was detained for interrogation. The Party officials asked him who taught him that China is revisionist. The boy and his class teacher both insisted that it was only a careless and unintentional mistake. However the Party officials were very convinced that the incident was a planned and vicious attack on Communism. The boy's father was arrested for sabotaging the stone slogans in the mountains a crime that he never committed and for teaching the little boy such ideas. He was sent to do hard labour. A teacher who defended the boy's father during a village meeting was accused of not being loyal to the Communist party and was labelled a danger to the people. He was sentenced to do 6 months of hard labour. As the story unveiled I became very upset. I simply cannot imagine what life is like under this environment. I imagine that these people are living in terror every day. They do not dare to speak with other people for fear that they will say something wrong and will be accused of some crimes.However this film may be exaggerating the situation and may have dramatised the events. I enjoyed this film a lot even though I was disturbed by the story. I hope what happened in the film is not reality.".

The answer is that you are probably watching a different version.Although I am sure someone more in tune with the background of this movie can explain it in more precise and detailed terms the version being shown on networks like TCM has been rewritten redubbed and is a lot less funny than the original. I have a copy from a 1982 video tape and that original version is great. I saw the TCM broadcast version and couldn't believe how badly the jokes were changed and how unfunny this film now is most likely in the name of political correctness. I can certainly understand anyone being dissatisfied with the film as it is now. However if you can find an old video of this classic and watch it the way it was meant to be seen.".

The answer is that you are probably watching a different version.Although I am sure someone more in tune with the background of this movie can explain it in more precise and detailed terms the version being shown on networks like TCM has been rewritten redubbed and is a lot less funny than the original. I have a copy from a 1982 video tape and that original version is great. I saw the TCM broadcast version and couldn't believe how badly the jokes were changed and how unfunny this film now is most likely in the name of political correctness. I can certainly understand anyone being dissatisfied with the film as it is now. However if you can find an old video of this classic and watch it the way it was meant to be seen.";

	schema:reviewBody "In its own nature the film being made fun of within the film What's Up Tiger Lily is inherently silly. It's a James Bond ripoff done to the Nth degree where based on only a few films its Japanese Bmovie counterpart does everything just in imagery alone to make it a ludicrous actionmovie experience. Just in the opening moments even before Woody Allen appears on the screen to explain the method to the madness in the film is quite funny in a badmovie sort of way. And I think that it's probably not too unexpected that it puts a divide in Woody Allen's audience. There's the group that's more into just his later style of wit and humor and I can tell that for those it's not surprising to see some not really 'getting' into this style of wacky offthewall cartoon humor. But after seeing a couple of more dramatic films recently this one really did the trick. It's the film that was the most likely to spawn the underground Night of the Living Dead parody of 1991 along with Kung Pow the former being better than the latter but it also has a kinship if not ascendancy of the ZAZ comedies of the late 70s and 80s and even a tinge of Mel Brooks.So for me this is actually one of my favorite Woody Allen comedies. Not really up as high in terms of cinematic 'quality' in terms of craftsmanship I mean as his 70s films but with material like this it's almost required not to carp. Woody and his team of writers and voice actors almost have it cut out for them. There's much to wonder perhaps in what the 'real' plot of this Japanese spy film Kokusai himitsu keisatsu Kagi no kagi or International Secret Police Key of Keys is almost as funny as what the writers come up with. Spies and assassins are on the look out for get this an Egg salad recipe! But of course this is just as much a gimmick as is well much of the rest of what comes out of the actor's mouths. At times I wasn't even sure if it was all Woody Jokes or which were twenty minutes apparently are not by Woody Allen's group but by someone else though it's hard to tell which is a credit to most involved but I didn't care. It's got the kind of jokes that on a certain plain can allow you to laugh like an idiot.Certain gags just come with the territory of the film itself and are heightened by the added bits during fights. But much of the film is based on the wit Woody's known for though here sometimes to equally 'badpun' and juvenile terms even featuring practically never in any of his other films rock and roll and cartoonlike voices my favorite the snakeobsessed henchman right out of Looney Tunes and Ren  Stimpy. So many lines strike up laughs to greater or lesser degrees it's hard to really spot them out but it's suffice to say that by the time it's done and through its end credits featuring an eyeexam you'll know whether you'll want to watch it again like a ZAZ or Brooksfilm to memorize the quotable lines and bits or put it in the lower deepertofind section in your video collection. Things like a spy who bursts into an operatic love song during tense confrontation scenes and with puns like two Wong's don't make a right are what you can expect in this film but there's more and it will either ignite the anythinggoes funny button or just not do it for you. One thing's for sure you'll never see the Lovin' Spoonful the same way again.By the way this review reflects the Woody Allen dub of the movie of what's 23 there anyway and it's available on the DVD recommended over the other dub that's been floating around too.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's almost necessary to watch this with a friend or two. You'll need to make sure your friends are familiar with movie conventions of the midsixties. If they aren't they might not laugh. If they are you'll probably laugh at the same time and have fun. To be brief WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY is a Japanese detective movie made in 1964 and dubbed into English two years later for comic effect. The perpetrators are Woody Allen Louise Lasser and a few others. In an unusual move Woody Allen sets up the joke at the beginning explaining on camera that's he's removed the soundtrack to the original rewritten the dialogue and made it a comedy. What makes WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY aboveaverage other than the fact that people don't just dub entire movies with gagdialogue having nothing to do with the plot is that it takes the humor which clearly already exists in the original and twists it. Although the original is foreign it is very similar to any number of American or British detective movies of the time such as OUR MAN FLINT or THE LADY IN CEMENT. Anybody who went to a doublefeature in 1966 had sat through such a movie. The dubbed dialogue is not entirely removed from what is clearly the intent of the original dialogue. There are funny visuals in this movie. Woody Allen's dialogue spins on the visuals and makes fun of them up to a point but it is actually a pretty good movie in the first place. It's not as if Allen took a bad movie and ridiculed it. The visuals are entertaining in themselves. Allen's plot involves a search for the world's greatest recipe for chicken soup. Every time the characters think they've found the recipe we see them inspecting strips of microfilm. Obviously the original involves a search for microfilm. So the plot is obvious. Our maverick detective will track down the bad guys and win. Why not eliminate the original dialogue and treat us to a featurefilm's worth of oneliners? If you like GET SMART you'll probably like this movie. If you don't like GET SMART you probably won't like it. But if you can't see why Allen bothered with this you'll need to ask yourself why so many movies in the late sixties spoofed the spy genre. Woody Allen didn't operate in a vacuum here. A note on the recent altering of Woody Allen's dialogue I have WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY on a DVD released by IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT. It contains both the soundtrack Woody Allen did for the 1966 release and what the packaging calls the television audio track. Very condsiderately IMAGE provides an option for comparing the dialogue where Woody Allen's dialogue has been replaced by the dialogue of whomever has REREdubbed it for TV. I've compared some of them and am saddened to think that Allen's humor has been forcibly blunted for current broadcast. But IMAGE does let us hear the difference and that's more than TV audiences may be getting. If you see this on TV and think the dialogue is strangely tepid try the DVD. You'll be able to hear what Woody Allen intended. I have to qualify this though because he seems to have had to put up with a certain amount of studio interference in 1966. Finally I'll say that you'll probably recognize a few of the actors in this movie. Two of the women appeared in a James Bond movie and the main actor Tatsuya Mihashi who died only last year in 2004 appeared in several prestigious films. Therefore Woody Allen isn't trouncing on helpless fools here.".

Although the concept is ingenious 22 years before the misadventures of the Satellite of Love the jokes are not as funny as they could or should be and there is far too much emphasis on Allen's sexual hangups.  There are a lot of scenes that could have been hysterical but which turn out to be uncomfortably unamusing. Still for its campiness and originality you should try to catch this film sometime.";

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen gives a Japanesedirected James Bondstyled actioner a new soundtrack including different dialogue telling a new story. Allen's changes turn the film into a spy versus spy quest for the recipe of the world's best egg salad.I'm a huge Woody Allen fan. The idea behind this film is promising and the basic premise of Allen's story grafted on to a preexisting film International Secret Police Key of Keys Kokusai himitsu keisatsu Kagi no kagi from 1965 by Senkichi Taniguchi is funny if silly. However this is one of the very few Allen films that just doesn't work for me. The Taniguchi film seems chopped up to a point of incoherence maybe it's presented here in its entirety and in the same order but that would mean that its running time is around 60 minutes or less although that could be a factor of the changed dialogue. I found myself wishing there was an alternate soundtrack that was a legitimate dubbing of the original film.Although there are a few very funny scenes oneliners and ideas in Allen's new story most of it isn't very funny. Too many scenes seem like they may be serious translations of the Japanese dialogue. There are too many occurrences of silly vocal noises but not enough to make that a motif so that it's funny. There are too many long sections where the film is mostly boring. The untranslated beginning goes on far too long. The miniinterview with Allen that explains the film's premise would only be funny if it weren't true. The Lovin' Spoonful scenes aren't funny and perhaps weren't intended to bethey seem like a studio attempt to try to put more butts in theater seats upon the film's release by featuring a popular rock group. It doesn't seem like Allen spent much time on thisthe dialogue seems largely improvised and mostly disjointed. In short the film is basically a mess and only worth viewing for Woody Allen completist and men with a serious Asian woman fetish it's also worth noting that Taniguchi seems to share a foot fetish.What would have worked better and probably would have made the film much funnier is if Allen would have written and directed both the film that we're seeing visually and a completely different story for the soundtrack. Much more time would have to be spent crafting each component to make them seem unrelated but coherent and funny. That's an experiment that remains to be done to my knowledge.There are enough positive aspects that the film doesn't deserve a 1as I noted there are times that What's Up Tiger Lily is funnybut the best I can do is a 5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back during the Colorization Wars of the 1980s Woody Allen was uncharacteristically public about defending the history and artistry of his craft against those who were eager to take old black  white classics and turn them into digitized coloring books. Chief among the foes of the cinematic art were Ted Turner who had used his power as a media mogul to buy up control of a huge backlog of films by MGM RKO Warner Bros. and other studios as fodder for his cable TV channels. Whether as philistine or shrewd capitalist Turner hoped to prolong the moneymaking life of old movies by making them look vaguely newer through color. Of this Woody said To change someone's work without any regard to his wishes shows a total contempt for film for the director and for the public. To which Ted replied WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY? It was not a question.And unfortunately Ted had a point.Once upon a time WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY? was a 1965 Japanese spy movie called KOKUSAI HIMITSU KEISATSU KAGI NO KAGI a.k.a. INTERNATIONAL SECRET POLICE KEY OF KEYS. The low rent U.S. studio American International Pictures bought the rights to the film and apparently realizing they had a hibachicooked turkey on its hands they decided to try to salvage the project by turning it into a comedy. Fresh from his experience as writer and actor in WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT Woody was offered the opportunity to try directing  well redirecting  by rewriting reediting and redubbing KEY OF KEYS into TIGER LILY? And the film's James Bondstyle story about missing microfilm became a wisecracking farce about the search for the perfect egg salad recipe.It may never be known if KEY OF KEYS wasis a good film but it is apparent that for all of his efforts Woody couldn't save it for American audiences. Rearranging the scenes and putting smart alec remarks and inane non sequiturs into the unsuspecting mouths of the actors must have been fun and maybe even an educational experience for the neophyte filmmaker. The result it like a 3D MAD Magazine satire or a trial run for the type of comedy that would make its breakthrough with AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN. But in the end TIGER LILY isn't all that funny or at least not consistently funny. For every good chuckle there are a dozen lead balloons and too much of the dialogue is used to explain the convoluted plot. If appearances are anything the reconstruction of the film was a rush job and it all was done on the cheap.So the interesting thing about TIGER LILY is not its value as art or entertainment but the ethics behind it. You can't blame Woody for taking on the project it must have been a challenge and it was certainly an opportunity to move his career into a new direction. But as the Ted Turner situation would make apparent TIGER LILY is not the film that the makers of KEY OF KEYS had envisioned. That is not to say that in its original Japanese form the film was a CITIZEN KANE or a MALTESE FALCON or even a MANHATTAN but whatever it was Allen greatly altered the way it would be experienced by most of the world. Of course Woody never claimed that his version of the film was meant to replace or even compete with the original but just the same he negated another director's work.If anything TIGER LILY is a lesson in both the plastic and the fragile nature of film as an art. Whether with mischief or malice a little imagination can alter not just the tone of a film but its message and its vision. And as the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN parodies that made their way to Youtube.com proved you don't even have to be a professional to become a redirector.A further irony AIP found Woody's cut of the film too short for theatrical release and they again reedited it to add some more footage and a few faux music videos by The Loving Spoonful. You can even tell in the final cameo that he makes at the end of the film that Woody's own voice has been redubbed by someone else. This angered Allen who felt his work had been violated and it motivated his drive to become a director who protects his work from unwanted tampering. But one wonders if Senkichi Taniguchi the director of KEY OF KEYS ever saw WHAT'S UP TIGER LILY? and whether or not he ever forgave Woody for what he did to it.".

If you want a funnier film watch just about anythingeven a test pattern on late night TV!";

He and his films are not for everybody some people don't like the neurotic approach he takes to his characters and he has been criticised for being selfindulgent. Of all his films What's Up Tiger Lily has a number of good things but it for me is one of Allen's weakest films with a sense that he was yet to properly find his voiceit was in Annie Hall when he found it. And it is one of his most polarising. There are things to like about What's Up Tiger Lily. It is made very well not audacious but skillful. The acting is more than serviceable and the voices while purposefully cartoony are really entertaining to listen to particularly the snakeobsessed henchman. The soundtrack is also very catchy in a groovy way but the best thing about What's Up Tiger Lily is the dialogue and the use of mismatched words much of it is just hilarious as well as very quotable and has Allen's witty acerbic style all over it. Not all the humour works the egg salad part is just silly and some of the aheadofthetime jokes may seem in bad taste nowsome are not going to take lightly to a few of the sex jokes. The film had such a great idea but it came off in a way that felt overcooked and undercooked basically a onejoke idea that did run out of steam too early. The film starts off brilliantly and the dialogue is all great the story though is paper thin and much of the pacing is dull and in serious need of a tightening up. Not helped by The Lovin' Spoonful music interludes the music is really good but the interludes are just bizarredone in a way that feels completely out of kilter with everything else are not really all that interesting and just slow the film down considerably. They were put in without Allen's consent apparently and it shows. John Sebastian adds very little here and just seems out of place and somewhat annoying. In terms of direction in What's Up Tiger Lily Senkichi Taniguchi's is fine while Allen's is competent but with a sense that he was understandablyconsidering it's a debut yet to find or refine his style. All in all not a very easy film to rate or talk about it does have a lot of laughs and shows some effort but it could have done much more with the concept it had and Allen has done far better. 510 Bethany Cox".

The original film does have fairly slick production values apart from some shots where the sea looks like a painted backdrop and two gorgeous gorgeous Japanese women in its cast they both starred in the Bond film You Only Live Twice!. Woody's version has some laughoutloud moments but it does wear thin in the course of its 80 minutes I agree with Pauline Kael's comment that it would have been better as a short. However the film's best jokes Beware of the man with....with....with....with.... are so good that they can make you laugh even when you're remembering them later though in my opinion the single funniest line belongs to Woody himself it's a great film beautiful color lots of raping and looting and killing!. 12 out of 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "What attracted me to What's Up Tiger Lily? was seeing Woody Allen working in redubbing a foreign film making into a new one. This technique is familiar to me thankful to a 30 minute show who lasted for a short period on MTV and it was really something seeing a unknown film being dubbed for comical purposes and ridiculous scenarios. Allen makes of the serious Japanese film called International Secret Police Key of Keys a funny but somewhat tedious and a times uninteresting film where the hero has to go to a lot of trouble to get an special egg salad recipe. Just like many spy flicks this one is very difficult to follow there's a moment when Woody is asked by a host to explain the film to the viewers to which he replies No and the film goes on. This Bond adventure type has some hilarious funny sequences some good dialogs a little bit of action and many histrionic moments where the characters keep making impersonations of Peter Lorre and other classic actors.Quotes like the one in this review title or things like I'm dying call my rabbi! and many others are really funny but the movie doesn't know how to be more hysterical more interesting. There some slow parts and some jokes that doesn't work nowadays. But Allen had a lot of comical touch to make it a nice film pretty decent and that can make you laugh at least in one scene. Yeah the plot is ridiculous but it works well it's well handled. One of the greatest things What's Up Tiger Lily? features is musical numbers by The Lovin' Spoonful which was included behind Allen's back when the studio felt a need to bump up the running time. Their appearance and the score was really cool highly funny even though it doesn't have much connection with the plot or anything.Inventive a little bit original for its time and even more effective than many cheap comedies of the past ten years this is a good example of Woody Allen many talents as a writer and director and deserves to be seen at least once. Just don't expect the high flies of intellectualism of his future works and you'll find some fun in here. 710".

It was amazing to see Michelle Yeoh as Ang Sang Suu Kyi the act was elegantly presented the way how Michelle put her hand on the waist while walking gracefully reminded me so much of the Lady everything comes natural nothing pretentious it's a joy to see such a great act with simple body language it even sent me a sort of spinetingling joy when she walked on the stage to give her first public speech at Shwe Dagon People Forum. I think Michelle did not disappoint the Lady and the people of Myanmar. The storyline may be oversimplified but I would still rate this movie with 9 it's hard to present the whole struggle of Daw Ang Sang in a short time but I guess most people who go and watch this movie should already have some background of what happened in real life.I've seen the Lady in Hong Kong and found it one of the best movies of its kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Making a commercial film about a struggle for human rights and democracy is a real struggle because most audiences want entertainment and not politics. So the producers have to find an 'angle'. In 1987 A World Apart told the story of the fight against apartheid in South Africa but through the prism of the strain that this put on ANC activist Ruth First's relationship with her young daughter. A similar approach is used here in this account of the life of Aung San Suu Kyi the eponymous lady and leader of the National League for Democracy in the dictatorship that has ruled Burma for most of the period since postwar independence from Britain. So it is not politics as such which is to the fore here but Suu Kyi's relationship with her husband Oxford academic Michael Aris and most especially the regime's brutal refusal to allow Aris to see his wife one last time when he was dying of prostate cancer. It is a gutwrenchingly sad tale.Malaysianborn actress Michelle Yeoh  a Bond girl in Tomorrow Never Dies and pugilist star of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  looks perfect in the leading role giving a performance which while often understated is deeply moving. David Thewlis various Harry Potter films and The Boy With The Striped Pyjamas is very effective as the longsuffering husband. The exotic locations and local faces in Thailand serve the movie well and original music by the French Eric Serra plus some Mozart enhance the emotional power of the work. It is perhaps no surprise that the script for what is in essence a love story comes from a female writer  the British Rebecca Frayn  but one might not expect the identity of the director for this AngloFrench film Luc Besson best known for such action movies as Nikita Leon and The Fifth Element.The Lady may be a bit onedimensional and lack nuance but it highlights a long struggle for human rights that is not sufficiently wellknown and the timing of its release I saw it in January 2012 is poignant. When filming started Suu Kyi was still under house arrest as she had been in total for some 15 years but by the time the film was finished she had been released. At the end of the movie the iron grip of the regime and the number of political prisoners are highlighted but in the weeks around the film's release the generals instituted a series of liberalisation measures including the freeing of most political prisoners. If all this augurs an era of genuine democracy in Burma The Lady will be a wonderful testimony to the power of personal courage and sacrifice to effect political change.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Lady";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the story by Rebecca Frayn who had spent three years interviewing close confidantes of Aung San Suu Kyi the narrative provides the points of view of both Suu Kyi herself played by Michelle Yeoh and her husband Michael Aris David Thewlis who because of her political awakening and development caused plenty of emotionally painful physical separation and time spent apart through her standing up for and accepting her countrymen's push for democratic leadership after years of military rule from generalissimos Ne Win to Tan Shwe Agga Poechit. It also presents different perspectives both within and outside of Burma as crises began to unfold with Suu Kyi a prisoner of her own home and country and Michael being outside of it trying his best to sound out her and Burma's plight. Then there's the sacrifice of family for country where a breakup of the family unit was something inevitable in order to continue being there for her countrymen and not abandoning them at times of need.In a story spanning decades that moves forward and back in time Besson has a solid hand in knowing the highlights of the many years history to translate for the big screen going back to the 40s when Suu Kyi's father Aung San a war and independence hero got assassinated right down to her emergence in politics as a force to be reckoned with and her subsequent house arrest right up to the recent 2007 rallies and demonstrations by monks that eventually led to a deadly crackdown. The Lady presents Besson an opportunity to move away from his relatively family friendly fare of late with the Arthur and the Invisibles series and also to perform an about turn from the usual action flicks for something a lot more serious in gravitas and needless to say the importance of getting the film right in most if not all counts as much as a filmmaker can with the resources at his disposal.As such some may feel that the film is relatively lightweight in its coverage of politics although I must add that being confined to one's home in the prominent years of one's political life doesn't make for a smooth translation on screen as there's only so much that one can do within the fantastic recreation of Suu Kyi's lakeside home. Instead a softer more heartfelt approach through a love story opened up Suu Kyi as a character who's a lot more down to earth than just a democracy icon. Besson's knack for handling strong female characters couldn't be more pronounced here with plenty of opportunities in scenes to show she does not cower even with gun barrels pointed at her face nor accept the constant nonsense dished out by the military might.Despite the lack of action you can feel Luc Besson's release of glee in channeling that frustration to mocking the military top brass from their deliberate big moments and silly gestures bordering on the comical to their illogical superstitions with characterization being very much in line with our esteemed ex Minister Mentor's comments in WikiLeaks. Almost all generalissimos and their underlings are ridiculously decorated and make extremely naive calls as if nobody can see through their simple rouse. It's a story of grace versus guns which in any other typical Besson movie it's no surprise if it comes with preference for the latter except for The Lady which trades in for the softer power approach. Michelle Yeoh lost quite a lot of weight in order to physically resemble the lead role and her time spent on researching Suu Kyi was time well spent as she nailed her mimicry down to a pat. Even her lines spoken in Burmese were flawless. Not that I can understand the language but the large percentage of Burmese audience that I've watched this with were nodding and acknowledging her diction and fluency as well as her performance of the real life heroine of their lives. In short they were in awe by her elegance and poise in making Suu Kyi come alive on screen. David Thewlis also shone in his role as the husband standing firmly behind her decision and to make sacrifices knowingly for the greater good for the benefit of even more people in a country that needs his wife more than he needs her. Together they made their struggle felt and will seek to move even the most stoic of hearts. And the actors who played the Burmese generals you guys surely hammed it up effortlessly.This superb film may be travelling the festival and commercial theatrical circuits now and will probably pick up a slew of film awards along the way. But what's more important and I'm sure it'll achieve is to bring the attention of the world towards Suu Kyi's and Burma's continued plight that seemed to be with no end in sight. You may not be very familiar with what may have transpired over the decades of strife in Burma but The Lady brings you up to speed with a succinctly packed historical lesson centered around one of the world's enduring icons of freedom and democracy. A definite recommendation for this wonderful effort.".

He handled the private woman and her personal sacrifice and bravery in a tasteful manner.Michelle Yeoh does a brilliant job. It's a really good fit for her. She is good in both the intimate moments dealing with her family and in her dignified public persona. She deserves an acting nomination for her work. David Thewlis is well cast as a disheveled looking professor type.The subtitles are a major part of the movie with lots of dialog in Burmese. But it's still easy to follow the plot which doesn't jump around too much and is well laid out. It deserves a place among the better political true life movies. While not as dramatic or gut wrenching as Cry Freedom or the Killing Fields it still delivers a powerful message. Those interested can also watch Beyond Rangoon with Patricia Arquette which is a more adventure style portrayal of the events in Burma.Wish the movie could have shown more recent events including her recent release. Reminds us there is still a long way to go in Burma.Touching and a must watch.".

The movie depicts the life of a people under military dictatorship and how the whole nation rallies behind the person that was destined to lead it despite all odds.

	schema:headline " Lengthy but absorbing biopic about Aung San Suu Kyi's struggle for a democratic Burma.";
	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson best known La Femme Nikita and Leon here directs an admirably earnest biopic about Burmese political activist Aung San Suu Kyi. The film is a real change of pace for both Besson and his leading lady Michelle Yeoh who swaps her usual highkicking womanofaction persona for something much subtler and more affecting. The Lady has its flaws but nevertheless manages to be a worthy and often moving account of a remarkable life.The story begins in 1947 when Suu Kyi is only two years old. Her father Aung San is nominally in charge of Burma as the country's hardfought independence from colonial rule draws near. However he his cabinet ministers are denied their moment of triumph when they are ruthlessly assassinated plunging the country into a long and downward spiral of political turmoil which leads ultimately to the establishment of a tyrannical military regime. Fast forward to 1988 where adult Suu Kyi Michelle Yeoh lives in Oxford with her husband Michael Aris David Thewlis and their two sons Kim Jonathan Raggett and Alexander Jonathan Woodhouse. Suu Kyi is summoned back to Burma when her mother suffers a stroke. Initially she intends merely to stay for a week or two in order to nurse her mother through her time of need. However during her visit Suu Kyi finds Burma to be a land of extraordinary violence oppression and misery. She witnesses corrupt soldiers brutally killing student protesters and sees desperate civilians demonstrating for their rights using old photos of her father to represent their cause. It isn't long before Suu Kyi is approached by the people and asked to lead them in their fight for a democratic and peaceful Burma.Yeoh is excellent in this film. Not only does she bear a remarkable resemblance to the real Aung San Suu Kyi she also shows a surprising emotional range in the film's more intimate scenes. The only weakness with Yeoh's performance is that her enunciation is a little wooden during her Englishlanguage scenes. Thewlis also does well as her stiff upperlipped British husband an equally remarkable man who is forced to bury his inner anguish because he recognises the importance of what his wife is doing for her country. The Lady comes slightly undone in two areas. One is that Besson has never been noted for his sincere and reverent style of filmmaking he's on much firmer ground delivering cool and stylized action. Here he handles the scenes of street violence and military manoeuvring with typical verve but a certain awkwardness hangs over some of the quieter moments. The other drawback is the rather cartoonish portrayal of the characters in the Burmese military regime. Although widely regarded as bad men in reallife the way they are presented here makes them seem almost like Bondstyle supervillains. The only thing missing is a baddie's lair and a scowling white pussycat perched on the head honcho's lap. A bit more nuance and depth would not have gone amiss in this department. Overall The Lady a solid and wellmade biopic about a very inspirational figure. Flaws aside it goes some way to ward making sense of a senseless political situation and tries hard to present its large subject in a manageable bite. There's a good chance that the first thing you will do after watching the film is go home and Google Aung San Suu Kyi. If that's so then the film has immediately achieved two of its worthiest goals  to educate and inspire".

As an Australian I have followed Aung San Suu Kyi's life but because of the violence the wrenching truth of its purity escaped me that she was confronted with it continually was spared us and as a result I was truly shocked by her braveness in the face of such mindless brutality. Therefore my admiration for her strength in the face of this mindlessness knows no bounds.People may feel that the true meaning of the film was the passion woven through the script of Aung's love for her husband and he for her. I do not think that I am disclosing any part of the film that I should keep quiet about because it is a central aspect of the film from beginning to end. To me that is the great theme of the movie it is like the wash that a painter applies to a canvas before painting.

	schema:reviewBody "Since 1905 there have been 15 women Nobel Prize winners three sharing in 2011. The loftiest stature has to be attributed to Mother Teresa. Aung San Suu Kyi The Lady comes very close behind. Luc Besson generally not exactly known for his modesty intimated in an interview how humbled he was in his first meeting with her in her house in Burma coming face to face with Goodness personified. Luc Besson is well known for his appetite to tackle ANY genre from historical epic to outlandish science fiction and everything in between and he has well demonstrated his virtuosity and flare. Filming the story of such a living legend as Aung San Suu Kyi however he is somewhat subdued. This is understandable because of the respect. Uncharacteristically restrained in his visuals he wisely takes advantage of Eric Serra's excellent original score to wonderful effects. As well rather than focusing on heroism in political struggle he leans more towards presenting a moving mature love story that elevates the word sacrifice to a new height. Absolutely everything hinges however on the titular role. Although not many people may know Michelle Yeoh has long proved that there is much more to her than a premium Amazon with The Soong Sisters 1997. It didn't take long for people trying to cast the role of Aung San Suu Kyi to unanimously agree that Yeoh was born for it. And she is proved them right convincingly. Her job is exceptionally difficult when you compare it with a majority of successful bio pics in the last decade where the protagonist is literally history Ray Charles Bobby Darin Truman Capote J. Edgar Hoover. Aung San Suu Kyi is in every sense a living legend. People see her frequently in live coverage. The courage and determination is probably quite similar in all heroic figures. But the grace and elegance of The Lady even under the acutest of pressures is unique. Yeoh's portrayal is absolutely flawless putting her in the same class as Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II and Morgan Freeman's Nelson Mandela. Yeoh's performance however superb would not shine as bright without the other half of this love story referred to earlier or as one critic aptly calls it a story of the man behind the woman. Cannes's Best Actor 1993 David Thewlis is with Yeoh every step of the way in portraying her most indulgent husband Michael Aris who does not just support unwaveringly his wife's dream of a free Burma which would have been remarkable but embraces it as his own. But there's not just the love between husband and wife but also love in a happy family including the two sons Alexander Jonathan Woodhouse and Kim Jonathan Raggett. The most touch scene would have to be the father and two sons receiving the Nobel Prize for the mother who is held in house arrest in Burma  Aung San Suu Kyi listening on the radio to Alexander's acceptance speech on her behalf. That is when it become quite difficult to contain one's tears.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the flaws in this dramatized biopic of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi  far too long at 132 minutes more emphasis on a family drama than an important change in Burma to Myanmar etc  this film as written by Rebecca Frayn and directed by Luc Beeson Taken Transporter La Femme Nikita etc deserves our attention in that it helps explain the volatile situation that existed in Burma from 1947 to the present. In brief it is the story of Aung San Suu Kyi as she becomes the core of Burma's democracy movement and her relationship with her husband Oxford professor and writer Michael Aris.Opening in 1947 we meet Aung San Suu Kyi as a child bidding farewell to her father General Aung San a hero of the Burmese democratic movement who is then assassinated. Aung San Suu Kyi Michelle Leoh escapes to England matures marries an Oxford professor Michael David Thewlis and has two sons Jonathan Raggett and Jonathan Woodhouse. The film then jumps to 1988 when due to the fact that her mother is critically ill Suu Kyi returns to Burma to care for her mother once there she observes the student protests to the military regime headed by a dummy superstitious dictator and as the heir to her father's fame in the country as a leader of the people she decides to stay and follow the encouragement of the protesters to be their leader. That decision places here in danger and eventual house arrest and with the love of her husband and children as support she stays the course and becomes the leader of the democratic movement of the country now called Myanmar. The commitment to her cause by her husband who discovers in Suu Kyi's absence that he has prostate cancer and a limited life span offers her strength and she gains world attention when she is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.THE LADY is more an epic love story about how an extraordinary couple and family sacrifice their happiness at great human cost for a higher cause than it is a full study of the persona of Aung San Suu Kyi Much is missing especially the period in Burma from 1947 to 1988 and the maturing of Suu Kyi into a hero. But the film does emphasize the peaceful quest of the woman who is at the core of Burma's democracy movement and the indomitable love relationship and strength of marriage and family due to their undying support of her mission. Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis are excellent and the film has touches of beauty that are memorable as Suu Kyi listens on a portable radio to the Nobel Prize speech read by her son the music that is so much a part of Suu Kyi's life is her playing of the Pachelbel Canon accompanied by a small orchestra over a distance of thousands of miles. It is a touching tribute to a great lady of peace. Grady Hap".

The commitment to her cause by her husband who discovers in Suu Kyi's absence that he has prostate cancer and a limited life span offers her strength and she gains world attention when she is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.THE LADY is more an epic love story about how an extraordinary couple and family sacrifice their happiness at great human cost for a higher cause than it is a full study of the persona of Aung San Suu Kyi Much is missing especially the period in Burma from 1947 to 1988 and the maturing of Suu Kyi into a hero. But the film does emphasize the peaceful quest of the woman who is at the core of Burma's democracy movement and the indomitable love relationship and strength of marriage and family due to their undying support of her mission. Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis are excellent and the film has touches of beauty that are memorable as Suu Kyi listens on a portable radio to the Nobel Prize speech read by her son the music that is so much a part of Suu Kyi's life is her playing of the Pachelbel Canon accompanied by a small orchestra over a distance of thousands of miles. It is a touching tribute to a great lady of peace. Grady Hap";

Moreover Miss Yeong also performed quite well and expressed the very exact characters of Suu Kyi in the film love patience tolerance artistic and calm.

	schema:headline " One of the Last Bastions of Tyranny";
	schema:reviewBody "Politically the late eighties and nineties were the most hopeful period in recent history. Throughout the world especially in Eastern Europe and Latin America but also in Africa and the Far East dictatorial regimes were giving way to democracy. Activists such as Lech Walesa Vaclav Havel and Nelson Mandela were exchanging their prison cells for their countries' Presidential Palaces and it seemed that Burma I will not call it Myanmar which had been governed by a repressive military junta since 1962 would be the next democratic success story. Opposition to the regime was led by Aung San Suu Kyi the beautiful and charismatic daughter of a national hero who enjoyed the devoted support of most of her compatriots. It seemed inevitable that people power would sweep away the junta just as it had swept away the Marcos regime in the Philippines and the Communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe.And yet this did not happen the Burmese regime succeeded in maintaining its iron grip on power. Perhaps the reason was that unlike many other tyrannies it lacked any recognisable ideology beyond an Orwellian vision of a boot stamping on a human face forever. Communism collapsed when it became clear that it could not perform its ostensible ideological function the protection of the economic interests of the working man. This in turn provoked the collapse of rightwing dictatorships like Pinochet's in Chile or Suharto's in Indonesia which had justified their existence by claiming to defend their countries against Communism. Apartheid collapsed when it became clear that the economic interests of black and white South Africans were so closely intertwined as to make nonsense of the idea of separate development. Than Shwe's junta lacking any ideology which could be discredited in this way could resist the forces of change for as long as it could maintain the loyalty of its troops and its own will to power.The Lady depicts the life of Suu Kyi known as the lady to her followers. It is not a complete biography as it shows little of her early life apart from the assassination of her father Aung San when she was three years old. The main action begins in 1988 when she was in her midforties and returned to Burma to visit her ailing mother having previously been living in England with her husband Michael Aris an Oxford professor. Her visit coincided with an uprising against military rule which was followed by a brief period of liberalisation. She was persuaded to lead the country's nascent prodemocracy movement and her party the National League for Democracy won a convincing majority in the 1990 parliamentary election. The military however refused to recognise the result and reimposed martial law. Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest and all political campaigning was forbidden. The junta seemed quite unmoved by international condemnation even the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Suu Kyi in 1993 could not persuade them to release her.The film was directed by Luc Besson who was perhaps not the ideal director as he had previously best been known for making action movies such as Nikita. He had made a previous biography of a national political heroine Joan of Arc but even there the action scenes are the best thing about the film. It is perhaps therefore unsurprising that The Lady is rather slow and ponderous and shows signs of having been made by a director unused to this style of filmmaking. Visually however the film is often attractive with effective contrasts between the green tropical lushness of SouthEast Asia these scenes were shot in Thailand rather than Burma itself and the grey stone of Oxford a city often seen in the snow.To be fair to Besson he appears to have been deeply committed to this film and it is possible that without his commitment it might never have been made. He was fortunate in having a leading lady Michelle Yeoh who was just as committed as he was indeed it was she who persuaded him to take on the project. Yeoh here gets to show as she did in Memoirs of a Geisha that she is more than just a Bond Girl more than just a kungfu action heroine. She has the advantage of bearing a striking resemblance to the woman she is portraying.Yeoh described the film as an incredible love story and the element most emphasised in the film is the relationship between Suu Kyi and her husband from whom she was separated for many years. She would have been free at any time to leave Burma and rejoin him and their two sons in England but always refused to do so knowing that if she ever left the country she would never be permitted to return. David Thewlis as Aris is perhaps even better than Yeoh playing him as an unworldly academic and devoted family man who nevertheless selflessly insists that his wife remain in Burma knowing that if she leaves the country this will be a great blow to the prodemocracy movement. His premature death from cancer possibly brought on or exacerbated by the stress of his situation is the film's most tragic moment.Suu Kyi's house arrest has now been lifted and Burma is now ruled by a civilian government although it remains to be seen whether it will evolve into a genuine democracy the elections in 2010 were widely denounced as neither free nor fair and the new government as a mere front for a continuing military dictatorship. The expulsion of Michelle Yeoh from the country last year would suggest that the authorities are still very touchy about criticism. The film however performs the valuable service of reminding the world of the problems of a country which was for too long one of the last bastions of tyranny. I certainly preferred it to The Iron Lady the other recent biopic of a major female political figure. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Luc Besson takes a change of pace for this slowmoving biopic of Aung San Suu Kyi Burma's most famous daughter and a woman whose life became symbolic of that country's struggle against a repressive military junta. For those who know nothing about Suu Kyi the most significant part of her story involves her being placed under house arrest for many years so adrenaline junkies should look elsewhere.This story is mannered simple and rich in atmosphere. It's not a political thriller with superfast cutting and editing between characters instead it's an often poignant exploration of courage and decency in the face of oppression. There's a kind of slowburning intensity beneath the surface nonetheless something that keeps you watching and which makes for a compelling journey despite the lack of incident.Michelle Yeoh was born to play the part of Suu Kyi and she performs admirably in the role capturing the woman's indomitable spirit through subtlety and carefullycrafted mannerisms. David Thewlis as her longsuffering husband is the human heart of the story and his tragic tale is full of emotion.Although the violent acts of the Burmese soldiers form the backdrop of the tale this is a film about people about character and the choices we make in our lives. I particularly liked the way that the film refuses to preach or eulogise about Suu Kyi's character she's certainly no saint and watching her choose her country over her family is quietly devastating in its own way.".

As you may or may not know HK is now under the control of the China PRC government since 1997.HK people have been dreaming of universal suffrage to elect their own chief executive using their own votes since then.The truth is PRC does all its possible way to prevent universal suffrage to happen in HK.And the worse is HK does not have Aung San Suu Kyi. Personally I don't even believe there will be one in the future.Burma has Aung San Suu Kyi. China has Liu Xiaobo. Hong Kong has nothing but a scumbag of proPRC politicians trying their best to protect their authority or privileges. So I guess this movie is particularly meaningful to those people me included that cannot cast their vote to find their desired leader. Democracy may not solve all problems but it gives hopes to humanity and the spirit of freedom.God bless Aung San Suu Kyi. Democracy never comes easy.".

They were ruthless and they were condescending. They could not understand this Buddhist country and their total lack of empathy created such a frustration that it was easy for the Maoist fraction to organize the full seizure of power after independence by assassinating the father of the independence of the country the General Aung San the father of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi.Then the rest is only circumstantial and anecdotic. The revolutionaries had to organize in 1962 a full military coup to keep the communist control over the country.Unluckily it has stubbornly not changed i n spite of the enormous changes that occurred in the world in China and in South East Asia. And that's dramatic though it could become tragic if the junta did not understand the necessity for change and did not keep the promises that are coming up now with the elections that are planned to take place soon in spite of the fact that elections already took place in the past and their results were nullified.The film is the story of this lady essentially from the moment she comes back to Myanmar to take care of her sick mother to the end of her first house arrest. This encompasses the death of her husband an Oxford University Professor and her decision to take the lead in the necessary evolution of Myanmar and the peaceful democratic change needed there.We discover the fate of a poor country when it is literally abandoned on the roadside of history. It is condemned to become poorer and poorer more and more desperate.The film does not consider the last ten years and the way this country has become crucial to the Chinese as a direct exit to the Indian Ocean which implies a deep change both politically and economically hence socially. The film does not consider the fact that all South East Asian countries are concerned by the development of the Mekong River as an essential industrial and commercial asset that could become will become an enormous electricity producer in an energy hungry area of the world. The Chinese have already done their share. The Laotians are in the last phase of doing theirs. Myanmar and then Thailand and Cambodia not to mention Vietnam have to follow suit.That's what I regret about this film. First the little consideration of the Buddhist spirituality and action that are essential for the future and second the economic stakes that are the real incentives to change. These are not explored in enough depth to really explain what is happening there.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "While it is certainly true that Aung San Suu Kyi has been and indeed remains a great figurehead for Burma and their struggle for democracy one wonders quite how after watching this film Besson managed to make it quite so long. This in fact is my main criticism. 'The Lady' is simply far too long and in addition to this is on a downhill slope after the initial stunning 10 minutes or so of cinematography. This opening was exciting moving and perfect in almost every way but from that point on the film just deteriorated. The use of music was excessive and I found it intensely irritating when practically every shot of the military junta was accompanied by 'evil' music. This simply trivialised a matter which is still relevant today and patronised the audience. Furthermore the dialogue between the junta leaders was a bit clumsy a bit stereotypical and a little bit soft.However this was a film that had bits of brilliance. David Thewlis was masterful and every bit of his heart and soul went into his performance. Michelle Yeoh was radiant although she looked a little bit out of her depth every once in a while when she let her character slip. It only happened a couple of times but that is enough. Typically for Luc Besson the shots were beautifully executed and I particularly liked the splicing of footage into reconstructed events. All these things however did not come together well enough. Perhaps the reason why this film doesn't hold together very well is that she has not finished yet. Aung San Suu Kyi's story is not over and she has not yet succeeded in her aims. The film itself just did not have enough substance to work with and in that respect it can be of some credit to the director that he made an unrealistic project into a passable film.".

He has such a natural and believable way about him in his roles that I find it hard not to be drawn into his character. He's definitely one of those actors who always plays himself but it doesn't matter as his ability and style just carry it off without a thought. A truly great actor in my mind.Matt Dillon is also very good although his younger trademark look of startled deer is ever present.The plot itself is a good one in that Hackman plays Dillons father a boring and very dull man with an equally dull job in his sons eyes anyway. What quickly transpires is that he is not the speed limit sticking man that his son first thought he is actually a ex CIA agent.This change is done very well with a short set piece in an airport. With the smallest of physical changes Hackman flips from average father to confident and action ready agent. You can see it in his manner and it shows his excellent capability as an actor.The rest of the movie reveals the story as father and son are pulled deeper and deeper into his life revealing the true extent of his agent activities. His son quickly realises that this is not the father he knew and quickly grows from offhandedness to total rejection and then to acceptance again.It is an interesting movie and the plot is quite good with some interesting action sequences. Where it fails are some of the other actors and the hectic pace of the movie it seems as though either in filming or editing that crucial parts of the movie have been missed or removed.Big shame but it is still good to watch for a Sunday afternoon movie. I think this may kick off my iwatch every Gene Hackman moviei campaign.".

Where this film shines is in the relationships between the characters and the quality of the acting. Mind you the plot and action aren't shabby either despite some comments here to the contrary.Perhaps this is merely middleage fantasy  how many middle aged dads or moms haven't had the fantasy of showing their sullen kids how cool they once were and could be again if necessary? I was fortunate not to have any sullen kids or grandkids but I've been in this guy's place and I recognized the looks on both faces. OK I was never a spy or anything so overtly cool but I did have my moments. The point is that there come inevitable times in the relationships between kids and parents when the kids suddenly realize that the old folks may have actually been cool before the kids even knew what cool was all about and that's the heart of this film.Contrary to some comments the plot is quite coherent with only a few holes which I won't elaborate. Some of the carping about plot points I've read here must have come from people lacking in either imagination or comprehension. The action is credible both in its pacing and execution. Not Arthur Penn's best film but this is as much of an actor's film as a director's film.The acting is uniformly good but Hackman holds the center of the film. If he weren't completely believable the whole effort would fall apart. Matt Dillon gives a very good performance as Hackman's sonfoil but isn't in the same league. The usually reliable Josef Sommer gives a surprisingly weak performance  OK but not up to his usual work. The late Herbert Berghof husband of Uta Hagen and cofounder with her of the eponymously named HB acting studio gives a master class in his portrayal of a truly sympathetic tortured soul  not much screen time but a real gem. Another standout is Viktoriya Fyodorova who offers some of the films most poignant scenes as Hackman's lovewhomighthavebeen who devotes herself to helping him and his son find his kidnapped wife.Highly recommended but it won't really resonate with the kids...".

They relaxedly fill in all the little character incongruities.The story is interesting but could have used much more exact local detail instead of this chain of insipid cutouts from travel brochures. The locals but also the spies talk and behave like cardboard figures and tend to lessen the atmosphere a little.

There aren't a lot of conventional thrillaction situations here its emotional and psychological and most of it works very well. I personally like the fact the violence is minimal in this film but there is enough to keep you chilled. The cocky kid who 'knows' better than dad resolves his feelings and relationship in the end while growing up may not be fully developed but I got the idea.The script was penned with 3 writers no wonder some of the storyline may stray. But I liked the clear relationships between Hackman and Dillon and found them likeable and believable never mind the mother gets lost somewhere.To compare this to a film in a similar genre I'd go with Harrison Ford in Frantic not the Eiger Sanction?!. I also want to complement Penn or whoever is responsible for using native speaking French and Russian actors I get very irritated when productions in foreign countries use American actors with SO fake accents. Native tongue productions always convey a veritecredible feel.".

Three  count 'em  three gorgeous women. Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon a couple of engaging actors. And it had an interesting premise too. Young man doesn't get along well with his dad discovers dad was a CIA spy develops new respect for him.But I just saw it again less distracted by the puzzling plot and it was something of a disappointment. The women are just as gorgeous Gene Hackman is as good as he almost always is and the shenanigans with the cars are as exciting but the rest seems pedestrian almost amateurishly done  from the script to the direction.I'll give you an example of what I mean. Hackman and Dillon are driving on a crowded road outside of Paris. Hackman is driving slowly and Dillon impatiently urges him to speed it up. Hackman his eyes on the rearview mirror says We've got company. Then he shifts into a lower gear and the Peugot leaps ahead. What are you doin'? Dillon exclaims. Seeing how good he is replies Hackman with a slight smile. There follows a high speed chase with cars twirling around on wet sandy roads through some kind of quarry and it ends with Hackman confronting the other driver and telling him to quit following him. The chase is fine. But it's pointless. Why is the car chase in the movie anyway? Seeing how GOOD he is? That's the reason these lives are put in danger for five hectic minutes? Not to mention the Peugots? That would be a great motive for a car chase in a kiddy cartoon.The rest of the plot is almost as weak. Matt Dillon's character is a complete irritation for the first third of the movie. He seems to have nothing but contempt for his father although Hackman doesn't seem to be guilty of much more than losing the kid's jitterbug bass lure. Dillon is always noodging him the way Captain Ahab was always noodging Moby Dick. The kid is a dumb selfindulgent slob and Hackman can never do anything right. Well  that's okay as a proposition but it's very poorly delivered and Dillon's character is turned into a strident stereotype. Furthermore Dillon himself gives an artless and unconvincing performance in a role that maybe nobody could convincingly enact. When Dillon finds out his father whom he'd thought to be an ineffective stickinthemud was a spy he almost begins to weep as he goes through his lines  You've been lying to me all this time. Dillon ought to be elated at discovering his Dad's secret identity.Another curious incident among so many curious incidents the evil guys and man do they LOOK evil with their black leather coats and their rimless spectacles as thick as Coke bottle bottoms have kidnapped Hackman's succulent wife Gale Hunnicutt because he has information they want him to spill. So the first thing they do when he steps off the plane is try to massacre him in a driveby shooting? Did I miss something? Why kill someone you need to wring information from?I won't go on I guess. It's still an engaging movie if you're seeing it for the first time because you don't know where it's going to turn next. And the location shooting is interesting too reminding us that in the middle of a chill wintry drizzle even Paris doesn't look so hot never mind Hamburg. It has other exciting moments that I haven't mentioned. Identities twist themselves inside out unexpectedly. I don't want to get into that and possibly debase the film's chief virtue.".

	schema:headline " Action flick that delivers and has some fun along the way.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've read some other reviews and blogs about how bad Hackman was a forced portrayal and that Dillon was a one note wooden character. I disagree because the movie works on the level it was designed for by having the most unlikely people involved in international intrigue. Hackman plays Walter Lloyd a mild mannered who lives in Dallas with his wife and son Chris played by Dillon. They have a shaky relationship at best with Chris resenting his father somewhat as a bumbling old fool and Walter's wife Donna also having issues with him for being less of a romantic husband. She is going on a trip to France but he doesn't want to go so she goes alone. The movie takes a while to get going until she is kidnapped and both father and son have to go and save her. Chris is all smug about going to France since he speaks French and thinks he will be the man having to lead his bumbling father around by the hand. That is until his dad rattles of French like a pro and gets tough with people. He then reveals to Chris that a long time ago he used to work for the CIA as a spy during the cold war and that with a wife and new baby on the way he had chosen to retire so he could be with them. He also tells Chris that his real name is Derrick Potter and that his name is really Duncan Walter aka Duncan would have made a lot of enemies during his spy days and he knew he had to keep his family safe hence why they were put into a type of witness protection program.The movie then takes off with Walter and Chris on the run from other factions who want both of them dead and a major double cross by one of the agents. The only thing I can see that keeps this movie from being better is what is changed from the book most notable that in the book Walter gets tough on Chris and slaps him for almost getting them killed and the assassin Carla is actually shot and killed later on after tricking Chris into exposing his father to another assassin.Also in the book the whole reason for the kidnapping of Walters wife is told in flashback  how they had caught 6 out of 7 German spies. The 7th spys family is murdered and its described in detail the killer is also described so we know it's not Walter. In the movie Walter simply jokes with Chris about almost getting them killed due to Chris's infatuation with the sexy assassin Carla and Carla is not killed She ends up getting slugged by Chris and sent flying across some cafe tables after she holds him at gunpoint revealing to Chris that she is one of the assassins sent to kill Chris and his father. She is not seen again after that scene. They do mention the circumstances around the 7th spy who got away but the murders are only briefly touched on by the 7th spy when he finally meets up with Walter they are not shown. The ending in the book is different too with Walter staying behind in Europe while Chris and his mother go home realizing how much Walter has changed and that he was not the fatherhusband they both thought they knewin the movie Chris Walter and Donna end up hugging each other in a field someplace in East Germany after they save her from the double agent and the cold war spy who thought Walter had killed his family. Overall though  810 .a bit uneven but entertaining with both Dillon and Hackman giving decent performances considering the characters are a bit underwritten.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've read some other reviews and blogs about how bad Hackman was a forced portrayal and that Dillon was a one note wooden character. I disagree because the movie works on the level it was designed for by having the most unlikely people involved in international intrigue. Hackman plays Walter Lloyd a mild mannered who lives in Dallas with his wife and son Chris played by Dillon. They have a shaky relationship at best with Chris resenting his father somewhat as a bumbling old fool and Walter's wife Donna also having issues with him for being less of a romantic husband. She is going on a trip to France but he doesn't want to go so she goes alone. The movie takes a while to get going until she is kidnapped and both father and son have to go and save her. Chris is all smug about going to France since he speaks French and thinks he will be the man having to lead his bumbling father around by the hand. That is until his dad rattles of French like a pro and gets tough with people. He then reveals to Chris that a long time ago he used to work for the CIA as a spy during the cold war and that with a wife and new baby on the way he had chosen to retire so he could be with them. He also tells Chris that his real name is Derrick Potter and that his name is really Duncan Walter aka Duncan would have made a lot of enemies during his spy days and he knew he had to keep his family safe hence why they were put into a type of witness protection program.The movie then takes off with Walter and Chris on the run from other factions who want both of them dead and a major double cross by one of the agents.

	schema:headline " Like 'Frantic' But Not As Good. minor spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of Target is quite reminiscint of Roman Polanski's Frantic which was released three years later. In the latter Harrison Ford plays a doctor who's wife is kidnapped during their stay in Paris. It had a lot of good action sequences like Harrison Ford dodging bullets on the roof of an apartment building and a good suspenseful story. In Target Gene Hackman and Matt Dillon play father and son Walter and Chris Lloyd. Walter's wife has been kidnapped during her visit to Paris and as both father and son will soon find out it is related to Walter's former work in the C.I.A. something of which his son was never aware.The movie spends more time with the fatherson bonding than it does in providing a very energetic story. This is because of the relationship between the characters who don't have much in common. This leads to a lot of interruption in what could be good action to have those fatherson moments.I think that is the downfall to what really could have been a good thriller. There were some good action scenes especially car chases but Walter and Chris seem to waste far too much time in this movie even though seem to remark about what an emergency it is to find Mrs. Lloyd and save her from the kidnappers. In 'Frantic' Harrison Ford's character  does a lot of bullet dodging and never seems to quit until he finds out what happened to his wife. In 'Target' on the other hand the scenes are often too slow moving despite the ability to be much better given the motive for kidnapping Walter's wife in the first place. That's really a shame too given the great potential you have with an actor like Gene Hackman who's proven he can do great things with action films see The French Connection and Enemy of the State. If this is the kind of movie you're looking for I'd recommend watching 'Frantic.'".

It's no surprise of course that the peril turns out to be caused by rot within the system by duplicity and weak character.

I'm not sure how I missed it back in 1985 because I'm a Hackman fan and usually like movies of this type.This is an OK film but not a great one. The locations are superb and there are enough car chases to keep guys like me happy. The basic idea of the film family of man with secret past must pay for his actions is all right too but it plays out in a rather clunky way. The story by the way was written by Leonard Stern the executive producer of the GET SMART TV show and the coinventor of Mad Libs. Hackman is the best part of the picture. Josef Sommer is also good but is basically playing the same role he played in WITNESS also in 1985. He could phone in a part like this. What drags this movie down is the thoroughly annoying Matt Dillon subplot. I'm not sure if it's just Dillon the actor that bothers me or his character. The screenwriters try to turn this film into a family drama where the father is reconciled to his son while they search for the kidnapped mother. But the son is SO stupid and annoying that if I were Gene Hackman I'd let the KGB put Dillon in a cement overcoat and toss him in the Baltic. IMHO this would have been a better film with Hackman searching by himself along with his former lover perhaps who is a more interesting character than Dillon.The closing climactic scene drags on WAY too long. The tension is gone long before it's over and the fadeout shot of the cuddly family is trite. If you think about it they're still in a LOT of trouble at that point probably more than an hour before! A much better film with a similar plot and good locations is the Harrison Ford vehicle FRANTIC. For spy fans TARGET is worth watching once but won't bear repeating.".

It is also a comedy that makes some fun of both genres although I am not sure if that is intentional.The acting and the direction are quite good the screenplay and maybe the editing less so. I suppose the main error is the decision to tell the story from the father's and the son's perspective alternatively. I think it would have been much better and thrilling to tell it from the son's entirely but in that case maybe it would have been impossible to use a big star in the father's role. The viewers become aware of the father's doubleidentity much earlier than the son in an incident at the airport that is unexpected weird outlandish and laughable. I really did not understand what was going on. The effect of surprise was thus given away pretty cheaply. I also think that the whole plot did not really make much sense  including the long dewiring of the human bomb mother at the end. Too much remains unexplained.But on the whole this is nevertheless a quite atmospheric movie with beautiful locations in Paris France and Germany. The highlight is a chase sequence through the town of Hamburg which involves a small red Fiat car a Mercedes taxicab and a small spluttering threewheel vehicle. Hackman jumps into a canal and Dillon drives the Fiat up some pretty steep flights of stairs. So I do not think I wasted my time entirely.To any viewer interested in Hackman playing a dad I can highly recommend the movie Class Action in which a brilliant Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays his daughter.".

That incident is then left incomplete and we are introduced to the owner Boss Brochu and his family.  Brochu is a middleaged widower who is the manager of a shabby service station somewhere in Qubec.  He's developed Parkinson's and he needs the help of his three sons to continue in business but the two older sons have no interest while the youngest is willing but only 14.The film is set in 1989.  Selfservice stations are forcing small and marginal service stations out of business and this one has almost as many robbers as paying customers.  It serves mainly as a hangout for an assortment of oddballs who gather every day to smoke joke around and pass the time.  Think of several Cliff Clavens with a Qubec accent.  Brochu knows the writing is on the wall but he knows nothing else but work and seems to think that if he can keep the business going he can keep his family together.Rejean however wants to be a blues musician.  He runs off to play his harmonica whenever he can abandoning the more conventional son Guy to cover for him.  But even Guy has had enough and he leaves to photograph Berlin after the fall of the Wall.Eventually we return to the armed robbery and see its dramatic denouement. Boss admits the inevitable and closes the gas bar.  He makes peace with Guy and Rejean and with his illness.This is an honest moving and charming film clearly bearing the imprint of personal experience.  The cast led by popular Qubec comedian Serge Thriault as the paterfamilias is uniformly excellent.  At 115 minutes I would say it runs 10 minutes long.  The Berlin episode should have been excised.  Mostly it serves as an excuse for Blanger to selfindulgently display his own arty photographs and to make a rather strained analogy between the East Berliners and people like Brochu who are economically obsolete.The subtitles of the very colloquial working class language of the characters are generally excellent.  However my companion assured me that the dialogue identifies Boss as 59 whereas the subtitles say 54.  Given that he looks about 65 it's a rather significant point.".

Scott lying in the sun is sprinkled with glittery particles that quickly evaporate. Later he is accidentally sprayed with an insecticide while driving and in the next few days he finds that he has begun to shrink. First just a few inches so that his clothes no longer fit then a little more. Soon he is only three feet tall and a national curiosity. At six inches tall he can only live in a doll's house and even that becomes impossible when his cat breaks in. Scott flees to the cellar his wife thinks he has been eaten by the cat and the door to the cellar is closed trapping him in the littered room where menaced by a giant spider he struggles to survive.";

Critics question why the mist did not affect others including the wife but the doctor's Raymond Bailey explanation later is that Carey was accidentally previously exposed to insecticides the 2 compounds in his system reacted together to create the phenomenon. This idea was used in The Leech Woman  1960 also with Williams where fluid from a male pineal gland had to be mixed with a floral powder to achieve youth. As a kid I was in awe with the attacks from an ordinary cat and a spider but as an adult one feels great sympathy for this character and his family. Williams a handsome Nordic blonde gives a beautiful performance and narrates over much of the film which later has no dialogue but greatly aided by a magnificent score the title piece is haunting with its Trumpet solo set against an advancing cloud that gets bigger while the human frame dwindles. Stuart is terrific as the suffering wife faintly resembling Dinah Shore she even costarred with Shore's exhusband George Montgomery in the following year's Man From God's Country  1958 her last film. April Kent daughter of actress June Havoc did she have a sister named May? is warm and sympathetic in her two scenes playing a midget although not when Williams is 3 feet high a poignant interlude. The special effects are supremely done. The first 3 words of the title have become part of our culture even recently a major magazine heading stated The Incredible Shrinking... on its cover. Director Jack Arnold paces beautifully Richard Matheson script is intelligent and the closing scenes have a soaring wondrous quality that few films have ever matched.".

The smaller Scott Carey gets the braver and more resourceful he becomes. As he shrinks he reaches a kind of spiritual enlightenment.The only sour note besides the special effects which may seem primitive by today's digital standards but which I as an 8yearold in 1957 seeing this for the first time thought were astounding is the scene with the Little People. The metaphor of you are as big as you feel is laid on pretty thick and that particular set of special effects especially that big coffee cup Clarice drinks out of didn't fool me even as an 8yearold. Incidentally up until recently TV showings of this movie usually cut that scene out although the names of the actors who played the Little People were left in the end of movie credits.However the point is well taken and Scott realizes that as his physical size decreases his mental and spiritual powers are increasing. The final scenes are a testament to Transcendentalism. For example Scott says in the narration that he no longer hates the spider who has been threatening him during his imprisonment in the cellar. He understands that it has as much right to survive as he has. In Transcendental terms he is saying that existence is neither good nor evil it simply is. Do people in California really have tarantulas in their cellars? The wonderful last scene where Scott the absolutely gorgeous Grant Williams bruised battered exhausted looks up at the heavens and is no longer afraid is one of the most empowering scenes in all cinema. This man has been so beaten down by fate that he is literally disappearing and yet he affirms existence and resolutely continues to move forward to whatever that next plane of existence may be. This ending is a far cry from the usual finales of scifi films of the 50s where destruction is generally the resolution of the crisis. Here there is no destruction only transcendence. I never get tired of this film.".

Legendary author Richard Matheson is to be congratulated for his truly excellent script as should be Arnold for putting his ideas on the screen with such vividness and imagination. Special mention must go too to Grant Williams for his fine performance Jack Arnold seemed to think it was worthy of an Oscar and I can't say I disagree!It was interesting to see that the title character's peculiar affliction effected him gradually and not all at once the fact that this was caused by exposure to radiation must have struck a note of panic amid contemporary anxietyridden audiences this was the Cold War era after all and in any case it was inevitable that such 'monstrous' radiation effects as seen mutating various forms of animal life on the screens of 1950s America would not spare man himself in the long run. An episode featuring sideshow midgets with whom The Shrinking Man seems to identify for a little while is quite moving  as is his jealous possessiveness of his wife who he suspects wants to abandon him.Despite the low budget the film's special effects are terrific and the second half of the story basically resolves itself into a struggle for survival for our unfortunate hero as he has to battle various elements the family cat a spider water the redimension of objects around him his own weakness due to hunger which a normal person would more or less take for granted.I thoroughly enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN  though I must say that Matheson's bleak yet strangely affecting ending blew me away giving the film an intellectual resonance lacking in most films of its type and period.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a businessman Scott Carey Grant Williams is infected by a mysterious cloud of mist on a boating vacation little does he know how his life and whole way of existing are about to change. After six months of normal life he notices he has lost a little weight and height and that this strange loss of size is continuous. He keeps growing smaller and smaller every day to the amazement of doctors and to the chagrin of his wife Randy Stuart. Soon everyday things become grave dangers to him and he has to completely let go of his old way of comprehending his place in life.The oversized props and the creative trick photography that is used to create the illusion of shrinking must have looked absolutely stunning in the 1950s when the film first came out because they still look impressive when I'm typing this in 2010. Carey's struggles with unexpected sources of terror like a cat a mousetrap or a spider haven't lost any of their charm over the decades they are still edgeofyourseat suspense and I'm not saying this as any kind of affirmative action in favour of old movies  I genuinely haven't been this thrilled by a movie in a long time! Besides the visual effects the riveting music is also perfectly in tune with the thrilling style of the film.Even though the film can easily be enjoyed as a great scifi suspense film there's also a deeper more personal level to it. Carey truly develops as a character over the course of the film. He is aware of his frustration and changing moods and scolds himself for being rude to his wife and not being able to take the new challenges bravely headon. The sense of loneliness created excellently with beautiful black  white cinematography and camera angles has been said to mirror the fearful atmosphere of the Cold War and the nuclear era. This is a valid interpretation but it's also possible to see Carey's journey as a symbol of Man's existential despair and feelings of inadequacy in life that is seemingly normal and mundane. The grandiose finale provides a majestic ending for the tale of newfound selfesteem all my worries about a predictably tackedon happy ending were proved unnecessary.I wrote this review immediately after seeing the film for the first time. These words came out completely without effort and that is to me a sign of an honestly compelling cinematic experience. The Incredible Shrinking Man is a delight to watch not the least bit goofy or dated like some other old scifi films. I recommend it for every fan of the genre admirers of imaginative special effects and anyone interested in existential character studies.".

He keeps growing smaller and smaller every day to the amazement of doctors and to the chagrin of his wife Randy Stuart. Soon everyday things become grave dangers to him and he has to completely let go of his old way of comprehending his place in life.The oversized props and the creative trick photography that is used to create the illusion of shrinking must have looked absolutely stunning in the 1950s when the film first came out because they still look impressive when I'm typing this in 2010. Carey's struggles with unexpected sources of terror like a cat a mousetrap or a spider haven't lost any of their charm over the decades they are still edgeofyourseat suspense and I'm not saying this as any kind of affirmative action in favour of old movies  I genuinely haven't been this thrilled by a movie in a long time! Besides the visual effects the riveting music is also perfectly in tune with the thrilling style of the film.Even though the film can easily be enjoyed as a great scifi suspense film there's also a deeper more personal level to it. Carey truly develops as a character over the course of the film. He is aware of his frustration and changing moods and scolds himself for being rude to his wife and not being able to take the new challenges bravely headon. The sense of loneliness created excellently with beautiful black  white cinematography and camera angles has been said to mirror the fearful atmosphere of the Cold War and the nuclear era. This is a valid interpretation but it's also possible to see Carey's journey as a symbol of Man's existential despair and feelings of inadequacy in life that is seemingly normal and mundane. The grandiose finale provides a majestic ending for the tale of newfound selfesteem all my worries about a predictably tackedon happy ending were proved unnecessary.I wrote this review immediately after seeing the film for the first time. These words came out completely without effort and that is to me a sign of an honestly compelling cinematic experience. The Incredible Shrinking Man is a delight to watch not the least bit goofy or dated like some other old scifi films. I recommend it for every fan of the genre admirers of imaginative special effects and anyone interested in existential character studies.";

This was a fascinating film for both me and my two brothers.Seeing this again about 10 years ago still was interesting but of course it didn't have the scary tone it once did but one can't expect that. Seeing films as an adult is quite different from seeing them as a young child. Also one can't expect the specialeffects to be anywhere approaching today's caliber but it's not bad in this old film and certainly topnotch for its day. Almost everyone agrees this was tons better than most of the schlocky '50s scifi films.Not only is it done pretty well but it's a good story and with a good ending. That ending is different too in that the man Grant Williams by the way playing Scott Carey is not cured but he doesn't die either. He just accepts his condition with an interesting speech at the end.It's dated and doesn't have the impact of course it did when it came out but it's anything but a stupid movie and worth seeing.".

To see Scott CareyWilliams dodge water drops scale a wood crate and battle a spider is something to be seen! The acting is very good and the pace moves along well. The special effects alone could have carried the film and almost does. Clifford Stine did a magnificent job. Jack Arnold does his usual fine job directing.

To see Scott CareyWilliams dodge water drops scale a wood crate and battle a spider is something to be seen! The acting is very good and the pace moves along well. The special effects alone could have carried the film and almost does. Clifford Stine did a magnificent job. Jack Arnold does his usual fine job directing. This is a classic from the 1950s and shouldn't be missed.";

Hollywood had to convey its messages in the guise of scifi or historical analogy.This spare cheap blackandwhite film starring unknowns has the ruthless unswerving narrative drive of an arrow into a bullseye. No subplots no diversions nothing but the examination of what it is like to lose everything to be stripped not only of the material consolations of conformity but the emotional insulation of marriage and friendship.Shrinking the MacGuffin of a nuclear cloud means nothing is a visual metaphor for exile and disillusionment. The hero becomes an outcast by becoming progressively more freakish until he is invisible or at any rate irretrievable. Yet every stage of deprivation has its consolations. Once he falls through the floor he escapes the attentions of the pruriently curious and the need to pay his way by performing for them and although at first the grille in the cellar is like the barred window of a prison shrinking further means he can squeeze through and leave the fearsome cat trapped behind.All this is very American in its qualified optimism and very characteristic of Richard Matheson's imagination as one of the great popular mythmakers of midcentury. Not for him the easy slither into plastic angst. Scott Carey's reversion to the primitive long hair needlesword ragged robes mocks his former status but also looks forward to the hippie protagonists who would soon reject social norms and carve out their own psychic territory.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1950's SciFiction scene had a slew of cheesy BList scifi movies featuring rubber aliens or giant bugs. In the midst of all this there came this wonderful and provocative film. A true classic. It's a great movie to watch but it's such a downer. Directed by Jack Arnold the film is based off Richard Matheson's novel 'The Shrinking Man'. Richard Matheson came up with the idea while watching an apparently incidental during the 1953's musical Let's Do it Again' in which an actor puts on hat belonging to someone else whom is has a much bigger head. This became the basis for one of the best scifi novels of the 1950s. The book was able to capture the nuclear war fears of the shifting Coldwar era and the different politics of each party. While its premise might seem like BMovie material Richard Matheson wrote the story with such detail tragedy and drama that makes it watchable from start to finish. The movie follows that same direction. The movie is about Scott Carey Grant Williams a happy marriage businessman while on vacation off the coast of California got exposes to a large strange poisonous cloud. The radioactive material from the cloud start to have a weird react to Scott's body forcing him to get smaller and smaller by the day. Scott Carey's life become a living hell as he's force to cope with his every changing standards. The movie depth with the psychological toll of the man whom afraid of what's happening to him and hates how other people are reacting to him. The movie has no idea of dwarfism looks like but you really get a taste of how life is like for people that go through dwarfism. While you don't see him suffer the physical genetic maleffects of dwarfism like malformed bones or bowleg or knock knee deformities. You see him go through somewhat of a castration anxiety in his masculinity. A good example of this is how bitter and angry he got with his wife Louise Carey Randy Stuart as she began to tower over him accusing her of treating him like a child. You really see his lostlove life. While the movie never focus on the sexual tension between the two due to 1950's censorship you get hints of it through the crafty words they were able to use to show their tense relationship. It's get harder and harder for him to find his libido. Estranged from his wife you feel for him as he tries to find any sense of connection. Great use of symbolism when Carey's wedding ring slides off his finger. I'm glad they at less took the way too disturbing behavior of him turning into a sexual predator trying to get with the babysitter. That would had ruin the film for me. The movie really digs deeper as Carey's life get more limited. Each day become more of a day to day survival when Carey shrink to the size of a bug forcing him to fight against house cats and terrifying tarantula. This is where the best of special effects play in. For a 50s lowbudget film while the special effects are dated the effects are impressive. The use of rear projection split screen and model effects all help convey Carey's dwindling size. The best scifi is the kind that focuses on the people rather than the technology. Take a premise speculate how it will affect human behavior and interaction and you get profound movies like this. The acting in this movie are great from Grant Williams as the lead to its supporting cast. There are some different between the book and the movie such as Carey's daughter being absent. The structure too has been significantly altered as the film has no flashbacks to his happier days. The film has this linear dogmatic narrative. The result is a film is a doomladen tone. No wonder why the director felt it necessary to add a somewhat optimism tone to the bittersweet ending. This is actually a unique way to end a movie and in a way inspiration and very easy to relate to. We all sometimes have to try to find that kind of closure in real life. The movie really become haunting as it pluck at our fears about illness loss of control and death. All handle a pulpy concept with intelligence and integrity. The film won the first Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation presented in 1958 by the World Science Fiction Convention. In 2009 it was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally historically or aesthetically significant and will be preserved for all time. Matheson made a number of novel sequel to the film such as 2006's Fantastic Little Girl alternately titled The Fantastic Shrinking Girl but a film version was never produced as of this writing. Indeed a 1981's The Incredible Shrinking Woman movie was made but it little to do with the original source material and play off as a comedy. 1989's Honey I Shrunk the Kids is by far the best movie since this movie to use the shrinking SciFiction concept. Overall A great philosophical film worth watching. If a remake movie was to be made let's hope it's keep the emotional depth needed.".

The shrinking though leading to obvious set pieces is almost secondary to the emotional and social consequences of such a transformation certainly in the 1950s as his wife played excellently by Randy Stuart begins to tower over him and as a result he now standing at about three feet tall begins to exert an enormous amount of power and domination as his size leads to an evergrowing insecurity complex.This is a kin to a man being wheelchair bound and feeling inadequate for example. But these themes are very well portrayed in a Sci Fi film of its time but proof that there are a few films pushing and even breaking the mold of the day. But when all is said and done this is a film with the title The Incredible Shrinking Man which actually takes a mature philosophical and metaphysical route rather than just cheap thrills and spills.But as for the action you couldn't really ask for more as once he ends up a few inches tall and trapped in his own basement he must battle mouse traps flowing water great chasms and the infamous spider all in a struggle to claim a small piece of stale cake left there by his wife But considering its age and special effect limitations of the day this looks spectacular thrilling exciting gripping and scary and with real motivations and a believable ethos Carey is striving for dominance in his new macro world. Overall I really liked this which took an abnormal situation grounded it with real character studies and a plausible analysis of the situations at hand make this a valuable entry into Science Fiction cannon.".

The final part of the movie has Carey struggling for survival in the basement dealing first with a flood from a broken water heater then fighting a brutal battle with a hungry spider. The final scene shows Carey wandering into the yard at night where he disappears among the blades of grass.Several 1950s scifi stalwarts appear in the film including Raymond Bailey and William Schallert as doctors and the dependable Paul Langton as Carey's brother. April Kent is very pretty and appealing as a tiny circus performer to whom Carey is attracted but unfortunately she is only on screen for a brief time. Randy Stuart shows great patience while dealing with a petulant Carey and his horrible condition. Williams nearly carries the film by himself showing a onceinacareer acting range while maintaining believability at all times through the rest of his career he never again showed this kind of talent. This oversized sets such as the giant furniture telephone and pencil give the movie an almost surreal feeling.

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen this one for at least 7 years so it was somewhat built up in my mind when I sat down to watch it yesterday. Some things occurred just as I remembered them while others were much different. For instance I remembered the scenes of Carey and Clarice to be more numerous but there were only two and each quite brief. Likewise I thought their final scene occurred back at the caf but instead it happens on a park bench. I also totally forgot about Carey's final voiceover! Kind of funny how memory distorts things.Anyhow I wasn't able to appreciate this as a kid but in retrospect I thought of it as being quite profound so I was excited to revisit it. Thankfully it turns out to have aged quite well. Unlike the modern genre film or at least the modern mainstream genre film which relies almost exclusively on spectacle this combined the top notch special effects of its day with some top notch writing courtesy of Richard Matheson. Though not all of the effects hold up some of the compositing is pretty bad this is still an incredibly strong film thanks to the thoughtful script some very good performances and some suspenseful direction from Jack Arnold. What sets this apart from most films of its ilk is the focus on human drama. Whereas a lot of films might be built around setpieces which this film certainly has its share of this has a healthy focus on the deterioration of Carey's marriage and his crumbling ego. Grant William's performance as Scott Carey is especially affecting as he effortlessly segues from sympathetic victim to bitter tyrant and finally a zenlike acceptance. While I already mentioned the dubious compositing most of the special effects hold up pretty well thanks to some clever use of forced perspective and giant sets and props. The creativity that went into the various sequences of Carey fighting for survival in the basement is admirable. His fight with the spider is still absolutely horrifying. As for his battle with the cat it's pretty suspenseful but definitely a bit humorous. The only decision I still find to be somewhat detrimental is the casting of an average sized woman as the diminutive Clarice. That we're supposed to buy that this woman is an actual little person especially with Billy Curtis in the same scene! is ludicrous and somewhat offensive. Would it have been so hard to cast a female dwarf?Besides that it's still a great movie. I do think the ending might have been a little more profound without the final voiceover but it's still a very haunting sequence. For years after my first viewing the visual of the tiny Carey climbing through the window screen stayed with me! And the way everything that can go wrong does with Carey makes this an incredibly nailbiting even depressing experience but also ensures that the audience remains sympathetic towards him. For now I have to applaud Matheson and the filmmakers for using such an unconventional ending. Matheson for envisioning it and the filmmakers for choosing to stick with it. Thanks to their decision this remains a film that will continue to challenge viewers for years to come.".

Though not all of the effects hold up some of the compositing is pretty bad this is still an incredibly strong film thanks to the thoughtful script some very good performances and some suspenseful direction from Jack Arnold. What sets this apart from most films of its ilk is the focus on human drama. Whereas a lot of films might be built around setpieces which this film certainly has its share of this has a healthy focus on the deterioration of Carey's marriage and his crumbling ego. Grant William's performance as Scott Carey is especially affecting as he effortlessly segues from sympathetic victim to bitter tyrant and finally a zenlike acceptance. While I already mentioned the dubious compositing most of the special effects hold up pretty well thanks to some clever use of forced perspective and giant sets and props. The creativity that went into the various sequences of Carey fighting for survival in the basement is admirable. His fight with the spider is still absolutely horrifying. As for his battle with the cat it's pretty suspenseful but definitely a bit humorous. The only decision I still find to be somewhat detrimental is the casting of an average sized woman as the diminutive Clarice. That we're supposed to buy that this woman is an actual little person especially with Billy Curtis in the same scene! is ludicrous and somewhat offensive. Would it have been so hard to cast a female dwarf?Besides that it's still a great movie. I do think the ending might have been a little more profound without the final voiceover but it's still a very haunting sequence. For years after my first viewing the visual of the tiny Carey climbing through the window screen stayed with me! And the way everything that can go wrong does with Carey makes this an incredibly nailbiting even depressing experience but also ensures that the audience remains sympathetic towards him. For now I have to applaud Matheson and the filmmakers for using such an unconventional ending. Matheson for envisioning it and the filmmakers for choosing to stick with it. Thanks to their decision this remains a film that will continue to challenge viewers for years to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps no movie since Network Sidney Lumet 1976 has sledgehammered television quite so thoroughly as Assassins. But where Network took the business of television for its target Assassins aims at the medium's ubiquity and its desensitizing effect on viewers. It's not a novel point of course and even the spin writerdirector Mathieu Kassovitz decides to give it  the effect TV has in creating a culture of violence  is neither fresh nor unquestioned. The story at the film's center is about an aging professional hit man Mr. Wagner Michel Serrault who takes on a young petty thief Max Kassovitz as his apprentice. It's set in the Parisian banlieus that were the sociopolitical milieu for Kassovitz's earlier and much better film about violence La Haine 1995. It opens with Mr. Wagner guiding Max into the brutal and entirely gratuitous murder of an elderly man Robert Gendreu and then flashes back to bring the story up to a recapitulation of the event  rubbing our noses in it so to speak. Max is a layabout and a screwup but there is a core of reluctance within him that Mr. Wagner is determined to obliterate. Eventually Max takes on his own protg a teenager named Mehdi Mehdi Benoufa who is decidedly not reluctant to engage in a little killing seeing it as just an extension of the videogames he plays. Throughout the film television sets are blaring game shows commercials sitcoms and even nature documentaries in the background an ironic if sometimes heavyhanded counterpoint to the murders committed by Mr. Wagner Max and Mehdi. Kassovitz stages much of the film well extracting full shock value and he sometimes embroiders the realism of the story with surreal touches At one point when Mr. Wagner is walking away from Max we see a demonic tail emerge from beneath Wagner's overcoat  or is it Max perpetually stoned who sees this? More effectively reinforcing Kassovitz's treatment of the effects of television Mehdi  who is coming unglued after his first commissioned hit  watches a TV sitcom about a group of young people that suddenly turns into violent necrophiliac pornography accompanied by a laugh track. Kassovitz showed undeniable talent with La Haine and some of it is on display here. Assassins was booed at the Cannes festival and has never received a wide commercial release in the United States but it's something of a fascinating if often repellent failure.".

The movie is by far too gloomy. Cinema cannot be an Art for the Art's sake it definitely has to do with entertainment. People go to the movies hoping to get out relieved from such concerns as screen violence  social issues. These people are not only fatbrained teens starving for action blockbusters it would be wrong to think entertainment is for loweducated masses. People want laughs mostly thrills escape from the dull scares not too scary though... but they do not want a distressing movie.Hence Assassins does not cater for a large audience. I found it great despite its darkness because I am sensitive to its top class directorial and writing skills. Yet the poor marketing skills make it a somewhat suicidal experience for a young director and fortunately Kassovitz has been granted the expensive privilege of learning directly from his mistakes. Just hoping Les Rivires Pourpres brought him back his selfconfidence to avoid outofthebox happy endings in the future.".

Fake sunflowers.5. The mental institution scene. The police must investigate. So they go to the mental institution where everyone is insanely happy. Of course the head guy there starts dancing while the police are being attacked by all of the loonies. The best part comes when they're both leaving the place and Don Johnson seems not at all scared or worried but casually pushes or slugs the crazies that are bugging him.

Don't take this film seriously just watch it for laughs....a great party movie.";

But the real hero behind all of this is Clint Howard the Ice Cream Man. I cant believe this movie was made in the 90's. It looks like a cheap 80's movie. But what do you expect from a director which only movie experience is from porn movies.I can't believe this is supposed to be a serious movie. The first time I watched this movie I had to rewind almost every scene. I couldn't believe my eyes. Where they really serious about this? At sometimes it seems like an exciting adventure movie for children the ones where a group of kids make a secret club or something to catch the bad guys. Just like the Monster Squad. Other times it seems like a comedy and some times even family movie. But then these nasty scenes appear and totally switch the tone of the movies so randomly. It's hard to explain but I just can't seem to understand the setting of the movie something that really bothers me about the movie. Not that you can take it seriously anyway.I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves trash cinema. This is accidental art.".

Ick.Anyway the plot's really just an excuse to show of the...well the...um well it's a plot.  Oh wait I know!  It's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos!  There's Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II The sequel? as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream.  And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk.Even better than that are some of the bizarre goofs in the film.

And the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man.  Who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man?  Then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene in which Jan Michael Vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness.  These are the cops who also scour the Ice Cream Man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck where of course the various bodies and such are kept.  Oh well better luck next time troops.Howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him.  It's all just plain dumb.  And fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata.  You'll have a GOOD laugh with the right sense of HUMOR.  I love that one.".

However Gregory is a new ice cream man  there's something not right about him maybe it's the fact that he had huge syringe's of green goo injected into his head when he was younger as part of his 'treatment' in Wishing Wells mental hospital? Maybe it's the fact he kills dogs  puts them though a food crusher? Maybe it's because he drives around with various body parts eyeballs  combat knives in the back of his van? Or maybe it has something to do with the disturbing fact he makes his ice cream of people he kills? It's up to detectives Gifford JanMichael Vincent  Maldwyn LeeMajors II to try  discover what's happening to all the missing people...Produced  directed by Paul Norman as Norman Apstein I though Ice Cream Man had potential that it didn't really live up to. The script by Sven Davison  David Dobkin has an intriguing premise one that has that juxtaposition where ice cream men are considered good  deal with children all the time  this film turns the ice cream man into an evil killer. The film definitely does't take itself seriously  at times feels like a spoof however the filmmaking is uneven  the horror comedy  spoof elements seem almost random  don't gel that well. There are a few amusing moments in it like after having killed  used a local woman for ice cream ingredients Gregory finds a female condom in the bottom of his bowl there are one or two gross moments in it like closeups of people eating ice cream with eyeballs in but for the most part once I got over the initial premise I found it rather dull pedestrian  boring. If it wasn't for the ice cream man turned killer gimmick this film would have nothing going for it nothing at all. Some of the ice cream related one liners  twisted imagery paper over the cracks but underneath this is a poor film that runs out of ideas very quickly. The character's are alright the kids weren't as annoying as I'd expected  while the parents are given some background  story to start with they are quickly forgotten  don't feature at all in the second half of the film.Director Norman or should that be Apstein judging by his IMDb profile is far more used to porn  has over 100 credited to him including being responsible for the Edward Penishands 1991 series he also seems to have appeared in the classic British horror film Village of the Damned 1960 as one of the village children amazing eh? The film has a reasonable level of competence  it has a few memorable scenes but there's nothing spectacular here. In case your wondering no children at all are killed in Ice Cream Man. Gore wise things are OK there's various body parts  eyeballs someone has a spike stuck through their chin  it exits from the top of their head  there's a few impressive decapitated heads including one in an oversized ice cream cone...With a supposed budget of about 2000000 which is a fair amount Ice Cream Man is generally well made but nothing special apparently according to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section it was sponsored by a shoe company  that it has a 'extraordinary number of shots of shoes' I must admit I can only remember one  the low level shots of peoples feet as Tuna hides under a shelf in the supermarket. Anyway what difference does it make. The cast here is surprisingly good Clint Howard JanMichael Vincent Olivia Hussey David Warner David Naughton  Lee Major's son! Unfortunately they aren't used that well  a potentially great cast is somewhat wasted.Ice Cream Man has an attention grabbing title  central premise that once you get past there is actually very little here to like or recommend a valiant effort at something a bit different but it doesn't quite come off.".

The film has a reasonable level of competence  it has a few memorable scenes but there's nothing spectacular here. In case your wondering no children at all are killed in Ice Cream Man. Gore wise things are OK there's various body parts  eyeballs someone has a spike stuck through their chin  it exits from the top of their head  there's a few impressive decapitated heads including one in an oversized ice cream cone...With a supposed budget of about 2000000 which is a fair amount Ice Cream Man is generally well made but nothing special apparently according to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section it was sponsored by a shoe company  that it has a 'extraordinary number of shots of shoes' I must admit I can only remember one  the low level shots of peoples feet as Tuna hides under a shelf in the supermarket. Anyway what difference does it make. The cast here is surprisingly good Clint Howard JanMichael Vincent Olivia Hussey David Warner David Naughton  Lee Major's son! Unfortunately they aren't used that well  a potentially great cast is somewhat wasted.Ice Cream Man has an attention grabbing title  central premise that once you get past there is actually very little here to like or recommend a valiant effort at something a bit different but it doesn't quite come off.";

The result is a goofy 84 minute diversion more a dark comedy than a true outandout horror film. It successfully goes for the gross out on a few occasions especially when the camera prowls around the interior of the ice cream truck and shows roaches and rats crawling around in the ice cream.

Neal is an environmental activist sent to Washington to help stop a bill that would allow drilling for natural gas in the habitat set aside by the government for the endangered California Condor. An evil oil company is sponsoring a bill in Washington that would allow them and only them to drill  thus disrupting the Condor's delicate breeding patterns. She crashes a swank DC party to try to gain access to the Department of the Interior bureaucrat who's been ducking her where she runs into a kindly retired Admiral Gwenn better known as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street who is taken by her and agrees to introduce her to one of his many Washington pals the sleazy but suave lobbyist lawyer played by Mature. What neither of them knows is that the Admiral is in fact an engraver at the Bureau of Printing and Engraving who's been forging party invitations for himself for years and has adopted the persona of a retired admiral. And Mature infatuated with Neal has to hide the fact that he's in fact the lobbyist hired by the gas company to get the special interest bill through Congress! Screwball complications ensue of course while Neal tries to get protection for the condors Mature tries to seduce her without actually helping her against the interest of his client and Gwenn finds his cover story unraveling the more he tries to help Neal all under the comic theme of the whiff of corruption in government business.The acting is fine here hardly true screwball but with believable performances by all three principles. Neal isn't quite enough of a sex bomb to explain Mature's infatuation and her natural intelligence and selfpossession bely the fact she's supposed to be something of a naif around DC. Nevertheless her portrayal is earnest and just enough tongue in cheek. Mature himself is just creepy enough to be credible as a sleazoid lobbyist although his Blist looks also don't suggest much chemistry with Neal. Gwenn is his usual sophisticated self playing the double role of Washington insider and humble engraver.Modern sensibilities may be a bit perturbed by the comic use of the Condor's plight but on the other hand it's a sober reminder of how little has changed that the plot would be just as plausible if remade today.Wait for this hilariously obscene line in the middle of the movie which somehow slipped by the censors Unpack that 16 gun!".

The plot is about gas companies vs. conservationists trying to save the California condor. Gas was first drilled for in 1821 and there have been conservationists since before Thoreau so this was an old story by 1950. Furthermore California's Audubon Society had been fighting to preserve the condor's habitat since the 1930s. So Mr. Wall seems to be among the disturbingly long list of people who assume nothing much of interest happened before they were alive to hear about it.What's more this environmentally conscious movie is hardly a first for Hollywood. To name a very famous example which this film resembles Mr. Smith Goes to Washington 1939 centered around the battle against dambuilders for the establishment of a national boys' camp.The script credited to I.A.L. Diamond among others has enough wit so that it hardly needed the screwball spin or the accompanying silly musical score. Victor Mature at his oiliest is perfect to play the Washington lobbyist named Steve though he's not exactly a light footed comic actor. On the other hand Edmund Gwenn and Patricia Neal bring their reliable gifts to their roles both exude intelligence dignity and disarming honesty.The IMDb entry for Memorable quotes is empty but there are more than a few good lines in this allbutforgotten filmNo one has ever accused me of being unpatriotic. In fact I was the first man in the House to speak out against the Japanese beetle.Congressman Is it your practice to distribute gifts to people in high places? Lobbyist Only to those who accept them.You know how it is in Washington. The more you deny something the more everybody believes it.Said of a widow That's quite an accomplishment surviving a Southern congressman.Journalist You'd barbecue your grandmother on the Capitol steps for a buck.

	schema:reviewBody "In Something for the Birds you get a history lesson on how government works...and it's not always a happy and nice lesson! Like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington it talks about the nastier aspects at times as it follows a lobbyist and shows how deals get made. But unlike the Capra movie this one is all about romance and comedy and takes a lighter look at Congressional 'gifts'.The story begins with Anne Patricia Neal crashes a Washington party in order to try to influence people about the plight of the California Condor...a bird that is still on the brink of extinction today. Unfortunately she meets two people who might not be the best to meet under the circumstances...the Admiral Edmund Gwenn and a professional lobbyist Steve Bennett Victor Mature. Why? Well while the Admiral is sympathetic and even helps Anne in her campaign he's NOT a real admiral and has been posing as one for years in order to attend all the best parties! And with Steve she has just started a friendship with a guy whose company is lobbying against saving the Condors! How does all this work out and will there be a happily ever after for everyone...including the Condors?Despite being highly idealistic especially in regard to the 'Admiral' when his ruse is discovered the film also does give insights into the sleazy world of lobbying. It also makes for a dandy romcom....one well worth seeing and quite enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long before Texas had a governor named Ann Richards there was Patricia Neal playing environmentalist Anne Richards out to save the California Condor from extinction when their sanctuary was threatened by a fuel company drilling for gas. Tough Neal is bold enough to crash a politician's private gathering where she encounters retired Navy Admiral Edmund Gwenn another one of his many cute old man parts who takes her under his wing yet seems to have some private motivations of his own that may or may not be on the up and up. Romance develops between the very determined Neal and powerful Victor Mature and in another case of the type of plot commonly called CapraCorn the stage is set for two people on opposite sides to come together and do what is right while love blossoms between them.There's a witty screenplay in this Robert Wise directed romantic comedy with political and environmental themes that makes the film more watchable than it could have been in lesser hands. The problem is that great dialog doesn't always mean a strong story and here the balancing act between romance politics and environmentalism isn't always smooth. Perhaps the most amusing moments come from the bird imitator who is so good at his craft that he fools them as they walk through a park and listen to the various bird sounds all of a sudden perplexed by one very rare to the area.".
