The relationship between these very different young women is complex and satisfying.Since the movie is about women and the female roles are so strong this movie has been dubbed a chick flick but that pejorative is unfair.

I was little then and didn't know what I was missing. My mother kept telling me how good of a movie this was but I was just too stubborn and didn't pay attention. It was only a few months ago that I decided to watch it when it appeared on TV and boy was I surprised!!This movie is beyond anything that I have ever viewed in my entire life. Usually this sort of movie isn't the kind that I look at but I fell in love with the story and the characters as well as the wonderful actresses Kathy Bates Jessica Tandy Mary Stuart Masterson and MaryLouise Parker who did an outstanding job portraying their characters in a unique and unforgettable way.Since I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it let me just say that it's an astounding tale of a special friendship that goes way beyond what we would call a regular one. It will make you thankful for the friends you have and even give women a sense to stand up for their own rights. All in all I give this movie a 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it what are you doing reading this?! Go out and rent it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my top five films of all time.  I was somewhat skeptical the first time I saw it because I adored the book and I knew there were some changes but I found the essence of Fannie Flagg's fabulous novel in tact. This is a story that burrows into your heart and mind and stays there.  It is absolutely magical storytelling with a stellar cast and beautifully written characters that never fade from memory.A time and place in America filled with the best and the worst of our life and history is impeccably captured.  The flashbacks take us to the time of an Alabama whistle stop town that was a bustling hub when the railroad was the center of all movement.  This was the era of hobos and simple pleasures. The scenes from the past become more powerful by the juxtaposition to modern times where the story begins and returns at intervals.Kathy Bates plays Evelyn Couch an unhappy middleaged housewife who stumbles on Ninny Threadgoode the superb Jessica Tandy one day by accident at the nursing home where she is visiting one of her husband's relatives. The two have an instant chemistry and a deep friendship begins.  Ninny proceeds to tell Evelyn the story of Idgie and Ruth two young women who shared an amazing friendship and love 50 years earlier. This movie has to be experienced as mere descriptions might sound like another southernflavored movie about women or a weepy nostalgic tale.  It is much more than that and more than the most glowing review can ever convey.  If you are reading this and haven't seen it please make a point to.  The actors are nothing short of magical.  All four actresses Jessica Tandy Kathy Bates Mary Stuart Masterson and MaryLouise Parker are at the top of their craft.I will borrow a line from Ninny Threadgoode to describe how I always feel after seeing this film.  I may be sitting here in this nursing home but in my mind I'm over at the Whistle Stop Cafe having a plate of Fried Green Tomatoes.I may be sitting here finishing this comment but in my mind I'm at the Whistle Stop Cafe.  That's how powerful this story is for me.".

But for that I might still be in ignorance now.It seems incredible that something so wonderful can be had for nothing.Kathy Bates plays the role of a mature but still comparatively young woman who has a marriage going nowhere. Her husband has reached the point where he just doesn't seem to care any more. Actually it's not that he doesn't care he just hasn't noticed how bad things have got.

When hints makeovers and candlelit dinners prove inadequate she finds unexpected inspiration in a feisty old woman called Ninny Threadgoode.This woman  played by Jessica Tandy  dilates upon her past and in particular a friendship between two young women called Idgie and Ruth Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker. The movie then shifts between the presentday circumstances of an increasingly emancipated wife and the flashback reminiscences of her inspiration.Some have rather misguidedly referred to this movie as a 'chickflick' as if it were dedicated to a female audience or in some way espoused the cause of feminism. Such opinions do a disservice. To see it in this light because the principal parts are female is like dismissing 'The Shawshank Redemption' as a male 'buddy' movie. Both are about two people who's enduring friendship unites them against adversity. Lesbian love is barely hinted at.Director Jon Aunet has created a spellbinding work. It has a wonderful lyrical fidelity like a Renoir painting whereby the few moments of comedy appear as small flagrant brushstrokes in an otherwise pastel completeness. There are moments of heartbreaking and tender subtlety when Thomas Newman's music score expresses human feeling more fluently than the spoken word.Soundengineers seldom receive the recognition they deserve. All too easily we take the ambiance of the moment completely for granted. Viewers should pay particular attention to the authenticity of this movie and marvel. The dreary interior of an unhappy home or the mildness of a sunlit summerevening carry such authentic presence that one can almost feel the chill of anger the sweetness of the season.Some have found fault with this movie somewhere. I confess to being too lachrymose to see anything other than the director's intentions. Excellent script flawless acting impeccably chosen music and ambiance to reach out and touch.This is a truly redeeming experience. Amongst the spoilheaps of formulaic Hollywood wretchedness gems like this help remind us that humanity is still worth caring about.The detail of life is what really gives us meaning.".

	schema:reviewBody "The twenty year friendship between two young women in the early twentieth century American South is the focus of this 1991 film from director Jon Avnet. Told in flashbacks the story adopts a modern POV with social empowerment being the theme. As such the story is both unusual and unexpected given its historical time frame. Viewers will be disappointed if they expect a more traditional Southern story ... about some dark sinister secret emotionally repressed and set among the lazy willows and old Magnolia trees.Empowerment can be a wonderful thing. But if it is taken to extremes as it is in two subplots one involving Frank Bennett and the other involving Evelyn Couch then it can be a cause for concern. And that's my main problem with this film. The subplots tend to lack credibility although they do not detract from the overall character study of Idgie and Ruth.What was most impressive to me was the film's atmospheric flavor. Production design set decoration and costumes all sparkle with such vitality and detail that you really feel like you're back in the rural South of the 1920's.Most modern films pander to youth. To its everlasting credit Fried Green Tomatoes features the wisdom of an elderly character played by Jessica Tandy in a nursing home. An added bonus of the film is Kathy Bates whose acting is always firstrate.".

	schema:headline " An authentic classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen this wonderful film for the third time after many years and it is such a classic and has not lost any of its interest or appeal. Indeed it is more relevant now than it ever was considering that it is about the plight of women and how they cope with their various life situations. It is based on a novel and has a screenplay by Fannie Flagg. It is set in Alabama where she comes from and the story presumably has some basis in truth. Not many people know that Fannie Flagg used to be a brilliant comedienne. I knew her in the mid 1960s when she was a standup comic and she was hilarious. She used to perform at a marvellous comedy cabaret night club in Manhattan now long gone which had two floors. The upstairs was called Upstairs at the Downstairs and the downstairs was called Downstairs at the Upstairs. It was at 37 West 56th Street and was run by an amusing and eccentric woman whose name I have forgotten alas. Fannie played there at the same time as Madeline 'Maddy' Kahn who was also wildly funny. Fannie told me she had wanted to perform under her own real name of Patricia Neal but was told by her agent or manager I believe that she could not do that because there was a famous film actress of that name already so she invented the name Fannie Flagg for herself. It was only years later that she wrote this marvellous heartfelt novel which was rejected by many publishers but which finally came out and then resulted in this film. And it is this which really made Fannie Flag famous. The film was shot in Georgia which is next door to Alabama. But the story is mostly set in Alabama in a little town called Whistle Stop. That name arose because it was a settlement situated beside the railroad. Many small Southern towns fell into desuetude i.e. withered away when the railroads started collapsing after the construction of the interstate highway system which shifted so much travel and freight transport onto roads and destroyed the rail industry from the 1950s onwards. In this film which takes place at two different times during the preWar period which constitutes the earlier story the two young women Idgie and Ruth open a railside caf called The Whistle Stop Caf. In those years it thrived and became the heart of the town where everyone went to eat real home cooking which included the favourite local delicacy fried green tomatoes which were sliced and fried in batter in what in the South is called a skillet which is an old 17th century English word for a frying pan the word surviving only in the American South and nowhere else. I still fry my eggs and bacon in an old iron family skillet which was cast in the family forge at Taunton Massachusetts in the 17th or 18th century. We have been using that skillet for many generations. Just imagine how many bacon fat molecules survive in the crystalline interstices of the cast iron after those centuries of use every morning. The outside of the skillet looks like something dug up by an archaeologist but the inside is shiny and ready for anything. But this question arises can bacon fat go rancid after a century or two? It does seem to improve the flavour anyway. However I am ashamed to say that I have never fried any green tomatoes which is doubtless a great personal failing of mine. The skillet has thus been deprived of what Ruth and Idgie would perhaps consider to be its main function to deal with those green tomatoes. Idgie who is a hopeless cook cannot prepare them so Ruth has to do it. Throughout the film people keep tasting them to see if they are up to standard. The modern story of the film consists of tales told by an old lady in a retirement home to a much younger woman and the effect this has on transforming her life. That younger woman is played by Kathy Bates whose performance is breathtaking in its sensitivity and brilliance. But then Kathy Bates has always been one of everybody's favourite and most endearing actresses and we all know what a genius she is. The old woman is played equally brilliantly by the famous Jessica Tandy veteran of a lifetime of superlative achievements in both stage and screen. Before TV wiped all the brains of the public as clean as a virgin hard disc people used to tell stories and there was such a thing as verbal communication. And people didn't even have to use their thumbs to communicate like today's simianthumbed and simianbrained text messagers. This film is all about the power of stories to stir the imagination and transform lives. Even as late as the 1960s some old women still survived in the South who could tell stories for hours on end. They are all gone now and it is like what happened after the time of Homer when the last of the bards died. The best rendering in fiction of the 'power of stories' is probably the novella by Mircea Eliade entitled THE OLD MAN AND THE BUREAUCRATS. Eliade wrote the story of Coppola's film YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH 2007 though that film was very disappointing and a poor adaptation. The stories told by Jessica Tandy are about Idgie and Ruth. In those lengthy flashback sequences the two young women are brilliantly portrayed by the two Mary's Mary Stuart Masterson and MaryLouise Parker. Certainly this is one of the greatest 'sisterhood' films ever made. Their story is full of love pain pathos loss tragedy and joy. Not unlike life. If you can see this without shedding a tear then there is no hope for you. Good old Fannie may she long keep flying her Flagg.".

This is a film that explores racism feminism respect for the elderly women's rights and so very much more in a manner that is infectious to watch repeatedly and defies forgetting.Told on two levels the film is narrated by the elderly Ninny Threadgoode a luminous Jessica Tandy who idles away her hours in her nursing home with stories about her childhood she shares with the sad obese emotionally fragile Evelyn Kathy Bates whose life of misery is slowly corrected by Ninny's tales of how two women in the past overcame impossible odds. The story she tells dates back to Alabama in the 1930s when a young upstart Idgie Threadgoode Mary Stuart Masterson is calmed by a frightened but solid Ruth Jamison MaryLouise Parker and how their partnering results in a series of events that involve murder racism and some very strange events.The cast is superb the script is delicious ! and Jon Avnet directs with aplomb not only the fresh talent mentioned above but also such fine actors as Cicely Tyson Chris O'Donnell Stan Shaw Lois Smith and a large cast of supporting actors. The recreation of the Old South is palpably well focused as is the hilarious and touching stance from the contemporary standpoint of the nursing home and house of the chameleon Evelyn. It is a choice bit of filmmaking and one that deserves a place in every film lover's library. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Touching if flawed tale of Southern women's friendships";
	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely an engaging amusing and moving film...a tribute to the power of friendship viewed through two sets of relationships between women. One is the friendship that develops between a middle aged woman and an elderly lady in a nursing home. The other is the strong bond between two younger women from a bygone era. I appreciated the Southern setting with its verandahed home al fresco wedding reception and so forth. However I do have a few complaints to be discussed later.The film relates a story within a story both set in Alabama. It begins with an unhappily married insecure overweight middle aged woman Evelyn Couch who is generally trodden upon by others and deals with her problems by eating compulsively. While visiting her husband's aunt in a facility for seniors she befriends an octogenarian resident named Ninny Threadgoode. Over the course of several months Ninny gradually relates a tale which causes an amazing transformation in Evelyn. This 'inner story' involves two young women from the 1930's Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison who become friends after a dramatic event in Idgie's childhood involving her brother Buddy Ruth's beau. The sharing of this experience leads to a warm friendship between the pair. Idgie later rescues Ruth from an abusive relationship with her despicable husband Frank and the women set up  operate a diner called the Whistle Stop Cafe whose specialty is fried green tomatoes.The actresses are brilliant in their roles. The incredible Jessica Tandy plays Ninny with Kathy Bates in the role of the unhappy housewife Evelyn. MarieLouise Parker is totally endearing as Ruth the sweet strait laced and gentle victim of spousal abuse. Mary Stuart Masterson perfectly captures the wild feisty poker playing no nonsense Idgie. My compliments also to Chris O'Donnell Buddy Stan Shaw Big George and Cecily Tyson his mother Sipsey. The wonderful child actress who portrays the tomboyish younger Idgie bears an uncanny resemblance to the adult version. Both friendship stories are well captured. Evelyn's newfound older friend Ninny has in a relatively short period of time a profound effect on Evelyn's life causing her to improve her diet  exercise habits and become more assertive in her relationships. Consequently this elicits a tremendous sense of gratitude such that her loyalty to Ninny might be viewed as surpassing her commitment to her husband not particularly the best message. As for Idgie and Ruth they experience a profoundly moving friendship  deep loyalty sharing laughs the food fight! as well as trials and pain. A lesbian relationship is not specified but I personally detected sexual undertones in Idgie's attitude. Their relationship is ambiguous and it would have been a more effective tribute to the power of friendship if the platonic nature had been made crystal clear. Much as I like Jessica Tandy I found Evelyn's tale all a wee bit foolish  stereotypical and would just have soon had only ONE story the 1930's characters.From my own female perspective my complaints lie mainly with its feminist philosophies. Why must movies about strong relationships between women invariably have the male roles either oppressive monsters or absolute jerks? Here Frank is a horrendous wife beater and Evelyn's husband Ed the stereotypical unappreciative uncaring idiot obsessed with TV sports and beer. I have a bit of news for screenwriters...women happily married to reasonable husbands can have strong friendships too. Also it's the classic scenario of portraying the housewife Evelyn as unfulfilled without a job outside the home. The parking lot scene is amusing but frankly I found her Women's Awareness Group utterly ridiculous and an insult to the intelligence of all women. Aside from the feminist issues the film also gives predictably a rather negative portrayal of the Reverend. In any case this movie should be required viewing for spousal abusers! Others have compared it to Steel Magnolias which also revolves around friendships between Southern women. Fried Green Tomatoes explores these relationships in greater depth especially the one between Ruth  Idgie but personally I preferred Steel Magnolias which focuses on the motherdaughter bond. However Fried Green Tomatoes is definitely a captivating tale with some unforgettable and heart wrenching moments as well as amusing scenarios including certain aspects of the ending which I won't divulge but are something of a hoot!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am running out of words to describe how good Fried Green Tomatoes was. It may be two or three minutes too long but other than that there is very little wrong with this film. The film is amazing to look at with gorgeous scenery and cinematography and the score was beautiful. Fried Green Tomatoes also has an intelligent and heartwarming story strong direction and some charming funny and touching dialogue as well. The ending was suitably uplifting but I admit I did shed a tear mostly because I was so impressed by how beautiful the film was.Also superb is the acting. Jessica Tandy is absolutely brilliant in this film and quite rightly received an Oscar nomination.

Kathy Bates is a sheer delight as Evelyn a modernday housewife who visits Tandy in the nursing home and finds inspiration in memories from her past. Mary Stuart Masterson and MaryLouise Parker are terrific as well as Ingrid and Ruth.Overall Fried Green Tomatoes is a lovely little film wonderfully acted and just very relaxing to watch. 910 Bethany Cox".

The film is amazing to look at with gorgeous scenery and cinematography and the score was beautiful. Fried Green Tomatoes also has an intelligent and heartwarming story strong direction and some charming funny and touching dialogue as well. The ending was suitably uplifting but I admit I did shed a tear mostly because I was so impressed by how beautiful the film was.Also superb is the acting. Jessica Tandy is absolutely brilliant in this film and quite rightly received an Oscar nomination. She plays an oldtimer in the American South who tells stories of the bigotry she encountered during her youth in the 1930s. Kathy Bates is a sheer delight as Evelyn a modernday housewife who visits Tandy in the nursing home and finds inspiration in memories from her past.

But it was aired on TV last night and watching it brought back everything. You just can't help but becoming involved in the lives of Idgie Ruth Evelyn and Ninny! Once again I shared laughter tears and love with them all. This was easily the 10th time I had seen it and it never loses its charm. The score is so beautiful and hauntingly sad that it actually hurts and it works hand in hand with the terrific camerawork providing magnificent shots and pictures the entire cast main and supporting actors alike are doing an awesome job and I love them for it and the story itself is just so great... Why Fried Green Tomatoes didn't get any Academy Award will always be beyond me because IMO everybody's performance on screen and behind the camera is just perfect.It was stated that this movie is a movie only girls can relate to and even worse that it was a chickflick. I honestly think this is a major insult. Pretty Woman yes THAT's a chickflick which I like but not this one. I should know because after having seen and by chance taped it for the first time I showed this movie to everybody who couldn't hide quickly enough including my father my brother and several male friends and I swear everybody was just as captivated by Fried Green Tomatoes as I was. I'll never forget my older brother getting upset as Frank's shoving pregnant Ruth down the stairs. Nope this definitely isn't a chickflick. It's a beautiful warm quality movie about true friendship and how it can give you the courage to change your life and to stand up against racism cowardice and hatred.I have thought long and hard whether I could come up with even one single thing I didn't like about Fried Green Tomatoes... but frankly there is nothing. IMO it's a gem and I can just say do yourself a favor and watch this movie.SPOILER AHEAD! When I first watched the movie I didn't know what to expect all I knew was it's on tonight and there's nothing better on TV. After half an hour into the movie and almost until the end I was afraid the story would turn out to become a lesbian thing. Don't get me wrong nothing against lesbians but we've had so many romantic movies already but there are only a handful of films about friendship and guts and strong women and even fewer of those are actually any good. Anyway I was afraid this movie would be reduced to just another romancething and I was really truly relieved to see the movie ends just as well as it starts.".

She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance Freaky Friday was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since The Parent Trap and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script they didn't like I do with some of the teen movies out today.The music used by the movie band Pink Slip was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget Herbie the Love Bug feature I would be even more happy.".

On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So what happened?  Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes my wife and I caught a few stares from other moviegoers I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a no it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions.  Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me I certainly understand them now or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes.  This movie accomplished that for me big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover the supporting characters from the little brother to the fianc to the grandfather to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is in writing.  Please watch this movie and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!".

This movie accomplished that for me big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover the supporting characters from the little brother to the fianc to the grandfather to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is in writing.  Please watch this movie and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!";

But the best thing about the movie is the casting assembled for it with a sure director's hand behind it.Actually this is about the first film that has made me laugh since Bringing down the house that came out earlier this year. Most comedies today seem to forget that the basic premise for their existence is to amuse the audiences and entertain them at the same time.Mark Waters the director shows he has a fine sense of how to make things move constantly in this comedy about identity changes. Of course this film wouldn't be half the fun it is without Jamie Lee Curtis who has never been as effective in any previous films. Her take on Tess Coleman the not so cool therapist strikes the right tone.Her daughter is played with a lot of conviction by Lindsay Lohan who is totally believable as the typical teen ager working through the pain of losing a father and getting a replacement she is not too fond of.Things move at a rapid pace there is never a dull moment in the film. It's a perfect summer comedy that will leave the viewer satisfied and happy.".

Although at times it seemed that way at other times it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it Freaky Friday is a familyfriendly film that tries to please everyone and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.Tess Coleman Jamie Lee Curtis changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen Lohan changed from Annabel Andrews is supposed to be a typical teenager but is anything but and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry Ryan Malgarini changed from Ben Andrews. Tess is going to marry Ryan Harmon because her husband died three years ago can't there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive? of whom Anna doesn't approve. After a fueled feud Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies Tess is in Anna's body and vice versa. Whatever will be done?Although most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen although with the people at my school what she does is anything but typical and she should be Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan a teenager could be an adult so well that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden AnnaasTess is a guest on a talk show talks to someone she has a crush on and watches TessasAnna perform? Not only were they awkward they were just not believable. On the other hand Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments but is also quite touching at times. Obviously it was going to be and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other considering it was shown in the trailer.One other part I didn't like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on AnnaasTess AnnabelasEllen and how she spent her day. Of course back then she was a housewife but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it unlike others which is basically watching the book. Overall Freaky Friday is a likable pleasant 90minute diverter. It won't change your life but you won't be upset you saw it.My rating 710Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some language.".

On the comedy side although on occasions coming across as just a little bit too silly Curtis has on the whole brought out the funny side of the situation without undue exaggeration. The important thing is her success in making the whole thing believable. On the pathos side her toasting speech in the engagement ceremony is touching performance. Lindsay Logan on the other hand has much less opportunity of repeating her brilliant performance in The Parent Trap 1998. The fault is not hers. It's just that it's much less fun watching a 40yearold in a 15yearold body than the other way around. While this is obviously the ladies' show the two beaus provide reliable support. However it is the fantastic pair of grandpa Harold Gould and little brother Ryan Malgarini who stole the show particularly the little guy. I for one would love to see a sequel with this pair swapping bodies. Good flick well worth the admission price.".

Maybe Oscar would be asking too much because of the competition but Curtis certainly deserved a Golden Globe nomination. And Lindsay Lohan did a capable job of the mom in a teen's body trying so hard to fit in at school.Harold Gould's performance also should be noted. He made quite a likable buffoonish grandfather. I liked Rosalind Chao's clueless almost stereotypical restaurant hostess. Lucille Soong made us notice as Chao's meddling mom who just HAD to help this family. And Jeff Marcus as one of Tess' more troubled patients.Although the musicians showed talent I will say I agree with the first opinion Tess had of her daughter's music. It was all just noise!

This is actually a new favorite comedy of mine Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have such a great chemistry I was really impressed with new comer Lohan's performance. She and Jamie just made this film an absolute blast to watch. I think I loved Jamie more though she captured the whole essence of being a teenager perfectly she did not over do it at all. Not to mention she's just an absolute pleasure to watch on screen she's such a terrific actress I love her so much. The story was just so perfect to update into today's society where everyone is so busy to even notice each other.Anna is a teenage girl she's pretty typical she loves music is a bit angry with her life a bit of a drama queen is annoyed by her little brother and annoyed with her mother who is constantly on her case. Tess Anna's mom is a busy lady with a constant on the move schedule she and Anna just constantly bump heads with one thing or another. Tess is also getting married again to a man who Anna is not too fond of. One night when Anna asks her mom if she can perform at a concert on the night of the wedding rehearsal it doesn't go so well and they get into a huge fight. The restaurant owner's mom gives them a fortune cookie and ends up switching bodies. They end up learning that maybe their lives are a little harder than what they really expected it to be.Freaky Friday is a very enjoyable film that I'm very sure you'll have a good time watching. It's a very impressive comedy for any age. My favorite scene was without a doubt when Annain Tess's body goes on TV discussing her latest book and tells the truth about why adults worry so much not to mention the scene where Tess and Anna discover their bodies are switched. This is just a great remake it has a great cast a fun script and is just all around a good movie I highly recommend it.810".

	schema:reviewBody "I am one who believes that a good film can be made very very good by a single moment of spectacular excellence a standout blow'emaway scene maybe just two minutes long that grabs you by the balls  heart and exudes some sort of sheer magic. Great films I mean truly majestic films a club whose members you could count on your fingers play at this level all the time and I haven't seen one of those in half a decade. So we settle well enough for the shining gilded tips that we can sometimes find in sturdy selfsufficient films. These moments aren't great by themselves take them out of their element and they're near worthless. No these moments are great because the movie did the footwork in bringing you there in setting up the big fall the miles of development that gives that moment it's striking power. In The Usual Suspects you had Verbal Kint's revelation. In Requiem For a Dream the climaxing montage of wrecked and debased humanity. And in Freaky Friday in a measure of less gravity and only slightly less potency we have toouptightforherowngood conservative fortysomething Jamie Lee Curtis rocking out some killer power chords on an electric guitar. It's a moment of sheer unadulterated glee of complete Dadaistic fearless uncynical and unfettered freedom that pretty much can exist only in the preslated innocence and silliness of a Disney film which is probably their greatest underappreciated asset. It is a moment of catharsis of really breaking free and where the movie comes full circle in its innerchild liberating mission.Let me explain. What we have for the bulk of its 90 minutes is a film that sometimes and only lightly sermonizes about understanding but is mostly about cutting loose and having fun. The formula's a winner. The real danger of the setup  typically dysfunctional family sans father figure overbearing mother rebellious teenage daughter  is that once you give them a unique chance to reconcile and identify with each other after some initial hijinks we go down some treacly familiar road that's more pushy than good for you. Thankfully that all takes a backseat to really exploring the sort of fun you can have when you've got a capable director and some really fine actresses to play around with. This lets all the pieces fall into place for that aforementioned climax.Jamie Lee Curtis jumps right into her role and comes off charming and amusing as the backtalking slang spouting teenager trapped in her mom's body. There's no doubt she's having a good time but put any other aging actress with a prudish complex in her place these are in no low stock let her go wild and I guarantee that you'll get pretty much the same result which isn't a bad thing really. On the other hand I'm starting to think that Lindsay Lohan is the real deal. Before I watched Mean Girls and Freaky Friday I really couldn't see what the big deal was but now I'm believing that she really deserves her big star push. I mean she wouldn't be able to carry a dry melodrama about accountants with a fondness for Neiztche but she can certainly polish roles befitting of her to a damned spitshine. I suppose I give her more credit because it's a much grander feat for a 15year old to play a 45year old than vice versa but moreso I think she brings just the right flavor oscillating between appalled disciplinarian harumphs and vulnerable sometimes happy realization of truths. It's the second part the letting her hair down erasing that prim guard and partying like a middleaged woman trapped in a teenager's body learning to be young all over again only could that really buoys the whole movie. And when we see her eyes well up with tears and her heart teetering on edge as she tells her daughter Anna in her mother's body to put her relationship with her fianc on the line in a moment of selfsacrifice that is when we realize that this whirlwind of absurdity has suddenly shut down into an honestly touching moment and Lohan pulls it off flawlessly.Though for all this the tradeoff is that Freaky Friday requires you to suspend a whole lot of disbelief not for the completely sudden and unexplained body switching idea but for the ways through which mother and daughter are able to hold a day in each others' lives together. From unpassably lousy psychiatry and driving to waltzing through a teacher's lounge to cheat on a test the film is full of near impossibilities that you have to accept our plucky heroines have the gumption and luck to pull off. The most annoying of all these is Anna's teenage crush Jake who at the drop of a hat does the following takes nagging interest in daughter falls in love with mother completely disassociates with daughter stalks mother falls out of love with mother and back in love with daughter. Though for the overall lightening fast aimedforchildren pacing of the film some of these are necessary shortcuts that can be forgiven under sheer winsomeness. If you're taking the film that seriously anyway you've completely missed the point. A plodding drama with prim respect to plausibility and minor character development is exactly the sort of stuffy fare that this vehicle of pixish momentum is made to make you forget.".

In other Freaky Friday movies I didn't really find anything funny just dull and boring. It's also interesting how they change the body switching item each time.

As Jamie had been also a high grader decades ago  fog   Halloween  this movie is also interesting the evolution of education and it's rather a bad one  clothes manners knowledge have become loose ! Actually  when you see how Lohan dresses to go to school and the kind of music she does well it's not very kind open and charming. I know that teenage means rebellion but emancipation can be light too. However my biggest dislike with this movie lies with its treatment of supernatural. The fact that mother and sister have changed souls and that audience can't discern it visually diminishes the impact. Maybe i am dumb but every time i saw Jaime inhabited by Lohan's soul i reacted as if she was Jaime who was still playing I know it was that actually!. In other words as I witness always the same body for me the person stayed the same. To be clear as soon as the exchange happened i would have rather Jaime playing the part of Lohan and vice versa. This way the supernatural effect would have been clear and it would have been more funny to see Jaime going to high school with Lohan's look It's all the more logical that the movie cover makes this choice Jaime dressed as a punk girl and Lohan as a Lady! I'm sure this kind of subjectivity reality has been done before maybe in  Xfiles  and i'm sure it would have benefit greatly to the movie !".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the title of this film I thought it was a scary movie that I didn't like but my friend told me it was really cool. After watching it once it became one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed it.This is a story about a mom and her daughter who don't get along well. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together. Tess Coleman Jamie Lee Curtis is an overworked mom and Anna Coleman Lindsay Lohan is a typical teenager who has some problems at school and has daily fights with her younger brother. When they switch bodies each is forced to adapt to the other's life for one day. They think each other's job is much easier than their own but they get to know that it's not so easy. Later Tess and Anna are getting to learn to understand and respect each other. Then they switch again and have a happy ending.Their acting was so real and their expressions were so creative. Lohan acted well like a real working mom and Curtis acted just like a young kid. You have to see her act. I burst into laughter many times because her acting was so funny. Curtis is a great comedian. Moreover the supporting characters Anna's little brother her grandfather her boyfriend and Tess's fianc were so natural and so real.Also I like songs from this movie. It has some oldies but goodies such as 'Happy Together' 'Take Me Away' 'What a Wonderful World' and Lindsay's own song 'Ultimate'. These songs were wellsuited to this pleasant movie. 'Ultimate' became very popular because people liked this movie and the song.Freaky Friday is not only funny but also quite touching. So far I've seen it hundreds of times and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. Everyone who likes a really funny but touching movie has to watch this film.".

And that's where Lindsay's talent has a real impact on how well this scenario really comes off.Don't expect it to necessarily surprise you by breaking the formula that you might be expecting but although it's incredibly hard to act these parts and make it believable I think Jamie and Lindsay manage to do it really well without making it overly obvious and cheesy which would be so easy to do.The key characters give a good mix of comedy and fun and support the story well enough so that you can actually sit back and let yourself get wrapped up in the fun and forget about the unreality.The presentation and content of this often used story is the difference here it injects fun and life into your day and gives you the smile that you're hoping to come out of a movie like this with.Undoubtedly worth watching if this type of movie appeals to you but equally a nice surprise for those who it wouldn't normally.".

The end is highly predictable though none the worse for that.Of the supporting players Mark Harmon has little to do but look baffled at the character changes and the annoying part goes to Harold Gould as a rather pointless deaf granddad. The part of the teacher played by Stephen Tobolowsky could have been expanded as his dry approach was amusing.Overall a film well worth seeing.

Network only with more naked men hot explicit sex well explicit for a documentary and snapshots frozen in time that show us visions of a bygone decade where the Gay Wide World went from draconian repression to sexual liberation of Bacchanalian proportions to the next chapter where the bill came due for all that excessive indulgence.No one clucks their tongues or passes judgment as the interviewees regale us with tales of just how things were back in those days although you have to consider that there was some extravagant embellishments here and there. I was only privy to a taste of the lifestyle of which the subjects speak in this film and I guess I should be grateful for it because more than likely it saved my life and the lives of more than a few other people I know. Even back then in my younger days I only knew of the stories about Fire Island the New Yorkbased bars baths and clubs and the infamous Piers and Trucks through hearsay and it all sounded fabulous hedonistic and legendary even as it was happening.There are touches of the ominous though and it certainly doesn't shy away from the dark side of all that jazz. There were risks other than STD's and in pursuit of ultimate bliss there were some who still paid the ultimate price and that was way before AIDS came to call.Funny touching shocking and sobering all at once the only drawback is that it isn't the fully rounded account it could be. Maybe Lovett can find a way to extend this into a series and capture more accounts of the shock waves that spread out into other parts of the country from the epicenter of the gay universe as someone in the doc describes the Big Apple. New York and San Francisco were important touchstones of gay culture but they were not the 'Alpha and Omega' of the Seventies' sexual revolution.At the very least it is an important historical record that a new generation can learn from for those who think that Stonewall is just another place in the mall where you can buy acidwashed jeans.And on a sadder note maybe the reason why it hasn't been possible to film a more complete history of Gay Sex in the Seventies is because many of the eyewitnesses to this remarkable time in history are no longer here to tell about it.

It has interviews with various men who lived through the 1970s and some incredible film footage and photographs. It shows how Stonewall liberated gays and made them fight back. It opened the doors for gay bars bathhouses and virtual nonstop anonymous sex. The movie doesn't pass judgment on the subjects. It just shows it how it was.I was born in 1962 so when I came out in the 1980s AIDS was in full effect. I've heard how great the 70s were and this documentary shows me a time we'll probably never see again. It doesn't shy away from the dark sideit makes it clear people were robbed or beaten or killed and there were plenty of STDs being passed around. Also it shows the rampant drug abuse going on. I honestly can't say that I personally agree with the nonstop sex and drugs but it does show gay men having sex and not apologizing for itand that's just great.This is obviously not for everybodyit's unrated but no one under 18 is admittedand some of it may be too graphic for some there's PLENTY of sex and nudity. Still it chronicles an important time in gay and US history and is invaluable. I give it an 8 because it does have its slow spots.".

I honestly can't say that I personally agree with the nonstop sex and drugs but it does show gay men having sex and not apologizing for itand that's just great.This is obviously not for everybodyit's unrated but no one under 18 is admittedand some of it may be too graphic for some there's PLENTY of sex and nudity. Still it chronicles an important time in gay and US history and is invaluable. I give it an 8 because it does have its slow spots.";

The scenes from the 70s in the film including the candid interviews made this film worthwhile. I was lucky enough to see it at a special private screening when in new york recently and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in gay history and gay sex from 1969 onward. One aspect of the film discussed the discos and the baths. I remember a time when Manhattan had at least ten active gay bathhouses from the ten story Man's Country to the sleazy Everard Baths. I went to all of them and I still have my Continental Baths towel that I bought at Bloomingdales. What memories! I don't live in NYC anymore. I am in Hawaii but according to this site BathhouseGuide.com there are still gay bathhouses operating in the Big Apple. Cheers Eddie".

This decade was a watershed momentin the history of the evolution of the gay identity. Beyond the tantalizing subject matter the technical aspects of the film were impressive to say the least. Specifically the archival work which was extensive and entirely relevant All in all an incredibly significant and fascination doc and an incredibly significant and fascinating era.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Movie accurate thoughtful and wellresearched with a very human touch";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie brought back many memories for me as I moved to New York in 1979 and lived there until 2004. I was 29 years old in '79 having come out at the tender age of 16 in Kansas City where I grew up. I considered moving to New York earlier but now I am sure that I would not have survived if I had. I moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village and in those few short years before AIDS was discovered I had sex in many of the places featured in the film. For those who may be somewhat critical of this movie or the mores of the era it is helpful to understand that sexual liberation really began in San Francisco with the straight hippies in the late 1960's before Stonewall ever happened. Then after Stonewall gay life and gay sexual liberation just exploded. While I missed much of the nonstop sexual activity of the mid to late 1970's I certainly enjoyed my fair share of sex in New York during those few short years prior to the early 1980's. The most remarkable events which occurred were only alluded to in a brief comments by Larry Kramer and others towards the end of the film. Larry Kramer said that when the gay community began to discover AIDS and act upon it this was the first time that an afflicted population ever took it upon themselves to demand radical change on the part of the US government and the US medical community. The gay and lesbian communities particularly in New York and San Francisco which were the epicenters of AIDS came together remarkably fast and formed several political and community organizations which ultimately raised huge sums of money and began to bring about real change and awareness of AIDS to the world. In the past 20 years there have been many books and films which document the relatively brief history of gays and lesbians. Joe Lovett's film has added an important piece to our history.".

In one brief scene there is a man with AIDS who resembles the Elephant Man and it is the only moment of contrast to the lean athletic and handsome good looks of the gay men in the 70s. Otherwise with a not particularly emotional scene where a man accounts for the tragic vast loss of most of his friends the emphasis seems to be gee it was such a great time. And that is troubling. This seems a nostalgic and waxing look at an era with little remorse and more dangerously it seems to barely speak to the lessons of that era. In fact one individual predicts that within twenty years everything should be back to socalled normal and we can indulge our every whim and pleasure. Many many young people have aired the opinion that this era seemed like so much fun a celebration of the sexual and with some envy are sorry they missed it. In all likelihood if you did you would be writing from the grave. Documentaries are by nature personal. They cannot help but suggest an opinion about the subject. Nostalgia rather than fact can be a great artistic license but it shields the truthand when it seems to glorify that era much like Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of Will it borders on irresponsible.".

I was around during that time in Denver and there was a hot gay scene in that city during the late 70's and early 80's does the name  The Ballpark ring anyone's bell? Men from around the World came to the parties at that bathhouse. But you never hear about it. I almost feel that there is an arrogance about New York and that it's the only place that matters because it had the largest population. It would have been nice to see a broader spectrum. The film seemed very self serving and my friends that I viewed the film with who are from New York felt the same.On the positive side who can not be happy to see Tom Bianchi. He is as hot as ever and it was nice to see him on the big screen.This film is worth seeing for the archival footage and stills but it lacks the broad scope that I had hoped it would cover. It leaves you to feel that you have just seen part one of a great documentary miniseries and are waiting for the rest of the story.".

Before she knows it she's married to him.The stars are very good in the film as is Harry Davenport as the uncle with a twinkle in his eye. Cooper and Oberon are darling together  he's so tall and broadshouldered and she's beautiful and petite and they have a nice chemistry. When she first asks him about himself Stretch answers with Cooper's famous Yep several times. Parts of the film are a little slow but it's a nice romance.

When you think of it that is a hallmark of Gary Cooper films.  He is the everyman the themes are simple and timeless.Cooper is in typically good form in this movie and so is his beautiful and delightful costar Oberon.  The film is loaded with humor romance and a touch of social commentary.  A must see for fans of Cooper Oberon Jimmy Stewart or Frank Capra.  A perfect date movie. One of my most favorite films.

Ummno. I think a lot of people miss an important line to make it seem more plausible. Mary Smith grew up on a farm with her father and uncle until her father decided to get into politics for whatever reason. She even makes a comment to him early on that she wished they could go back to those days before she even met Stretch.

It was a sweet throwback to an earlier time when single ladies weren't in single men's rooms at night or any time for that matter! It wasn't proper in 1938. It was very sweet and romantic for Stretch to propose marriage. His search for a wife was over!Here are my slight criticismsAlso unsure if I can believe that his REAL name was Stretch.Then there are the scenes where Mary was at the rodeo cleaning up. She became filthy and her dress was torn as a result.I would think that she could have had her maids send her some clothes or wire her some money so she could purchase some clothes and toiletries. Or even ask her new husband to purchase her some clothes. There was a scene where she attempted to purchase some pants but was interrupted by the phone call. Why didn't she or Stretch purchase clothing and toiletries for her she before she boarded the bus?Even rich ladies have to bathe and look presentable. A rich lady with her background wouldn't travel on the train for 3 days in a filthy torn dress and unwashed. Suppose her dad and his friends had ALREADY arrived when she got there? How would she explain her appearance?Also the scene in the framework of the house lasted a little too long in my opinion.But other than that I enjoyed this movie! Gary and Merle were great in the leads!".

Instead it has some nice moments as well as some lulls.Perhaps it was just too much pawning off the idea of Merle Oberon with her exotic ways and accent as a rich lady in love with Cooper. While the idea of a society lady falling for a cowboy Oberon just seems too distant and cold to make it all seem possible. I really think someone a little more human could have made this odd pairing work well. Oberon was a fine actress but I just don't think she was right for this film.Perhaps it was that once the two fell in love the film just stagnated until near the end. They married and yet the film still had a long way to go and the middle just seemed like filler at timesparticularly Cooper's pantomime sequence inside their new house.Whatever the reason the film just seemed like an agreeable timepasser and nothing more.

With no need to worry about plot you can just sit back and enjoy the performances.Merle Oberon hits just the right chord as a polished socialite with a hidden practical side and a goofball sense of humor. Her English accent is a trifle thick even for the everyone rich has an English accent days but her physical comedy brings her back down to earth. She outshines everyone else in the film in my opinion.Gary Cooper plays Gary Cooper as usual but there were two shots in particular where I saw thoughts and emotions played that were deeper and more wellrounded than his stock plays his stock plays being bashful strongnsilent voice of the working class and bewildered.The cast is rounded out nicely by some of the better character actors of the day and the action moves along briskly. As others have noted there are definite echoes of It Happened One Night and Mr Deeds Goes to Town as well as Meet John Doe. All three films are better than this one but The Cowboy and the Lady remains unexpectedly sweet and winning. A lovely bit of fluff!".

	schema:headline " The little 'work horse' who wasn't and 'Daddy Longlegs' get hitched";
	schema:reviewBody "An unusual light romantic comedy in which a sheltered bored rich girlMerle Oberon as Mary becomes enamored of a rodeo rider from a Montana ranchGary Cooper as Stretch who happens to be staying in Palm Beach for a few days of rodeoing. Its implausibility serves as the basis for a situation comedy. Mary gets herself in hot water claiming she's a house maid like her 2 friends who are bona fide maids in her house. For this outing they are also her dating coaches and chaperons. Furthermore as instructed she thinks up a hard luck story to gain his sympathy. Namely she moved away from her family because her shiftless drunk father often beat her. Nonetheless she supports her 4 younger sisters with her maid job. She figured she could get away with this big fib since probably she wouldn't ever see her date again. But it comes back to haunt her because soon she would be married to this handsome cowboy and he definitely expected his wife to be a 'work horse' not a 'show horse'. Furthermore she wanted to keep her impulsive marriage a secrete from her father as long as possible as she knew he wouldn't go for a common cowboy as a soninlaw which also might stir up some negative press just when he was running for president. Furthermore she now had conflicting demands on her to serve as hostess for her father's political cronies or to accompany her new husband to his ranch in Montana so he can finish building their house and get back to his cowboying. She decides he father's needs come first thus she returned from Galveston to Palm Beach 'for a few days' which turns into a week or so. Coop gets impatient. He travels to Mary's mansion and barges in at just the wrong time when the guests are eating with Mary and her father. Coop quickly surmises that Mary is no maid but rather part of a rich family. He now saw her as a 'show horse' which he despised. He told the VIPs what he thought of them as a class sarcastically inviting them to come to his ranch and see how 'real people' treated each other. He then takes a train to his ranch. But Mary her father and Uncle Hannibal took an early flight to his ranch thus preceding him making themselves comfortable in Ma Hawkins' ranch house. Coop was stunned to hear Mary's father had suddenly withdrawn as a candidate deciding Mary's happiness was more important and Coop's take on life was the better one. Also Mary was already learning to cook like Ma baking Coop's favorite cake. Both Patsy and Mabel were sometimes added to films to provide some light comedy as quirky women....Harry Davenport as Uncle Hannibal provided some humor as well as sage advice and a shoulder for Mary to cry on. He was her first 'date' in quite a while at age 72! Yes she seemed best suited to older men....Emma Dunn as Ma Hamilton provides a model for what Coop hopes Mary will become a work horse. She could be quite bossy if you were in her way or didn't do things her way a serious yet also humorous bundle of energy....Walter Brennan and Fuzzy Knight were Coop's rodeo and ranch partners. Fuzzy also sang a bitas did Coop. I haven't mentioned that Merle and Coop provide some physical humor in getting used to city or ranch life. The most notable example occurs when Coop was rehearsing where we wanted various pieces of furniture in his future house. He pretends he's speaking to Mary and sitting in her chair. Eventually the onlookers come in and pretend they are sitting in imaginary chairs until Ma Hawkins happens along and breaks up the spell.See this moderately interesting film on YouTube.".

Behrman and Sonya Levien who received the screenplay credits this average romantic comedy won an Academy Award for its Sound its title song and Score were Oscar nominated.According to Goldwyn biographer A. Scott Berg McCarey told a story off the cuff to a bunch of the producer's writers one evening who then had to write the screenplay from what they'd heard.It stars Merle Oberon as the sheltered wealthy daughter of a man Henry Kolker who's seeking his party's nomination for POTUS. Concerned that her actions like an appearance at a nightclub which was raided while she was with her funloving uncle Harry Davenport might jeopardize his standing with an influential power broker Berton Churchill her father sends her to their vacation home in Palm Beach Florida. While she's there she meets a rodeo cowboy played by Gary Cooper and the predictable happens.Oberon plays Mary Smith daughter of Horace Kolker and niece of Hannibal Davenport. Irving Bacon appears uncredited as Smith's secretary. Bored of being sequestered e.g. in Florida she goes with her two servants Katie Patsy Kelly and Elly Mabel Todd on a blind date to a rodeo where she awed by the talents of one of the cowboys she later meets a reluctant 'Stretch' Willoughby Cooper. Katie's date is another cowboy named Sugar Walter Brennan and Elly's is Buzz Fuzzy Knight. As far as the three cowboys know the three girls all work for an absent wealthy woman.Inexperienced in dating Mary follows the other girls' advice and tells an untrue sob story to Stretch about how she's taken care of her four siblings and aging parent. So he believes he's finally found what he'd always been looking for in a woman a workhorse in lieu of a show horse the type of woman he'd always seemed to find in the past. In fact he thinks Mary is a younger prettier version of Ma Hawkins Emma Dunn the mother figure who takes care of his Montana ranch. Love struck he asks for her hand. Though she thinks it's all too soon he tosses her in the swimming pool which somehow! convinces her to follow him to the dock where his rodeo show is packed up and ready to leave for Galveston by boat. She impulsively decides to go along one thing leads to another and the next thing you know the two of them are saying I do in front of the ship's captain Frederick Vogeding ... despite the fact that Mary's yet to tell Stretch that she's a show horse.After a brief fish out of water sequence in Galveston where Mary gets her one dress dirty and torn she receives a call from Katie who informs her that her father and Oliver Wendell Henderson Churchill are coming to Palm Beach for a visit. Though Mary tells Katie she's married Stretch she asks her to keep it a secret. She then tells Stretch that she's got to return home to tell her employer et al and promises to meet him in Montana the following week. Stretch then puts Mary on a bus driven by Eddie Acuff uncredited home. Once there she tells her uncle everything he is understanding and tries to help. Her father of course is furious but accepts her situation if she promises to help with the Henderson dinner during which he expects to receive the man's endorsement for the Presidential nomination.Meanwhile back at the ranch Stretch is getting everything ready for Mary's arrival. There are two scenes which must have been funnier when McCarey told them than when they were realized on screen Stretch's playful endless pulling of Ma's apron strings causing it to fall and his pantomime dinner with the other incredulous cowboys as guests in his tobecompleted house's framing.The Henderson dinner causes Mary to send Stretch her regrets and promise to come later but he decides to visit Palm Beach again to find her instead. Naturally he walks in during the big event finds out the truth about his wife e.g. being a show horse and in the film's best scene ends up giving an everyman speech after being talked down to by the upper crusts.But never fear. Made to feel guilty by his brother Hannibal Horace makes things better in the end with a surprise visit to Montana. Stretch then witnesses Mary doing domestic chores under Ma's direction gets slapped on the back by Hannibal and the movie fades out with the newlyweds kissing in the kitchen.".

Both Cooper and Oberon are very good indeed though a decent supporting cast are given too little to do. It won an Oscar for Best Sound Recording and was also nominated for it's score and for Best Song.";

	schema:headline " Delightful romantic comedy with witty script and excellent performances";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a superb example of a thirties romantic comedy. Merle Oberon who the following year would dazzle the world in WUTHERING HEIGHTS 1939 here predazzles the world with her witty charm big eyes and mischievous smiles. Gary Cooper is the tall very tall compared to Oberon whom he cannot kiss without practically bending double innocent cowboy whose favourite gal is his mare Bess. Oberon is the rich and cocooned daughter of a politician who wants to become President of the USA and uses her to host his dinners just as the bachelor President James Buchanan used to do when his daughter became 'the First Lady'. Early in this film Oberon is even toasted at one of the dinners as 'America's future First Lady'. Her father is clearly a widower though this is never stated. This film had more writers than any film I have ever encountered. There were seventeen of them! The main screenplay appears to have been written by the wellknown playwright and screenwriter S. N. Behrman. But he must not have done a good enough job because 16 other people had to be brought in to pep up the script. They included such famous figures as Anita Loos and her husband John Emerson Lillian Hellman Dorothy Parker and Robert Ardrey. With all that talent thrown into the soup it is no wonder that many witty lines appear throughout the film many of them doubtless having come from the acerbically mirthful Anita Loos. The film also had three directors H. C. Potter being credited but the other two including the famous William Wyler not being credited. The reason for this deluge of talent was due to confusion on the part of Samuel Goldwyn. As several reviewers have pointed out Goldwyn started with a title he liked and then tried to find someone to write a story for that title. Talk about topdown instead of bottomup! There had already been three films made with the title THE COWBOY AND THE LADY. The first was a 1903 short apparently lost. Then there were two silent films of the same title made in 1915 and 1922 both based upon a play by Clyde Fitch. Both these films are also apparently lost and neither had any relation with this 1938 film except for the title. Probably Goldwyn knew the title whether consciously or subconsciously from the 1922 film it stuck in his mind and he got fixated upon the possibilities which it gave for an entertaining story. The juxtaposition of a cowboy and a lady was readymade for comic possibilities especially in America where cowboys resonated with the public in contrast with the stuffy New England Establishment. The film succeeds in being very amusing and entertaining and in this case too many cooks did not spoil the broth.".

She has not private life of her own although she is egged on to get one by her freespirited uncle  Harry Davenport. After a nearaccidentalscandal she heads off to Palm Beach where on a lark with her maids she attends a rodeo where she falls in love with Gary Cooper one of the cowboys.

On the boat they get married but Mary knows she has to go back to face the music and her father...whom Cooper believes is a poor drunkard. Mary delays getting back to the ranch in Montana so Cooper returns to Palm Beach looking for her only to interrupt an important political dinner. Realizing Mary's story of being a poor maid Cooper returns by train to his ranch only to find that Mary her father and her uncle have flown to the ranch where they demonstrate rather quickly that even the rich can be very down to earth. All live happily ever after.So why do I think this may be Gary Cooper's finest film? Let's see  he accomplishes drama comedy pantomime and romance...all in one package. And he's great at all of it. The pantomime segment is a classic particularly after he gets a whole bunch of cowboys to participate.Except for her extremely high forehead which always distracts me Merele Oberon is beautiful here and turns in a fine performance as the little rich girl who realizes her true happiness will be a very different life though her fibs seem to have screwed that all up.The supporting cast here is superb. The highlight is the performance of one of the screen's great character actors  Harry Davenport as Mary's uncle. You even get to see him dance and dressed as a cowboy! Patsy Kelly and Mabel Todd are fine as the maids. Walter Brennan is on hand as a cowpoke and friend and is  as always  a treat. Finally a film in which I enjoyed the performance of Fuzzy Knight here as another cowpokepal. Henry Kolker is fine here as Mary's father and the presidential hopeful. In fact for once he redeems himself in his role as a stuckup father.It's difficult to find anything to criticize here. So savor this delightful comedyromance with fine sentimental overtones. Highly recommended.".

Harry Davenport is hysterically funny as Oberon's lovable uncle her biggest supporter who tries desperately to wake his onesided brother Kolker up to Oberon's needs over his own yet isn't afraid to perform a lively jitterbug. This is one of the rare cases of opposites attracting on screen that really works even though Oberon's sophistication betrays her supposed job as a ladies' maid. Still she's very funny in dealing with such poor man's items as a collapsing cot and sticky fly paper.While most of the film is charming and lighthearted it does turn into Capralike corn as Cooper confronts the snobby associates of Oberon's father with a list of what the country really needs. This scene is totally faithful to the plot of the film and gives the story some substance in addition to amusement.".

Potter's The Cowboy and the Lady qualifies as a predictable but entertaining lightweight romantic comedy about a rodeo rider who falls in love with the sheltered daughter of a wealthy politician. Naturally Gary Cooper plays the cowboy while Merle Oberon appears as the lady. Believe it or not this simple contemporary yarn went through three directors and countless scenarists before Samuel Goldwyn released it. William Wyler started calling the shots but Goldwyn replaced him with H.C. Potter. Unfortunately Potter couldn't complete filming owing to scheduling difficulties with his next film so Goldwyn replaced him with Stuart Heisler. The Cowboy and the Lady was Heisler's third film to helm after The Hurricane and Straight from the Shoulder. Later he would work together with Cooper on two more oaters Along Came Jones 1945 and Dallas 1950.Quo Vadis scenarists S.N. Behrman and Sonya Levien received credit for the screenplay. Nevertheless during the troubled production no fewer than 13 scribes toiled on the project including Richard Connell Lillian Hellman Dorothy Parker Anita Loos and Robert Riskin. The amazing thing about The Cowboy and the Lady is that it works on the level of a sophisticated fairy tale. The gal is searching for a guy and the guy is searching for a gal. He is looking for an honest woman while she is behaving dishonestly so she can land him. Truly Potter's film emerges as a guide to dating. Some of the comments that the women make about men are hilarious. Principally they worry about the fragile male ego. This movie shows how a woman can land a man. Usually it is the other way around and The Cowboy and the Lady is as much a delightful comedy as it is a commentary on courtship in a simpler time. The supporting players contribute significantly to this saga with Walter Brennan Harry Davenport Fuzzy Knight and Eddie Acuff sticking their necks out in fine fashion.The Cowboy and the Lady opens with the police raiding a night club called The Silver Bowl where illegal gambling is taking place. When the newspapers obtain a list of names of those in attendance they spot the name Mary Smith but are initially uncertain. Judge Smith has launched a presidential campaign and he needs the endorsement of a power broker named Oliver Wendell Henderson. When he discovers that his daughter Mary Merle Oberonwas questioned during the raid Judge Smith decides to send her packing to West Palm Beach so that Henderson won't catch a whiff of a scandal. In Palm Beach Mary goes crazy with all the solitude and turns to stacking cards in house configurations. Two maids Katie and Elly are attending to her when she asks them about meeting guys. As it turns out Katie and Elly plan to go out on a date with the rodeo riders. Mary persuades them to count her into their plans. Initially when they meet the three spruced up cowhands Mary winds up landing Sugar Walter Brennan but she craves Stretch Gary Cooper and gets him Mary deceives Stretch into believing that she is a person maid to the lady of the house. Mary explains that she helps her superior dress. Our hero and heroine hit it off on the first date and they are pretty much inseparable after this occasion. Mary has spent her entire life in the shadows so that her father the Judge would look good and win votes as well as elections. Mary follows Stretch to the boat ready to set a course for Galvaston. During the short trip Stretch and Mary fall in love and Stretch gets the ship's captain to marry them. Katie and Elly call Mary and warn her that her father and his campaign is coming to Palm Beach and she is explained to entertain her father's supporters. Miraculously Mary talks Stretch into allowing her to go back home before she relocates with him in Montana. Stretch labors under the impression that Mary has struggled to help her alcoholic father and her four sisters. Stretch admires her but little does Stretch know that Mary is not in his social class. Eventually this creates trouble for our love birds.The Cowboy and the Lady boasts a happily ever after ending.".

The characters weren't great and weren't bad either.  Sure we've seen it all before in other films but I have little hope of finding a film that's completely original.  Frankly I got about what I expected out of it  motion picture fastfood.  You enjoy it as you take it in and digest it and forget about it after you leave the theater.  It's just entertainment and not bad for what it is.  Unlike LOST IN SPACE or BATMAN AND ROBIN this film isn't boring.  It moves at a quick enough pace to where you don't find yourself checking your watch all the time.  I'm not sure what the deal was with Donald Sutherland's character who displays no sense of logic whatsoever.  Had they dropped the stuff with his character it would've helped the film.  If you're bored check it out.  It's worth at least one viewing.".

Virus failed to deliver characters that we could believe and identify with.I still recommend this film highly as its interesting it contains Jamie Lee Curtis a hottie and Donald Sutherland a 20th century legend lots of effects and action.

If it was the latter it would simply have the entire crew set port in Australia and have taken it from there. Instead the humans are viruses approach simply brings it down. Bummer. Billions of miles of space travel and it gets bested by the motley crew of a tugboat with a demented skipper.Anyway 21 years after Halloween Jamie Lee still looks delectable with a perfect figure. The rest of the crew are funny and charming in a forgettable way. Sutherland puts in the best acting he has in years which isn't saying too much as he has been  phoning his performances in since JFK.Anyway this movie is low on originality but if you like the genres above it is a pretty nice diversion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laughable extremely poorly scripted and acted effort about a small crew boarding what seems to be a dead huge Russian science ship that has been taken over by an alien life form in the form of electrical current. The small crew from the other ship quickly find out that boarding the ship was a bad idea and soon they begin to I know this will surprise you ...DIE. Okay for starters the film is very derivative of other films most notably Alien with the same premise of a small group investigating a large foreign vessel and ultimately led by a strong female protagonist. Ther are many other obvious similarities but time and a total lack of desire to rehash that drivel must excuse me. I could live with a less than original story if it had some better dialog and some characters you might give a hoot about but Virus has none of that. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job at best and gives the film's best performance but that is not saying anything as virtually everyone else is just awful. This is a surprise when one sees Donald Sutherland's name attached to this project. I have never seen him give quite as bad a performance as he does in Virus. He goes for every clich and stereotype of an old sea captain save a wooden leg and a parrot on his shoulder. The accent he uses I found excruciating. The rest of the crew has a group of guys that you will not care about in the least. None of the guys can act. This applies mostly to male lead Wiulliam Baldwin who looks like he is lost at sea playing an actor. The script aids the actors in being inadequate as half the time it just makes no sense and other times begins to show promise and ends abruptly. Wow the way Jamie Lee Curtis gets out of a jam near the film's end was so ridiculous. What about the captain and why he was almost going to shoot himself in the beginning of the picture? What was that all about? It was never brought up again. What does Virus have going for it? It is the very embodiment of mindless entertainment with almost no thinking required. The special effects are pretty good too. But for me the film was a great big letdown. Not that I was expecting something great but I was expecting something suspenseful. I was laughing and turning my head a lot more times in this one then I was on the edge of my seat  except when I was ready to turn the movie off!".

	schema:reviewBody "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.I was still recovering from the fallout of 'Bruce Almighty' why God WHY?? when I sat down to watch 'Virus'. That might have had some bearing on my opinion of this film after all after watching a Jim Carrey film leaves me with certain demands. Namely entertainment. I don't really consider that an unreasonable demand from a film but unfortunately 'Virus' did not succeed that well in delivering.Anyway I sat down to watch 'Virus'. I went in with a few preconceived notions. Firstly I thought it was set in space. Of course it wasn't but I can understand how I got to that conclusion. When I hear a story about an extraterrestrial virus I don't immediately shout sea ship! but that didn't detract from the film. Okay we're in the ocean. I can deal with that. Secondly I thought this would be good. However it wasn't. And it's main problem suffers from a phenomenon that I have dubbed The 90s However I'm sure somebody reading this review will steal that from me like the filthy bds they are.I won't go into the plot in detail because to be honest you've heard it all before. and it's based on a comic. Wow betcha didn't see THAT one coming! In short MIR space station contracts alien intelligence that zips it's way down to Earth and stays on a Russian vessel. Enter Donald Sutherland and his merry men who want to claim the now abandoned vessel and claim a profit on it. Or something.Now I must bring up Donald Sutherland here because his delivery of Captain Whatever is laughable. Not that the character he plays is given any depth but still. The man looks totally out of his tree. I guess he was just breezing through 'Virus' to pick up a healthy check at the end. And who can blame him? He evidently forgot who he was supposed to be playing by the end seeing as his accent completely metamorphs. So does the Russian woman but I won't go into her.I said earlier this film's main problem was the 90s How this essentially translates for 'Virus' is a complete lack of scares or horror or action or whatever genre it was trying to fit in to. How does it manage to do this? One anacronym CGI. For a film that follows in the long proud tradition of 'Alien' ripoffs it's sort of troubling to realise it has absolutely no idea how to be as horrifying as the film it tries to emulate. 'Alien' uses quick glimpses of it's creature to utilise the collective imaginations of it's audience to create something far more horrific than ANY film could deliver. Much like the 'Blair Witch Project' that came out the same year as 'Virus'. at least I think it did. I'm not going to check though. I'm in far too big of a rant now to start fiddling around with details In that way 'Virus' is almost the antithesis to 'Blair Witch Project'. The unknown is infinitely scarier than a CGI robot tramping around in full view.Actually that's another preconceived notion I had about 'Virus'. It was actually going to be about A VIRUS. Now an intelligent bolt of lightning is certainly an interesting concept with many avenues of story that could be pursued and tellingly 'Virus' is far too lazy to go down any of them. Instead we are treated to Cybermen clones Borg wannabes and Terminator inspired robotic nasties. None of which are particularly scary or impressive. Also there are presumably for comic effect little spider scuttler things that fire nails at people. I actually owned one of those as a kid. They were called ZOIDS. You'd assemble them and wind the motor and they'd go walking off for a couple of feet. And 'Virus' actually shows these as if they're the worthwhile portrayal of an electrical alien intelligence. You'll even see them ambling along in all their nonfluent glory as they lure some character I don't care should you? Into a vent. Now bear with me because I think this scene is worthy of note. The guy is in a spooky old derelict and sees something dragging wires into the darkness of an shaft. Now he is holding a weapon something revolutionary for this genre methinks but what's this? He is EXCHANGING HIS GUN FOR A TORCH. And of course he goes in the shaft and promptly gets captured by lots of sentient wire cables. Serves him right.Another interesting scene is where Donald Sutherland's character decides that the good and proper thing to do after witnessing the above character come back as a Borg drone is to offer himself up to the Virus. Now uh why? We get the feeling he doesn't like his crew but what the f is he thinking? Absolutely nothing is made of this and it's a shame because had the film given the captain even two dimensions it would have been an interesting character twist. As 'Virus' presents it however Donald Sutherland is assimilated surprised they didn't use that term in the film comes back to spout some rhetoric and is dead within two minutes.Yet despite everything I've said about 'Virus' I can't give it anything less than four stars. You see even though it has boring effects wooden acting clich characters and a story based off a comic based off an entire genre it's still entertaining. I mean this film isn't Godawful or anything. It's not 'Showgirls'. There is some entertainment to be had at how hopelessly flawed it is. There are some deliberately I assume although it could be the writer's attempt at a severe characterturning moment hilarious moments especially when the token black guy exclaims Spare parts my ass man! Hoho how I laughed. That one is sure to become a catch phrase I reckon. In fact I can't remember how many times I've been trapped in the middle of boring pretentious conversations at stuffy late evening engagements only to exclaim Spare parts my ass man! And have the entire room suddenly erupt in laughter. Then strobe lights come down from the ceiling Scatman bursts over the speakers and strippers fly in through the windows.I gave this film four out of ten for sheer entertainment I should probably revise my first paragraph 'Virus' is a disappointing film with an interesting premise that it ultimately wastes when it realises it is in danger of becoming a halfway decent horror film. Basically 'Event Horizon' at sea. Hopefully you read this bloated review and now will feel no compulsion to see it.Oh yeah Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. I think she plays a mannequin or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I know this movie borrows so many elements from so many scifihorror movies that I'm not gonna bother making a list of them. The setting plot development characters ending... are all far from original but the premise of this movie sorta is. Instead of monsters or cyborgs running around killing people we now have an intelligent alien lifeforce in the form of electricity from outerspace invading a big Russian researchship in desolate ocean waters. The lifeform takes over the ship's computers and electronic circuits and is determined to wipe out the one virus it sees as a threat Humanity. When the crew of the small salvageship Sea Star finds the abandoned Russian vessel dead in the water the fun starts.The acting is okay but the characters are badly written and full of clichs with Donald Shutterland's character Capt. Robert Everton being the worst and therefore the most fun. He handles in an irrational manner all the time. In the beginning of the movie he wants to kill himself by blowing his brains out 'cause he's depressed over losing his cargo. Then he's happy 'cause he thinks that salving the Russian ship will make him a millionaire. When things go wrong again he claims himself being the superior lifeform and tries to make a deal with the alien force. Needless to say this is the last dumb mistake he'll ever make. Jamie Lee Curtis and William Baldwin play the only 'normal' characters on board.But we don't watch these type of movies for characterdevelopment or logical plottwists do we? The suspense and action leading up to the climax are well dosed and the special effects are rather excellent. They start out small and turn grotesque near the end like it should be. We have small spiderbatlike robots operated by animatronics puppetry and humans with metal parts sticking out of them for the visualization of the symbiosis between man and machine and in the end they switch to solid CGI for the massive berrobot. I just love the whole using humans for sparepartsidea.I must say sorry for the spoiler that there is a survivor though easy to figure out I'm not gonna tell who it is but the way heshe escapes the ship is a bit ridiculous probably doing it for only one reason to make the ending look spectacular. Just jumping overboard would've been as effective and less dangerous. But we don't wanna see that huh? Bottomline This flick is fun! But make sure you leave your brain at the door when you see this otherwise you'll end up needing spareparts yourself. You might even have yourself a treat by organizing a triplefeature Ships Of Horrornight by watching VIRUS DEEP RISING and GHOST SHIP. Because there are far more worse horrorflicks involving ships out there. If you don't believe me then check out UNINVITED DEATH SHIP or sorry Jasonlovers Friday THE 13TH PART 8 JASON TAKES MANHATTEN instead of what the movie's title might lead you to suspect almost 70 of it takes place on a cruiseship!.If you like the robots vs humansconcept you might wanna check out more obscure similar titles like SATURN 3 starring Harvey Keitel or MOONTRAP starring Bruce Campbell.

If you look more attentively you can notice that the Novgorod churches had no crosses on top. The full helmets Eisenshtein took from ancient manuscripts and followed the history precisely. The portable organ the monk plays was an exact copy of the real thing from the 13th century which crusaders used. The children autodafe was taken from ancient chronicles both Russian and German. But in addition it had religious meaning since it draws parallel with Herod's slaughter of the innocents used later once again in Ivan The Terrible. Alexander Nevsky is a Russian historical saga which has everything in common with old Russian cultural and historical tradition but nothing or very little with the Soviet propaganda. The film definitely has allusions to the Stalin's time free Novgorod republic fights for its freedom at the expense of prosperity elected prince Alexander leader but not czar etc. But nevertheless I think that the French critic Robert Brasillach he was very close to nazis was right when he called Alexander Nevsky the slavic war carol which has nothing to do with bolshevism communism etc.But IMHO Serghey Eisenshtein was against the war and followed the tradition of War And Peace by Leo Tolstoy. The same plot with common people uniting to oppose the uppish professional army. If you remember the scene when Russian soldiers alike in color with the earth and trees butted into the German close formation they use axes the same way they did when chopping woods. No pride honor or awards but every day job. I think it is an excellent film which is larger then our judgements.".

Here this visual elements are twisted showing the enemy in white and the russians in dark uniforms. Certainly there is a propaganda tone in the whole story but it's quite comprehensible for the time previous to WWII and the country. There is another element for which this movie is so touching the excellent music by Serge Prokofiev and specially the part of the battle. Alexander Nevsky is very much worth seeing not seeking for a conventional war movie but as an  alternative way of cinematic expression.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think it's a superb cinematography experience once again Einsenstein goes beyond the conventional visual elements of the movies lets take an example we are used to see the white color as a sign of purity and the black color as the bad element. Here this visual elements are twisted showing the enemy in white and the russians in dark uniforms. Certainly there is a propaganda tone in the whole story but it's quite comprehensible for the time previous to WWII and the country. There is another element for which this movie is so touching the excellent music by Serge Prokofiev and specially the part of the battle. Alexander Nevsky is very much worth seeing not seeking for a conventional war movie but as an  alternative way of cinematic expression.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many of Eisenstein's other works Aleksandr Nevsky is a beautifully made and wellwritten propaganda piece. Even today it stands on its own with a solid story and incredible action scenes. No one did an epic battle better than Eisenstein October and Ivan the Terrible and the giant battle on the frozen lake in Nevsky ranks up there as one of his best.Just as important to the film as Eisenstein's script and visuals is the masterful score by Prokofiev. Fortunately it has been rerecorded for the most recent video release and the new soundtrack adds incalcuable depth and power to the story on the screen. In my opinion the film's score is simply the best ever composed for a film. It fits the film perfectly both during the film's intense action scenes and the lingering moments of reflection. If for no other reason one should see this film to hear one of the 20th century's greatest composer's best works.The story is true well as true as events from the 1200s can be accurately recreated and simple but powerful. Despite its heavyhanded RussianSoviet patriotism the film succeeds in telling a compelling story. When one looks at the events unfolding when the film was made it becomes even more of a masterpiece.No Nevsky doesn't have the flashy visuals or superhandsome stars of a modern war epic but it still ranks of one of the most interesting films in my book. For fans of Eisenstein or classic cinema it is an absolute mustsee. And for people who want to see the Soviet propaganda machine firing on all cylinders check it out as well.".

Some say this movie isn't worth the genius of Eisenstein then they have to watch it over and over till they can say anything bad or even worse that it is just some propagandamovie for the Russians. Let's say it as it is it is indeed pure propaganda for patriotism but isn't Saving private Ryan or The longest day so? I could sum up so many movies in where America is being raised to the top so why not Russia and besides every war is fought for itrs patriotism why else would they raise flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who cares about cinematography as almost every shot is a sublime picture. Perhaps it's all overseen but I am in wonder why this isn't included in IMDB's Top 250 where as there is so many overrated Oscarcrap in it as well.".

This influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day. The soundtrack by composer Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction are a sight and sound to behold Many years later John Milius used many of the movies scenes set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into Conan.One of my favorite lines from Conan was taken from this movie. It's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that wields it is what matters. The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor that James Earl Jones and the Leader of the Teutonic Knights wear are virtually identical. A true tribute paid from one director to another.I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The movie plays like the final Act of Richard III.

	schema:reviewBody "Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky was made mostly for propaganda purposes in 1938.  It was a reminder to all Russians of their dastardly neighbors the Nazis to their west. The film plays on this comparison and several others to a lesser degree.  The evil Germanic Teutonic Knights just happen to be of the Christian faith and their religious leaders make for very effective villians.  Although Nikolai Cherkasov as Nevsky and Nikolai Okhlopkov as his righthand man Vasili are commanding in their roles this movie is mainly noted for the final climactic battle between good the Russians and pure evil the Germans.  Eisenstein purposely covers the Germans with oversized helmets so that they're totally devoid of any human facial expressions.  On the contrary the Russian peasants who comprise most of Nevsky's army are portrayed with a variety of emotions and their humanity is not only recognizable but refreshing and appealing to the viewer. When the Teutonic Knights make their charge on the Russian position the action is fast and furious and it would be difficult to find any other film which stages its action scenes as well as Eisenstein does here.  Although a bit dated in the print that I saw the sound was certainly a bit off this movie is a mustsee for anyone interested in foreign films and especially the Russian cinema during the days of Stalin.  The Germans might have thought twice about attacking Russia in 1941 if they had seen this film beforehand.  The message was clear back then.  In the words of Alexander Nevsky himself  Do not enter Russia with a sword in your hand.  Well you can't say they weren't warned.".

This last time I watched it I was struck by a detail that I hadn't noticed before.Toward the end of the picture the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled. There are a couple of closeups of the dead men. The one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind in sync with the flicker of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body.Every time I revisit this film I see something new.".

This last time I watched it I was struck by a detail that I hadn't noticed before.Toward the end of the picture the slain heroes are conveyed back to the town via sled. There are a couple of closeups of the dead men. The one that struck me most was a shot of the blond youth. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind is blowing and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind in sync with the flicker of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body.Every time I revisit this film I see something new.";

	schema:headline " Propaganda films in Russia England and Germany";
	schema:reviewBody "Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership where they worked together to match image and music scene by scene. Unfortunately the sound recording was a disaster so for once the devotion to authenticity in Criterion DVD's backfires. Fortunately there is at least one restored version of the film on VHS BMG Classics with an excellent rerecording of the music by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.It is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938 in response to the fear of a German invasion and Olivier's in 1943 when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are stagey but in different ways. Olivier begins by showing a staged performance of the play in the Globe Theater by Shakespeare's own company then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic though still stylized setting. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning but the dialog and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches as Alexander because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public.In Nazi Germany the first major propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl's tedious Triumph of the Will which recorded a huge political spectacle  massed crowds cheering Hitler's ranting speeches. The propaganda in her masterpiece the film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics is much subtler with its worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the Aryan superiority myth. But wartime German propaganda films could also be subtle. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort Furlough on Word of Honor is typical. It shows a young lieutenant letting the men in his company go on a 24hour leave before returning to the WWI trenches and almost certain death. Against the advice of veterans he accepts their word of honor to return though he will be courtmartialed and shot if they don't. Naturally they all return though some of them berate themselves for it presumably inspiring the audiences to similar displays of duty to their country.In the United States one of the better WWII propaganda films was Howard Hawks' Air Force. In it we follow the mismatched crew of a bomber as they bond to each other with the experience of battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war. Typically for Hawks' films however their real loyalty is more to each other than to their country.Eisenstein has to reach far back in history to find any Russian military triumphs. Ironically Alexander like the other Russian princes is descended from the Vikings who sailed up the Russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms. So he is a conquerer repelling another wouldbe conquerer. Physically they are not that different though the actors portraying the German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and smirking stupidity. But the real contrast is between the common soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles whereas the German peasants who scuttle out of the shield wall to kill wounded Russians are a foot shorter than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. Russian serfs in the Middle Ages were much better off than their European counterparts because they could always escape into the wilderness and clear their own land.Eisenstein's film also cleverly gives us our first sight of Alexander as a fisherman. In the battle with the Germans he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall they are forced to regroup and mass on the West side of the lake where the ice is thinner.One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film which most audiences miss is the historically accurate way that he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities like Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing wealth and prominence largely to trade which put the merchants into power and sidelined the princes until their military expertise and feudal levies were needed to repel invaders. In the film Alexander is shown not only as a military leader but also as a master politician who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory.".

Therefore I probably did not experience the film the way it was meant to be seen and as a result my opinion of it has been tainted.Alexander Nevsky is a decent propaganda picture released during Stalin's reign over the Soviet Union. It is filled with patriotism and proud declaration of Russia's greatness and willingness to fight. However much of this enthusiasm didn't carry over for me and I felt very lost and detached the entire film again mostlikely due to the technical quality of the DVD. Also the translation and subtitles were awful and made it even harder to follow the film. However it did have one long rousing battle sequence that surely set the standard for many to come and a memorable score added to the excitement. Overall though it was all a bit underwhelming for me.I can only hope for a newly restored updated version to be released some day so that I can fully enjoy the film the way it was meant to be enjoyed.".

This film unlike many of his silent works is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group.  This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had risen to the fore by 1938.  Still his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil.  Nevsky is just one of many men.  He is prince because he is strongest but not because he is somehow different than the rest.  The film's romantic angles provide more of a personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies where you have to put to one side some of its obvious shortcomings a result of the date and location of its productionand accentuate the positive.  In many ways this is a truly superb film.Forgive the parody in the one line summary but the most serious shortcoming for an English speaker like me was the ghastly subtitles.  The print I saw had 1982 Soviet Film Export subtitles which consistently used inverted grammar presumably to give the impression of 13th century speech.  The actual impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the subtitles which means you spend less time looking at the images.  Given that the cinematographic imagery is this films great strength this is a real issue.Other IMDBniks have written plenty about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film just in case the viewer doesn't notice them for himherself. They have also written plenty about the battle on the ice scene which is superb in my view.  The love interest almost totally lacks subtlety and yet strangely..... almost totally lacks charm also.  But it is good to cringe every now and then.I was familiar with the Prokofiev music to this film long before seeing the film.  The images and the music complement each other marvelously.  And it is the images that will stick in the mind for a long time.  Bergman clearly learned a lot from these images  the imagery of his medieval pieces e.g. The Seventh Seal The Virgin Spring building upon and enhancing Eisenstein's ideas.  This film was made in 1938 in the USSR.  In that context it is a masterpiece albeit a flawed one.  For the modern viewer I suggest that you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on show.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hate to admit that this movie wasnt really one of my favorites. I saw it at the Arsenal  a small arthouse movie theater in the heart of Berlin  with great expectations. How surprised was I when I realized the film was a piece of the most outrageous Russian propaganda designed to support peoples feelings towards the Germans in a time of war. To say the least it seemed a little outdated.Apart from this disappointment I found the film to be yet another formal masterpiece of Eisensteins. His use of the frame composition and editing is just stunning almost unbelievably creative and of hypertrophic proportions. On the other hand there is that famous scene on the frozen lake which has an awkward look to it simply because the viewer is able to see that NOTHING is for real. Even the breaking ice resembles big chunks of plastic rather than the real thing.In addition it is plain to see that those were settings in a studio... Gee Americans know how to hide that fact so much better. All in all I didnt think it was a bad picture just a little overloaded with insignificant informations on how to defend Russian soil against the threat of the Germans. I understand there is a good reason for Russians to argue the way they do in that film obviously because Germany really was at war with Russia in the late thirties. On the other hand I just think its pathetically outdated and  above all  not very well acted either!Forgive me for my harsh critique of your genius master Sergei!".

	schema:reviewBody "Eisenstein was a visionary at this point with an unparalleled grasp of film language. But as with so many of this celebrated sort  Vertov Welles Tarkovsky  he had the misfortune of working under illiterate patrons.A complex web of events helps explain this while underlining his own trajectory through film.Soviet cinema was officially killed off by Stalin in 1932. It was asserted that all art henceforth should be something tangible that every prole should understand nothing abstract in the level of vision. Every notable Soviet film before and after that decree has been hastily lumped together in the West as propaganda but there is a world of difference between them.Eisenstein's roots are in the first days of the Proletkult and Meyerhold Proletkult's theater director. Proletkult was a radical movement in the arts that sought to devise a radical new culture to shape the new world all the curious iconoclastic things we associate with early communist art come from them. Meyerhold had been working for plays he staged on something he called biomechanics acting without interior space.Those were unstable and exciting times the first years following the Revolution. The world seemed like could be new again actually discovered anew a fresh start for humanity. It could be anything from one day to the next and naturally everyone had an opinion. I don't believe we have ever felt something even close to the scale of this in the West except perhaps briefly and rather schematically in the 60's. Proletkult was formally over by 1920 years before Eisenstein's first film dissolved in bureaucratic tugs for power. Lenin himself opposed it a man attuned with traditional ideas for art and beauty and ironically enough suspicious of grandiose visions. This happened at a crucial junction for the movement and the arts when the new state apparatus was being designed. But in just those few years it spawned something amazing.VGIK was set up in 1919 the famous Soviet film school. Lev Kuleshov taught there a very astute mind. The effect he pioneered and is named after him exhibited how there is no intrinsic meaning behind a given set of images a given part of life by extension beyond what the eye constructed in the present moment. The Soviets had caught perception unawares using film to examine the controls of it.Eisenstein put all this into effect the eye as studied by Kuleshov constructed space from Meyerhold. He went beyond them introducing the idea of layers from Chinese calligraphy. We got Stachka one of the most radical debuts in film history.So even though Proletkult was dissolved in the first hours of the movement its legacy thrived in his films and those of Kuleshov Pudovkin Vertov. The course had been set however as early as Lenin's decision in 1920 away from experimentation away from abstract exercise and radical breaks and into rigid control propaganda cultural bureaucracy another tradition in place of the old. Stalin clamped down on everyone. Trotsky was sent packing officially signalling the end of plans for world revolution. Eisenstein in the meantime had been to the US and back now a questionable figure accused by party hacks and broken after the Mexican failure.So fast forward to 1938 in many ways Eisenstein's path through Soviet film reflects the shift in an entire cosmology that was onethird of the world for the better part of a century.Strike and Potemkin we have classified as propaganda and a lot of their traditional appeal in film lore has been asserted in spite of their ideological fervor. But did they envision any state or authority beyond the will of the people? Or anything beyond the spontaneous burst for revolution?In keeping with basic principles Eisenstein had eschewed stars and professional actors in favor of those actual people and this was a time when Stalin was grooming himself as star of the regiment. World revolution as an idea had been axed with Trotsky and the whole thing was beginning to look more and more like a one man show. Alexander Nevsky was commissioned after the 1 star in Russian history.Notice then what happens to Eisenstein's technique in context of this repressive environment it is concrete as before still impressive on just the scope it is conceived but now strangely cumbersome stilted weighed down by the need for historical momentum. Once again swathes of people are filmed in harsh conflict with ideological opponents but now they are lead to battle by a true Russian hero statuesque and virtuous and are only a class insofar as their nationality is concerned.This is important to note. This is no longer about workers revolting or an eye constructing worlds. Now there is a face above the crowd leading dictating order. Having been deprived then of the enthusiasm to really envision a revolutionary world the eye turns dull pompous merely formal and rehearsing for the occasion.The most famous sequence in the film exemplifies this the epic battle on the icy river referencing a DW Griffith film. Kuleshov also referenced the same scene in By the Law but in 1926 he had been free to layer this into a complex metaphysical fabric. Eisenstein's similar scene by contrast unfolds as operatic splendor no longer modern and forwardlooking as was communism in the early days but conservative celebrating power virtue state.He was awarded the Stalin Prize in '41. The previous year Meyerhold had faced a firing squad as a subversive.".

I think it's best to just forget who directs this.This has all the makings of epic propaganda of high adventure.Alexander is a war hero and is called upon to fight the Tuetonic knights of Germany who invade their land.The chief plot here becomes the subplot of a comic romantic triangle however and the interweaving of this is probably the only thing that saves this movie from fairly heavy ennui.We don't mind the Teutonic knights being evil or Germans being the bad guys but they are portrayed in a way that makes no sense. For some reason a papal court leads the knights in evil. Not only did the papacy have nothing to do with Hitler and not only did Hitler persecute all theists but this had nothing to do with the propaganda needs at the time. The best guess here is that Russia didn't want to offend the rest of the East.Aside from the propaganda some things work. Alexander is well photographed throughout. Eisenstein's bright spot is in highlighting his hero.The rest of the movie is fairly dull a struggle to get through. This was made in days of movie houses so it is understandable that much of the movie is filler space for people to go to the lobby and buy popcorn and soda. This movie must have sold tons of popcorn and soda because 50 of it is walk out and buy popcorn and soda time.Eisenstein doesn't flair as a director but does have a knack for cameras. Use of cameras seems to be his forte.".

But the main focus of this is the epic battle sequence that features heaven knows how many extras waving their axes and swords around occasionally hitting something usually someone's head It seems the extras get carried away in several scenes you can see several of them attacking each other lol. Though masterful the whole thing DOES become a bit repetitive after awhile eg people swinging weapons around people riding horses people getting bopped on heads etc.Finally I have no idea whether exportfilm which I guess handled subtitling for this film? has corrected the English subtitles but the version I saw had more or less the correct dialog for the film.but was presented in a very yodalike manner. eg Fight we must!".

However the anxiety of the creature creates havoc in the laboratory that is burnt down and explodes killing Frankenstein's assistants Dr. Zahlus Quentin Crisp and Paulus Timothy Spall. Dr. Frankenstein believes the creature died too but he flees to the woods. Soon he meets and befriends the dwarf Rinaldo David Rappaport who gives a name to him Viktor and invites him to work in a circus in Budapest. Meanwhile Frankenstein and his house keeper Mrs. Baumann Geraldine Page teach Eva how to behave and to be independent. One day Frankenstein introduces Eva to the highsociety telling that she was found amnesic in the woods and has become his protge. But Frankenstein becomes obsessed of Eva while Viktor and she have a strange connection. What will happen to Eva? The Bride is a different version of Frankenstein story by Mary Shelley. The film is actually a romance that begins slow paced but well resolved in the end. Clancy Brown has an outstanding performance in the role of the naive creature.

The cinematography is beautifully done creating a rich atmosphere and setting for the story. Filmed in England and France the locations add some real authenticity to the story this is no Hollywood back lot. Some may criticize the acting skills of the leads or the degree of depth in the story line but one thing is sure the movie is consistent in story direction mood and content from beginning to end a well delivered package. I also enjoyed this spin on the Frankenstein monster he's got personality and character. Instead of being only an object of horror as in other films the viewer gets to know and identify with him as the movie progresses coming to care for his success and well being. As another viewer stated previously approach this movie as a Gothic novel instead of a horror story and you're sure to find some enjoyment from it.".

	schema:headline " A Great Gothic RomanceNot a Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Bride is more Thomas Hardy than Mary Shelley and more Gothic romance than horror. Director Franc Roddam points out on his DVD commentary that he wanted to make a very different version of the old story by eliminating almost all elements of horror so only the first ten minutes qualify as authentic horror. Roddam does not discuss the illogic of making a film devoid of the very elements its target audience was interested in seeing but we already know that The Bride had a very poor showing at the box office. This target audience disconnect was most likely the cause. Nor does he comment on the failure to market the film to another audience segment those interested in Gothic period pieces.It is especially cool that 20 years later the film is finally being discovered by this other audience and they are finding it a beautifully photographed example of their genre that emphasizes storyline and atmosphere over blood and gore. Even the much criticized casting of inexperienced leads Jennifer Beals and Sting although both look great in period costume takes on a different dimension when the film is reclassified into the Gothic genre. Suddenly you see that it was the director who was responsible for the apparent lack of chemistry between the two stars particularly Beals lack of passion in the scenes they share. Roddam wanted these performances from his actors to advance his story they are not not a reflection of inexperience or talent limitation. Which is not to say that Sting will ever be mistaken for a great acting talent but Beals has been unjustly criticized for a shallow performance when she simply gave Roddam what he wanted from her character Eva. Eva is only learning how to feel as the film progresses and when the events have all played out you realize that her emotionless attitude was meant to convey the indifference she felt toward her creator.I highly recommend this movie as Roddam is an excellent stylistic director and has made a very good and very original Gothic romance. The fantastic production design unifies what are two stories as Roddam cuts back and forth between the Baron Sting teaching his creation Eva Beals while David Rappaport as Rinaldo teaches his other creation Victor played by Clancy Brown. There is a psychic link between the two creations which will result in a interesting plot twist.Roddam has created a visually gorgeous film that has held up much better than the 1980's mainstream features that outperformed it at the box office. Don't be scared away by the negative comments if you know what to expect gothic romance not horror almost any fan of films will enjoy The Bride. I recommend the DVD it was made from a flawless print and the widescreen presentation really showcases both the topnotch photography and the terrific work of the production designer.".

He invites the monster along and gives him the name of Victor. It is from Rinaldo who's patient and understanding in a way Dr. Frankenstein never was that Victor learns how to get by in life how to behave how to share and to go after your dreams.Meanwhile back at the castle Dr. Frankenstein is trying to educate and enlighten his newest creation Eva a lovely and talented Jennifer Beals.

He does not however consider the full implications of his aspirations.As Eva grows and learns she begins to ask questions. She has been lied to about who she is and where she comes from. Much to Dr. Frankenstein's annoyance she has become strongwilled and independent just like a man but obviously not quite what he had considered. He had also not considered how arousing he would find her.Victor and Rinaldo successfully join the circus after much persuading but Rinaldo longs for his dream to visit Venice and Victor discovers he longs for his dream of Eva his intended.As the movie progresses there is an obvious connection between the two characters which they are aware of but aren't in contact with each other.As Dr. Frankenstein introduces Eva into society with a few little mishaps Eva discovers a handsome young soldier played by a very young Cary Elwes.

The scenes with Victor and Rinaldo are wonderful. Jennifer Beals is perfectly bewitching at first unknowing and naive then becoming strong and intelligent as the movie progresses yet still revealing an innocence to her character.I think anyone would be charmed and entertained by this wonderful movie and I highly recommend it to all.".

	schema:reviewBody "A beautiful movie! It was really quite lusciously filmed where everything  the set designs the costumes outdoor locations and luscious depiction of an early 18th century Transylvania setting  are absolutely topnotch and give the film an almost magical sort of quality. This is must see film making.The movie basically deals with the lives and fates of two living creations of Dr. Frankenstein played by Sting one Viktor whom you might think of as Frankenstein's Monster is a big scary guy. The other Eva played by Jennifer Beals is a beautiful young woman. Both have been created from spare body parts and then brought to life by Dr. Frankenstein in the laboratory. There is a storm and a fire the tower in which the laboratory is housed is destroyed and Viktor escapes to fend for himself out in the countryside of Transylvania. Eva is taken care of by Dr. Frankenstein who along with others in the castle helps to educate the helpless young woman.That essentially is the setting for the movie and it is told in a surprisingly effective dual tales sort of technique. In one story we watch as Viktor goes out on his own and meets up with Rinaldo a sly but very lovable midget played by David Rappaport. Rinaldo convinces Viktor that the two of them would make a good living by going off to join the circus and so off they go getting involved in a couple of amusing scrapes along the way. Eventually they do indeed end up with the circus where both are mercilessly exploited by the circus entrepreneurs Magar and Bela played by Alexei Sayles and Phil Daniels.Meanwhile back at the castle... We watch how Eva is carefully groomed and schooled in the finest European fashion and meticulously transformed Eliza Doolittlestyle into quite the proper upper class young lady.The movie carefully and with nicelytimed pacing switches back and forth between these two stories and these stories prove to be very enjoyable watching.I didn't find it distracting whatsoever to see Sting playing Dr. Frankenstein. Sure they could have found a different and arguably better actor to play the good ? doctor but at the time this movie was made 1985 Sting was the Man  you know the dude with the starpower name who could pull in the teenagers. And probably the same could be said for Jennifer Beals who was still riding high from her recent fame in 1983's Flashdance. They need to fill those seats in the theaters folks! No they aren't that bad don't let that deter you from seeing the movie. And if you are a Sting fan or a Jennifer Beals fan and we know how painful THAT can be then you will be even more delighted with this film.Oh yes I said in the summary bar above that this is also a thoughtprovoking story. Well basically both Viktor and Eva are subjected to varying degrees of exploitation by their benefactors and one can't help but feel that the movie is an allegory for how the strong exploit the weak. This was especially true back in the days of old where man exploited man. Now thankfully we live in a modern and enlightened age and it's just the opposite!".

It's at least enjoyable half of the time since it functions as two different stories which merge together later on.The best part of the movie regards the adventures of the Frankenstein Monster wellplayed by Clancy Brown and his friendly dwarf companion the excellent David Rappaport as they roam the exquisite countryside trying to discover their dreams. When this half of the movie is playing you can't help but be moved.Unfortunately the other half consists of rock star Sting it hurts me to say this but I think he makes a good Frankenstein and the gorgeous Jennifer Beals as his latest creation. They don't add anything to the whole mix though and only get in the way and slow things down. This film could have been quite good indeed had these parts been removed and the exploits of the monster and his pal been fleshed out.I think my opinion is a popular one among critics and fans but one thing is clear this film is not as bad as some think and it's in no way intended to be a remake of 1935's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scripted by Lloyd Fonvielle from the novel by Mary Shelley this is a fairly interesting revisionist take on Shelley's legendary story. Rock star Sting stars as the icy cold Charles Frankenstein who as the film opens has already created his male monster Clancy Brown and is now in the process of constructing the monsters' mate Jennifer Beals whom he names Eva. During the subsequent destruction of Frankensteins' lab the male monster escapes soon making the acquaintance of amiable dwarf Rinaldo David Rappaport. Rinaldos' ambition is to eventually make it to Venice but for now he wants to join a circus to make ends meet and the monster  who Rinaldo dubs Viktor  tags along. Meanwhile Frankenstein works hard at creating in his eyes the perfect woman to introduce to high society.The lovely friendship between Rinaldo and Viktor is the true heart and soul of the film and makes it worth seeing. Rappaport is so endearing  he's the real star of this show  and he and Brown work so well together that they make the segments with Beals and Sting less intriguing by comparison. There is a theme here of men harbouring a fear and distrust of the empowered woman and Frankensteins' desire to basically be in charge of Evas' life is part of his undoing. Brown is wonderful as Viktor and while Sting and Beals do decent jobs they're not as much fun to watch. A superb supporting cast consisting of Anthony Higgins Geraldine Page Alexei Sayle Phil Daniels Veruschka von Lehndorff Quentin Crisp Cary Elwes Timothy Spall Guy Rolfe and Tony Haygarth lends a great deal of respectability.The Bride has the absolutely perfect look in terms of classic Gothic horror but in the end it's much more of a drama and romance than a horror film. Its opening scene is certainly great horror in the old tradition and the lab set is amazing. The period recreation is impeccable and Maurice Jarres' music is beautiful.Overall a good film worth a look or revisit for fans of this kind of literature.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Mary Shelley's famous story has often been heavily criticized surprisingly. Actually I find it a refreshing and imaginative effort. It concerns the efforts of Baron Charles Frankenstein Sting to create control and ultimately to conquer the perfect woman. After an electrifying creation scene the baron's first male creation comes to claim his counterpart but disaster results and he runs off into the night. After rescuing the raven haired beauty from the flames engulfing his laboratory the baron decides to tell people she was brought to him after being discovered unconscious in the woods. He gives her the name Eva and begins educating her. In the meantime the male creature befriends a dwarf after rescuing him from a group of tormenting schoolboys. The dwarf looks beyond the creature's unusual appearance and sees a man simply longing for friendship and acceptance. He gives him the name Viktor teaches him about life on the road. The two stories intertwine until circumstances bring Viktor back to the Baron's castle to try to win back his bride. The Baron's creations are played by Jennifer Beals and Clancy Brown. The late Dasvid Rappaport plays the dwarf Rinaldo. If I have any criticisms it's that Sting in his portrayal of the Baron has a constant irritated look on his face and final confrontation between Eva and the Baron could have been better written. Other than that I really enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bride is one of the earlier attempts to sex up classic horror stories with period piece production value glitz and hot young actors predating Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein if not Frank Langella's Dracula. The movie has a great opening hook What if the Monster's Mate survived the explosion at the end of Bride of Frankenstein? From there the movie builds itself as something of a feminist fable. Dr. Frankenstein given the first name Charles for some reason decides he can build the perfect woman a woman who thinks like a man is as he puts it equal to a man. The script nods silently at his sexist intentions. The film has quite a bit of potential with that setup.It doesn't quite live up to it but still the movie that follows is definitely worth watching. The story is split in two. One follows the Frankenstein Monster quickly named Viktor as he befriends a traveling dwarf and tries to make a career in the circus. The other half of the film revolves around Baron Frankenstein training and teaching the Bride dubbed Eva in the ways of polite society basically a horror version of My Fair Lady. Oddly of the two story lines the Monster's quest is actually the more interesting. Paired with Renaldo the late David Rappaport the two become immediate friends. Stories of outsiders struggling to make it can be prone to smultz but then again there has never been a more definitive outsider then the Frankenstein Monster. It's the entire appeal of his character. There are no surprises in the circus drama that follows but the performances of Rappaport and Clancy Brown make up for the potentially trite material. Rappaport makes dialogue as hokey as Follow your heart and you'll be fine actually effecting. Renaldo's death scene is likely to bring a tear to your eye. Brown's take on the monster a mumbling simpleton who slowly learns his own selfworth never rings hollow even if it's far from the actor's best work.By comparison the Bride's journey comes off as more route. The broad comedy of her learning to eat or shrieking much like Elsa Lanchester at cats quickly gives way to the girl as a fully selfaware young woman dancing at balls and gaining the attention of a young count. Played by young handsome Cary Elwes. Remember when Cary Elwes was young and handsome? The most potentially interesting material the stuff inbetween is glossed over.The relationship with the doctor isn't delved deeply into. Sting who has always been fairly adapt at playing villains gives a decent enough performance but his growing feelings for the girl and his sudden turn to teethgnashing villainy at the end are more script problems then actor problems. The inherent sexism in his desire to build the perfect woman boils down to him being fine with teaching her but as soon as she shows any romantic desire for another man he gets all possessive and rapey. That a male ends up rescuing her at the end rather undermines the point of the story.The potentially complex material is simplified a bit. It's no fault of Jennifer Beals who gives a rather understated thoughtful performance as the titular woman. The psychic connection between the two creations is never explained and comes off as a plot contrivance.Even if the movie never lives up to its potential it does have some striking moments. The nude Bride slinking out of the darkness clinging to the Baron's side like a frightened animal. Or later on her standing in the rain in an open tomb questioning her own origins. The opening sequence with its disembodied body parts twitching in shattered tubes of liquid suggests a more conventional just as effective horror film could have been made from this material. The movie wasn't successful upon release which is probably why it's underseen and somewhat underrated today. Frankenstein fans should seek it out if just to wonder about the excellent film that it could have been instead of the merely satisfying one it is.".

And it was anything but a horror movie. It was a heart warming story much more complex than the 1931 Universal movie. Both the male monster and female monster were very sympathetic characters. I love period Old World costume productions which this was. The movie had a rich high budget look. Sting acted respectfully. The midget character was a bit Disneyesque  a little too sentimental but he was charming nonetheless. I had no clue how this was going to end but was satisfied by the ending. I suppose it did poorly because it wasn't a horror movie with scary monsters in it. But I still liked it a lot.".

This one of the best horror movies from the 80's. If it does not scary you no movie will. 5.3 is underrating it. This is a true horror classic. It is kind of a love story. But still it is a very good movie. It is a great monster movie. Doctor Frankenstein his a bad guy. And the monster is a good guy. So it is not quit the traditional Frankenstein movie. Frankenstein 1931 is better. But still this is a good movie. The Bride of Frankenstein is better. This is better then Frankenstein 1910. It a great film.";

Rock Legend Sting plays scientist Frankenstein who recreates 2 people intended for each other until they're separated after a lab explosion. Beals Flashdance plays Eva the woman who is taught about life and herself by Frankenstein. Brown The Shawshank Redemption plays the man Viktor who wanders around the countryside. The late Rappaport Time Bandits plays Rinaldo a dwarf who not only befriends Viktor but teaches him to follow his heart and dreams. Soon Frankenstein tries to keep Eva for himself but she and Viktor eventually find their way to each other. Elwes The Princess Bride appears briefly as Josef a young man who takes advantage of Eva. I've always liked this film and think it's underrated. It's got some dramatic and suspenseful moments Sting  the cast are great as well as Maurice Jarre's score. I recommend this.".

The female seems scared of the first creation and it ends up out on its own for awhile as Dr. Frankenstein tries to put his moves on his latest model. Well the other one meets up with a little person who befriends him and they become quite the team. These are by far the best moments in the film to me as it is nice to see the monster of the film be treated very well by his new buddy. It is sad what happens to him in this movie and in real life. However this leads to an ending that works a bit better for me than most of the films featuring Frankenstein and his monster. The scenes though with Sting are not all that great and at times the movie seems really boring when it is not focused on Rappaport and the monster. However overall it is okay.".

Griffith employed it for dozens of films.The Bride begins where Bride of Frankenstein ended with the creation of the mate for Frankenstein's monster. The scene is generally based on those of the 1930s Universal films with a laboratory in a tower full of bubbling beakers spinning gizmos flashing doodads archaic levers and pulleys and the lightning. There's also an electric globe that looks like one of those Van de Graaff generators you see in science museums for children. Dr. Frankenstein has his assistants too one of which may be the usual hunchback except the hunched back isn't prominently displayed if it's there and another who is a whitehaired fellow doctor with a passing resemblance to Dr. Pretorius from the 1935 film without an ounce of the charm. There's the typical violent conclusion and the monster runs away his path diverging for most of the film from those of Dr. Frankenstein and the bride. But of course we know their paths will converge again by the end because that's how these movies work and because the monster and his bride inexplicably have a psychic connection. It must be love... or lightning. Ooh tagline idea Born of lightning and mutilated corpses. Their love was electric.Jennifer Beals as the bride christened here as Eva after Genesis heads the cast with her Razzienominated performance her snarling and initially painfullyslow delivery grabbing its due attention but the musician Sting is equal to the part of Frankenstein as well. Content to speak softly about the new woman and do next to nothing for most of the film he occasionally has bursts of chauvinistic and jealous yelling and violence. Frankenstein's original creature christened here Viktor the name of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and his midget friend unfortunately for those interested in rubbish are more interesting to follow as they have a journey plot that takes them to Budapest and employment with a circus. Viktor also finds himself chased by a mob a hallmark of the Universal monster movies and he has an encounter with a blind man much different than the ones he had in either the 1935 film or Mary Shelley's novel.I'm afraid there are two other bits about The Bride that I liked but I promise they're brief. One is the reference to Percy Shelley's book Prometheus Unbound Prometheus also being part of the subtitle of his wife Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. The other bit is the secret passageway behind a mirror that reveals the truth of her origins to Eva. I like a good mirror shot and it stands out in a film otherwise framed barely better than a TV movie with some cinematic lowkey lighting.I've been reviewing a bunch of Frankenstein movies since reading the novel which is something I also recently did with Dracula. More so than Dracula most Frankenstein films manage to avoid reducing the Gothic horror story to a romance but not here. Although Frankenstein may've lasted more than a decade longer than Dracula without it where films such as Blacula 1972 and Dan Curtis's TVmovie Bram Stoker's Dracula 1974 introduced the reincarnation romance ripped off most famously by Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula.Oh and the ending of The Bride takes a page from D.W. Griffith's playbook by resorting to a damselindistress scenario with Eva in the part frequently played by Lillian Gish where she runs away from her wouldbe rapist only to be saved in a lastminute rescue by the hero. A perfect ending for anyone comforted by the hackneyed and if one thought that Boris Karloff's speech about life and death to conclude the 1935 film was too pithy and poignant lacking the copious amounts of sap required for an oldfashioned mawkish finale fear not. Unless boredom or generally low quality frightens you there is nothing to fear in The Bride.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few minutes into this movie and I began wondering if there might have been a prequel that I should have been aware of. It felt like a continuation of a story that had gone before with the character of the yet unnamed Viktor Clancy Brown representing the Frankenstein Monster that all horror fans are familiar with. This sense of being just a bit off balance remained with me for the rest of the picture because this wasn't really a horror film per se but more of a Gothic love story gone wrong for the principals Dr. Frankenstein Sting and his latest creation which he named Eva Jennifer Beals.There's actually a story within a story as the movie unfolds as Dr. Frankenstein's original creation escapes from the burning castle tower following a laboratory accident and an experiment gone wrong. Presumed dead the ungainly creature is befriended by the dwarf Rinaldo David Rappaport who convinces him to journey along to Budapest to join the circus and make their fortune. There's an awkward subtext of 'following one's dream' that carries through the remainder of the story that relies on a psychic link between the newly named Viktor and the woman Eva he felt spurned by when she was first created. When Viktor cries at the death of his friend Eva cries as well feeling trapped by the domineering aspect of her creator.It almost seems as if the writer and director were inserting as many themes into the story that they felt they could get away with in attracting an audience.

None of it seemed to work for this viewer particularly the forced feeling of the picture's happy ending. By then the voice over narration and vision of the dwarf Rinaldo insuring the picture's message of 'he will win' just made it seem all too corny for my taste.".

	onyx:emotionText "A few minutes into this movie and I began wondering if there might have been a prequel that I should have been aware of. It felt like a continuation of a story that had gone before with the character of the yet unnamed Viktor Clancy Brown representing the Frankenstein Monster that all horror fans are familiar with. This sense of being just a bit off balance remained with me for the rest of the picture because this wasn't really a horror film per se but more of a Gothic love story gone wrong for the principals Dr. Frankenstein Sting and his latest creation which he named Eva Jennifer Beals.There's actually a story within a story as the movie unfolds as Dr. Frankenstein's original creation escapes from the burning castle tower following a laboratory accident and an experiment gone wrong. Presumed dead the ungainly creature is befriended by the dwarf Rinaldo David Rappaport who convinces him to journey along to Budapest to join the circus and make their fortune. There's an awkward subtext of 'following one's dream' that carries through the remainder of the story that relies on a psychic link between the newly named Viktor and the woman Eva he felt spurned by when she was first created. When Viktor cries at the death of his friend Eva cries as well feeling trapped by the domineering aspect of her creator.It almost seems as if the writer and director were inserting as many themes into the story that they felt they could get away with in attracting an audience. Along with the 'follow one's dream' aspect there was also an obvious overture to women's lib with Eva consistently extolling the right to her own person while the Baron's friend Clerval Anthony Higgins lamented the idea of any woman attaining equality with men.

	schema:reviewBody "There is something strange about 'Dragonfly'. It is not a thriller in its subject but it deals with it as if it's a thriller. Even more strange in some scenes it actually succeeds in that. I mean when your wife has died and she is trying to reach you from the other side is something else than simply seeing dead people. Your wife probably has the best intentions and although it is creepy you do not have to be scared of your dead wife. I guess. The man who thinks his dead wife is trying to reach him is Joe Darrow Kevin Costner. Is he going mad a premise for a dramatic film or is he really connecting to the other side?At times where his wife is communicating with Joe at least to Joe's knowledge the film breaths a creepy atmosphere with a cinematography and score that make things suspenseful. But the film does not have its focus on whether Joe is going mad or not but on how scary it is when a dead person talks to you. That there is actually suspense shows that there is some nice filmmaking to be found here. The premise is interesting although not that new but especially the final act in the film goes wrong at crucial points. There is a moment where I thought the film was over I will not reveal where but at that time certain things were left in the middle. It felt like the right ending. But then the film continues providing it with an ending that must have popped into many heads from the audience probably dismissed by a lot for being too ridiculous.Still the premise and the first hour are good enough to keep us entertained and although it should not work as a thriller it does. Watching it like that without thinking too much could help you like this film in one way or another.".

If I were to examine every little detail of the film I could no doubt as other reviewers have done find things that don't quite add up.

But I won't do that because I could do it with every other film that has been made with the same result.Summary. Very good film and well worth a look. 710";

The twist in the ending gives some credibility to the journey of the lead character but Kevin Costner's character exhibited characteristics one would not expect of a doctor let alone head of the emergency room.  This gave Costner's character less credibility throughout where even the good twist at the end couldn't salvage it.  There were also some relationships that could have been better developed.  This movie seemed to focus primarily on Kevin Costner's character through placing utmost importance on his perspective when development would have been better achieved through more insightful development of the relationships that support him.  For example the character's relationship with his supervisor could have been less cold maybe reflected more of a complex camaraderie.  I believe these relationships the supervisor Kathy Bates as the nextdoor neighbor could have offered more insight into the relationship between Joe Darrow and his wife Emily than was reflected in the film.All in all I was disappointed with the film.  It had a great premise that needed a deeper message a stronger pull throughout the film.  It's best asset was the twist at the end.

SOMEWHERE he must have fans but they apparently stayed away from this film and several of his other recent ones.  Here he plays a doctor whose pregnant wife Thompson is killed in an avalanchebus accident while volunteering in the jungle.  A lifelong disbeliever in the traditional assumptions about the afterlife he finds himself challenged by a series of eerie sometimes unbelievable events.  He bounces ideas off of his pragmatic but concerned neighbor Bates and works overtime trying to make heads or tails out of the confusing signals he thinks he is getting from Thompson but may also be making up in his griefstricken mind.  The film has a fair amount of atmosphere and a couple of minor thrills along the way but ultimately it winds up being not only improbable but downright preposterous!  It's not that what happens at the climax couldn't happen it's just handled in such a ridiculous way that it blows any sense of reality away.  Costner who is before the eyes of the world morphing into Sam Neill does an adequate job.  His usual monotone speaking voice does mar certain sections of the film but he also injects enough emotion at times to make up for it somewhat.  Bates at possibly her most enormous of all time is endearingly matteroffact.  Hunt pops up briefly and hilariously as a somewhat mysterious nun.  One major problem is that most of the people in the film do not behave the way real humans behave.  It's all very contrived and bythenumbers in order to move the plot along.  Also the director telegraphs things to the point of ridiculousness.  He wisely made some cuts  available on the DVD  that would have spoiled the ending for even more people than before if they'd have been left in.  As it stands some people will be surprised by the resolution.  Thompson has some lovely moments as the wife but her relationship with Costner is sketchy at best robbing the audience of a true emotional core to the story.  Her very first scene is horribly melodramatic and phony though.  There's bound to be an audience for this type of film the people that love metaphysical romanceconquersall type of things.

Sometimes a fresh approach allows for a film to hit the mark but not this time. After listening to Shadyac's featurelength commentary on the DVD release it's obvious he understands the material while promoting his next comedy feature with Jim Carey  how annoying but he couldn't translate this to the screen.Firstly we don't get enough backstory to really appreciate the strength of Joe's a strong performance by Kevin Costner love for his wife and the resulting emotional turmoil he is currently experiencing now that she is believed dead.Secondly there are wasted performances by Kathy Bates and Linda Hunt in small roles. Their performances are strong and while their characters are significant to the story being told they are too small. They could have been written to be more instrumental to the story.Thirdly there are too many cliches such as the verymaturefortheiragedyingofcancerchildren. Another would be the hospital administrator. Perhaps Shadyac forgot that everyone has seen all of this on TV's ER and should have put together more creative minds to try and tell this aspect of the story differently.And lastly and the most obvious is the amount of additional footage that went into the production. There is an entire major scene that was shot afterwards and inserted into the film and it's so glaringly obviously that it ends up detracting from the story.  The following isn't intended to be a spoiler to the ending of the film but read at your own risk. The scene where Joe dies underwater in the bus and is then pulled to shore where he comes to was a new scene. The scene itself is wellproduced and definately adds action to the story. But the following scene has Joe running fulltilt through the forest with no apparent discomfort or distress and still relatively wellcoiffed. Not very likely for someone that had just flatlined from drowning. Had director Shadyac reshot a bit more to show Joe running with obvious physical distress this would have added more muchneeded realism to the surprise ending which is worth hanging around for.".

Had director Shadyac reshot a bit more to show Joe running with obvious physical distress this would have added more muchneeded realism to the surprise ending which is worth hanging around for.";

Pictures like these often suffer with pointless or meaningless characters such as Kathy Bates who only exists to increase the number of pages in the script. There are also scenes in Dragonfly which are absolutely silly and not believable. Even though there are a few moments of interest or excitement most of it is stupid boring and dull. Kevin Costner is not a bad actor but his choices of films in recent years has not been good and Dragonfly is no exception. I already mentioned that I liked The Mothman Prophesies and when it comes to the genre of supernatural thrillers I would recommend it.

He tries to move on but he thinks he is going crazy with little things happening around the home and thinking he is seeing things. When a patient at his hospital has a neardeath experience he returns to tell Joe that Emily has something to tell him but the patient can't remember anything other than a symbol he remembered seeing. As Joe digs deeper he finds more mystery without many good answers. Meanwhile his friends and colleagues worry that they are losing him.Do you get weepy at stories where love lives on beyond the grave? Do you believe that love between two soul mates could be so strong as to cross any divide? If these things sound like a story well worth hearing then you are probably target audience for this film and may well enjoy it. Certainly its blend of the supernatural and eternal love will be best enjoyed by those who rate Ghost as one of their favourite movies ever. For the majority the sentimentality may be a bit too much to swallow though but it still does enough as a mystery to keep things moving forward. When the ending does come though it does have enough emotional syrup to choke a camel and it takes its time to get to the conclusion that we all knew was coming. The mix of jump scares and romance doesn't work that well but like I say it pushes the right buttons to suit the target audience even if it pushes the emotion one a bit too hard.Costner is roundly depressed from start to finish and can't do much more with his character than mope around the place looking sad before occasionally looking frenzied and determined. He does enough to suit the material but I did struggle to see this as the man who once barnstormed it in Oliver Stone's JFK. Thompson is all a bit angelic and saintly and therefore just joins the dots in her performance. The support cast will have plenty of familiar faces but none of them do much of note Morton and Rifkin are just sort of there while Kathy Bates takes the money for a few scenes and a week or so's work.Overall this is not a terrible film but it is very much aimed at a specific type of viewer and if you're not into this sort of thing then it is unlikely you'll get much from it although it does enough to be distracting and watchable if still nonsense.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are certainly many meanings underneath the veil of comedy of this movie. Indeed defining Dans la maison a comedy would be reductive in the same way as thriller sounds out of tune. And it's really difficult to assign a precise category to it. It's a multifaceted movie showing different levels of interpretation. From the point of view of the teacher it's a subtle reflection of a middle aged failed man who has to come to terms with his failure as a writer and his incapability to inspire enthusiasm in class of bored students. From the point of view of the wives it's a refined portrait of middle aged unsatisfied women and their need to find any kind of escape or consolation. But above all the movie offers a lucid and intelligent gaze on people's voyeuristic curiosity on how much we are ready to do in order to see what happens behind closed doors and walls and here the pair teacherstudent works perfectly and develops through the quickpaced writing of a story where the boundaries between reality and fiction become more and more faded thus making it intriguing and engrossing. On this aspect the movie is also a reflection on the process itself of artistic creation which can seduce the reader or the viewer with an incredible power of attraction. A movie which certainly offers a perfect balance between suspense and entertainment supported by a talented young and mature cast involving the viewer till the utmost and moving us to an unpredictable and gripping finale.".

It's a multifaceted movie showing different levels of interpretation. From the point of view of the teacher it's a subtle reflection of a middle aged failed man who has to come to terms with his failure as a writer and his incapability to inspire enthusiasm in class of bored students. From the point of view of the wives it's a refined portrait of middle aged unsatisfied women and their need to find any kind of escape or consolation. But above all the movie offers a lucid and intelligent gaze on people's voyeuristic curiosity on how much we are ready to do in order to see what happens behind closed doors and walls and here the pair teacherstudent works perfectly and develops through the quickpaced writing of a story where the boundaries between reality and fiction become more and more faded thus making it intriguing and engrossing. On this aspect the movie is also a reflection on the process itself of artistic creation which can seduce the reader or the viewer with an incredible power of attraction. A movie which certainly offers a perfect balance between suspense and entertainment supported by a talented young and mature cast involving the viewer till the utmost and moving us to an unpredictable and gripping finale.";

The story has the power to control over the audience which sometime drags between reality and fiction as its layers and subplots. You can't just judge the story especially the end but you have to experience yourself by watching it till end. The twist was really a nice one it made the movie completely. I liked the scene at the end when they both sit on a chair and looks at a small flats from outside and say their own version stories.The movie was suspenseful but comedy especially when the character Germain popout as a narrator or guidance during the story flow of a student and his affair. The actual story of the movie was a teacher finds out one of his student's caliber in writing. So he offers him guidance to improve his talent which later the student submits a series of essay papers. When the story written by his student brings complication to around them there is no other way to solve it. Before to giving up on it is reached at its highest point to blow on everything out.As the story was loosely based on the house the title was perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Ozon is the director of this provocative and unusual film that takes the viewer inside the minds of the characters. It is not a traditional movie with a beginning and an end but a study of a period in the lives of different people. In this movie a high school student named Claude catches the attention of his teacher named Germain through an essay that explores the family of another student named Raffa. Claude has begun to tutor Raffa in mathematics. At first the teacher as the student's mentor is hesitant about the breach of privacy with this series of essays but succumbs to the the temptation to become a voyeur. Each essay ends with the notation...To Be Continued. Both student and teacher are seen as outsiders in their own worlds and are strangely attracted to the family. The student gently mocks the family he is observing as dull and middle class. The teacher can understand this estrangement from their world because Claude is from a different world and the teacher himself is something of an outsider in his own world. He encourages the boy to continue his writing because he feels the boy has potential as a writer. As the movie goes along we see the family of Raffa behaving as many other families pursuing money and status. The boy and his father are both named Raffa so they become the Raffas plural. The student has a romantic interest in the mother who seems to be the real reason he wants to explore the home. The desire for sexual encounters is present throughout the movie and seems to come out in a few surprising and light hearted episodes. We also see how Raffa and Claude interact with their teacher and the other students and their own families. The wives of Germain the teacher and Raffa Sr. are also interesting with one a traditional woman handling the domestic lives of the two Raffas. Meanwhile Germain's wife manages an art gallery for two wealthy sisters who she is trying to keep happy by making the gallery profitable. The movie is an interesting view of modern angst with the pressures to conform competing with the desire to be independent and on occasion straying from the accepted standards. All in all it is a provocative look at the different lives of people who interact and occasionally come into conflict. At the end we see the message to be continued.".

Germain Fabrice Luchini is a French lit teacher married to Jeanne Kristen Scott Thomas who runs a modern art gallery without much success she insists on showing conceptual art that no one understands or in fact that everyone understands too well as pretentious claptrap. Germain disgusted by his students' plebeian efforts at writing at first comes across as a kind of aesthetic purist who sees literature as occupying some sort of moral high ground we are gently pushed to this conclusion because we can see he is uncomfortable about telling his wife the truth about her gallery that merely slapping a picture of Hitler on a blowup doll is not a real indictment of the tyranny of gender or the gendering of tyranny  it works either way and you just know that somewhere some art student has come up with the same idea and someone like Camille Paglia has praised it. Amidst the dross he is surprised to find a short essay by one of his students Claude that captivates him. In crisp simple prose Claude describes his fascination with the house and family of schoolmate Rapha and how as a math tutor to help his nice but thick pettybourgeois friend tellingly he cannot understand imaginary numbers he manages to infiltrate Rapha's house and capture the scent of a middle class woman Rapha's mother convincingly played by Emmanuelle Seigner. He ends his vivid account with a to be continued  suivre in French whose terseness is a bit more urgent than the English version. Germain starts talking to Claude who until then was an otherwise unremarkable student. He begins tutoring him and encouraging him to write although he maintains a superior attitude about the relationship more or less it would appear you have some small talent. Here is where it gets interesting. Germain becomes so entranced by Claude's treatment of his friend's ultraconventional and boring middle class family that he begins to suggest which details to emphasise in his accounts. In other words he starts suggesting plot lines to heighten the narrative drama which Claude more or less puts into play by manipulating the family eventually the division between fantasy and reality is broached. It seems at first the film will insist on being yet another highbrow indictment of middle class banality  young Claude is smarter and better educated than anyone in the Rapha household even Mommy Rapha's obsession with House Beautiful style decoration is belied by her very banal results. But there's a twist amidst the semisnide comments it becomes increasingly obvious that Claude and Germain have other agendas than merely exploring the upper reaches of high art by diving into the world of the petty bourgeois Raphas. Manipulating the Raphas becomes a power game in which Germain can flatter his ego that was flattened by his lack of literary talent we discover he is a failed novelist and Claude can finally feel something because he comes from a broken home with a paralysed ! father and a mother who abandoned the family when Claude was young we get hints later that it was to seek love. At this point nearly everyone is tainted and morally ambiguous Germain's wife's gallery fails because she insists on showing highbrow conceptual art that no one buys despite warnings from the building owners a deus ex machina represented by twins but she leaves him when she realises Germain is no more than an emotional voyeur who can only live through Claude's manipulation of the innocent Raphas. Germain gets fired because he stole a math test so Claude could get brownie points with the thick Rapha junior Claude's alleged talent is revealed to be no more than a fascination with the seedy at the end he seems as homeless as the bynow fired Germain. When the Raphas get their act together to take advantage of a deal in China they unite Mommy rejects Claude's advances and realises he's just a boy with a boy's childish destructive streak Daddy grows a pair stops whining about his richer and more successful partner and launches his own business even Rapha junior thick headed and apparently innocent and nave finally realises that Claude is really more of an emotional parasite than a friend and beats him up for making a pass at his mother. In the end the boring and conventional Raphas are vindicated and the intellectual and artistic highbrows Claude Germain and his wife are ruined. This is a scriptdriven film everything is narrated and the actors are illustrating scenes that Claude has written at the urging of his mentor and fellow emotional cripple Germain. As such it could have been slow but the pace is quite racy director Franois Ozon not only uses the to be followed to keep up interest he gives a little wink to the audience when he overuses it with several hypothetical scenes are played out to get a resolution. All in all a highly successful film adaptation of a novel with fine actors pacing and dialogue.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a student who writes about his classmate's mother in his essays. As the teacher encourages him to delve deeper into details the unexpected unfolds.I am blown away by In the House. The plot sounds simple but it keeps me engrossed throughout. The young guy Claude looks so innocent and angelic but he is surely up to no good. He is so manipulative and destructive.

The ending of In the House is exactly like that. Just when I thought the film was about to end there is this other scene on a park bench that twists to the real ending. This ending is even more spine chilling than the one I thought was the ending.In the House is an excellent thriller. It is easy to follow but is entrancing and engrossing.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review In The House";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe it's just me but there's something sexy with stories about writers and their writings making it onto film with recent releases such as Ruby Sparks powering its way into my top film of last year. In The House looks set to do the same too directed by Francois Ozon well known for his feature film Swimming Pool which was also centered around a writer played by Charlotte Rampling and based on a play written by Juan Mayorga called The Boy in the Last Row. Words cannot deny the genius of both the screenplay and the film's direction in crafting a piece that draws and sucks you into its narrative becoming what's akin to a page turner that captivates all the way to the finale.Fabrice Luchini plays Mr Germain a literature teacher in a school whose lofty ambitions of imparting his vast knowledge go up in smoke with the most uninspired students until he latches upon the raw talent of Claude Garcia Ernst Umhauer which isn't hard since his homework submission on what happened over the weekend was two pages compared to his peers' two liners and contained all ingredients necessary that would have caught any reader's attention with its yet to be verified autobiographical nature a hook and a cliffhanger. Soon Germain slowly discovers that he wanted more and takes it upon himself to bring Claude under his personal tutelage so that Claude's creative output and juices can get to be nurtured by him.Kristin Scott Thomas plays Germain's wife Jeanne who partakes in the same reading Claude's submissions as she struggles to get her professional art gallery in order lest it be shut down for the lack of a good exhibition. And the interplay between husband and wife over Clude is something the film excelled in presenting two sides to an argument whether Claude is imagining it or telling it as it is experienced about his near obsession with wanting and eventually getting into the house of his friend Rapha Artole Bastien Ughetto which soon evolves into becoming an integral part of the household with his presence on the pretext of tutoring his friend but essentially being an outlet to get close to Rapha's mom Esther Emmanuelle Seigner an infatuation that will take on epic proportions.Interesting enough this film works if you'd participate in it just as how both Germain and Jeanne allowed their morbid curiosity to get the better of them. We become those characters personified and one can imagine just how powerful this is in a staged production. But its effect and impact are not diminished on film as you'll find yourself demanding more with Ozon often pulling the plug leaving you wanting more and lapping everything up with Claude submitting another chapter of sorts being played out on screen. We connect the dots and partake in the lives of the Artole family learning about their hopes dreams secrets celebrate in their success and sympathize when they hit a brick wall. And there are many relationship types in the film from that of lustful ones to fatherson relations mentormentee best of friends and even the recurring GLBT ones that Ozon's films tend to feature.In truth watching this film becomes that guilty pleasure that is voyeur central filled with comedy drama and wonderful acting that bring the characters to life yet having the narrative mileage to pique and sustain one's interest from beginning to end by appealing to our primal curious nature and really milking and manipulating it with us allowing it to and growing increasingly effective as we clamour for Claude to seek out even more intimate moments. It's a scary reflection of ourselves yet an engagement by a film par none. A definite recommend!".

A young writer creates a reality in his essays that is shown as if real on screen. The characters around the writer and within the fictional story get intertwined because they are all the same. This game of deception is coy but also witty and warm and it's a fun genuine movie.I'm not sure how much logic you should try to apply to things here. I assume they have it worked out perfectly but watching it lightly the layers of reality get necessarily confusing. In a way this doesn't matter because you get the general drift. Which is this a literature teacher in high school has a talented student Claude who writes fictional essays about real people. One is another student Rapha and we see events in this other student's house because of the writing and have to guess whether or not those events are fact or fiction. The teacher talks to Claude about the content wondering if it's fair to lay open Rapha's life and the student smartly says that it was written for the teacher alone. This brings the teacher into the story in ways he doesn't suspect. It also shows the audience that Claude is outfoxing his teacher and we are going to see a game played as Claude's writings raise reactions in the teacher that affect the fictional plot. Or is it the actual plot? Or both?Exactly.The director Francois Ozon is no stranger to this type of game playing. The famous earlier film of his in the U.S. is Swimming Pool a remake of an earlier film that has the same tricks played on the audience. It's never quite enough to have this slippery reality be the basis of a movie and in Swimming Pool the events became quite dramatic and psychologically interesting. The ambitions for In the House are smaller and less chilling and in a way less effective but also less sensationalist and more believable. We have here more of an ensemble piece a charmer a play brought to the screen.And it does rise above mere literary cleverness because of the leading man the teacher played by Fabrice Luchini who will be familiar even to American audiences. His wife is the dependable Kristin Scott Thomas speaking in French. The two of them make a likable intellectual couple and her own role as an contemporary art dealer plays a small part in the plot. The way they talk about Claude's regular installments is how we get to think about the interweaving of realities. And does it ever get interwoven. Keep track of it is you can.

	schema:reviewBody "'Dans la maison' 'In the House' directed by Francois Ozon is one of the the most surprising films I have seen lately. Adaptation of a play the screen is so smart that my major question is how is it that Woody Allen did not write it first? or maybe he wrote it under disguise? It is really such an Allenesque story which mingles real life and imagination the writer as a creator of life and life as a creator of literature. It even has a thread about relations of adults and underage and even if it loses a little bit of steam by the end talking so much about a good ending for the story that it forgets to create a real good and nonconventional one it is still one of the smartest and most original scripts I have watched lately brought in screen. The hero is a professor of literature Germain Fabrice Luchini smart enough to abhor the reintroduction of uniforms in high school whose literary ambitions were not fulfilled and who finds a goal and a change in the routine in pygmalionizing one of his pupils Claude Ernst Umhauer in the ways of literature. As it happens Clude's subjects are his friend and colleague Rapha Bastien Ughetto his house which is the middle class dream for a poor kid from the peripheries and his family or especially his mother Emmanuelle Seigner who becomes the object of his teenage dreams and guilty desires. As the story develops the house becomes the stage of the action reality inspires fiction at first just to make room for literary fiction becoming reality the intervention of the teacher becomes much more than correction of grammar or style it starts to be correction of destinies. All in a fluent and well paced style for most of the time.I liked the acting of Fabrice Luchini well supported by other fine actors as the two charming Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife coreader of Rapha's essays and supporting character playing eventually a surprising role in the story and Emmanuelle Seigner. All of them act solidly their problems are credible and we can feel the atmosphere and the torments of the middle class in the French province. The two teenager roles are played with the natural touch and expected freshness by Ernst Umhauer and Bastien Ughetto the latest is very promising may he have luck in getting distributed in roles that fit his talent and his face!. Overall it's a smart and funny movie worth seeing for many reasons.".

	schema:headline " In The House  Ozon is back on track!";
	schema:reviewBody "Haven't been tracking Ozon's output for awhile his previous entry for me is TIME TO LEAVE 2005 710 IN THE HOUSE apparently heralds a pleasing return with his most confident pace and killing panache delineates a spellbinding yarn withholds which part is really happening and which part is our young writer's fancy imagination. Slickly shot the opening upbeat instrumental tune brings viewers instantly to the scenario of a joint action between a high school teacher Luchini a hasbeen belowbar writer and his finest pupil Umhauer. With mutual assent Umhauer comes from a broken family and has to tend his maimed father all by himself is encroaching one of his classmates' Ughetto domestic domain using the practical stalking horse  remedial lessons after school for the latter whose perfect bourgeois life represents everything he is craving for mostly a sensual middleaged mother Seigner. So he is writing down everything as a serial detailing fictional or not what is happening inside the model family and the teacher promises to read it correct it advice him how to become a real writer.Obviously from the very first chapter Luchini has been intoxicated by the story after a serial of disasters from the retrograded youth Umhauer's writing could never be more fetching so is his wife Thomas a middleclass gallery owner who is in a dire situation and might lose the gallery if her new collection fail to please her new boss twin sisters played by an unrecognizable Moreau.

Slickly shot the opening upbeat instrumental tune brings viewers instantly to the scenario of a joint action between a high school teacher Luchini a hasbeen belowbar writer and his finest pupil Umhauer. With mutual assent Umhauer comes from a broken family and has to tend his maimed father all by himself is encroaching one of his classmates' Ughetto domestic domain using the practical stalking horse  remedial lessons after school for the latter whose perfect bourgeois life represents everything he is craving for mostly a sensual middleaged mother Seigner. So he is writing down everything as a serial detailing fictional or not what is happening inside the model family and the teacher promises to read it correct it advice him how to become a real writer.Obviously from the very first chapter Luchini has been intoxicated by the story after a serial of disasters from the retrograded youth Umhauer's writing could never be more fetching so is his wife Thomas a middleclass gallery owner who is in a dire situation and might lose the gallery if her new collection fail to please her new boss twin sisters played by an unrecognizable Moreau. As we all fully aware things will go haywire and the reverberations will boomerang on someone and in this case it is Luchini himself his life will disintegrate eventually.Borrowing Umhauer's confession of using the present tense in his works the film per se contains a certain present vibrancy which is extremely audiencefriendly engaging with a hefty gush of dialogs among its main characters Luchini with Umhauer Luchini with Thomas and Umhauer's self narrative whether it is florid edification or common conversations all fittingly satirise the banality and futility of the status quo one is facing or trapped like it is said in the film literature and art cannot teach a person anything we learn by simply living our lives.

	schema:reviewBody "I was intrigued entranced and beguiled by this movie from the start but 45 minutes in it pretty much gives up. Claude is a teenage student who excels in maths because of this he manages to inveigle himself into the home of Rapha a fellow student who is struggling with the subject. On the pretence of assisting with his homework he gets 'In the house' which he has been watching from a nearby park for a while. Claude's story of his time with Rapha and his parents is told to us via the essays he writes for his language teacher Germain. Germain laps up these tales and shares them clandestinely with his wife Jeanne Kristin Scott Thomas adding to her list of French movie roles. So much so he actively encourages the boy to carry on the deceit. The story from in the house involves possible infidelity male bonding voyeurism the vilification of the middle classes ill health rejection and acceptance. And yet with all this going on I felt we were not being taken on a cinematic journey it was more akin to slowly walking on a filmic hamster wheel. After the great set up where the characters are skilfully introduced the performances are solid as is the direction and dialogue. But the writer and director don't know what to do after the set up and the film meanders somewhat tediously to a clumsy and over long conclusion. A shame really. I'm not sure The Buscatcher can recommend a journey to the flicks for this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the house is a movie like a lot of Ozon's work that unveils secret and repressed desires. Frustrations are also a key element to the movie and the plot is based on a need coming from every character that makes the story go forward at almost any price.This story is narrated through the lens of Claude a student whose french teacher sees an incredibly huge potential as a writer in him. But what's the most interesting in this story is how through his essays Claude manipulates his teacher and manipulates the reality of the story. This movie has a complex narrative that is happening in different places but that are all connected through a simple sheet of paper showing the power of words. But what's the most interesting and disturbing at times is Claude's interpretation of what is Realism for him. It is not a coincidence if the major literary figure in this movie is Gustave Flaubert one of the greatest representatives of 19th century realism. Because Claude says it he only writes what he sees and what happens around him. And we clearly see that when he starts imagining what he is writing it doesn't work. That obsessive need is what makes Claude all along the movie becoming what could name a manipulative sociopath and his teacher a complice of his acts because he only sees himself in his student and doesn't want him to reproduce the same mistakes that he already made. This is a great stimulating movie where at the beginning especially Kristin Scott Thomas and Fabrice Luchini are kind of off but then the intrigue catches you and I challenge anyone who watches this movie not to be caught by this wonderfully unsettling and thrilling movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a Chinese box. Reality inside fiction. Fiction inside fantasy. Fantasy inside wish. A story nested inside many others all In the House. A boy writes for his frustrated teacher about his real life supposedly. The teacher makes the boy a protg but critiques his story which is the boy's real life maybe. Soon the teacher his wife and the audience are caught up. Are we voyeurs to the boys real life stalking real people or just watching fictionalized people in a story? What happens when the watchers become characters in the story? When we see a scene with the boy's real father is it true? Or just a form of escape? What I love is that I don't believe the boy is a real stalker or voyeur not really. He's a Houdini escape artist using art and the mind to escape his real world and create another. Its just it may be very dangerous how he's doing it because he's using his fantasy and the fantasies of others to escape his own reality and using real lives to do so sort of. So he's dangerous but in your heart can you forgive him? Or are you being duped? He's a very clever kid. In a way he makes the lives of others more real to themselves for which there are consequences. A middle class mother Esther who the boy inappropriately woos falls right back in using a child to escape her boring life. The teacher's wife Jeanne escapes her unreal life when the boy tells her a secret maybe. The people in real lives that his fiction illuminates are changed forever. What I really respect about this film is that the boy sees the people in the lives he wants more clearly than they see themselves. They feel his clarity as an invasion or criticism. But really it is a begrudging acceptance that no matter how stupid or vacuous their concerns their lives hold the key to his escape. As an artist he needs to be able to describe his own real life. But he's too young for that he needs his imagination to escape first. Then later he can return to somewhere a home 'inside the house' where he is respected cared for wanted. First you have to imagine it possible. Reality is a burden if you can't escape it.".

	schema:headline " Normal life can be the most fascinating drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes we go to far into a fantasy that we both imagine and create images in storytelling for ourselves. In the House is this all in one showing the audience the mind of a teenager who is really his teacher but younger Usually when I see films no matter what language they are in about the intellectual mind of youth I become uninterested quickly having to hear these young people talk about what they believe to be right but with this film I was never ever to take my attention firstly from the dialogue that was being spoken on screen as well as being told in such a way that up until near the end I was unaware if what I was being shown was a story created by the young Claude Garcia Ernst Umhauer or if it really was a real look into this normal seeming family that turned out to have so many twists and turns to the Artole family. Germain Fabrice Luchini is a french teacher who along with his wife Jeanne Kristin Scott Thomas seem to take pleasure in stories being told by the young Claude about his love for Esther Emmanuelle Seigner and his exploration into the Artole family.I was mesmerized by the story of the film having it mostly take place in a house where some of the quiet moments where the most stunning and effective moments of the film such as the image of a committed suicide which turned out to be false which really changed my idea of the story being told by this young boy. With the Artole family looking normal to outsiders then to have such inner family drama was a great advantage to the family with the idealisation of Esther being both beautiful and being the emotional part of the film since this young confused boy seemed to be pushed into the house by his teacher who could not but correct this young boy. The reactions from Germain and his wife Jeanne were also great as they started to question whether these stories were true or if they were figments of this boys imagination.Fabrice Luchini played Germain and his performance called for him to both be reactive and forward in his actions how he inspired the young Claude. He was the standout of the film for me and I was very impressed by his performance in scenes such as his fight with his wife when he read the final part of the Artole story and finding out his wife's truth almost badly hurting her was very intensely played by Luchini. Ernst Umhauer played the young Claude and this could be considered a breakout for him as he both radiated on the screen as well as having such a natural presence as the character. He was given a lot of simple scenes to played and his performance was really strong and never became clich in any way. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Jeanne and she is probably one of the best working actresses and this is another example of her talent in her own language. She may have not have had the most challenging role but she was perfect in everything. The only other actor to mention is Emmanuelle Seigner as Esther and she had the most subtle role as she was idealized through the writing and she was both beautiful and heartbreaking by the end of the movie.A strong movie by Franois Ozon obviously based on a play but still having a cinematic feel with strong visuals and a great and fascinating look into a middle class family through the head of a creative young boy.MOVIE GRADE B MVP Fabrice Luchini".

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes we go to far into a fantasy that we both imagine and create images in storytelling for ourselves. In the House is this all in one showing the audience the mind of a teenager who is really his teacher but younger Usually when I see films no matter what language they are in about the intellectual mind of youth I become uninterested quickly having to hear these young people talk about what they believe to be right but with this film I was never ever to take my attention firstly from the dialogue that was being spoken on screen as well as being told in such a way that up until near the end I was unaware if what I was being shown was a story created by the young Claude Garcia Ernst Umhauer or if it really was a real look into this normal seeming family that turned out to have so many twists and turns to the Artole family. Germain Fabrice Luchini is a french teacher who along with his wife Jeanne Kristin Scott Thomas seem to take pleasure in stories being told by the young Claude about his love for Esther Emmanuelle Seigner and his exploration into the Artole family.I was mesmerized by the story of the film having it mostly take place in a house where some of the quiet moments where the most stunning and effective moments of the film such as the image of a committed suicide which turned out to be false which really changed my idea of the story being told by this young boy.

	schema:reviewBody "In The House Francois Ozon 2012 45 'Home is where the heart is' 'There's no place like home' these and countless other sayings have reverberated throughout cinema's history. Let's face it there is no film that doesn't feature in one form or another a domestic space where all of our characters reside. Francois Ozon's new feature looks to uncover what happens when we peep through the windows of the 'perfect' family unit and deconstruct its very construction. In many ways Ozon is merely continuing his signature style of blending a familial setting with a criminal or dramatic undertone. Films that echo this sentiment include Swimming Pool 2003 Ricky 2009 The Refuge 2009 and Potiche 2010.The narrative follows a sixteen year old boy Claude Garcia Ernst Umhauer who ingratiates himself into the Artole family by befriending and tutoring the only son Rapha Denis Mnochet. He begins to write stories about their activities and gives these to his teacher Germaine Fabrice Luchini who along with his wife Jeanne Kristin Scott Thomas becomes embroiled in a game of fiction and the very nature of storytelling. The film begins with a very naturalistic style with the focus on mise en scene and performance however without quite knowing it it slowly develops into a selfreflexive take on contemporary families and suburbia. As such Ozon carefully weaves a story that takes off the veneer of clinical domesticity.You might say 'hang on a minute this has been done to death right?' Well you'd be right although I can assure you this isn't an episode of Desperate Housewives that spirals into soapy drama. In fact it verges on both the hysterical claustrophobia of Douglas Sirk and the keen voyeurism of Alfred Hitchcock. Indeed what we get is a very knowing film that understands what has come before it but at the same time is trying to create something new and intriguing. The way it does this is that most of the film is constructed around written assignments where Claude communicates his findings of living with the Artole's for a year. However as he tries to break the classical convention of the family which includes a brief fling with troubled mother Esther his actions have far greater consequences for Germaine.The whole style of the film is fresh as Jrme Almras's cinematography and Pascaline Chavanne's art direction effortlessly guides us through the trials and tribulations of the characters. Note the fast forward shots at the beginning and the colourful imagery of the finale and you will see that the film becomes bookended. Much like the books that Germaine wants his students to read for assignments In The House not only tries to uncover the secrets of the family but also becomes a selfreflexive take on the novel. Indeed all of the twists and turns of a paperback is conveyed visually through Ozon's willingness to dive straight into the comical sensual and uneasy character relationships.The performances from the entire cast are great with particular standouts being Luchini Scott Thomas and Umhauer. However it is Emmanuelle Seigner who gives the best impression of a contemporary Betty Draper which steals the show! In fact in many ways she embodies the very strict nature of the familial unit and its unwillingness to change. Her character is quietly unravelling however with the stabling force of another pregnancy she finds her place yet again as the stereotypical matriarch. As such in the end although prodded and poked the perfect household remains intact however as Claude prepares another suburban adventure there is a sense of the unknown of what he might find out underneath the bricks and mortar of what makes a house a home.".

He is proud of being at such a young age the person bringing the bread to his poor family. But things change when his widowed mother marries a police officer. He regards this as a double betrayal and he tries to make life for his family impossible. After putting his two young sisters in jeopardy in a domestic oven in one of the film's best scenes he flees to a port city. The policeman follows him and in the road back they found themselves in the desert in a final chase scene that is among the best thing I ever saw. Eventually and in extremis adoptive father and son reconciles. Perhaps the best thing of the movie is the portrayal of the policeman. His manners are a bit rough and unpolished but in his heart he is a good man it would have been much easier for the film to portray him as a monster but happily this was avoided. Another triumph for the humanistic Iranian cinema that surprised the moviewatching world in the 1990s and which sadly right now seems to be going through a bad time hurt by renewed censorship in the Islamic republic.".

The adolescent son working for his family comes back and finds that his widowed mother remarried a policeman. She explains that she had to marry again for social security. But the boy who loved his father before the accident could not stomach a step father. With all Hamletian fury he hates his step father without finding out what sort of a person the step father is. He runs away and the stepfather searches for him and finds him. On their return journey they have to undergo hardships while traversing the desert and empathy builds up between them. Majidhi's touches are there in many scenes. The accident which killed the boys father was just shown with the scene of the accident. He also knows when to stop the narrative. The boy and the stepfather lie dehydrated over a stream. The photograph of the stepfather with his mother and sisters drifts from the pocket of the stepfather and stops at the nose of the boy indicating reconciliation and the boy's discovery of a new father. And then the film ends. The best acting is by the mother  the anguish and suffering of a poor woman whatever the culture they live in who is torn between the love to the son and love to the man who kindly gave security to her in a traditional society and jas neem a good father to her children. Of course I think Majidhi's other film the children of heaven is much better film  the story of how a bother and sister of a poor family share a pair of shoes between themselves.".

I bought it based on his name so it is only reluctantly that I post these comments.The idea of the conflict between the son and his stepfather is great and certainly a wellknown story. This one carries with it the tarnished dignity and lessened honor felt by Mehrollah.But in order to set up the moral conflict Mehrollah faces at the end the story takes some directions that are painfully implausible and ultimately destroy the ending.MAJOR SPOILER HERE The idea that a police officer would take a motorcycle so far away to get his wayward stepson is implausible. The idea that it might break down and he would just abandon it is ridiculous. The notion that he would start walking into the desert is just preposterous any cagey guy like that would know to stay on the main road. So the setup that has him die is impossible. If Majidi wanted Mehrollah to confront a moral dilemma having the two of them ambushed by bandits would do the job as well. I also longed to hear the stepfather show respect for Mehrollah's love for his mother and sister. That did not come.".

It is quiet movie the silence broken by outbursts..Its a movie of contrasts  of love and hate..but going back to love ultimately.

But over all Aliens in the Attic is far from the worst kids movie you have ever seen. Obvious yes but enjoyable for the little ones. I'll say this I took these same grandkids to see Daddy Day Camp when it was out and I was completely disgusted and disappointed by that turkey. Aliens in the Attic is a couple of notches above that one. At least there are no exploding outhouses or questionable values modeled by adult characters.No doubt taking little kids to the zoo or going for a walk in the woods would be better for little kids but if you get stuck for something to do this summer you should not feel hesitant to take them to this film.".

But if you think you might then I'd recommend giving it a try because I was a little unsure but I thoroughly enjoyed it.The plot is pretty simple while vacationing in a large rental house over the Fourth of July holiday the Pearson family is forced to stop an advance team of four aliens from bringing eternal enslavement andor instantaneous death to the human race. The alien technology allows them to control the adults leading to a lot of slapstick comedy some of which will be funny to adults but all of which the kids will enjoy so it's up to our hero Tom 17 years old or thereabouts his siblings and his cousins to stop them.I thought the acting was quite decent. Carter Jenkins brings a lot of good energy to Tom who is very likable and sympathetic. All of the kids do a great job and the voice talents behind the aliens bring a lot of personality to those characters in only a few scenes. Thomas Haden Church as Tazer really stood out to me and J.K. Simmons is always fantastic.The messages I came out of it with were 1 family is cool 2 fishing can be just as fun as video games and 3 being different is OK and being smart is OK. Ashley Tisdale's Bethany doesn't start out as a particularly sympathetic character especially when taken with her sleazy boyfriend but she soon shows herself to be a good role model demanding that her boyfriend respect her and her family.I laughed plenty  even the jokes which were easy or cheap didn't make me groan or roll my eyes.I would definitely let my kids watch this movie. Not only do I approve of the general morals espoused by the film but they'll almost certainly enjoy it. And except for believing Grandma had gotten into the Pinot Grigio Miss Tisdale bouncing around in a skimpy bikini and a scene of Bethany and her boyfriend putting lotion on each other including a reference to second base the film is totally clean. And even those things are hardly worth mentioning.It's not supposed to be smart it's supposed to be fun. And it's targeted towards kids. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone I know but I know a couple of people who would definitely enjoy it so don't discount it so quickly based on other reviews if you think it might be your kind of movie.".

I definitely put it up with all the good old 80's classics like goonies back to the future etc as a no brains good old adventure... can also recommend spiderwick chronicles as a similar fantasy adventure film!".

We thought certain scenes were very cute and funny there was no foul language and my children enjoyed this film. It is sad that so many other movies get attention when this one is entertaining and clean. I would recommend it and think it is better than a lot of other summer films we have seen.

I thought it was so cute in the film how that little girl bonded with one of the aliens. It was sad when they said goodbye a real tearjerker. I also enjoyed the slapstick in the film especially with the arrogant jock it was nice seeing him humbled like that. Kevin Nealon who used to be on Saturday Night Live has a good part in this as a well meaning but dorky father. I also wanted to mention the noted character actress Doris Roberts who plays the grandmother she was on my parent's favorite show Everybody Loves Raymond. There is a scene in this film where the aliens possess her and she turns into a superhero and kicks butt. It is the single funniest scene I have witnessed in a film this entire year. I thought I would fall out of my seat! I'll bet Ms. Roberts had a ball making this film. I'm glad I went to see this film and highly recommend it. It wont win any Golden Globes or Oscars and the American Film Institute will never consider it a classic but it will make you laugh and feel good after the credits roll isn't that why we go to the movies?".

	schema:reviewBody "The original title for Aliens in the Attic was They Came From Upstairs  a much better title you must agree. Still I can understand the change. Everything else about the movie is generic bland and unmemorable. The title was the last part of the movie to have any ounce of inspiration sucked from it.What we have here is a children's movie that should have been fun and mischievous but is instead overly safe and tedious. It doesn't even bother to give us any real characters. The kids who act as the heroes are dull the adult actors may as well not even be there and exist mainly to pop up every now and then to say What are those kids up to now? and the aliens are even more boring than the adults. Shame about the aliens. They kind of look like Yoda's angrier and shorter halfcousins but they hold absolutely no personality. I remember they had names but darned if I can remember what they were. The aliens themselves are a ragtag group that are pretty much interchangeable. There's a girl one voice by Kari Wahlgren one who turns out to be nice and helps out the kids Josh Peck and two whom the movie didn't even bother to give personalities or real dialogue to so naturally they are played by the best actors in the cast Thomas HaydenChurch and J.K. Simmons.Why are the aliens here on Earth? From what little the movie tells us it has something to do with an invasion campaign. The little creatures arrive at the vacation home of the Pearson family who are having a sort of family reunion for the weekend. There's apparently a device the aliens want hidden under the basement of the house. The Pearson kids learn about their presence soon enough but the adults remain completely oblivious throughout. The six kids who act as the heroes basically act as one giant unit and have very little individual personalities. The leader of the kids Carter Jenkins is flunking school much to the shame of his clueless parents Kevin Nealon and Gillian Vigman and his sister Ashley Tisdale is dating an older guy who's a jerk Robert Hoffman. Speaking of the jerk boyfriend he becomes the victim of the alien's mind control gun which turns him into a zombie that can be controlled with a device. Fortunately said device looks and works like a video game controller so when the kids get their hands on it they can control him easily enough. The kids' grandmother Doris Roberts also falls under alien control leading to a scene where the boyfriend and the grandma have an elaborate kungfu fight with the kids controlling granny and the aliens controlling the jerk. This scene should be fun but it's really very boring.So is the rest of the movie. Aliens in the Attic is cinematic junk food for kids that doesn't even have the decency to go down easy enough for accompanying adults. No one seems to be that involved not even the kids themselves. They're going through the motions as much as the adult actors are almost as if they're already planning to wipe this movie from their screen credits before they hit 17. It's bad enough seeing people like Andy Richter and Tim Meadows cashing paychecks in the worthless adult roles this movie gives them. I found myself wondering what was going through the minds of the filmmakers. Did director John Schultz think kids wouldn't care as long as there were cute CG aliens added in later? Speaking of the CG not even that impresses. Not only have they been given no personality by the credited writers but they're boring to look at. They don't even get any real oneliners. I have to question if anyone even cared about this movie.The premise for this movie calls out for a director like Joe Dante Gremlins someone who knows how to mix fun with creature terror. Instead we've been given a toothless commercial product that will probably fade from theaters long before August ends and sit forgotten in the back corners of video store shelves the world over. Kids deserve more and better.".

	onyx:emotionText "The original title for Aliens in the Attic was They Came From Upstairs  a much better title you must agree. Still I can understand the change. Everything else about the movie is generic bland and unmemorable. The title was the last part of the movie to have any ounce of inspiration sucked from it.What we have here is a children's movie that should have been fun and mischievous but is instead overly safe and tedious. It doesn't even bother to give us any real characters. The kids who act as the heroes are dull the adult actors may as well not even be there and exist mainly to pop up every now and then to say What are those kids up to now? and the aliens are even more boring than the adults. Shame about the aliens. They kind of look like Yoda's angrier and shorter halfcousins but they hold absolutely no personality. I remember they had names but darned if I can remember what they were. The aliens themselves are a ragtag group that are pretty much interchangeable. There's a girl one voice by Kari Wahlgren one who turns out to be nice and helps out the kids Josh Peck and two whom the movie didn't even bother to give personalities or real dialogue to so naturally they are played by the best actors in the cast Thomas HaydenChurch and J.K. Simmons.Why are the aliens here on Earth? From what little the movie tells us it has something to do with an invasion campaign. The little creatures arrive at the vacation home of the Pearson family who are having a sort of family reunion for the weekend. There's apparently a device the aliens want hidden under the basement of the house. The Pearson kids learn about their presence soon enough but the adults remain completely oblivious throughout. The six kids who act as the heroes basically act as one giant unit and have very little individual personalities. The leader of the kids Carter Jenkins is flunking school much to the shame of his clueless parents Kevin Nealon and Gillian Vigman and his sister Ashley Tisdale is dating an older guy who's a jerk Robert Hoffman. Speaking of the jerk boyfriend he becomes the victim of the alien's mind control gun which turns him into a zombie that can be controlled with a device. Fortunately said device looks and works like a video game controller so when the kids get their hands on it they can control him easily enough. The kids' grandmother Doris Roberts also falls under alien control leading to a scene where the boyfriend and the grandma have an elaborate kungfu fight with the kids controlling granny and the aliens controlling the jerk. This scene should be fun but it's really very boring.So is the rest of the movie. Aliens in the Attic is cinematic junk food for kids that doesn't even have the decency to go down easy enough for accompanying adults. No one seems to be that involved not even the kids themselves. They're going through the motions as much as the adult actors are almost as if they're already planning to wipe this movie from their screen credits before they hit 17. It's bad enough seeing people like Andy Richter and Tim Meadows cashing paychecks in the worthless adult roles this movie gives them.

This may be my 3rd favorite movie of 2009 behind Friday the 13th and Land of the Lost! I've seen a lot of negative reviews toward this movie but some people take things a little too seriously. This movie is for the kid in all of us. While on summer vacation the Pearson family go to threestory holiday house in the middle of nowhere. The kids Hannah Tom and Bethany don't wanna go but they are forced to. They meet more family members like Jake Art and Lee. When Bethany's boyfriend forces Tom to the roof they see the aliens who want to take over the world. Throughout the day the kids try to stop them without their parents finding out. One alien Sparks is not a threat to the humans and decides to become friends with Hannah. Sparks is a cute little alien unlike Skip Tazer and Razor. Will the Pearson children stop the evil aliens from taking over the world? I highly recommend ALIENS IN THE ATTIC!!!".

Kevin Nealon who plays Stuart Pearson confronts Tom and tells him everyone has to go its tradition. After just getting to the cabin with the whole Pearson family Bethany Pearson Ashley Tisdale boyfriend Ricky Dillman Robert Hoffman rolls into the driveway to see Bethany. The cable goes out and Tom and Ricky are told to go fix it what they didn't expect is to find the satellite blown up and four aliens pop out from nowhere. The aliens get control of Ricky with their dart guns and try to stop Tom and Jake Pearson as Austin Butler from getting back inside. After being let back in by the two twins Art Pearson  Henri Young and Lee Pearson Regan Young they try and fend off the aliens from getting inside the house. Recently seeing Tisdale in High School Musical 3 she is taking on some different roles now. Playing the older sister in this movie which she does really good at. Also a girlfriend to Robert Hoffman's character Ricky who recently i saw in Step Up 2. Im curious to see how Tisdales career pans out too and maybe she will do something more with music in future movies that she does. This movie is fun to watch and has Doris Roberts playing the grandma which was funny. All in all this is a good family movie and one that would not hurt to check out.

The aliens can control the mind of adult people but not of teenagers and children so it is the children of the family to protect their house their family and the whole world. The story is very predictable from the very beginning you can tell what is going to happen. The cast is good the performances not that much. I love the role of Doris Roberts as the Grandma she is very funny Kevin Nealon is also very food as the dad. I think that it is already time for Ashley Tisdale to leave behind the roles of the spoiled high school teenager and the kids were good enough specially the little girl Ashley Boettcher. In conclusion Aliens in the Attic is an entertaining and enjoyable movie specially for kids then if you don't have kids or you're not one avoid it or wait for it until its on DVD.".

It is directed more towards the younger crowd. In the film they talked about modern day technology a lot like the Wii BlueTooth and such. But I think adults with open minds will find the movie to be clean fun. The only questionable moment that I can recall is that Tom says Get off my planet you nasty name but he is cut off before he can finish. Younger kids probably wouldn't catch it because it is in the heat of a climactic scene. Other then that it was a clean fun movie. Also the no gravity parts and the part where Sparks makes the girl's hair stand up were pretty interesting to watch.Overall Aliens in the Attic was a clean tween film. It was definitely not a summer blockbuster but it was very enjoyable for a day out.".

Aliens In The Attic is a fun family affair that kids and adults alike can enjoy.Performances. Carter Jenkins is a likable lead. He's nerdy but he has the charisma and remarkable presence for his age to pull it all off. Austin Robert Butler is likeably goofy. He made a great duo with Carter. Ashley Tisdale is pretty cute and despite the fact that her character got on my nerves at times she came out of this looking solid. Ashley Boettcher is shockingly a very likable kid actress. She's full of life and funny how bout that?. Doris Roberts is hilarious in her limited screen time as the Nana. Seeing her do karate was a hoot. Robert Hoffman is the brunt of many jokes. Seeing him bounce all over the place usually had me giggling like a little school girl. Tim Meadows is amusing as the Sheriff.Bottom line. Aliens in the Attic is a perfect distraction if you're having a bad day. It's not a great movie or anything but it will give you quite amount of entertainment in the process. Worth the look.610".

The Aliens are a bit useless to be honest hence plenty of slapstick type humour.I didn't think the effects were to bad personally but I was not expecting to see an Oscar winning movie. Aliens in the Attic is never going to win any awards for technical brilliance or olivieresque acting but my kids were after popcornlaughs and a little bit of action and thats what we got.810";

	schema:reviewBody "The last film that unsettled me much like The Woodsman did was Todd Solondz's superb and exceedingly black comedy Happiness 1998 which dealt with similar themes. But unlike Solondz who never seems to like any of his characters screenwriters Nicole Kassell and Steven Fechter appear to genuinely care about the people they create.Their story's really very simple Walter Kevin Bacon gets out of prison after serving a dozen years for molesting young girls. He takes a job at a Philadelphiaarea lumber mill and tries to get his life back together again while dealing with his inner demons.What's likely to disturb many about The Woodsman is that Kassell and Fechter raise the intriguing question of whether someone who's done something despicable is not only capable of putting his life back together again after serving his time but also whether society ought to allow him to do so. And to make our job even tougher Kassell and Fechter don't turn Walter into a monster.The Woodsman is aided immensely by a strong compelling performance by Bacon. It's easily his best work a role that requires him to underplay his character. Director Kassell isn't shy about letting the camera linger on Bacon's face and Bacon credibly brings to life Walter's suffering. It's a sensationally good performance. Bacon gives him depth and feeling and we suddenly find ourselves caring about this reprehensible man.There are some superb supporting performances including Mos Def as a cop David Alan Grier as Walter's boss and Benjamin Bratt proving he really can act if he's given a good role. The most interesting supporting character is Vickie a coworker willing to give Walter a second chance at life. Kyra Sedgwick a gifted yet underrated actress is utterly convincing as Vickie a woman almost as damaged as Walter is. The WalterVickie relationship works because there's terrific chemistry between Bacon and Sedgwick. True they're husband and wife but reallife couples can fail miserably on screen. Kidman and Cruise in Far and Away 1992 anyone?Bacon and Sedgwick's scenes are tender passionate and real. Though there's one intimate moment between Walter and Vickie that's clearly inspired by the famous Donald SutherlandJulie Christie love scene in Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now 1973.What makes The Woodsman such gripping viewing is that the film doesn't shy away from letting us into Walter's struggle. There's a particularly uncomfortable scene on a park bench as Walter comes to terms with his true nature.The Woodsman is a film that deserves to be seen. It's a pity that lessthanmediocre movies such as Connie and Carla and Twisted get widely released while a gem like The Woodsman gets to very few theaters. Seek out this film. It's not an easy film to watch but the performances are all good the story's riveting and it's definitely one of the best most thoughtprovoking films of the year.".

The difficult subject matter may spell boxoffice suicide for this film particularly at Christmas time. However if Newmarket Films is smart they will market this the same way Monster was promoted for Charlize Theron's performance. Bacon employs a minimalist acting style and submerges himself into this complex character on the strength of his physicality alone. Thin and gaunt hair darkened eyes dead and jaw severely set Bacon doesn't waste a facial muscle or telegraph anything more than necessary. He allows us to get into the character's head piece by piece and it's not always a pleasant place to be. Bacon is uncompromising in his refusal to make anything about the character trivial and sentimental and that is the key to his success in making Walter such a vivid believable man. The screenplay seems to almost be stripped bare with little actually revealed through dialogue. However monologues are used to great effect. Bacon's mesmerizing performance is enhanced by astute direction from firsttimer Nicole Kassell who also adapted the screenplay with the original playwright Steven Fechter. The cast is superbBenjamin Bratt Kyra Sedgwick David Alan Grier the beautiful Eve and best of all Mos Def who steals virtually every scene he is in against Bacon no small task. for those celebritywatchers Madonna's baby's daddy Carlos Leon father of Lourdes is in a few scenes.This is a mustsee for Bacon's work and for the tasteful intelligent way the subject matter is handled.

Kassell's film manages to steer clear of didacticism and lays the misunderstandings and prejudices about and ignorance of paedophilia open for the audience to interpret in their own way. The protagonist is neither a sympathetic hero or a villain but during the course of the film he wavers between the two leaving the audience both supportive and sickened. This amalgam of conflicting emotions makes 'The Woodsman' essential viewing for a rational adult audience.

Kevin's performance is so good that at one time I found myself pulled out of the experience in awe while continuing to believe the truth of the character I was at the same time floored by Kevin's ability to deliver such depth. Sure the subject matter allows actors to express strong feeling. Anger is an easy route as is selfloathing.

Sympathy For The Devil Bacon's best performance to dateKevin Bacon has always been one of my favorite actors and constantly proves to be such a truly exceptional one at that. In his latest as a recently paroled convicted pedophile he gives the performance of his career that should entitle him to his first Academy Award nomination long overdue.Walter Bacon is an excon attempting to begin a normal life after being incarcerated for molesting several young girls. What seems to be a large task at hand only proves to be increasingly difficult for a variety of reasons including the fact his apartment is just out of reach of the mandated length he cannot be within the distance of a school which rests  tauntingly like a diabetic a candy factory  directly across the street where he now lives. This is a test he rationalizes and reports this discovery and others to his appointed therapy sessions with a psychiatrist which only makes Walter increasingly uncomfortable as the good doctor suggests he keep a journal and reflect on what he has done or worse what he may do. Getting a job as a factory worker in his rundown Philly suburb Walter keeps to himself especially from the slyly sexy MaryKay rapper Eve who has other plans for the newcomer and instead is befriended by the tomboyish yet openminded Vickie Bacon's reallife wife Sedgwick also giving a career high performance with just the right amount of fronting toughness and vulnerable empathy when she beds and eventually discovers Walter's burning secrets.All of the proceedings lead to a keg of explosive ramifications as Walter tries desperately to walk the straight and narrow but it isn't helping matters as the deck is stacked against him in the form of police Sgt. Lucas rap star Mos Def in the Walter Matthau role dogging Walter as a likely suspect in rash of recent child molestings. Sooner or later Walter is going to return to his old form.

His pained grimace of accepting his sickness only curdles his well intended desire to shirk his monstrous past but will not embrace the touchyfeely psychobabble that he must endure to delve into his childhood as perhaps the key to his perversities. Smartly directed by newcomer Nicole Kassel  who coscripted the usually ontarget screenplay with Steven Fechter they bungle it when Walter's playbyplay inner monologue of a perceived local molester makes a mark outside his window is a tad uneasy  wisely allows her character just enough rope to hang himself before reeling himself back to square one. There is a nice interplay of just the right amount of nervous tension between Bacon's Walter and a little girl named Robin perfectly played by Pilkes he espies one day and follows into a local park .Bacon is a journeyman character actor trapped in a leading man's body but has what so few of his contemporaries do  moxy talent and the chops to tackle a taboo subject without being exploitative. That is the true skill of a marksman and that is truly what Bacon is.".

Although I am a selfproclaimed Kevin Bacon hater let me stand up and shout that this is not only his best ever performance by far but also a performance that will stand up against most any dramatic turn by any actor. For the first time Bacon is understated rather than overacting and hamming. The film and Bacon capture the emotional torment of a recently released from prison child molester as he struggles to fit in and be normal. Bacon's remarkable acting is extremely well supported by his real life wife Kyra Sedgwick Mos Def Benjamin Bratt and a most surprising Eve. Bacon's eyes are truly haunting and we feel his pain as he struggles to find a bit of joy amidst his demons. Two weak script features were the rapidness of Sedgwick's character's acceptance of Bacon and the over the top scene in the park with young Robin. Otherwise the realism was gritty and believable. Not one I want to see again but the creepiness and edginess make it worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Woodsman at the 2004 Stockholm International Film Festival. It was quite a popular film at the festival especially with all the Oscarsbuzz surrounding Kevin Bacon due to this film.The Woodsman is about a pedophile who gets released from prison and tries to fit into society. He works at a sawmill meets a woman and tries to stay out of trouble. But feelings he tries to push away emerge again and the question is if he can stay out of trouble for long.Kevin Bacon is terrific in The Woodsman but The Woodsman is not a terrific film. Rather it's a quite mediocre film that has it's points but also walks into some of the traps that always surround dramas that deal with a difficult subject.Let's start out with Kevin Bacon. He is as good as i have ever seen him. He has been one of my favorites for a long time and i hope that this film can finally give him a shot at the Oscars. He really lifts this film a couple of notches as well. So what about the film itself?Well it has it's ups and downs. The up is that it deals with a difficult subject in a rather good way. Instead of just boiling everything down into just black and white as is often the case in Hollywood films this film tries to understand. While most of us feel that pedophiles are disgusting people and that the crimes they commit are horrible they are still human and as complex as you or me. It doesn't excuse them in any way but perhaps in understanding them we can better prevent these crimes. Just categorizing them as plain monsters doesn't help us stop any of this from happening.The downside in this film is mostly the exaggerations added to make a greater impact. Sometimes you get the feeling that there is a pedophile waiting behind every tree and it just becomes a bit too much. Also the love story between Kevin Bacon and his reallife wife Kyra Sedgwick feels a bit shallow.All in all this is an interesting film well worth the effort of watching it. I guess many people will shy away from the subject matter which is sad really since this film in no way tries to justify child molestation. So watch it more for Kevin Bacon than for the story. I rate this 610.".

But the film addressed two salient facts. Firstly there are far more paedophiles around than caught and this type of thing happens frequently in a domestic situation. Far more frequently than anyone is willing to admit. Secondly paedophiles come in many forms and some are as Walter is. He hates it but cannot help it without a huge amount of inner strength. At the end you do not know if he will do it again it seems likely but he hates himself and the urges he gets even more than others around him do. It was an intense film very hard to watch but it points out some ugly truths which most people will not want to admit happens. yet there are a thousand stories of this happening with no one bought to justice.

From a filmic point of view it is a nailbiter as you find yourself hoping he makes it. There is also a subtle erotic interaction with his offscreen wife. This is a mustsee for serious film goers.

On the other hand she could reply that I am overly susceptible to manipulation at the hands of skilled professional movie makers and both of us may be right. However like the man said difference of opinion is what makes horse races so we can take this one right to Aqueduct. From her point of view there's manipulation in spades. Walter Kevin Bacon is just out of the Joint after drawing 12 years for in his own words molesting little girls. He takes a job in a lumber yard heavy use of title symbolism although THAT woodsman is the one in the fairy tale who cuts the girl out of the wolf's stomach. Right off he rejects the advances of MaryKay  played by an actress known simply as Eve and if THAT isn't an omen what is  who is one of those egoists who figure that any guy who rejects them must have a secret that needs exposing. Adding to Walter's burden is Sgt Lucas Mos Def  where do the GET these names from? who's a graduate of the giveadogabadname school of detection and enjoys nothing more than hassling Walter and delivering sloppy script points like asking Walter where he was at such a time and such a day when a girl was molested and THEN telling Walter that every move he Walter makes has been observed since he left the slammer illustrating that by definition Walter could NOT have been involved in the alleged molestation. Just by way of an extra handicap Walter can only find a room right across the street from a school playground which is not unlike a compulsive gambler taking a room at Caesar's Palace. The Book of Job isn't in it as Walter is denounced anonymously by Eve to add to the rest of his troubles. All the reviews I read in the National Press  unqualified raves to a man made the same point that we are being asked to empathize with a paedophile and wind up actually doing so. The film resembles nothing so much a a Wounded Bird Convention beginning with Walter himself then taking in Vickie Kyra Sedgwick Bacon's reallife wife who has a tale of her own to trade for his as a girl she was sexually abused by not one but THREE brothers and winding up with Robin Hannah Pilkes the eleven year old girl befriended if that's the right word by Walter who reveals obliquely that she is being abused by her father. There's not a bad performance in the whole film but I'm reminded of the now notorious comment by critic Brooks Atkinson when reviewing the first performance of Pal Joey on Broadway. After noting the excellence of the Rodgers and Hart score and the fine singing and acting on display he concluded by asking 'can you draw sweet water from a foul well?' From the comments I've seen posted here I'd have to say Yes.".

Kevin Bacon's reserved handling of the character Walter is deft and powerful. At times he is almost unrecognizable as Kevin Bacon.The discussions that I heard after this movie were conversations I was glad to hear. Bacon's character in the film had a unusual sexual awakening early in life. Having no healthy means to try to understand his fetish he got stuck in that moment of time forever. It turned into a sexual perversion and ending up being something that banished him from normal society. It makes for a brilliant psychological conflict on film. On a side note the musical scoring to this film is notably wonderful. Perhaps that has something to do with Damon Dash being one of the producers.".

Kevin Bacon's reserved handling of the character Walter is deft and powerful. At times he is almost unrecognizable as Kevin Bacon.The discussions that I heard after this movie were conversations I was glad to hear. Bacon's character in the film had a unusual sexual awakening early in life. Having no healthy means to try to understand his fetish he got stuck in that moment of time forever. It turned into a sexual perversion and ending up being something that banished him from normal society. It makes for a brilliant psychological conflict on film. On a side note the musical scoring to this film is notably wonderful. Perhaps that has something to do with Damon Dash being one of the producers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Walter a child molester is released from jail where he has served time for one of the most heinous crimes ever committed by a person. He is a man that has lost everything in the process. His sister repudiates him the only one being kind is his brotherinlaw Carlos who feels it's his duty to be nice to him because Walter had proved to be his friend in his own time of need.What's to expect from a man like Walter? This is the basis of this courageous and disturbing film directed by Nicole Kassell with great sensitivity to the subject matter. Can Walter keep away from the temptations that were instrumental in landing him in jail? Or would he go back to harming unsuspecting children? When he arrives in Philadelphia Walter is given a job by a man whose father had met him in prison. For all practical purposes Walter seems to be behaving himself even when his new apartment overlooks a play area of an elementary school. He is trying to work things out with a therapist apparently making progress. He becomes obsessed with a man he sees hanging out by the playground offering candy and rides to young boys. This is a sad reminder for him of what landed him in jail.In the lumber factory where he works Walter meets Vicky. She is also a woman who has seen a lot. Vicky doesn't appear to be a likely candidate for a relationship with the excon but they appear to be more compatible than what one gives them credit for at a simple glance. Vicky begins caring for Walter as his secret past suddenly is blown out of proportion in the work place. Vicky is not a quitter and she realizes she loves him and she can't believe the monster Walter is supposed to be is the man that she has fallen for.After quitting his job Walter is seen on a bus attracted by a young girl that is traveling alone. He follows her into a park but the encounter only emboldens him to pursue the girl. When everything turns bad after seeing his sister briefly Walter begins a predatory march toward the park searching for Robin the meek young girl he met before. That encounter reveals that Robin is a damaged girl victim of an abusive father and Walter changes his mind about it. The film ends in a positive note as Vicky comes for Walter to take him to her place.The Woodsman works because of the incredible Kevin Bacon. He is the Walter of the story. Mr. Bacon has never been better! This actor surprises by the way he conveys the essence of the character just by looking at all the emotions going through inside him. Under the direction of Nicole Kassell Kevin Bacon rises to the challenge of capturing Walter.Kira Sedgwick is seen as Vicky. She is also contributes to make the film even better. In supporting roles Mos Def Eve Benjamin Bratt and the sweet Hannah Pilkes are seen. Ms. Pilkes is a revelation in the film. She shows great talent holding her own against Mr. Bacon.Nicole Hassell and her cinematographer Xavier Perez Grobit have done wonders with a film that in spite of the darkness of the situation shed a lot of light into the picture. Ms. Hassell is a new talent who will no doubt go places.".

	schema:reviewBody "This week's review is for The Woodsman the directorial debut of Nicole Kassell.The woodsman tells the story of Walter played with an Oscarworthy performance by Kevin Bacon who just got out of prison for child molestation after 12 years. Walter attempts to restart his life as a normal citizen by buying an apartment which happens to be across the street from a grade school because it was the only landlord that would take his money and by getting a job at a lumberyard. Walter begins a romance with coworker Vickie played beautifully by Kyra Sedgwick and must deal with the label that society places on him and his own selfguilt. With the help of Kyra and a young girl Robin perhaps the only 2 people who understand and sympathize with him Walter attempts to forgive himself and become what he wants to be just normal.Kevin Bacon does a remarkable job playing the detached almost emotionless Walter. You're able see in his eyes in his face the anguish that he puts on himself and the reflections of society's view of him. Yes I called his performance Oscarworthy and it is unfortunately it came out too late to be considered by the academy this year and too early to be considered for next year's awards. Kyra Sedgwick does a great job as Walter's love interest and as a woman who has her own inner demons from her past. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are accompanied by a great supporting cast including Benjamin Bratt Mos Def Eve and David Allen Grier all of which pull their weight with great performances.One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is how the topic of pedophilia is handled. Bacon plays the role not as most people see child molesters as just a person who has a sick fetish but instead Walter is a man who knows that its wrong doesn't want to be this way but cannot help it. As Benjamin Bratt's character describes it his disease. The audience instead of disliking Walter as we normally would sympathizes with him and sees that in some cases it may be a mental sickness. It's also interesting to see how Walter's outlook on the world is. He is a man confused by the ideas of love and attraction as he suspects that his best friend has romantic feelings toward his daughter just because he used the term love.What really makes this movie is the final 20 or so minutes in which as I sat there I was tense and on the edge of my seat and not a breath could be heard throughout the theatre. The little girl Robin played by first timer Hannah Pilkes almost steals one of the climactic scenes away from Bacon and really makes her presence in the film known. While the final 20 minutes really propels the film to success that is not to say that the first hour and ten minutes are not without their merit. However at times it did seem like it took a bit too long to get to where it was going.The Woodsman is a great film that deals with a subject that you don't see too much in film and it's handled remarkably. Nicole Kassell produces a great film her first time around which gives me the pleasure to give the Woodsman 4 stars.".

The story touches a very unpleasant and practically forbidden theme in Hollywood the life of a pedophile. Further the drama is presented from the side of the sex offender how difficult is to rehabilitate such a person in a normal society facing his own guilty and shame and the prejudice of the society as a whole. The direction of this independent movie is stunning and the performances are outstanding. The underrated actress Kyra Sedgwick Mrs. Kevin Bacon in real life Mos Def Eve and the young Hannah Pilkes are amazing with their very real and human interpretations. The metaphoric title related to the woodsman that saved the little girl in Little Riding Red Hood fairytale completes this excellent movie with a golden key.

	schema:reviewBody "Bravo Bravo Bravo! The Woodsman is a great human drama! I had read so many reviews that this movie was disturbing and that it sympathized with child molesters??? What a load of garbage! Some people just don't know how to interpret a movie in the way it is meant to be represented.It seems like every time a film is made that tackles real life issues people duck and coveror worse they start criticizing and tearing it down.Simply put this movie is brilliantand I will explain why The Woodsman is about ADDICTIONS not pedophiles. A pedophile is used as a metaphor for the film but the underlying message of the film is all about addiction.A lot of people have addictions that may not be good for them or for others that surround them. In fact everyone has at one point succumbed to temptation of one sort or another. Some people have addictions that hurt themselves or others and others have healthier addictions that don't hurt anybody. But we all have them. Some smoke drink steal compulsively lie or even abuse others. Some people get in trouble for not being able to resist their temptations and therefore may pay the heavy and well deserved price. People who DO succumb to their notsohealthy addictions often find a way of restraining and coping with them. However some people NEVER learn to resist their addictions and impulsesand end up paying throughout their lives without ever learning the meaning of self control.Keep that in mind while watching The Woodsman. Because that is what this film is REALLY abouta man who is trying to resist his addictions and the temptation he feels after regaining a chance to join society after being released from prison.I'm not going to tell the story of The Woodsman in this review because no matter what could be said in writing this is a movie that should be watched and experienced for your self.This is not a film for children or people looking for mindless action or comedy. This is a REAL drama. It is an adult honest and fantastic movie that just soars.Kevin Bacon is such a brilliant actor. Here is a movie star millionaire who could do any kind of movie he wants. The fact that he will work for NOTHING and take on such roles as this just proves his dedication to the craft of acting and film making. Kevin and his wife Kyra Sedgwick also helped to finance this little gem and get it off the ground.The Woodsman is the best movie I have ever seen with a husband and wife team acting together. Normally two married or even dating actors is a recipe for disaster in a movie. These two play SO well off each other in these gritty roles that as the viewer you will not only completely forget the fact that they been married for years but that they are also successful millionaire movie stars.This movie should have gotten some Oscars or at least some nominations. The Academy just really sucks sometimes! To nominate such movies as Finding Neverland or The Aviator and their male leads and to have ignored Kevin Bacon and The Woodsman only goes to show how far Hollywood has NOT come in recognizing fantastic works of art.I loved this movie. It was captured beautifully. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended for people who consider themselves intelligent movie goers that like honest well written and extremely well acted films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be put off by the subject matter  yes Kevin Bacon plays a child molester just released from prison and yes the movie is distressing. It is also amazing. It would not be hyperbole to say that it was the best movie I saw all year. It is very quiet without a lot of dialog and many scenes of just watching characters react to each other. Very subtle and very moving. And so fresh and different from so many movies that bash you over the head with The Point they're trying to make. When I got to the end I realized how many levels the movie was operating on without my even noticing. You could watch this movie many times as there are many meanings to what is said even the title has at least two meanings. I have always liked Kevin Bacon and I have so much respect for him for taking this role it was so brave and he just breaks your heart several times over with his performance. It is beyond me how the Academy could have overlooked him they are cowards. Reward this fine actor and the many brave and talented people who made this excellent movie and go see it.".

It would not be hyperbole to say that it was the best movie I saw all year. It is very quiet without a lot of dialog and many scenes of just watching characters react to each other. Very subtle and very moving. And so fresh and different from so many movies that bash you over the head with The Point they're trying to make. When I got to the end I realized how many levels the movie was operating on without my even noticing.

With the help of Director Nicole Kassell making a solid debut effort and his offscreen wife Kyra Sedgwick excellent actress Bacon makes a wise but difficult choice to portray this child molester not as a monster as would be the case in most stories but rather he portrays him as a very complicated deeply flawed tormented man. The fact that this story is told from the pedophile's pointofview makes it all the more powerful in forcing the viewer to confront this man's humanity or at least acknowledge that there is a human being somewhere inside the monster. Besides top notch support from Sedgwick and Mos Def there is a solid and uneasy to watch small role excellently played by Hannah Pilkes as a young girl who tempts Bacon's character. Terrific film.".

Some are even quite bad but they try so hard to offer something for everyone that there usually are at least some things in the movie you like. But because they do offer something for everyone they usually also have some things you don't like. However once in a while a film comes along which focuses solely on it's own target audience. Sometimes the critics and fans of socalled 'quality cinema' are the target audience. In those cases we have films like American Beauty. Sometimes fans of sexrelated teencomedies are the target audience and we have a film like American Pie. And sometimes fans of pure actionentertainment are the target audience and we have a film like Fair Game.This is a film which most people have a strong opinion of. Others love it while others hate it. What's interesting is that the reasons for the opinion of the film are the same for both people. Others hate it because it's unbelievably dumb excessively violent has an unoriginal plot stupid dialogue and has no good actors. However others love it for the same reasons. And I'm one of those people.The film is based on Paula Gosling's novel of the same name. It's interesting to notice that Sylvester Stallone's actioner Cobra was also based on the same novel but the films have very little in common. About the only thing they share is the hate of the critics and the love of actionfans. What's even more interesting is that Stallone was originally attached to this film as well.Anyway about this film.. While it's true that noone has been able to make a good machoactioner since the 80s except Steven Seagal and even he is now making films like The Patriot this is a quality effort if there ever was one. This has everything I want a macho cop as the hero a sexy woman as his sidekick lots of action and gratuitous violence and nothing I don't a deep and original plot Academy Awardwinning actors emotional scenes between mom and daughter.... Actually many scenes here are so stupid that they could be considered campy and even if you aren't a fan of the genre you might enjoy laughing at the movie's unintentional humor.One of the things which always means a lot to me in films is the score and Fair Game has one of the best scores I've ever heard. I liked Mark Mancina's score to Speed and Bad Boys but they're nothing compared to this. A brilliant main theme combined with excellent underscore. Full marks.There is also the traditional You killed my partner. Big mistake you hear me? Wanna know why? Because I'm gonna come and get every last one of you!threat from Baldwin. I love those lines I really do. Cobra was filled with them and the  mid80s was a good time for machoactioners.In fact Fair Game is like a throwback to the 80s when Joel Silver still made good actioners Commando Action Jackson Die Hard Road House  all brilliant. Of course it's not intelligent. Of course it's not original. Of course it's not a film which makes people think about their lives. It is pure actionentertainment nothing more and nothing less. This will definitely appeal to fans of Cobra Action Jackson and the early Steven Seagalfilms. However if you don't like action pure action and nothing but the action  skip it. Even if you liked films like Speed and FaceOff you might not like this.Gunfights explosions gratuitous violence gratuitous nudity from Cindy Crawford no less! a brilliant score..what more could a guy who loves action ask? Definitely a 10.".

It's still far from the worst film ever made and certainly far from the worst in the year it came out 1995 was the year of Showgirls Waterworld Species and Congo for openers.Way too much senseless violence confusing scripting from Charlie Fletcher and an uncredited Steven E. deSouza and frenzied editing for sure and Cindy's Oscar is unlikely to be coming any time soon  but she's no worse than the rest of the cast and unlike Steven Berkoff at least SHE hasn't sunk to doing a Jean Claude Van Damme film since. She's actually pretty good more often than not and her punches are more convincing than some male actors though hitting the smuggest of the smug Baldwin brothers provides motivation. Let's just say that the man credited as her acting coach clearly didn't see all his efforts go unrewarded.And you have to give her and the rest of the cast and crew credit no one ever pretends that Fair Game is anything other than an unpretentious action film which can't be a bad thing. But then even Cindy's biggest detractors have never claimed she was pretentious. While it is mainly for fans of the moled one it's still short enough not to hurt and it certainly improves on the last time the Paula Gosling novel it's based on was turned into a film the truly awful Cobra with Sylvester Stallone and you don't often see films starring lawyer characters doing something other than criminal law. And before you point out that no lawyer ever looked as good as Cindy Crawford remember that that never stopped Steven Bochco  or David E. Kelley with Ally McBeal.

I mean she's okay with her pointy chin and beauty spot but is she any more attractive than say Madeleine Stowe Sean Young or Jennifer Connolly? Crawford is taller than the others true. She could be on an allgirl's Olympic basketball team. But it would be hard to rank order the beauty parade that's been on screen lately. When you get so close to the top it becomes a matter of stylistic choice almost arbitrary.There's another woman in this movie a homely middleaged KGB agent who demolishes men with a single kick to the head. It could be argued that a woman with such a talent for meting out punishment might be a more exciting date than some marshmallow exmodel.Anyway Crawford the exmodel at hand isn't bad. She has legs the length of a giraffe's and she takes two showers at the beginning of the movie and changes her T shirt in front of the camera once. I don't mean to be too critical of her appearance.It's no wonder that her bare midriff prompts the goggleeyed Baldwin to put a cigar in his mouth and try to light it. I take this to be symbolism although to be sure sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. But then she cozzens some computer nerd so much that he winds up fiddling with my joystick. Can a joystick sometimes just be a joystick too? Of course she can't act but we can't count that as a demerit because nobody else in the movie can act either so the absence of skill on her part is hardly noticeable. Her performance though does put on display at least one of her attractive features in addition to the other two and that is an endearing lisp. Pizza comes out PEETtha. Kind of nice. Gives her a vulnerable quality you know? Speaking of her vulnerability brings up the question of the plot alas. See  these exKGB agents try to murder her in every way possible  shooting blowing up her house shooting yet again and again. Then towards the end they decide she can't be killed but rather she must be interrogated. End of discussion of plot.I found myself wishing the heavies weren't all exRussian KGB agents because the movie was shot after all in 1994 five years after the collapse of the USSR which either makes the villains out of date or the screenwriters unimaginative in their search for heavies. Maybe both.It doesn't matter really except that there are some people of an impressionable age who might be tempted to take this cartoon as a serious reflection of reality. Their minds might be warped enough by exposure to these stereotypes that they grow up imagining all Russians have faces with the general contours and texture of potatoes. The heavies all scowl and sneer and speak with one or another foreign accent. Was it Oliver Cromwell who said Take me for what I am warts and all? Makeup has given the chief heavy a prominent wart right in the middle of his forehead like a third eye I suppose so we don't mix him up with the others.These exSoviet Seals are something special. They are experts in electronics the film tells us but that doesn't do them justice. Their equipment has positively supernatural attributes. For instance they use an infrared heat sensor that can not only penetrate walls but can detect that the leading lady is wearing high heels as well. And their radio direction finder can triangulate a transmitter's position all by itself.Essentially the whole movie is one long chase. None of it makes too much sense. After Baldwin saves Crawford's life a dozen times over she suddenly turns on him angrily then runs away. Shortly afterward aboard a freight train they have a physical fight and then she immediately falls into his arms and they make love. Unfortunately it's one of those lovemaking scenes in which such arty effects as dappled spots of blue light move across patches of undifferentiated limbs and it's interrupted by one of the agents who has a lasersightequipped weapon that plants a red circle on Baldwin's butt. At least Crawford notices this. I can understand why Baldwin might not have.There are some gags and wouldbe jokes and sassy lines sprinkled through this melange of explosions and shootings and slowmotion fireballs. It doesn't add up to much but it's so slam bang that I found it kind of fun. I really do wish we had some generic villain for these types of movies though. Those impressionable minds  the ones that can't remember the difference between Russia and the Soviet Union  worry me at times.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Action packed police movie set in Florida about a group of mobsters consisting of exKGB agents led by former KBG agent Kazak Steven Berkoff. The mobsters use an offshore freighter The Tortugo to tap into underwater bank cables and steal millions of dollars in bank transactions. That plan falls apart when the feisty and pretty civil lawyer Kate McQueen Cindy Crawford got in their way and had to be eliminated in order for them to keep up their illegal activities. Attempting to assassinate Kate at the beginning of the movie as she was jogging down swanky Ocean Drive she has Homicide Detective Max Kirpatrick William Baldwin assigned to be with her around the clock to watch protect and defend her it's a real hard job but somebody's got to do it against other attempts on her life. This gang of exKGB thugs really mean business as they blow up half of South Florida to get the pair Max  Kate. As usual in the movies Max  Kate are always one step ahead of them and the mobsters no matter how much men and firepower as well as electronic equipment that they have are no match against the two who have almost nothing but the clothes on their back and some times not even that to fight them with. Far more violent then most action police movies with almost the entire cast wiped out with the exception of Max  Kate of course by the ending credits. The action scenes of Fair Game are a lot like the old Saturday afternoon cliffhangers with Max  Kate looking like they've had it and then just getting away from the bad guys every fifteen or so minutes in the movie. The bad guys are as bad as they can get in what they do and try to do you can just imagine anyone trying to hurt or kill Cindy Crawford has to be the biggest enemy against huMANity in history.The last halfhour of the movie is nonstop action on the roads and highways as well as railroad trains and ships in the South Florida area with the most graphic boat sinking since even though movie was made in 1995 but I haven't seen it until 2004 the movie Titanic in 1997. Outlandish but at the same time ironic ending with the head gangster Kazak instead of trying to escape the sinking and exploding ship tries to punch into the ships computer the information that he needs to complete his illegal bank transaction of almost one billion dollars! All this with him knowing very well that he won't make it out alive by taking so much time doing it! It's as if Kazak just wanted to die rich.".

The bad guys are as bad as they can get in what they do and try to do you can just imagine anyone trying to hurt or kill Cindy Crawford has to be the biggest enemy against huMANity in history.The last halfhour of the movie is nonstop action on the roads and highways as well as railroad trains and ships in the South Florida area with the most graphic boat sinking since even though movie was made in 1995 but I haven't seen it until 2004 the movie Titanic in 1997. Outlandish but at the same time ironic ending with the head gangster Kazak instead of trying to escape the sinking and exploding ship tries to punch into the ships computer the information that he needs to complete his illegal bank transaction of almost one billion dollars! All this with him knowing very well that he won't make it out alive by taking so much time doing it! It's as if Kazak just wanted to die rich.";

Cindy Crawford is of course a beautiful center piece but her acting is so strained there is no emotional connection with her acting partners or with the audience. Baldwin also bombed in having any kind of real or believable connection with his scene partners. I actually walked out of this movie because it was so painful. Some really good films would be Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the Thomas Crown Affair or a more comical film like True Lies".

A cop played by William Baldwin who is supposed to be Sergeant Kirkpatrick is publicly humiliated by his girlfriend played by Salmek Hayek in a police station before he has to interview Cindy Crawford. She goes home after a quick trip back to the office and just when Kirkpatrick shows up to get something signed her house gets blown up by the Russians. This is when Steven Berkoff steps in to attack Baldwin and Crawford. A chase ensues because through a computer they can track the couple's every movement. The baddies kill two police cops at a safehouse several f.b.i. agents bash two computer salesmen and generally create mayhem. In the end Crawford gets captured and Baldwin comes to the save the day. The ship explodes with the remainder of the baddies including Berkoff and that wraps up the film. It is quite a short film with the British version lasting nearly an hour and a half. It also plays in widescreen and looks like a good but dud film of that era. If you like action you will like this.".

This movie was actionpacked and a thrillseeker as well. I liked the train scene when the cop and lawyer got on and the Caddy sacrificed itself at the pole. Going after the KGB is an extreme task especially when these agents are extreme themselves. Killing everyone in their path targeting anyone they first lay eyes on. At first both KateCrawford and MaxBaldwin don't get along too well. But when the rogue KGB starts targeting people and killing Kate's sister that's when the two began to trust one another. Some scenes remind me of The Gauntlet and The Joshua Tree. The action of the movie is just right I don't see what the big deal was. Perhaps when a model decides to go into acting expect a lot of typecasting in the making. I don't see it that way Cindy Crawford did fine there. I don't care what the critics say this movie was fine not in the theaters but at home it's a hit! 3 out of 5 stars!".

If you have to poke fun an it you could but take the whole thing like a grain of salt.Invite some friends over leave your brain at the door get a few beers and Chinese takeout and prepare yourself for a blast!";

After the rather absurd attempted shooting of Crawford in the opening scene Fair Game' begins rather effectively examining the loss of privacy in the digital world a fresh idea in 1995 Enemy of the State' didn't arrive till three years later. Crawford plays a lawyer specializing in civil cases. While helping one of his divorce clients she inadvertently falls under the scrutiny of a group of former KGB assassins. William Baldwin Backdraft'is the cop assigned to protect her. Baldwin looks like a cross between his brother Alec and Nicholas Cage in other words kind of goofy. Cindy Crawford looks like well Cindy Crawford one of the world's most beautiful women. Crawford received some pretty bad raps for this movie. That's really unfair but not surprising considering Hollywood's experience with supermodels. In the 50s they used to dub supermodel Suzy Parker. Crawford's considerably better than that. Her voice and line readings remind me of early  Farrah Fawcett.The big problem here is neither Crawford nor Baldwin. It's a script that would have us believe former KGB operatives would miss Crawford with a machine gun as she stands by a storefront with no cover. It's a script that would have us believe KGB agents would blow up Crawford's house with C4 to cover a COVERT operation. It's the script that would give Baldwin endless supplies of 9mm ammunition while he leaves behind machine guns and street sweepers'. It's a script that has the intelligent sensible Crawford running from Baldwin her only ally. It's a script that would have us believe the feisty Crawford would surrender without a fight etc. etc.Production values for Fair Game' are top notch great color photography sound music editing and stunts. Had producer Joel Silver substituted Jackie Chan for Billy Baldwin Fair Game' would have made a first rate martial arts movie even with its other shortcomings.  Course I'm not sure Cindy Crawford would've gotten naked' for Jackie Chan.  Well topless anyway.Fair Game' is a dumb blonde' of a movie but Crawford is anything but dumb. She deserved better and deserves another opportunity to prove her mettle as an actress. If she made another movie  I'd go see it even if she become closer to an 8 than a 10.Nonetheless Fair Game' is at worst a fair' movie.  I give it a 5'.".

As they look into the case Nick and Nora learn that Drake wasn't very well liked and there are actually several people who benefited from his death. Drake owed money to loan shark Al Amboy and Janet's father disliked Brant and may have set him up. Drake's girlfriend may have been having a fling with clarinetist Buddy Hollis and he and Drake had a fist fight on stage during the festivities.

	schema:reviewBody "Song of the Thin Man is a sadsweet experience something like meeting a good friend you haven't seen in years and realizing how much affection you still have for him... but also how much you both have aged. It's been 13 years since The Thin Man appeared in 1934. We have to stop and remember that Nick Charles wasn't the thin man back then that particular thin man was just one of the many murder victims Nick and Nora came across in their six movies. We remember the sophistication and insouciance of this affectionate and clever couple. They were never at a loss for a quick comeback or to shake a cold gin martini. Even Nick's modus operandi to bring all the suspects together at the conclusion and pick apart the case until he has the murderer squirming never quite got stale. Alas with Song of the Thin Man we have the MGM factory squeezing out one more film to try to wring a profit from it this time attempting to make it contemporary by setting the story in the postWWII social world of afterhours jazz clubs bebop musicians and hep cat dialogue. Nick and Nora never looked uncomfortable anywhere their adventures took them in the past. They look at times now as out of place as salesmen from Peru Indiana at a Linda and Cole Porter party. Gone is the sophisticated world of white sofas and polished black floors of naughty Porter lyrics and earnestly sophisticated Gershwin tunes. Martinis seem oddly old fashioned now and so do Old Fashioneds as Nick drinks high balls and Nora sips sherry. And instead of clever repartee Song of the Thin Man gives us the kind of dialogue only studio journeymen can write. Says one character I must have blown my top kicking Buddy over for a road company Casanova like you! The solution depends on the kind of halfbaked melodramatic psychology popular at the time. To make it even more tedious there are no characters except Nick and Nora to care about. The movie is peopled with crooks opportunists gold diggers scattalking musicians and the unattractive rich. The acting is so variable that it doesn't take long to realize we're watching the kind of movie that MGM did not waste much effort on. Why spend time on it? Two names William Powell and Myrna Loy. Even though 13 years have elapsed even though at 55 Powell is a little fuller around the face Loy at 42 doesn't seem to have changed a bit and even though WWII altered decisively the world of films they remain one of the most refreshing attractive and delightful movie pairs in screen history. They raise the movie if at least not to their level to a level of enduring affection for their style their warmth their intelligence and that word again their insouciance. So three stars is too much for the movie but five stars is too little for them.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not quite a great movieperhaps but of all the Thin Man series'entries that starred capable William Powell and mature and lovely Myrna Loy arguably this is the best mystery of all. It is also unfortunately true that having saddled the funloving Charleses Nick and Nora with Little Nicky the same error committed in the Tarzan series this series' executives discovered the young fellow admirably played by Dean Stockwell was crimping the thirties' breezy and boozy style of their very stylish duo. So this was the final entry of a longlasting and frequently delightful set of entries. The storyline for this one is particularly strong as are the dialogue and characters in my judgment. Steve Fisher and Nat Perrin wrote the strong screenplay with additional dialogue by James O'Hanlon and Harry Crane. The story was by Stanley Roberts. The main narrative concerns musicians and socialites and how badly they mix in this 'case'. The corpse is an obnoxious bandleader who is killed while leading his aggregation aboard a gambling ship that operates outside the 'threemile limit. Nick Charles retired New York detective refuses to become involved here then he is shot at involved in the case up to his ears menaced lied to frustrated by police instructed in bee bop music and finally left alone and also aided by his wife long enough to solve the murder and clear the innocent.

Bess Flowers who is somewhat inadequate both as a singer and an actress is also featured.

	onyx:emotionText "This is not quite a great movieperhaps but of all the Thin Man series'entries that starred capable William Powell and mature and lovely Myrna Loy arguably this is the best mystery of all. It is also unfortunately true that having saddled the funloving Charleses Nick and Nora with Little Nicky the same error committed in the Tarzan series this series' executives discovered the young fellow admirably played by Dean Stockwell was crimping the thirties' breezy and boozy style of their very stylish duo. So this was the final entry of a longlasting and frequently delightful set of entries. The storyline for this one is particularly strong as are the dialogue and characters in my judgment. Steve Fisher and Nat Perrin wrote the strong screenplay with additional dialogue by James O'Hanlon and Harry Crane. The story was by Stanley Roberts. The main narrative concerns musicians and socialites and how badly they mix in this 'case'. The corpse is an obnoxious bandleader who is killed while leading his aggregation aboard a gambling ship that operates outside the 'threemile limit. Nick Charles retired New York detective refuses to become involved here then he is shot at involved in the case up to his ears menaced lied to frustrated by police instructed in bee bop music and finally left alone and also aided by his wife long enough to solve the murder and clear the innocent.

By 1947 William Powell and Myrna Loy had become a little too long in the tooth to portray the dashing urbane mystery solving couple. Both still do a good job but I always picture Nick and Nora a little younger. The writing is not up to the standard set by the first three Thin Man films. It often seems more like what you would find in a cheap Monogram Charlie Chan film. I'll always argue that the writing in this series as a whole really suffered with the departure of Dashiell Hammett. And with a child at home the jokes centered on Nick's drinking seem out of place and not as funny.So how can I rate a movie a 610 if I see so many problems with it? The faults I point out are found when comparing Song of the Thin Man with the other movies in the series. On it's own it's an enjoyable enough movie just not the best I've ever seen. But when compared with the previous five films it fails. Still we're talking Powell and Loy my alltime favorite movie couple so a 610 seems about right.".

Drake suspected him of having an affair with his girlfriend Grahame who sings with the band.In an attempt to be hep Nick attempts to use musician language and it's funny to hear it coming from him and Nora tells the institutionalized clarinet player that she's a canary. Though they were always wonderful together Powell and Loy just don't have the zip of earlier films they are after all older. Powell is 55 Loy is 42 and lovely but their routine is tired. The mystery is okay Dean Stockwell is funny as the incorrigible Nicky and Asta Jr. has some funny bits.You'll enjoy this as long as you don't compare it to the first few. The Thin Man started a host of imitators as well as a TV show and Broadway musical. Powell and Loy brought humor and class to the detective genre.

In many of the earlier Thin Mans Nick and Nora both seemed to thrive when they encountered a murder mystery and when they drank quite a bit which became less and less as the series continued.  Unfortunately the humor which had centered around their especially Nick's vices drinking gambling flirting etc. was replaced with parental humor.  The scene where Nora becomes a disciplinarian and insists that a reluctant Nick give a spanking to Nick Jr. just wasn't the humor we'd become accustomed to and was difficult to observe.  It was obvious that Nick and Nora had entered a more mature phase of life but in the movies that doesn't usually make for better comedy.  POSSIBLE SPOILER It is also hard to believe that someone who had been committed because he had been made to believe that he was the killer and rehabilitated by being made to believe that the murder never happened was brought back to give a concert and then announce who the killer was after the concert.Despite all of this I did enjoy the film.  I think it was mainly because of the jazz in the words of Klinker Love it! Love it!and the nightclub and jam scenes.  I wish I had been around when that music was popular.  I also liked the fact that there weren't any stereotypical pathetically helpless female characters in the supporting cast unlike the first four Thin Mans. While this is one of the weaker Thin Mansthis and Another Thin Man while After the Thin Man and the original Thin Man are the best I cannot imagine that this series would have been like without William Powell Myrna Loy and Asta I think there was a new Asta for this last film.

The usual array of suspects is on hand for Bill Powell to sift through and expose.Song of the Thin Man has Dean Stockwell as their young son Nick Charles Jr. and Powell and Loy get a sidekick in the form of sideman saxophonist Keenan Wynn.

Jayne Meadows Leon Ames who played a different character in The Thin Man Goes Home and Patricia Morison. Stockwell Meadows and Morison are all still alive incidentally. It also features Don Taylor in a small role as the musician Buddy Hollis which was interesting since I know him best as the director of Escape from the Planet of the Apes. The film far predates Buddy Holly's rise to fame but it was impossible not to think of him whenever Hollis' name was mentioned!It's a shame that the series couldn't have gone out on a stronger film. I like to imagine Nick and Nora continuing to investigate crimes for decades to come with Nick Jr. and Asta Jr. by their side! There was talk of a remake of The Thin Man starring Johnny Depp a few years ago but it seems to be stuck in development hell. Usually I'm against remakes but this one sounded promising. I hope that if it is ever made it is a period film since I can't imagine Nick and Nora working nearly as well in a present day film. Helena Bonham Carter would be my first choice for Nora.".

The plot was thin the dynamics between the lead actors wasn't what it once was and the Nick Charles trademark of gathering all the suspects at the last minute was overly dramatic if not over the top. Yet it is a Thin Man and like they say they just don't make them like they used to. Even a lukewarm Powell film is better than most fare out on the market today. William Powell was the master of understated wit and Asta was always a delight when he got the stage time. It was obvious Myrna Loy didn't quite have her heart in the role as she once did but she still played well as Nora to Powell's Nick. I have hopes more classic BWs will come out on DVD to offset the sorry collection of mundaneinane plots and rerunredonemovies that have become so prominent.".

The supporting cast is excellent especially Keenan Wynn who gives a hilarious performance as a jivetalking clarinetist. It's very amusing watching Nick and Nora trying to understand his hip slang.

The cutting edge in 1947 was bebop and even bebop was fairly mature by then. The afterhours jam sessions would be mixed race efforts with an edge toward the black musicians not a bunch of white guys playing smallgroup variations of 1940's big band crap. The white musicians went to the sessions to learn bebop from their black compatriots and to get away from the junk they had to play on the bandstand. Even the instrumentation was dated.

Besides Wynn you had Leon Ames Gloria Grahame and Jayne Meadows and the kicker would be Dean Stockwell still a kid as young Nick Charles Jr.As usual and despite my best efforts to follow the characters and situations it's virtually impossible to solve the mystery presented but getting there is much of the fun. I knew that necklace would wind up being instrumental in solving a murder as soon as Nick William Powell picked it up the first time but gee what's with Mrs. Talbin Patricia Morrison? She would have gotten her revenge when her husband confessed to killing Drake Phillip Reed. I think you'd have to call her shooting of Mitchell Talbin Ames an unforced error. Oh well too bad.So for a swan song I think Nick and Nora Charles went out respectably. Powell by this time was showing his age a bit but Myrna Loy still looked great though both conceding that perhaps their party hearty days may have been well behind them. Even Asta still had a few good scenes left in him working the bedroom gimmick for maximum effect. Spanning a period of slightly over a dozen years I think the Thin Man series came to a successful conclusion with this entertaining swan song.".

Powell by this time was showing his age a bit but Myrna Loy still looked great though both conceding that perhaps their party hearty days may have been well behind them. Even Asta still had a few good scenes left in him working the bedroom gimmick for maximum effect. Spanning a period of slightly over a dozen years I think the Thin Man series came to a successful conclusion with this entertaining swan song.";

The Thin Man films have a following and are an important part in the grand story of what made cinema great and etc etc however this shouldn't be the first Thin Man movie you check out. In fact it should be the last. Not only because it was the last Thin Man but also because it far from the best Thin Man. I can't say it is the worst Thin Man because I haven't seen most of them I believe there are 6 or 7 of them. Anyway the film isn't great but it is watchable. It is about a couple a detective and his wife who are also martini drinking socialists who are on a gambling ship on the night a murder occurs and they need to figure out who did it. Most of the Thin Man movies are similar in that they revolve around a who done it plot. I honestly couldn't stop watching it because it is charming and frankly a breath of fresh air from all the mindless films out there. 2015 was such a disappointing year for films and I have a bad feeling about 2016 as well. Thankfully there are a lot of gems out there for people who know where to look and the Thin Man series has a few of those gems in it. Start out with watching the very first Thin Man movie and if you like it continue on down the line. Anyway this film was enjoyable and will keep you watching regardless of the drag at times. IMDb Isn't letting me give it a 6.5 out of 10 so I'll just round up to a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "I completely disagree with some prior posters who thought this the worst in the series. First of all it's one of the best mysteries with any number of possible candidates. Secondly it has a really strong supporting cast led by K. Wynn who is terrific in the role of jazz inside man. Jayne Meadows and Ralph Morgan are also strong supporting actors. Third it really showcases jazz perhaps inadvertently and in a negative way however as out of touch out of the mainstream with a different language etc. and has some great numbers including the theme song You're Not so Easy to Forget which I think the director was using as a nod to this being the last in the series of Thin Man movies and to William Powell. The director obviously makes his disapproving commentary on jazz in a subtle way by focusing the camera on the bust of Beethoven just after a jazz scene! But he does integrate the music well into the plot since much of the plot takes place on a gambling boat. The denouement of the mystery is also probably influential on other mysterycriminal series to follow like Perry Mason in that the entire cast of suspects is collected together as in an Agatha Christie or a Rex Stout story. Fourth the script is very very witty and you have to pay close attention to the words like the reference to Somerset Maugham with the it couldn't be his razor a reference to Maugham's The Razor's Edge. Or how about the time William Powell is eying a ladies earrings but his sight is a bit focused elsewhere and Nora reminds him something like earrings are higher than that! But I did think we saw too much of Dean Stockwell and the film would have better off with him in a reduced role sorry to his fan club but I'm no fan. I thought I saw the Wizard of Oz in this movie and it turns out that it is his almost lookalike brother! Lastly Asta has a big and important role in this movie fittingly so since it is the last in the series. In short great acting great script and great harmony between Powell who really could act especially in comedy and M. Loy. Superb.".

Sorry if its hard to follow but if so then maybe you will like this movie.What follows is an odd collection of tender family moments interspersed with fart jokes nut shots and fat people Kevin James or short people Rob Schneider getting hurt. Oh and did I mention the barrage of oneliners? Basically the entire script is one big wry joke after another. I guess the writers realized nothing they could come up with was particularly funny so they should go for quantity over quality.

Next time include a paying audience in on the joke. It would have been nice if one joke were there any? would have worked. Did I mention that not one joke worked? Adam Sandler claims that he cowrote this mess but we all know there was never a script. Adam just called up his SNL drinking buddies and said Hey Let's take a vacation and film it for 80 million and charge people for it. Adam Sandler plays just a lazier version of himself. There is nothing he does in his movie that is amusing but he did manage to crack himself up in nearly every scene. So at least he has that going for him. I know that Adam's character stepped on the line and that is why he grew up to be a jerk. I don't think anyone told Chris Rock that they were filming a movie until after it was completed. He looks befuddled in every scene. It is a shame that he is so bad in this trash when he was so good in Death At A Funeral. His acting in this movie is the real kiss of death. Kevin James has never ever been funny and so I expected nothing from him and he delivered a grand slam. Kevin spends almost half the movie inside a KFC box. That is how embarrassed he was. Dennis Dugan did a lazy job of directing? this woodland waste. It's like he just set the camera down and let these 5 men try to act around it. I bet he spent most of his time trying to convince the stars how funny each scene was. He should be Razzy nominated. I will skip to the end of the movie because nothing really ever happened. Out of nowhere comes not even halfbaked melodrama with each couple overcoming some stupid problem. Each issue is brought up and resolved within 5 minutes and then never mentioned again! Why bother even brining it up in the first place because no one cares in the slightest. The final basketball showdown is filmed as if the entire crew fell asleep. I've seen more tension in a Dora the Explorer episode. Sandler's final lesion is worthless and really doesn't make much sense when you think about everything that has happened before it. Sandler's family was due for a loss and the evil guy was due for a win. What??? The evil guy was a jerk to everyone in the movie. And besides how do you know he was due for a win you haven't been in town for a long time. You know nothing about his life. How in the world does that insignificant game change that much? No one in the audience is buying that ending Sandler. No one. The women characters in the movie do nothing of note are interchangeable and look as bored as they audience watching these 5 idiots try and make the lamest stuff funny. I won't mention the women by name to spare them of unfair blame. And last but certainly not least or very least is the acting duo ? of Spade and Schneider. They are so bad that they make the acting in Troll 2 look Oscar worthy. Both should have to give up their SAG cards for this. I want to vomit just thinking of their acting again. They are worse then amateurs. I think both of them must be hiding a dark secret of Sandlers otherwise why are they here. I have an idea for Adam Sandler's next movie. Please call it Train Wreck. This way when it is released no one will be surprised when it sucks.".

I bet he spent most of his time trying to convince the stars how funny each scene was. He should be Razzy nominated. I will skip to the end of the movie because nothing really ever happened. Out of nowhere comes not even halfbaked melodrama with each couple overcoming some stupid problem. Each issue is brought up and resolved within 5 minutes and then never mentioned again! Why bother even brining it up in the first place because no one cares in the slightest. The final basketball showdown is filmed as if the entire crew fell asleep. I've seen more tension in a Dora the Explorer episode. Sandler's final lesion is worthless and really doesn't make much sense when you think about everything that has happened before it. Sandler's family was due for a loss and the evil guy was due for a win. What??? The evil guy was a jerk to everyone in the movie. And besides how do you know he was due for a win you haven't been in town for a long time. You know nothing about his life. How in the world does that insignificant game change that much? No one in the audience is buying that ending Sandler. No one. The women characters in the movie do nothing of note are interchangeable and look as bored as they audience watching these 5 idiots try and make the lamest stuff funny. I won't mention the women by name to spare them of unfair blame. And last but certainly not least or very least is the acting duo ? of Spade and Schneider. They are so bad that they make the acting in Troll 2 look Oscar worthy. Both should have to give up their SAG cards for this. I want to vomit just thinking of their acting again. They are worse then amateurs. I think both of them must be hiding a dark secret of Sandlers otherwise why are they here. I have an idea for Adam Sandler's next movie. Please call it Train Wreck. This way when it is released no one will be surprised when it sucks.";

You can literally just erase main characters from this movie and it wouldn't affect the proceedings at all. Honestly what does Chris Rock get to do in this movie? Can't remember a single one of his lines really. The movie never really works up to a point the characters have no goals they just exist and you sit there and accept it. I really wish I could say something nice about this movie but seriously even Steve Buscemi is bad in it. A bad Steve Buscemi. How do you do that? Very tiresome witless comedy.".

From hikes to swims to paper cup phones this crowd is discovering what is important right? It would be impossible not to laugh at the good moments of this film which seems like a long improvisation by these experts of comedy. There are some great lines and funny situations certainly. No its probably not the most memorable film of the year but if a feelgood experience is needed this one should fit the bill. The cast is stellar with all of the major actors doing fine and funny work. For the most part too they seem to work as an ensemble passing around the catch phrases nearly equally.

Hayek Maria Bello Maya Rudolph and Joyce Van Patten as the leading ladies support the men nicely. The scenery from the lovely wooded home to the riverfront is a joy and the costumes camerawork script and direction are above average as well. Yes some of the humor is not appropriate for younger children so parents need to be cautious. Nevertheless if you like Sandler James Rock etc andor you would welcome a chance to laugh with your loved ones ante up and go see this flick soon.".

I was wrong. Dead wrong.The plot in itself is about as thin as you can get. I don't want to get into trouble on IMDb for posting spoilers but there is really nothing to spoil about this movie because there really is no plot to it. It's really nothing more than just a bunch of random 'jokes' thrown together for a few cheap laughs. What can you expect out of an Adam Sandler film but at least Happy Gilmore Billy Madison Click and Big Daddy were tolerable. This film on the other hand is not.I will spoil one thing for you however. There is an obese black woman who is the mother of Chris Rock in this film. We get a nice little shot of bunion and callused feet as well as her habit of farting randomly. There are some jokes that rather fall flat such as jokes about homosexuality and socalled 'male bonding' and the film seems to insult today's 'tech savy' video game and texting children. Plenty of morbid dark humor such as making jokes at a funeral and spilling someone's cremated ashes into a bucket of KFC. There's also quite a bit of slapstick being shot in the foot with an arrow and toilet humor Peeing in swimming pools. Basically if you have an IQ of less than 45 andor you find jokes similar to the ones in movies like Big Momma's House and Are We There Yet? Grown Ups is the perfect film for you. But if you want more intelligent humor I suggest staying away from this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing a great Adam Sandler performance in Funny People. I was telling my friends how my opinion might have started to change with Sandler and that he does have a lot of potential to be a great actor. Then my friend dragged me to see Grown Up's Adam Sandler sent me back with this failure of a movie. My God my head hurts from this movie it's like Adam Sandler just sent his friends over to his vacation home and said Hey! See those camera's? Let's act like idiots for 2 hours and make millions of dollars by releasing the footage as a movie! heck for a few million dollars I would just film how my friends and I act if I was guaranteed good money for it. Adam Sandler wrote this script exactly for his own ego his character is successful a great basketball player a wonderful father a kind man married to Selma Hayek rich loving funny do you get the point yet? This is one of the laziest and most hurtful movies I have seen this year and is a shame to the word comedy.Lenny is a Hollywood agent married to Roxanne Eric is married to Donna Kurt is a stay at home father and is married to Deanna and Rob is married to Gloria despite the fact that Gloria is 30 years older then him. Lenny gets the news that their old basketball coach that led them to their one and only championships has had a heart attack and dies he contacts all the guys to see how things are going and to tell the about the news. The five men along with their families come to their hometown for the funeral. The families go to Lenny's lake house for the weekend and reminisce about the good old days. Lenny is constantly insulted by the guys making fun of him because he is a ugly Hollywood agent. They make fun of Rob's wife they make fun of Eric's obesity and breast feeding wife they make fun of Kurt being Mr. Mom they make fun of their single alcoholic party friend Marcus. Lenny and Eric then take their kids to the water park only to be mocked by the team they beat in the championship leading to another pointless game they for some odd reason haven't gotten over the win that was how many years prior? Throw in some random family oriented problems that they skim over and that's how we get in Grown Up's.I had maybe three small laughs during this film mainly coming from Steve Buscemi's performance. But seriously the hurtful jokes were a bit much they kept making fun of Kevin James' weight Chris Rock's pride in being a stay at home dad Rob Schneider's older wife. I can see one joke about it but they constantly go on and on making it ridicules and also makes you wonder how these guys are friends because my friends and I give each other a hard time but not to the extent where it's almost 247. Then Sandler trying to throw in family oriented drama or love was so forced that it made me sick. He starts to have a little tiff with his wife and it's passed over within a second making it completely pointless. This film was a waste of talent and money it makes you wonder how these guys are real comedians that get a paycheck. Don't waste your money on this movie like I did if you really wanted to see it get together with your friends for a weekend and goof on each other you saved 9 bucks. This was just a bad movie.210".

Lenny and Eric then take their kids to the water park only to be mocked by the team they beat in the championship leading to another pointless game they for some odd reason haven't gotten over the win that was how many years prior? Throw in some random family oriented problems that they skim over and that's how we get in Grown Up's.I had maybe three small laughs during this film mainly coming from Steve Buscemi's performance. But seriously the hurtful jokes were a bit much they kept making fun of Kevin James' weight Chris Rock's pride in being a stay at home dad Rob Schneider's older wife. I can see one joke about it but they constantly go on and on making it ridicules and also makes you wonder how these guys are friends because my friends and I give each other a hard time but not to the extent where it's almost 247. Then Sandler trying to throw in family oriented drama or love was so forced that it made me sick. He starts to have a little tiff with his wife and it's passed over within a second making it completely pointless. This film was a waste of talent and money it makes you wonder how these guys are real comedians that get a paycheck. Don't waste your money on this movie like I did if you really wanted to see it get together with your friends for a weekend and goof on each other you saved 9 bucks. This was just a bad movie.210";

It also has that bythenumbers pattern of raunchy humor thrown in with some childish jokes and then the inevitable feel good vibe. In Grown Up's defense that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so clich that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. Grown Ups revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. Yep that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paperthin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good and everything that's good about this movie it's bad. Although I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually the characters are pretty likable but still are pretty twodimensional. Moreover this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous but it sure does have some slightly funny times. Now onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the payoff was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. sigh. Moreover I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a bythenumbers plot typical performances and a beentheredonethat tone then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.Overall Grown Ups could possibly win the award for the most clich Hollywood film of the century although surprisingly that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry but they just want to give the audience a fun outing which they do but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad but it's just so formulaic and been theredonethat that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matine. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.".

This is also the premise of his new film. This film was no doubt a situation where I'm sure these friends had more fun shooting it than what we get in return. An absolute abysmal film and largely a comedy that perhaps 15 years ago might have had some better Sandler moments. Here these guys look tired and old and are not honing their comedic craft. Compare this comedy to the newest ones we have been given in the last several years. 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked up Forgetting Sarah Marshall to name a few. Sandler's crew do nothing to accommodate where we are going in terms of humor nor where we have been. I'd beg for my hour and a half back but it probably took Rob Schneider more than 6 months to film. And that just seems mean.".

This is also the premise of his new film. This film was no doubt a situation where I'm sure these friends had more fun shooting it than what we get in return. An absolute abysmal film and largely a comedy that perhaps 15 years ago might have had some better Sandler moments. Here these guys look tired and old and are not honing their comedic craft. Compare this comedy to the newest ones we have been given in the last several years. 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked up Forgetting Sarah Marshall to name a few. Sandler's crew do nothing to accommodate where we are going in terms of humor nor where we have been. I'd beg for my hour and a half back but it probably took Rob Schneider more than 6 months to film. And that just seems mean.";

I did like how it looked the locations and scenery are very nice and the editing and photography were also better than expected. The soundtrack was decent too and I did like the first 1015 minutes or so. I didn't like the acting much but there is one actor who clearly puts gusto into his performance and that's Kevin James.The rest of the cast range from adequate to below par not helped by their uniformly shallow and unlikeable characters. Adam Sandler is irritating Chris Rock underplays Salma Hayek's acting is very forced often Rob Schneider overplays and David Spade is rather limited and goes through the motions. The direction is not awful but far from great most of it is unexceptional while having the occasional flash of decency. The pace is uneven some of the comedy scenes feel rushed and the more sentimental scenes feel pedestrian.What spoils Grown Ups is the writing and story. The writing is pretty much awful with clichd and stale jokes and dialogue that made me groan rather than laugh. And then there's the story which was very thin and predictable on the whole with the comedy scenes rather forced and the sentimental scenes rather mawkish. All in all not a complete travesty but rather lazy and didn't do much for me. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " An awesomely fun and twisted little fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite enjoying other films like it I was never a fan of James Gunn's Slither. It just came off as being average to me and despite multiple tries I have never ventured back to give it a second chance. Keeping that in mind I ventured into a screening of Super at the Toronto International Film Festival hoping to be surprised and not to come away disappointed. Thankfully it turned out to be quite the awesome surprise.Frank D'Arbo Rainn Wilson lives a pretty miserable existence. He has just two happy memories in his entire life  marrying his wife Sarah Liv Tyler and pointing a police officer in the right direction of a suspect. So when Sarah a stripper and former junkie leaves him for her boss Jacques Kevin Bacon he loses all faith. But during a chance epiphany he realizes his true calling is to be a superhero  the Crimson Bolt  and fight against those committing any sort of crime whether it be drug dealing underage rape or even butting inline at the movies.While I figured the film would have a hurdle to face making it feel different than any other movie about ordinary people donning costumes and fighting crime in the past few years alone see Special Defendor KickAss and to a point even Batman Begins and The Dark Knight but Super is a much different beast. From the epilogue through the totally ridiculous in a good way animated song and dance credit sequence on you know you are in for something different. This is a film that embraces the absurd and the fullblown psychopathic and delivers a twistedly hilarious comic gem that lacks the seriousness mostly that plagues the other films previously mentioned. And any movie about someone using a pipewrench to wreak havoc on crime is immediately enough to make me forget Defendor even existed.I think the element that sets Gunn's twisted fantasy apart from other films is that it is decidedly not mainstream. D'Arbo truly becomes the superhero we all wish we were by taking out anyone who is committing crimes. He has the vendetta against Jacques taking his wife hanging over his head throughout the movie but in the meantime he ensures that no crime goes unpunished  in increasingly graphically violent ways. I knew that using a pipewrench could only lead to a bloody mess but I did not expect the movie to become the nasty bloodbath it quickly does. If you remember being disappointed at how much blood got cut between the conversion of KickAss from a comic to a film you will be delighted at just how much is spilt here. I knew Gunn was a graduate of the Troma film academy Lloyd Kaufman makes a cameo late in the film but I never expected to see just as much violence as I did. Thankfully every injury and blood spurt is more hilarious and ridiculous than the last.Wilson is amazing from start to finish as D'Arbo. I have never been a fan of his zany humour but it fits this role perfectly. He jumps from being the pathetic loser to being the invigorated crime fighter with ease. And despite playing the role seriously you never once think he is descending into parody. The film is a parody but he never hams it up in the role deliberately looking for laughs. He has a very strong comic presence that he maintains throughout the film and brings a rather poignant touch to more than a few scenes. If he sticks to more roles like these and stays away from being the best thing in downright awful movies like The Rocker and My Super ExGirlfriend he might have quite the career ahead of him.The supporting cast is all very good and very funny in their smaller roles. Bacon is just as good as he always is injecting the right amount of style and finesse into his scumbag of a character. Tyler could have done a bit more as the damsel in distress but she remains quite memorable in her role. Smaller turns by Gregg Henry Michael Rooker and especially Nathan Fillion all pay off wonderfully within the film. But if anyone can even stand close to Wilson's performance it is Ellen Page as the offtherails comic nerd Libby. While she has found fame playing Juno and derivatives of the same character in the majority of her roles she actually is quite different here. She alternates between being anxietyridden and being a complete psychopath often in the same scene and practically steals the film from Wilson. And when she finally becomes his sidekick Boltie she truly is able to embrace the absurd.If I have any problem with the film outside of a rather bizarre and horrendous looking CGI sequence early in the film it is that it never stays consistent with its tones. The humour remains intact throughout but its absurdity starts to waver as the film goes on. It remains ridiculous but it becomes a bit too serious in some sections. It feels more like Gunn did not want to truly push the film into the realm of comic fantasy and still wanted some semblance of realism to stay within the film. He explained his tonal shift choices to the audience but it still is not enough to make up for the film never knowing which way it wants to go. I loved its unpredictability of what D'Arbo would do next but loathed never knowing what the next shift would be. It never destroys the film but it weakens the film cohesively.Super is an awesome film and one whose dark humour never truly overtakes it. Wilson and Page are amazing in their roles and the rest of the supporting cast does a great job backing them up. I just hope everyone can experience and have as much fun as I did.910.".

	schema:headline " Super is super realistic...and super dark";
	schema:reviewBody "With a recent emergence of superhero movies aiming to be grittier and more realistic Super is arguably the most accurate portrayal of what would happen if someone without powers or insane amounts of money decided to be a superhero. It would require a strict devotion to doing what YOU believe is right. There is of course almost always a level of ambiguity among superhero stories. Batman is considered by some to be a menace who if ever caught would most likely be charged with assault and breaking and entering among other offenses. But he decides to be a vigilante because he sees injustice and wishes to fight it. He believes that what he is doing is right. Similarly Rainn Wilson's character Frank becomes tired of standing idly by after his wife Sarah portrayed by Liv Tyler is taken away by the slick and dangerous Jacques played by Kevin Bacon. Frank intends to get his wife back and stop crime in his neighborhood. But as soon as Frank dons a costume and a monkey wrench as his weapon of choice his mental wellbeing quickly comes into question. After all what kind of person would strike someone in the head with a wrench thus sending him to the ICU for cutting in line at the movies? Is he psychotic? Is he deluded? Frank argues that it's actually everyone else who is deluded. What if we're the ones with a problem. After all most of us witness the injustices and evils of this world and simply accept them as facts of life. We tell ourselves that nothing can be done about them and continue with our lives. Frank however knows what is right even if that truth is only in his heart. The film earns it's R rating with massive amounts of graphic violence and a particularly strange sex scene. While KickAss already tackled similar subject matter Super takes a different approach. While HitGirl had weapons and combat training Frank a.k.a. The Crimson Bolt and Libby a.k.a. Boltie Ellen Page have no experience at all and have nothing but rage and a penchant for violence to help them stop the bad guys. Additionally Super begs the questions Are the protagonists defenders of justice or psychopathic killers? Can they be both? While KickAss had Joan Jett's Bad Reputation playing during HitGirl's butchering of a group of criminals Super doesn't always portray our heroes' actions in such a cheery light. In order to save Frank's wife The Crimson Bolt and Boltie need to be murders. They don't have the money or skill to develop sophisticated weaponry that will incapacitate their opponents. They don't have that luxury. They will gather whatever crude weapons they have in order to exact justice on those who escape the law. And if that makes them crazy then so be it.".

	schema:reviewBody "On 2nd April 2002 a 50 page script originally written as a short born from the creatively messed up mind of James Gunn flourished into the world. Entitled 'SUPER' deliberately all in capitals the film was destined to be a personal homage to the early comicbooks Gunn had grown up with as a child combined with the sincerely twisted Troma films he had worked on whilst first touching down in the movie business. What remains today 8 years later is both a darkly sarcastic tale of personal justice and a horrifically funny look at the everyman melting together to form a rather obscure and perversely convoluted masterpiece of independent cinema.Destined to be likened to the recent features of late such as Matthew Vaughn's 'KickAss' 'SUPER' stands alone successful in its conquest to both alienate the viewer and twist their perceptions of justice and doing the right thing. Whereas 'KickAss' longed to be gritty and satanic in its approach it only appeared so through the hazy goggles of Hollywood never fully commanding the realistic ambiance that sits so gracefully at the centre of 'SUPER'. Gunn's unique and devoutly crooked approach is so confident and gracious in its presentation everyshot though tremendously rough settles calmly into the film reflecting Darbo's genuine feelings that he's not actually doing anything wrong. The film although simple in its setup truly digs in under the skin of what is right and wrong and who decides toying with religion and depression and other serious affairs along the way whilst also juggling sociopathic violent outbursts and superbly perverted comedy.Although fantastically scripted the heart of 'SUPER' belongs to the frankly outstanding cast. Rainn Wilson's astounding central performance as mopey Frank and his demented alterego frantically shakes the viewer throughout tearing the words directly from the page with emotional and personal flair allowing him to be both despondently bitter and broken as well as painfully hilarious at exactly the same time. Strong support is held up by Kevin Bacon's interesting villain Jacques as suavely bold and sophisticated as modern drug dealers come with his team of bumbling accomplices making troublingly comic targets. Liv Tyler drifts sweetly and innocently into the backdrop of Frank's crusade as his angelic wife Sarah but the showstealing Ellen Page dives straight in front as the sadistically adorable Libby later becoming Darbo's sidekick Boltie. Her fearlessly pushy and exaggerated enthusiasm for bloody violence is both utterly hysterical and painfully sinister although never drifting to the darkside of the audience's perception despite her adversely psychotic attacks on crime. Even the cameos from the likes of 'Slither' star Nathan Fillion among others are marvellously acted and well placed providing constant hilarity for Gunn fans and others alike.Due to the tiny budget roughly 2 million and limited shooting schedule visually 'SUPER' can be noticed to be rather dim in places luckily salvaged by the hauntingly humorous use of onomatopoeic graphics Bam Boom Splat etc. and truly fragrant soundtrack in particular Tyler Bates' chirpy yet thoughtful scoring.Viciously funny sadistically adorable and hilariously heartfelt 'SUPER' is bound to be one of the most original unique and darkly comic films you will ever have the privilege to lay eyes on. It won't be to everybody's taste some welcoming the extreme violence and sickening comedy others not but it will certainly open up your mind to look beyond the face value of justice and is sure to blur your perceptions of right and wrong beyond recognition.What exists beyond the colourful spandex and bloody smears is a truly heartwrenching and unpredictably grim portrait of the 21st century peppered with love and laughter making 'SUPER' the most beautifully honest and ambitiously passionate vigilante tale to ever grace the eyes of the public. Treat it with care and a thoughtful mind this is not your average gore fest 'SUPER' is an engrossingly real and overlooked gem so original yet commemorative in its approach. Rubbing shoulders with the heavyweight blockbusters of 2011 won't allow it to fare well financially but 'SUPER' is a fresh and poignant escape from the dark depths of the Hollywood explosionfest and should be endured by all those who seek excellent filmmaking. Shut up crime!".

	schema:headline " An engaging and challenging masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "The single solitary downfall of this movie is that it completely disregards expectations but I'm pretty sure it couldn't have been done any other way. How do you advertise for a movie that is a perfect mix of drama comedy tragedy thriller parody and characterbased gorefest? How do you tell the uninformed moviegoer that what they're about to see is going to challenge them in ways that a superhero movie could never be expected to? The answer You don't. James Gunn invests a lot of confidence in his audience with this film because he knows it has to be seen and he knows it is great but is risking everything just by the mere fact that he made it. People will go into this movie expecting a comedy about a silly downtoEarth superhero and for the first half hour or 45 minutes they'll be confused about why some really serious themes keep popping up. Then when all hell breaks loose and the jokes slow to a halt they'll be wondering if they should have been laughing at the first half of the movie. But is that the movie's fault? If you walked in to watch Romeo and Juliet expecting a romantic comedy the same thing could happen. You'd laugh at the cheesy dialogue at the squabbling houses but after a while you'd start to wonder. And at the end well you'd feel that you'd been duped. Myself walking into the empty theater at 1000pm having researched the movie obsessed over it and prepared myself for anything well I was blown away. Even though I built this movie up on a pedestal of monstrous heights I was still pleasantly surprised and left the movie with my heart beating in my throat. One review is not enough space to discuss just why this movie is so great. People could analyze it in groups like they do with Citizen Kane and I think they'd have a good chance of missing something. I only wish to say that I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a thinking moviegoer or appreciates art in all of its forms. This movie deserves to make a billion dollars and hopefully it blows up and gets its just deserves. Bring everyone you know and support this underrated masterpiece.".

He's obviously not happy where his life is and he can't seem to be as normal as your typical everyday guy. His wife Sara Liv Tyler who normally wouldn't be caught seen with Frank just basically married him because of her troubled life. Then one day Sara just packs up and leaves and Frank just can't get over her. He tries to get her back from the evil Kevin Bacon but to no success. So one day he has a revelation and decides to dress as a superhero named Crimson Bolt in efforts to find meaning in his life. A friend of his named Libby Ellen Page volunteers to be his sidekick known as Volty and together the two of them work together to save Sara from the evil Kevin Bacon.All I can say is that this isn't a happy movie. Our two protagonists cause more crime themselves than the good of society and they really don't seem to get too much credit in their efforts to shut up crime. In the end when they decide to get Sara back comes a situation I never saw coming. This is the first time in a long time where a twist in the story was totally unexpected and I applaud the filmmakers for making me surprised. That rarely happens.There's also an attraction between Libby and Frank. However Frank is so bent on being with his wife that he turns down Libby's efforts. I really wanted him to just forget his wife and pursue a life with Libby. He might even be more happy. Does he? Well I won't spoil that.Super is a good movie but very dark. I was glad I was able to catch it. It's definitely not a feel good movie and again I could totally relate to the main protagonist. It makes me wonder if there is a little Super in all of us.".

	schema:reviewBody "The superhero film craze has led to a lot of ordinary main characters taking justice into their own hands. In that sense nothing will strike you as original about Super the latest film from James Gunn Slither and one made on a shoestring budget. Rainn Wilson stars as Frank a man who loses his cool when a drug kingpin Kevin Bacon steals away his wife Liv Tyler. After having a vision in which his brain is quite literally touched by the finger of God Frank decides to create his own superhero the Crimson Bolt a force against all that is evil in the world or at least the small town he lives in.Much like last year's KickAss which reexamined superhero tropes using unlikely and subversive heroes Super specializes in being deliberately perverse and relishes in the violation of genre expectation. James Gunn's film is foul hilarious real and campy all at different times. The film's disapproving critics will undoubtedly argue that downtoearth characters and a gritty context cannot coexist with excessive comical violence. Gunn likely believes that these two universes can be reconciled into one film but nevertheless the film delivers roaring entertainment with surprising moments of poignancy despite being a complete brainscrambler.Super begins like a typical narrated indie comedy. It portrays Frank as a bit of a dreamer a slightly unrealistic person with a slight but charming navet. He finds oddly religious sources of inspiration to become a hero such as the Holy Avenger Nathan Fillion a madeup TV superhero used to promote Christian messages to children. Although Gunn brings Frank's overactive imagination to life the film stays grounded in its real person seriously considers being a superhero concept. As Frank's world comes crashing down we develop a definitive sense of pity and support his revenge fantasy. Then Gunn blows the lid open.First off the Crimson Bolt's weapon of choice is a pipe wrench. It seems goofy and kind of silly at first but then he's actually bashing people over the head with a pipe wrench until they're bleeding andor unconscious. Eventually sweet lovable frank becomes a morally ambiguous hero especially after he decides to teach the guy who butted in line at the movie theater a thing or two. This certainly makes Super a more complicated film but it also creates a definite discomfort. Enter Ellen Page as the overzealous comic book shop girl who inserts herself into the equation as Frank's kid sidekick Boltie. She not only attempts to seduce Frank but she has an even more unrealistic notion of the violence she seeks to create. Together they serve as a catalyst for the black comedy elements and the campy gore.Both Wilson and Page push themselves in positive ways with their roles. Page leaves her dry wit comfort zone for some outrageous antics and Wilson shows some range with Frank's emotional side. Their radically different notions of what being a superhero is about leads to great hilarity and disturbing conflict.Gunn chooses to sacrifice communicating the great depth of these characters by violating viewer expectation with the violence. Some of the gore stays realistic but uncomfortable while other deaths go over the top. The inconsistencies jar the tone of the film and suggest to the audience that they should take the film more or less seriously depending. It can become very difficult to remain engaged in the character subplots and the script's other strengths with this distraction. The other issue is the lack of realism with Frank being able to pull of his superhero. He drives around with his own license plates for example and does a terrible job of concealing his identity. For a film that chooses to create downtoearth characters it becomes a bit hypocritical to ignore obvious truths.Yet the fun the humor the strength of character and the way Gunn challenges thematic notions raised by most superhero films definitely elevates Super in a way that suggests its future will be as cult favorite as opposed to lauded superhero spoof. The way it toys so carelessly with realism and cartoony realism makes the ride a bit bumpy but judging it purely on entertainment value it's a hilariously good time. One simply must be able to reconcile its various genre elements in order to remain engaged in Gunn's unique and wellintentioned story that deconstructs our previously unquestioned love of superheroes.Steven C".

Massive special effects dulled further by stale stories in another installment of give us your money please. Today we are also starting to get more of the average man superheroes such as KickAss which as described by friends who were able to see Super in theaters is similar. Well having been able to see it for the first time I have to disagree whole heartedly. Super is unique. Super is more real while still holding true to some of the ridiculous that makes superhero movies enjoyable. I didn't know what to think of Rainn Wilson as the lead at first. After seeing Super i'm sold. Ellen Page well she was a riot to watch go insane with blood lust. While the plot is fairly basic it's interesting to see how attached to characters one can get through proper camera work and good acting. I didn't like the baddie and I rooted for the good guys. Go figure right? In a strange sense and this is just something I pulled from the film not saying it's intended or really even shown I see this film taking another road. Root for the good guys because they're who you want to win. Boo the villains because they are holding the hero back. Well what's holding the good guy back is the fact that they aren't really all that good to begin with. I'd say bashing a guys face for cutting in line is pretty apparent. But point being is that in all of us is the perspective that we are the good and only through a looking glass self can we understand that while we may consider ourselves better we may not be as far off from the villains as we thought. Boil it down Super is a good film thats highly entertaining to open minded people. Come in with preconceptions and you may be disappointed. Come in willing to go along for the ride well i think you'll be very happy to watch Super.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. Like this reviewer a small fraction of the audience will find themselves in between. The general public will either love this or hate it depending on their expectations in comparing this movie to KickAss and it will always be compared with KickAss. Both films are about ordinary people donning costumes to fight crime. However this is where the comparison ends. Written and directed by James Gunn this is not a movie for just anyone. Keeping in mind his Dawn of the Dead and Slither it becomes evident that Gunn has intended for this movie to target a specific segment of the movie going populace specifically those who enjoy very dark humor.A cook by profession Frank D'Arbo Rainn Wilson is sad man with a depressing past and a feeble excuse of an existence. His greatest moments in life is marrying a recovering drug addict Sarah Liv Tyler and helping a cop catch a purse snatcher. These events are so overwhelming that Frank even symbolizes its meaning through crayon sketches. Then things turn sour again. Sarah relapses into drug addiction and even leaves Frank for Jacques Kevin Bacon her drug dealer. Attempts to get his wife back results in insults and beatings until the day Frank has an epiphany. Having realized that the only way to recuperate his wife is to punish drug pushers Frank becomes a furious vigilante and soon gains media attention as The Crimson Bolt.As an independent production Super has its moments as a believable and funny film with some good acting by the likes of some top actors. Although the plot acting and twisted humor are the highlights of the film it never comes together as a whole. Like KickAss the story pits average Joes as superheroes but without super powers. But unlike the aforementioned film the vigilantes here are almost psychopathic. And yes there is more than one. Last seen together in Juno Ellen Page joins Frank as Boltie a sensuous sidekick bordering on lunacy. Together they are more dangerous than the sleaziest of dark alley crooks. As actors both D'Arbo and Page are scary funny and insane. In opposing roles are Kevin Bacon and Michael Rooker as his sidekick. Bacon is the same as in all his antagonistic roles 80 threat and 20  deed. My biggest disappointment is the underplayed role of Liv Tyler. Gorgeous as she is Tyler's role and character is a negligible two pennies worth that could have been done without.Coming back to Gunn and his attempt in making an offbeat albeit dark comedy I can say his approach is acceptable in starting an offshoot in the superhero genre. By his words there are thousands of bank heist movies so why not a few movies about superheroes without super powers.If you haven't seen KickAss I would suggest you watch that film first. If by then you are ready for some inyourface violence literally a twisted and absurdly dark plot with a questionable conclusion then and only then would I suggest you try this movie. But don't say you weren't warned. In not calling it tasteless this film does have a certain odd taste to it. It's like curiously savoring a mediumrare steak and then wondering halfway what if the meat is human flesh!?!".

He provides a muchneeded credibility to this film...it's hard to put it any other way. I wanted more of him.And of course there's Nathon Fillion. He's only in the movie about 2 minutes or so but while he's on it's wonderful.

But the man deserves high praise for his performance as the jilted loverturned amateur superhero in Super  a movie that having not known what to make of the trailers turned out to be a pleasant surprise indeed.Wilson's seemingly fairytale marriage shatters when his recovering addict wife Liv Tyler runs out of the house and into the arms of drugdealing Kevin Bacon.

Page joins the unlikely enterprise as his overzealous sidekick and the duo arm themselves to the teeth and take the fight to Casa de Bacon.Wilson is impressive as the deeply conflicted Christian who finds himself doling out some seriously violent street justice. It's at times goofy role but nothing like his signature goofiness on The Office no mean feat. Page is vshe's very likable here. And Bacon brings a hilarious detachment to the asshat dealer making it a almost ironic performance.I'm pretty sure this movie contains the funniest asskicking montage I've ever seen. The early days of The Crimson Bolt's crimefighting career are spent smacking guys in the head with a wrench ... and more often than not just running away. That's his shtick. Naturally the character becomes more earnest as time wears on adopting an almost Batmanlike intensity in his punishment approach and the movie as a whole follows this trajectory as the oncelighthearted and silly premise becomes ever more serious and violent.What began as a dark comedy eventually dims all the way to black and increasingly brutal. But out of the death and destruction emerges an end result that manages to be sweet and dare I say poignant.710".

	schema:headline " As disturbing as Hell and constantly challenges the viewer!";
	schema:reviewBody "'SUPER' Four and a Half Stars Out of Five Another average guy superhero movie this one is from writerdirector James Gunn and stars Rainn Wilson. Gunn is a former employee of the low budget independent film production company Troma Entertainment which he wrote and codirected his first film for the critically acclaimed 'TROMEO AND JULIET'. He also wrote and directed the horror satire film 'SLITHER' and wrote the screenplay to the 2004 remake of 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'. 'SUPER' is done in much the same style as Gunn's earlier work and has a definite slightly bigger budget 'Troma' feel to it. I can see a lot of heavy inspiration from 'Troma's' most famous film 'THE TOXIC AVENGER'. It's been compared a great deal to last year's popular 'KICKASS' film because of it's similar themes and even called a ripoff by some but in fact Gunn was writing his screenplay at the same time that Mark Millar was writing the original 'KICKASS' comics. I have to say I saw a lot of similarities between the two films but they definitely have their own unique styles as well. While 'SUPER' is not quite as great a film as 'KICKASS' it's still an impressive 'kickass' film all it's own.Wilson was cast as the lead in the film due to a suggestion from Gunn's exwife and Wilson's 'OFFICE' costar Jenna Fischer. Wilson than sought out buddy Ellen Page whom he had worked with on 'JUNO' as his costar for the film. In the movie he plays a lonely and nerdy cook named Frank D'Arbo who led a pretty uneventful life until a beautiful waitress named Sarah Liv Tyler fell for him and married him. Sarah was a recovering drug addict and saw Frank as someone she could basically just use to help her feel better. When she falls into addiction again and leaves Frank for a local strip club owner named Jacques Kevin Bacon Frank falls into depression again and finds inspiration in the form of a religious superhero kid's character on TV played by Nathan Fillion. Frank then has a vision he believes to be from God and decides he needs to become a masked avenger and win Sarah back. He gets advice from of a local comic book shop clerk named Libby Page.The film is very dark and increasingly violent. It's as disturbing as Hell and constantly challenges the viewer you want to like Frank as well as Libby but the things the characters do continuously press the boundaries of normal moral behavior far beyond normal. At the same time the movie continues to try to make you feel sympathy for the characters and oddly relate to them so the film is constantly hard to process and stomach. It's very gross and explicit at times including a very weird rape scene of a young woman raping a man much bigger than her. The film is also very funny and thrilling at times as well as oddly dramatic. It's a complete mixed bag of entertainment and feelings. I really admire a film like this that seriously takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride and never leaves you knowing how to feel. It of course has a lot of similarities to other similar themed films but it's also completely unique in it's own way and without a doubt unforgettable. Hats off to Gunn once again! Wilson is great like always and plays a little against type and Page is a stand out. It's nice to see Corvallis's Darkside Cinemas breaking the norm and getting unique genre films like this for a change. People should definitely go out and support it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vvqvCRlRn7qY".

In the movie he plays a lonely and nerdy cook named Frank D'Arbo who led a pretty uneventful life until a beautiful waitress named Sarah Liv Tyler fell for him and married him. Sarah was a recovering drug addict and saw Frank as someone she could basically just use to help her feel better. When she falls into addiction again and leaves Frank for a local strip club owner named Jacques Kevin Bacon Frank falls into depression again and finds inspiration in the form of a religious superhero kid's character on TV played by Nathan Fillion. Frank then has a vision he believes to be from God and decides he needs to become a masked avenger and win Sarah back. He gets advice from of a local comic book shop clerk named Libby Page.The film is very dark and increasingly violent. It's as disturbing as Hell and constantly challenges the viewer you want to like Frank as well as Libby but the things the characters do continuously press the boundaries of normal moral behavior far beyond normal. At the same time the movie continues to try to make you feel sympathy for the characters and oddly relate to them so the film is constantly hard to process and stomach. It's very gross and explicit at times including a very weird rape scene of a young woman raping a man much bigger than her. The film is also very funny and thrilling at times as well as oddly dramatic. It's a complete mixed bag of entertainment and feelings. I really admire a film like this that seriously takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride and never leaves you knowing how to feel. It of course has a lot of similarities to other similar themed films but it's also completely unique in it's own way and without a doubt unforgettable. Hats off to Gunn once again! Wilson is great like always and plays a little against type and Page is a stand out. It's nice to see Corvallis's Darkside Cinemas breaking the norm and getting unique genre films like this for a change. People should definitely go out and support it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vvqvCRlRn7qY";

	schema:reviewBody "First let me start off by saying that at first glance Super looks very similar to Kick Ass and I've read many reviews on here with people calling this film a Kick Ass rip off IT IS NOT! In fact Super is nothing like Kick Ass the only common thing they share is one ordinary person becoming a super hero you could say that kick Ass rips off such works as Batman or Green Lantern. An normal person suddenly becoming extraordinary isn't a new concept that Kick Ass invented and Super does not rip off that film in anyway but I'm going to stop talking about this and get to the film itself. The trailer for this film did not show what this film was really about this is not a light hearted comedy about real life superheroes instead it's much more adult. This film is about a troubled man that has never really known true happiness in his life and suffers an ultimate blow when he looses his wife. This pushes him over the edge and eventually through a series of bizarre signs and a very disturbing vision decides to become a superhero. This is about a man who could well be close to becoming a serial killer but his victims are people who commit crimes. He doesn't intended to kill them but his attacks are so brutal that they could lead to death and he seems to have no intent in puling his punches per say. Like wise his sidekick played by the talented Ellen Page is also a border line psychopath who is overall feisty and eager. Her character is just plane insane and without Frank would have become a crazed killer in a costume. I enjoyed her character very much I thought she was very funny and I loved her crazed psycho personality. I admire how this film is shot there's a lot of handheld or steady cam shots and it gives the whole film a very documentary feel and it adds to the sense of realism that this film is about. This documentary realism feel is something that I personally think Kick Ass would have been better with this feel works so well when action sequences take place or violent scenes occur because it makes them so much more tense and brutal. The comedy in this is well placed dark and disturbing at times and I found myself in some scenes laughing at how disturbing these scene were not one to show the kids. I have nothing against any of the acting in this film I thought everyone was at their best suited their character the only character I had a problem with was Liv Tyler's character I couldn't understand what her character really wanted during the course of this film one moment she wants to give up drugs for good the next she's living with a crime lord who deals in drugs what is going on with her? I personally wish this film went on longer but that's just me. There were some really shocking moments in this film that really got a reaction from me and the ending at first left me feeling really sad inside but then afterwards it felt like the right one although I was disappointed with one aspect of it but I can't say without spoiling anything. In short if you had low expectations and haven't seen this watch it and leave your expectations at the door you will not be disappointed unfortunately this isn't one of those films that I can share as some people will be put off by the odd and disturbing scenes but keeping in mind this is not a Kick Ass rip off this is a unique film all on it's own.".

Not as comic booky or teenoriented as KickAss not as serious and ultimately tragic as Defendor but with action violence and drama to rival either.Rainn Wilson is perfectly cast for the role of the inept possibly delusional losercomesuperhero while Ellen Page is a great turn as a comic book store clerk who is wayway and I mean way too excited about becoming the sidekick. Liv Tyler spends most of the time whispering confused and high I think they probably just carted her out of her trailer to the set and had her be herself. And Kevin Bacon makes a great villain team with the underrated Michael Rooker.The film maintains a rather desperate atmosphere with highlights of giddiness which sets up both compelling drama and naturalfeeling humor falling somewhere in the middle of its two most recent genre entries.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had promise. The first hour give or take had enough going for it to keep me involved. It is quirky. From the handheld camera work to the low tech animation and effects I was in. The violence is over the top and unrealistic which works in this movie for that first hour. In the last part the writers veer off course and it feels like a bait and switch. This viewer was left confused and feeling like I had to not only catch up to what they were doing but to completely reevaluate these characters. Rainn Wilson is able to create a sympathetic if eccentric character in Frank. He sells the dramatic parts as well as the comedy. There are some truly laughoutloud parts in that first hour. Frustratingly something happens to the story at a certain point. It has been described as dark. I would say it was offensive. When the movie is being absurd I can buy in. When it tries to take me from absurd to a more real place I cannot. In that last half hour though there are two different scenes that depict very devastating events in a very realistic manner within minutes of one another. Neither of which was essential to the story. The movie lost me there.The actors put a lot into this movie and they are all watchable. Nathan Fillion and Linda Cardellini are wasted as their collective parts last about 3 or 4 minutes. They shine when either is on the screen. Kevin Bacon is fantastic and Liv Tyler does a nice job. I was happy to see Michael Rooker as well. It disappointed me that the writers appeared to have a thought toward giving his character some depth and then pulled the rug out from under him. I was able to assimilate Ellen Page's incredibly over the top portrayal of a wannabe sidekick even with her undesirable characteristics until it got too real. Overall this movie's message is simply not strong enough and seems to only act as bookends for the movie as a whole. The plot and events in between do not communicate that message and so it doesn't really pay off. This viewer was left feeling embarrassed for laughing at some of the earlier parts in light of the last half hour. Not a superhero genre movie and not strong enough to be a social commentary.".

It's more violent than the others and has laugh out loud moments but what exactly is the tone of this film? We know the plot. Frank Wilson becomes the Crimson Bolt after his wife Tyler is literally stolen by the druglord pimpish Jacques Bacon. After watching the corny bible action hero The Holy Avenger Fillion he goes on a quest to hide behind dumpsters and wait for some crime to happen. Equipped with a monkey wrench he eventually teams up with LibbyBoltie Page.At first this movie looks like a low budget version of the films announced in the beginning but as we progress into the movie our two heroes become more and more violent and literally insane especially Libby which was creepily played by Page. When it comes down to almost beating a man to death and even his annoying girlfriend for cutting in line the dark comedy really escalates. We ask the question Why are we rooting for these two? We should be labeling them as kind of pathetic or psychotic.It's nice to see Rain Wilson do a film like this. I didn't see Dwight from the office but a depressed man who simply wants his life back. Frank is very religious watching the Holy Avenger played brilliantly by Fillion  the few scenes he was in and tries to ask God what's his next step in life. We know that he was a geek in is younger years but how does he land Tyler  which is answered in the film.Page is a very underrated actress. She picks her roles wisely. Once in a while finding that blockbuster Inception but this film you know she wasn't paid much and same to the rest of the cast. But her character Libby is very innocent and that plays along well with the message that Gunn might be trying to establish. She's only twenty two. We don't know too much about her except she hangs out with a bunch of pot smokers. She doesn't seem to care about the direction she's going but just in the moment.I've never seen Slither. I hear it's also a dark comedy but the reviews are split in half usually asking the question What is Gunn trying to do in this movie? The unusual shift changes of comedy and drama has you wondering but those who can answer the question will probably end up enjoying this film. At first when I left the theater I was happy and upbeat. But during the hour and a half ride home  I believe I figured it out. I was actually kind of depressed that I did. Violence isn't something to laugh at but you can't help to in this film. Is this suppose to be a dark comedy? I didn't find Taxi Driver funny which seems to be a closer comparison than the list of films I mentioned.Check this little film out. 8.510 or B".

Frank convinced blindly that she was kidnapped takes on his super hero persona of the Crimson Bolt.He's out of his league at first but perfects his own style of justice in Gunn's typical comedic gory style.But I think the highlight of this film is in the crazy performance of Ellen Page as Libby a hyperactive crazy comic book store employee who joins Frank in his delusional holy war against crime as Boltie.At first going into this movie I was expecting the typical jokes that I loved in his first film but came out with something much more. Super starts off as a wacky misadventure for Frank only further pushed by Libby then in the final showdown it up and changes on you into a pretty sweet action flick with a almost sugary sweet emotional ending  I know that sounds crazy but this is one of the best movies this year I've seen combining all the elements of genres to make a really authentic piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank D'Arbo Rainn Wilson gets left by his drug addict wife Liv Tyler for a douchebag drug dealer that no one would ever date a wonderfully hammy Kevin Bacon. So for some reason D'Arbo decides to suit up and be a superhero to get her back. But then he spends most of the movie just fighting random crime that has nothing to do with his wife. It's cool though he ends up trying to get her in the end. James Gunn wants to focus on throwing his particular brand of outlandish grotesque humor at the audience like he so wonderfully did in Slither and his PG Porno internet series but then he tries to give the film heart and emotion. This is where it completely falters and the whole thing ends up feeling like a really cheap unevenly toned mess.I mean don't get me wrong there are some genuinely hilarious scenes and Ellen Page is an absolute delight in a role entirely different from anything she's done so far but the whole thing just feels off. Rainn Wilson is likable enough on The Office but the guy just can't carry an entire film by himself and the supporting cast feels like they belong in a whole separate movie. The entire thing feels like it has no focus and the motivations of characters jump all over the place never letting the viewer immerse themselves at all. One second our main character is all about getting his wife back then he's just fighting insignificant crime that means nothing to the actual story then he completely switches focus back to his wife. Just like the film itself the guy has no focus and despite some hilarious moments never gives the audience a good idea of what it actually is. It feels like something a couple of college kids threw together in a week and put online.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely do I see a film that I loathe with the degree of disgust that I normally reserve for politicians and Kevin Smith's films. Unfortunately I just saw James Gunn's 96minute train wreck Super.The trailer looked promising and I elected to see the film based on the cast involved Rainn Wilson Ellen Page Liv Tyler and Kevin Bacon. It turns out that trusting the cast to choose a worthy script was a BIG mistake.Not only does the film break every rule of a filmmakers checklist characters to root for a clear obstacle to overcome and a plot that makes sense...but the films hyperviolence comicbook captions realistic wounds and Ellen Page's rape scene are completely out of place and unmotivated. The film begins weakly drawing sympathy from a pathetic character who is cast aside by his indifferent and unhappy wife. For the next 90 minutes the film limps along as the actors deliver sterile forced and oftenwacky performances and eventually the action is pushed forward by the illconceived story.Frank Rainn Wilson the hero of the film with a lazy back story runs around the city wielding a pipe wrench and whacking some smalltime criminals on the head as well as a few innocent citizens. The police correctly denounce the vigilante known as the Crimson Bolt until his sidekick Boltie Ellen Page runs a bad guy over with a car allowing the Crimson Bolt to successfully murder his first victim. This forces the police to admit that ...he's only killing bad guys. Brilliant.The climax of the film consists of the dynamicduo raiding the house of evil drug dealer Jacques Kevin Bacon where Frank's wife Sarah Liv Tyler is being held hostage. They storm the castle tossing homemade bombs at bad guys Ellen Page gets her face blown off Kevin Bacon delivers one of the worst bad guy performances of all time and of course...the hero rescues the damsel in distress with his catchphrase Shut up crime! To thank her knight in shining armor she leaves him a few months later gets married has kids and Wilson finally gets a worthy companion...a rabbit.As if the script acting  direction weren't enough to make this one of the worst films ever the final sound mix  whose volume fluctuated like an 8yearold was playing with the remote  was the icing on the cake.I have a compulsion that once I start watching something I must finish it. By this curse alone I finished all 96 agonizinglylongminutes of this film. I felt insulted as a viewer but motivated as a new filmmaker if someone believed enough in this film to finance it photograph it act in it edit it and to top them all actually show it to the public....well then I should have no trouble making movies with at least as much success as this unwatchable swill.".

Unfortunately this movie doesn't provide enough substance to summarize anything so I'll skip this part.At first I want to express my astonishment how anybody could vote with more than one star for this movie. Oh I forgot... People who don't give a 9 or a 10 are just too stupid to understand the movie. The problem is just that neither I am stupid nor is there anything to understand. It is a just big pile of nonsense the plot the characters and their development just everything. I don't want to repeat everything that was already said by other reviewers who gave the movie a 1. They all pointed it out correctly already.No a movie isn't a masterpiece just because it is different or shows violence in an exaggerated way. I love movies that tell a story also in a different way. But not like this. As always there are those who think that they are so intellectual by liking this movie just because it is different making up all kinds of reasons to make them feel superior and special.I think the movie shows perfectly how screwed up and schizophrenic the North American society and filmmaking industry is. Violence is shown in a very graphic and gory way. But the sex scenes are just suggested. Why not going the whole nine yards then? For example why not showing graphically how Boltie is raping her hero with some real genitals and some real body fluids? Not that family movie style sex when Rainn Wilson still has his boxers on after they are finished not even having an erection? You can show how a head is half blown off but not the wonderful act of love and reproduction? You can show a completely stoned person and drug abuse but not making love? It is completely dishonest. Porn is bad!!! Violence is OK...! Yeah right... Sorry for being cynical.I don't need senseless violence to enjoy a movie that tells a good story. Same goes for sex in movies. It is just not necessary to show everything. Doing so doesn't change a bad movie into a good one and the other way around. And while I love good humor Violence is not funny! Period! People who think otherwise should see their doctors for further examination.This movie stole one and half hours of my life time and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The producer should be forced to pay compensation to all viewers. And the actors should be ashamed to have played in that movie if they were not forced at gunpoint.I better stop ranting. Just a quote of my wife as she hated the movie just as much as I did I always thought Ellen Page is a cool actress but now that I saw her in a really stupid movie like this I lost a lot of my respect for her!Amen.".

Nick loathes the thought of another mission but this seemingly easy job will earn him enough money to get back with his estranged family. He recruits some of his former mercenary buddies to help him with the job. The island people refuse to give up their land and Nick decides to help them fight the greedy corporation that hired him. The island and its people bring Nick back to life. He finally finds something worth fighting for and a place to call home.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this expecting a stupid but violent Dolph Lundgren directtovideo action thriller.  Well it's violent alright but it is by no means stupid. In fact I'd say this is the best directtovideo action movie ever made and at the very top of Dolph Lundgren's filmography.  The general outline of the plot  Mercenaries assault tropical village to muscle mining rights from the villagers but then mercenary has a change of heart and helps defend the village  is eminently cliche of course.  Previous mercenary classics Dogs of War and The Wild Geese already have similar plots.  But the execution is marvellous!  What did you expect with the great independent filmmaker and famed scriptdoctor John Sayles writing the script on this one?  The movie doesn't rely pure action to raise your blood pressure  All the time spent building the relationships and personalities pays off big time when it comes to the showdown.  Real dramatic tension in a directtovideo Dolph Lundgren flick!  Who'd have expected it?  The dialogue is smart and knows when to laugh at itself when it gets too cliche or macho.  The director and cinematographer do great work as well very stylish without resorting to cheap musicvideostyle tricks so common these days.  And don't worry about the action there isn't much at the beginning but the last 30 minutes or so is one huge long action sequence.  Best of all it doesn't pull any punches.  Maybe its directtovideo status allowed them to show more I don't know but this is a helluva violent film.  You see the results of the violence and it's anything but pretty.  I loved this film.  Go find it at the video store it's worth it.  The only negative is that the tape is panscan and there's no widescreenletterbox version available on DVD.  The compositions seem a bit cramped especially during the action scenes. Anyway go see it and keep any eye out for some cool actors in the supporting roles  BD Wong Catherine Bell of tv show JAG fame playing a hardass mercenary chick no less! etc.  I hope the studio releases a widescreen DVD soon!".

	schema:headline " Most definitely Lundgren's best movie with lots of action gorgeous scenery and an excellent supporting cast.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of  I don't generally make it a point to review Dolph Lundgren films since they're usually steeped deep into mediocrity but I gave this one a chance based on some fairly high recommendations. And I have to admit I'm pleasantly surprised though not a great movie Men of War delivers thrilling action amidst a plot that's actually not halfbad by generic action flick standards.Lundgren stars as Nick Gunar an exspecial forces operative who's given a lucrative job by a corporation looking for someone to do their dirty work. Apparently the company wants mining rights on a small island inhabited by a village of natives and they think Gunar's the man to convince the villagers to sign the rights over if the natives don't agree then Gunar and his men will have to eliminate them. With some reluctance Gunar agrees to the deal and rounds out the rest of his team with hardboiled mercenaries totaling eight in all including Catherine Bell looking for a good payday.But upon their first few days on the island Gunar and a few of his teammates find themselves quite taken with the natives and their way of life and are unable to bring themselves to complete the mission. This splits the team in half with Gunar and his group choosing to defend the island and the rest leaving to join another much larger mercenary group led by Kevin Tighe and Aussie Trevor Goddard that's got its eyes set on completing the mission. No points for guessing this is going to lead to allout war.The film's premise though often used time and again in the annals of action cinema is effective in immediately engaging the viewer. Plot has often been a tricky complication in Lundgren's movies as they tend to get in the way of the action or there's simply not enough of a hook in the story to hold one's attention. Not so in this case and while the script isn't particularly complex or convoluted I found myself quite interested in the natives' plight and the way Gunar and his soldiers respond to the situation.It's also to no small degree that I even cared about the characters and in this regard even the natives aren't shortsighted as ample screen time is given to both B.D. Wong and Charlotte Lewis. Wong in particular is excellent as the translator who helps bridge the cultural gap. As the lead Lundgren is likable and appealing displaying a fair amount of the same charisma that made Schwarzenegger a huge star. He's clearly not a good actor but he has an undeniably strong presence.The supporting cast immeasurably aids the film most especially hottie Catherine Bell as one of the asskicking mercenaries with a heart of gold. I'm only a little disappointed that she didn't strip down or show any skin so it seems that gratuitous task was left up to Charlotte Lewis. Also making strong impressions are Tom Wright and Tim Guinee as mercs on Gunar's side and Trevor Goddard as the overthetop villain.The action scenes are spectacular and thrilling even if most of it is held off until the climax. But what a climax! The last halfhour is nonstop mayhem with shootouts explosions knifings and fisticuffs taking place all over the island. For my money this is the best Bmovie battle since Arnold took on all those Latino soldiers in Commando. Lundgren doesn't really get to show off his martial arts moves until his manoamano battle with Goddard but it's a damn good showdown that wraps the action up on an exciting note.Add to that the gorgeous scenery and surprisingly high production values this certainly has the look and feel of a theatrical release and I'd have to say Men of War is a winner. It's not innovative or original cinema but it is a highly entertaining action flick and that's all I ask from a movie starring Dolph Lundgren.".

	schema:headline " One of Lundgrens best films!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is undoubtedly one of Dolph Lundgren's best if not his best all round film. Firstly the film marks a change of pace for Dolph here playing an action man with a conscience and although still a muscled killing machine he has a sensitive side. The film is old hat in terms of idea however it's given a good sense of humanity thanks to the work of original scriptwriter the Oscar winning John Sayles. His script was re tooled to be more action friendly but the humanity is still there. Dolph plays a mercenary hired to persuade islanders to sell there land to a mining company and by persuade I mean destruction of the demands aren't met. A simple job for Dolph and his team of Mercs. However Dolph discovers that the entire island is going to be torn apart pillaged for the mining of minerals found in bird and bat poo. Clearly Dolph's years of doing rich peoples dirty work has gotten to him because he stays to fight by the side of the islanders and the few group members with enough conscience to stand by their leader. This is an old idea but being an action movie originality isn't high up on the list. It is refreshing to see Dolph playing a more rounded character and the film is well made.The film looks fantastic. It's beautifully shot by cinematographer Ronn Schmidt while the score from Golden Globe nominee Gerald Gouriet is very good probably the best in any Lundgren piece. The film was to be directed by John Frankenheimer and as good as that would have been for Dolph's film career Perry Lang directs proceedings well.The cast is good with many well known faces and it was key that Dolph's motley crew were all well portrayed. With Tiny Lister Tim Guinee Anthony John Denison Tom Wright and Catherine Bell all good as Dolph's special forces unit. While the Islanders are strongly represented by the gorgeous Charlotte Lewis and show stealer BD Wong as mouthy Islander Po. Also the later Trevor Goddard is superbly over the top and villainous as the deranged Kiefer. Dolph Lundgren is surrounded by some strong actors and he also manages to give probably his best performance understated and effective.Although we have seen far better versions of this film on a technical level it can't be faulted. It's beautifully shot in a glorious location the same place Di Caprio's Beach was filmed. and it has a decent budget allowing for a good chunk of action. The film could have done with an action scene in the middle to quicken pace however the films last half hour is frenetic building up to a down and dirty showdown. Overall a solid action movie and with Dolph's latest film being one of his best and involving him leading a military operation there seems to be a hint as to his speciality. 12".

	schema:headline " Better than usual Lundgren vehicle.";
	schema:reviewBody "Action genre icon Dolph Lundgren plays Gunar a former Special Ops soldier turned mercenary. He's hired by sleazy corporate interests to force the residents of an Asian island to sign over the mining rights. Well as you may expect he experiences a change of heart when he meets the natives including gorgeous Charlotte Lewis of The Golden Child as do some of his comrades. The other members of the team remain mercenaries and become determined to complete the mission leading to the inevitable all out war.The capable direction is by veteran actor Perry Lang The Hearse Alligator who also co stars as one of the young corporate creeps. Given that the script is cowritten by indie favourite John Sayles along with Ethan Reiff  Cyrus Voris Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight one can also expect this to be more well thought out and interesting than the run of the mill action film. It's quite serious yet not totally without some humour and the natives as led by amiable young spokesman Po B.D. Wong are an inherently sympathetic bunch.Of course the natives do turn out to be pretty effective fighters once the stakes are raised. The set pieces are largely confined to the last half hour but are intense and enjoyable once they occur. There are some nifty demises devised for our antagonists and Dolph is given a formidable opponent with Trevor Goddards' over the top psycho mercenary Keefer. The location shooting in Thailand allows for some beautiful scenery and it's all nicely shot by Rohn Schmidt.The cast is above average for this sort of thing. Besides Dolph Lewis and Wong the cast consists of Tony Denison Tim Guinee Don Harvey Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who like Goddard relishes chewing the scenery Tom Wright the lovely Catherine Bell who looks mighty fine and also proves herself adept at kicking ass alongside the guys Kevin Tighe as Dolphs' mentor Thomas Gibson and Aldo Sambrell long ago costar in Sergio Leones' Dollars trilogy as a goon named Goldmouth.All in all this is good rousing entertainment that genre aficionados will likely savour.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Pretty Good Lundgren Film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a pretty good Lundgren film and also an above average war film. It's a powerful film at times with a menacing villain however Tom Tiny Lister annoyed the crap out of me with his constant yelling and he's not a good actor at all. There are a lot of great action scenes and a lot of the characters were cool however  it took a while to get into but once it got going it was great. It's Low budget but very well made with some quality acting  especially by Lundgren!. The Directing is pretty good. Perry Lang does a pretty good job here with realistic looking war scenes keeping the film at a fast pace and doing a solid job overall!. There is LOTS of violence. We get lots of bloody beatings TONS of very bloody gunshot woundschopped off hand bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains spurting knife in the shoulder 2 severed heads stick jammed in the chin and out the head and lots of bloody bodies. The Acting is excellent!. Dolph Lundgren is AMAZING as always he is excellent in the acting department was very likable had good chemistry with Charlotte Lewis and kicked that ass! Lundgren rules!. Charlotte Lewis is very beautiful and does fine here she had good chemistry with Lundgren however she didn't have much dialog still she did a good job. B.D. Wong is good here with what he has to do. Anthony John Denison did well here as well not much to do though. Tim Guinee also does well with what he has to do. Don Harvey is excellent here and is a great character actor. Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr. is GOD AWFUL Here all he does is yell bitch and complainand annoyed the crap out of me he is just a dreadful actor also known as Zeus from the WWF. Tom Wright is good here and was pretty likable. Trevor Goddard is good as the main villain and was fairly menacing. Overall i highly recommend this one! for a late night 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " an engrossing and surprisingly thoughtprovoking movie";
	schema:reviewBody "What if they made a really good Dolph Lundgren movie and nobody came?Well if they put it out directly to video ... I saw Men of War on broadcast TV so of course some of the nastier stuff was censored.  Still I think I got the idea.  And it was a good idea!  This movie continually impressed me with excellent dialogue good character development humor and most of all a story that I actually cared about. Sure it was somewhat predictable but there were some unexpected developments mostly centering on the ability of the supporting cast  and I mean way down the list to some of the bit parts  to behave in ways not anticipated by the principals.  This made for a rather unorthodox movie.  I also really enjoyed the soundtrack good music well suited to each scene. Did I mention the dialogue?  I did?  Well I'll mention it again because usually that's the last thing I expect to like in a DL movie but this one was smartly scripted.My favorite character was Po who was exceptionally well written and nicely played by BD Wong.  It took all of about 15 seconds for me to like this guy his intelligence and wit were quickly evident even through the language barrier.  Actually that's one thing that impressed me a lot they managed to come up with broken English script that comes across as totally believable.  If I were a mercenary in SE Asia this is a lot like how I'd expect people might really talk to me.I can't say this is a great movie it has its shortcomings.  The themes explored were already old hat by the time this film was made and there is a strange schizophrenia to the film it's half storymovie and half actionmoviewithbigherostardude.  But the strong points seem to carry it pretty easily perhaps because the makers realized beforeduring production what we do when we see it and compensated.  For example the film does visit certain cliches but it doesn't dwell on them expecting them to make a huge impression on the viewer.  It's as though the makers realize that a given situation is old hat and are almost apologetically including it simply out of necessity then moving on to what they REALLY wanted to show us.  I think that shows respect for the intelligence of the audience treating us as though we've actually seen a movie before  imagine that!!  and I appreciated it.Since Lundgren is the star here I guess I'll close by saying that he was very well used.  The story is the real star which is why this movie works so well.  Lundgren has never been a topnotch actor and isn't one here but that's not important.  This movie tells a story and it uses all of its assets not just shoving big Dolph in our faces over and over again.  When he says something or does something it's because it was his turn to do so. Really I'm very impressed by how well this worked.BTW lest you get the wrong impression I actually like Dolph Lundgren and have enjoyed some of his films usually almost exclusively for the action. I just don't think he's Oscar material.".

Awesome.Dolph plays Nick Gunar a retired mercenary hired to coerce some islanders into signing away their land to some mining company an evil mining company no less. Nick gets his old back team together but while on the island Nick has an epiphany and pledges to defend the island and its people at all costs from evil mercenaries led by the evil Keefer Trevor Goddard.This is a story we have seen in other movies but on the hand most other movies don't have Dolph Lundgren running around in a jungle with a rocketlauncher in one hand and a handgun in another hand. In the end that is all that really matters isn't it? The movie starts out slowly but fear not action fans! The last 20 to 30 minutes make one long but exciting battle scene.As always Dolph is awesome. Conversely Trevor Goddard is not. I have nothing against him as an actor in action movies I just can't understanding what he is saying. Hey I'm an Australian and although he was English despite saying he was an Australian and always cast as an Aussie the Australian and Cockney accents are very similar so why can't I understand the guy? Am I not ocker enough or did he enjoy being not understood by everyone? 'Men of War' is one of Dolph's best movies  810".

Charlotte Lewis definitely played one of the better  looking not to mention sexiest native women I have ever seen on screen. I just wish Catherine Bell would have had a nude scene too. Bell's role was pretty kick ass as well. I can see why they hired her for JAG. The only drawback of the film was that the bad guys were pretty much your stereotypical badguys. Trevor Goddard and Tiny Lister were the the worst of the bunch. They were so good at being bad that you wanted to kill them yourself. The more interesting characters were the two men who decided not to stay around Jimmy G and the guy who was looking for Jade. One stayed bad Jimmy G. had the hots for Bell's character Grace and showed his good side when it mattered.All in all this was a pretty decent action movie that really isn't that predictable. It's worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always say that a good action movie needs to have a decent story to work. Otherwise it will be just a mindless violence that is quickly boring and forgettable. Dolph Lundgren movies not always seem to remember that. This one however despite being a little clich is god enough to keep the viewer interested.The story here is based on screenplay written by John Sayles  nominated for Oscar for the screenplay for The Lone star. You could say that the story ere is generic  but it's really not badly written for a Bclass action movie. The film's premise is effective in immediately engaging the viewer.The characters here actually have some soul and different personalities. They aren't bland and uninteresting like in many bad action movies. Another good thing is that the dialogues between them are actually nice to listen. When you care about the characters it means that someone did his job right. All the time spent building the relationships and personalities pays off big time when it comes to the showdown. A real dramatic tension.There are no Oscar worthy performances here  but the acting is definitely above average. Lundgren is likable and quite convincing as the troubled mercenary leader. B.D. Wong as the natives leader is really good. There are also some attractive women here  Catherine Bell and Charlotte Lewis. The rest of the cast also doesn't disappoint with one exception  Trevor Goddard . He is overacting so much in the role of the villain that he almost single handedly destroys the movie.Most of the action is held off until the climax of the movie. There is some nice action before  but it's the last halfhour that really counts. It's true that sometimes the camera work isn't perfect as other viewers pointed out. Still the mayhem is just great with shootouts explosions knifings and fist fights taking place all over the island. It's also interesting that while a direct to video release this movie actually looks and feels like a theatrical release. The production values are surprisingly high and in the end the scenery is quite gorgeous.This is not Seven samurai The magnificent seven or even Dogs of war. It is however a decent action movie with heart. It has message antiwar and proecological   likable characters  some excitement and overall Men of war is a nice movie that might apply even to those who don't like action movies. It's a solid action entertainment with some substance . I give it 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Krabat has been one of the classics of youth literature in Germany for almost 40 years and one wonders why nobody tried to make a movie out of it earlier. Actually it is not that hard to answer this question since Krabat is a very grim and dark tale with some gruesome deaths an ending that comes across as rather anticlimactic and above all an incredible amount of religious symbolism even though the book is no sappy Christian novel that would make it hard to market it. Parents would not go and see this movie with their kids and young people might not find it cool enough. Fortunately the producers were smart enough to think of another target group grownups who read the book in their youth and have been haunted by it ever since.Some changes have been made. The symbolism is reduced the role of the Kantorka is slightly expanded which makes the showdown a little more exciting and Tonda's love to Worschula plays a bigger part than it does in the novel. Make no mistake though both women still have small roles. The story is shortened by one year so that it now covers only two years instead of three which ultimately saves the life of one of the boys  and to those who only watched the movie but haven't read the book It is not the guy you think it might be and the story centers even more on Krabat than in the book which means that all scenes that explain more about the master such as the sorcerer's duel and the trip to the Elector in Dresden were left out.I don't mind these changes too much. While the trip to Dresden was in my opinion one of the most memorable scenes of the book I can understand why it had to go. There are some other minor changes which I won't go into. But even with the shortening of the story Kreuzpaintner still had a lot left in his hands that he had to press into two hours. And I have to say that he does not entirely succeed. Kreuzpaintner does something Preuler does a lot in his book He only hints at many things and hopes that the viewer will link the parts together. But Preuler had a much bigger story than Kreuzpaintner does and often this makes the movie feel rushed or incomplete. But still the story is touching and gripping and in my opinion totally satisfying.The cinematography is outstanding. The images are truly beautiful and the aerial shots even allow the viewer to see the entire set. Incredible work has been done here. Now in most big German productions there is one scene in which the director decides to go totally Hollywood and usually this ends in a disaster. The same thing unfortunately happens here when the boys get into a fight with some marauding soldiers. Kreuzpaintner tries to outScott Ridley Scott here and the picture is so distorted that not only can you barely see what is happening but it also really hurts the eyes. What makes this even worse is that this makes it look like they tried to cover up bad fighting stunts with these scenes even though I am sure that they were in fact done well.The actors are mainly well cast. Brhl Redl especially Redl! Stadlober all act well and make us forget the actor behind the role Brhl and Redl succeed better than Stadlober Hanno Koffler whom I usually like a lot does some overacting which seems annoying at first but since he plays Juro that might have been a deliberate choice. Unfortunately David Kross is a little weak but this seems to be the curse of title characters who after all are supposed to serve as models for identification. The guy I actually liked best was Moritz Grove who plays Merten as thoughtful caring and in the end almost tragic. All in allit has to be said that the casting agents really did their job well in making these guys distinguishable even though some of their parts are rather small.While I liked the set design and the costumes I was not too pleased about the makeup. Smeering some black paint on strategic places on the actors' faces so that they look dirty but still pretty gets on my nerves when it happens through an entire movie. It really looks fake after a while and when you get to scenes where the actors show their shaved armpits you cannot help but laugh at this pseudohistorical mess.I have to say in spite of some criticism I really liked the movie and I will recommend it to everyone. To people who read the book it will bring back great childhood memories and others who have not read it will find the movie entertaining thrilling and maybe even scary.But just like the movie ends on a big f you to the audience I will end this review with my biggest gripe about the movie Who on earth made the decision to put such a terrible song at the end of the movie? The picture has such an incredibly beautiful score and does everything to set the mood right and they actually decide to put some electro dance track over the credits!!!! This must be one of the worst choices of a filmpromoting song in film history! The people behind this decision should really lower their heads in shame!".

Make no mistake though both women still have small roles. The story is shortened by one year so that it now covers only two years instead of three which ultimately saves the life of one of the boys  and to those who only watched the movie but haven't read the book It is not the guy you think it might be and the story centers even more on Krabat than in the book which means that all scenes that explain more about the master such as the sorcerer's duel and the trip to the Elector in Dresden were left out.I don't mind these changes too much. While the trip to Dresden was in my opinion one of the most memorable scenes of the book I can understand why it had to go. There are some other minor changes which I won't go into. But even with the shortening of the story Kreuzpaintner still had a lot left in his hands that he had to press into two hours. And I have to say that he does not entirely succeed. Kreuzpaintner does something Preuler does a lot in his book He only hints at many things and hopes that the viewer will link the parts together. But Preuler had a much bigger story than Kreuzpaintner does and often this makes the movie feel rushed or incomplete. But still the story is touching and gripping and in my opinion totally satisfying.The cinematography is outstanding. The images are truly beautiful and the aerial shots even allow the viewer to see the entire set. Incredible work has been done here. Now in most big German productions there is one scene in which the director decides to go totally Hollywood and usually this ends in a disaster. The same thing unfortunately happens here when the boys get into a fight with some marauding soldiers. Kreuzpaintner tries to outScott Ridley Scott here and the picture is so distorted that not only can you barely see what is happening but it also really hurts the eyes. What makes this even worse is that this makes it look like they tried to cover up bad fighting stunts with these scenes even though I am sure that they were in fact done well.The actors are mainly well cast. Brhl Redl especially Redl! Stadlober all act well and make us forget the actor behind the role Brhl and Redl succeed better than Stadlober Hanno Koffler whom I usually like a lot does some overacting which seems annoying at first but since he plays Juro that might have been a deliberate choice. Unfortunately David Kross is a little weak but this seems to be the curse of title characters who after all are supposed to serve as models for identification. The guy I actually liked best was Moritz Grove who plays Merten as thoughtful caring and in the end almost tragic. All in allit has to be said that the casting agents really did their job well in making these guys distinguishable even though some of their parts are rather small.While I liked the set design and the costumes I was not too pleased about the makeup. Smeering some black paint on strategic places on the actors' faces so that they look dirty but still pretty gets on my nerves when it happens through an entire movie. It really looks fake after a while and when you get to scenes where the actors show their shaved armpits you cannot help but laugh at this pseudohistorical mess.I have to say in spite of some criticism I really liked the movie and I will recommend it to everyone. To people who read the book it will bring back great childhood memories and others who have not read it will find the movie entertaining thrilling and maybe even scary.But just like the movie ends on a big f you to the audience I will end this review with my biggest gripe about the movie Who on earth made the decision to put such a terrible song at the end of the movie? The picture has such an incredibly beautiful score and does everything to set the mood right and they actually decide to put some electro dance track over the credits!!!! This must be one of the worst choices of a filmpromoting song in film history! The people behind this decision should really lower their heads in shame!";

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a change of pace from American fantasy flicks.The basic story takes place at the end of the 30 years war in Germany. It focuses on a young orphan named Krabat. I won't give any more details except to say that it's an interesting twist on the idea of magic.I'm not saying it's a 1010 I gave it 9 there are a few inconsistencies in the film but they exist outside the main line of the story and you don't notice them until after the credits are finished.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the film I was unsure what was wrong with it. The pictures are magnificent the acting was OK to good the score was good and the plot was there. Palpatine replacing the Gevatter was may be OK. I think the Gevatter as described in the book is really hard to transfer onto the screen.The magic was changed in a bad way as described in comments before. The landscape is changed too. I did not like this but one has to see the film as an own work. A Plan 9 from outer space like goof is the Kantorka entering the mill in the night and the journeymen leaving with her in bright daylight only minutes later. But this only explains why the film is not a really great one and not why it is only a film as thousands more.After rethinking what did not work things came back to the missing year. The point which worked the least in the book is the shortage of time. Krabat is getting from the newbie to one main antagonist and the possible successor of the master within three years in a ritual death cycle lasting one year. So in the book he is able to see the rhythm of new trainee to prey only two times completely while other journeymen had an advance of at least 9 years for this and react accordingly at the end of the year. And the relationship of Krabat to the Kantorka can built up by very few meetings within year 2 and 3. So the development of Krabat himself is very fast and nearly unbelievable in the book.By omitting one year in the film the pace goes over the edge. To explain the KrabatKantorka relationship the journeymen have to stumble massively into the town life as positive figures therefore the awful fight scene. And Krabat has to go to the town on easter himself and Juro has to catch him in the town and reveal himself. The original scene in the book where Juro is accidently burning Krabats' hand is much more appropriate but give not enough time for Krabat to physically meet the Kantorka during the rest of the film. As a result of all this the changing of Krabat during the story is getting implausible. So is for an example to add the suicide attempt.The film is simply lacking plausibility by telling a story of breaking a cycle in too short time. You can not give the real impression of a cycle by only showing it once. An additional hour for the third year would have made the film a much better one. Even then Pumphutt or Dresden had to be left out which still changes the picture of the master but a film can never suit a novel.".

Other people like me being disappointed what they made of the book but as a real fan you have to see it all even if it breaks your heart. In fact i cannot share most of the bad reviews about it. It is not a literature film but i does not intend to be it. When you keep that in mind it was entertaining more like the HollywoodVersion of the book.OK! The behavior in the film of the boys is not affected by fear as described in the book and they are more like individuals than a band of lost souls. The acting could have been better of some actors but Daniel Brhl and some others kept the level very high to the point of his characters death. For the rest the story was very close to the book so it held itself. I think it is important to show their despair and they did with the suicide scene which is also in the book. The only thing i really did not like was the fighting scene in the middle of the movie which is not in the book. I could hardly watch it. Very fast and the picture seemed to be broken. It was very eye and mind hurting for me. Some funny important scenes from the book are left out which might have done the movie good. Why they use Magic is not explained in the movie and the master is more like a father figure then the all evil in the book. If they did then movie would have been a mess. The book tells that they learn Magic to trick other people to rob them to betray them to gain power over them which is very tempting. It is more like an allegory for the youth in the third Reich. The movie is more like the youth in the 30years war and their search for a home a base at all costs.But they kept the main aspect. Power can lead you on the wrong way and everything has its price. This is important.".

Overall I have to say it was decent but nothing to knock my socks off 7 out of 10. They did have to compress a lot of the action and a lot of the character development suffers Krabat's evolving from ambitious prize student to somewhat suspicious to doing his own thing though this is always a problem with book adaptations and not generally something I blame them for. I do have issues with parts of the story that are outright changed but not necessarily for the better. While I go back and forth on the showdown scene the previously mentioned soldiers scene is absolutely terrible. As a suggestion the events that lead to Tonda's having gray hair could have been covered in a brief flashback they don't actually occur during Krabat's time at the mill anyway and made room for something else. The acting is very good especially on the parts of Brhl and Redl the main character is a bit annoying he goes from blankfaced boy to angry rebel skipping the more insightful aspects of Krabat's character and one of his lines towards the end of the movie was so cheesy I wanted to punch him for it. Scenery and music were nice if a bit Lord of the Ringsesquire the Gevatter was totally a Ringwraith before he turned into Emperor Palpatine and the Kantorka had some initial backup from Enya it seemed though I'll have to agree on the clich medieval fantasy bit especially the bad teeth looked fake.

It is a nice fantasy movie with well done CGI nice acting a beautiful environment and an aboveaverage fantasy story.If you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it don't expect too much or better don't expect anything at all. The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain that the movie is voted 110 from people around 40 or more like me and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.Most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting in my opinion much to the worse The magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. Changing weather creating illusions transform into animals ... In the movie the magic is more like jedischool for the middle ages TM wooden sticks instead of lightsabers. That the devil is looking like emperor palpatine after part III doesn't make it really better.The mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. In the book the story is set near Dresden which Krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. This part might have been changed to cut costs. I also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.The whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. Lots of mud everywhere dirty faces not an orderly kitchen only very rough houses. The book never suggested such an environment.In the book the master tries to make Krabat his successor but Krabat rejects. Krabat is somewhere between admiration distance and silent rejection. In the movie Krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.The movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. OK the stories are missing anyway in the movie.Also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes In the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the movie. Sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.The book explains why only a few Gesellen try to confront the master If the master dies by any mundane reasons the Gesellen are free AND keep their magical powers. If the master dies at the confrontation all will lose their power forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is set in the European 30yearwar and is about a young homeless boy Krabat who ends up as an apprentice in a mill. Its miller is in fact a dark magic master who needs 12 apprentices to get the mill going. Every year one of the apprentices has to die to keep the master alive this does no surprise somehow frighten the apprentices... There is a way to become free again through the love of a girl. Etc. etc. guess what happens? Right... The movie is based on Ottfried Preuler's Krabat novel which I recommend very much. The movie I don't recommend so much. It starts OK setting is OK actors are OK Krabat slowly unfolds the mill's secrets  but after about two thirds of the movie it slows down somehow and you can pretty much guess what's gonna happen. Problem is that vital elements of the book were left out a confrontation between the master and a straying legendary wizard the master loses and therefore the apprentices learn that he can be beaten and a magical journey to the magnificent Saxon capital Dresden which certainly should have been included into the film. Also in the book it takes three years which are actually nine years outside the mill until the final showdown in the film one year has been omitted and knowing the book I felt rather disappointed and betrayed about that. It might not be that bad if you don't know the book. Like other commentators I recommend not to watch the movie in case you have read the novel if you haven't you might watch it and get entertained a little but not too much.".

	schema:headline " Rare German fantasy movie except the fairy tales of course";
	schema:reviewBody "When you hear the word Krabat you will probably wonder first of all what is that. If you think it has to do with the Moroccan city you are completely wrong. If you think it includes the German word for raven you are much closer but most of all the film is simply named after the film's main character played by David Kross. This movie has some of the most known younger German actors in its cast. Apart from Kross who you may have seen in The Reader there is also Daniel Brhl Robert Stadlober Anna Thalbach Hanno Kofler and my personal favorite Charly Hbner. I'm usually not too big on Kross Stadlober and Brhl but at least the latter impressed me occasionally here. I would say that this is mostly a kids movie although a fairly dark one but adult audiences can also have a good time watching.The main antagonist is played by Christian Redl who is also the only older actor in the cast. He plays an evil sorcerer but as he seemed to be a bit of a father figure to the boys for quite a while it was initially unclear how evil he really is and I even considered for a moment that Stadlober's character my be the main villain because of Krabat's dislike for him. The movie is written and directed by Marco Kreuzpaintner. It is an adaptation from the late Otfried Preuler's one of Germany's most famous children's book authors novel. Kreuzpaintner already worked with a few cast members like Kofler Stadlober or Paula Kalenberg the female main character and love interest to Krabat. For the director it is the return back to Germany from Hollywood after making a film with Kevin Kline one year earlier. He is still fairly young was 30 when he made this film so we may get many more films from him and I hope they won't be worse than Krabat.The film won a handful awards and also scored nominations at the German Film awards in the smaller categories. There really wasn't much wrong with this movie. The thing that maybe bothered me the most was the choice of the song Allein allein for the soundtrack. It was a huge hit here in Germany but I felt that it did not suit the film or the topic at all. Apart from that it's not a good song at all in my opinion. Really bad choice. They simply should have gone for some gloomy tune without lyrics in my opinion. But back to the more positive factors I liked how with the introduction of Krabat's childhood friend Krabat turned into Brhl's character and the young boy was pretty much Krabat when he freshly joined the group. The fact that the boys are the ravens was clear from the very beginning and it is a good idea although I wish it could have surprised me or they would have added more to that subplot except the ending scene with the girl choosing the correct raven. The 20th Century Fox intro with the ravens was pretty nice as well. However I wondered what the whole leaving your body plot was about. Brhl's character and Krabat were doing it when Krabat meets his girl the first time. And what was behind the whole thing that they should not have a girlfriend? I guess it was the sorcerer's fear that he could not fight love and that he may lose all his boys just like he did at the end of the film. But one or two more scenes could have helped in my opinion. They could have cut some of the less significant scenes for that. The film runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and they could have done without 510 minutes because it is already very long especially for children. Most German kids movies these days do not cross the 100minute mark.Anyway as a whole I liked this movie and finally I would also like to mention explicitly the good work with the aging makeup for Redl's and Brhl's characters. The film has some nice fairytale and fantasy elements which made sure it did not drag at all or only once or twice which is very acceptable given the runtime. Very atmospheric too. Recommended.".

I thought they are disappointing at best especially for a film that wants to be epic. It takes more than a shaky cam to create a good fighting scenery. And thats the next thing the film tries hard to be epic but fails hard in achieving it. The story is not that bad nor are the actors but I think Krabat would have been much better if produced as a TV series. The source material would have been perfect. Some young men who are ordinary apprentice lads are getting trained to become powerful wizards. This training should be interesting you may think but yawn all we see are some guys with wooden staffs. There is no exciting arc for the characters Krabat and the others don't seem to change very much even since they are wizards. And what is there motive? Why is Krabat even there? Because he followed a raven? I know he shook the hand of the sorcerer and now he is bound to him but why does the sorcerer train all this young lads? For what purpose? What is his plan... is it for fun or does he want to achieve something? So many questions so less answers. At some point I didn't care anymore I am sure there is an answer somewhere but it is not illustrated very well in this film. Overall a waste of good actors and a potentially great TV series. 310".

	schema:headline " Scariest Movie I've Seen In Years!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy campy romp with the same tried and true tricks of the trade like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She incidentally didn't make a peep thankfully I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. I was also expecting to see some blood and guts especially coming from the guys who made Saw but there wasn't a drop. Instead they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater my girlfriend included. From literally the opening credits they created an intense haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie well at least a PG13 movie. Overall the movie was great. It was crazy scary thoroughly entertaining and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So if you plan on seeing this movie please consider this a cautionary reminder it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the genre's that Hollywood has to offer the most tattered of the bunch is without a doubt the horror department. I am so sick of these wannabe 'so called' horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel. Im sick of the same old parlor tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years. And i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year. You would figure after great horror flicks like The Decent and Paranormal Activity studios would start realizing what actually works and what audiences want to see. Hopefully in the coming years this genre' will come back to life.When it comes to horror movies i think the two most crucial elements are the cinematography and the musical score. Actually i prefer there to be no music at all. Almost all the great horror movies never use it because they rely on scaring the audience with disturbing images not raised music that makes everyone jump. If i want that I'll go to a haunted house. When i go to see a horror flick i want it to leave a lasting impression. However movies like this are the one exception.This film had such amazing cinematography that i didn't even care about those 'raised music' sequences. I rarely get creeped out at the theater and this movie scared the crap out of me. I'm talking' sweaty palms eyes wide open my body sunk all the way down in my chair scared. And for those of you who have read my reviews in the past i hardly ever say that about a horror flick. And what really sold it was the cinematography. This film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images. So much in fact that you will hate walking into your dark house alone. Yes they do use the same scare tactics but since everything in the movie looked so damn creepy and demented i for once didn't want the lead female to hurry up and open the basement door and get it over with.The storyline is pretty decent. It's not an amazing concept or genuinely creepy on it's own. But it does a decent enough of a job to keep your interest and sell what your seeing unfold on screen. And it's safe to say that this is a very different take on your typical haunted house.Bottom Line......holy crap i just realized that this movie is only PG13. Is it possible for a movie to be scary as hell and only be rated PG13? The answer is yes and this is a prime example of that. You know when a horror movie has done it's job? It's when it scares you both in the theater and hours later when you try to sleep at night. Tonight i will have lots of trouble sleeping. I can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year.".

I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you not gross you out. The images are frightening for sure. Insidious doesn't waste any time trying to creep you out. The scares already start with the opening credits. I sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies i've seen but it lives up to that. That being said I don't think I'd have the guts to see it again!".

James Wan did a very impressive for only an 800000 budget for this movie. If you're going in the theatre expecting to see the typical run of the mill haunted house flick you will be sadly mistaken and surprisingly pleased at the same time. The parts that I liked most about the film is the detailing. Everything in the movie means something no matter how small and I love that when the suspense builds up for the audience to be scared you won't be disappointed to find its just the dog or the tree brushing against the window....it will definitely be something to be scared of. The people sitting beside me kept laughing at me because whenever the suspense would build I would say to myself uh uh....uh uh.But enough of my rambling the plot was definitely original and James Wan and Leigh Schanell definitely succeeded in bringing the audience something scary suspenseful funny emotional and frightening all at the same time. The score is amazing. The use of all sound design was great specially since they weren't any fake screams. LOL. The best acting performance hands down was Lin Shaye. She did an amazing job with her role. I can't say anymore without spoiling the movie. All I can say is if you LOVE a good scary movie then you must see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just came back from watching an advanced screening of  Insidious  tonight with my wife we both liked it a lot. When it comes to Horror films there are always the same Horror formulas which film makers really can't escape when making a Horror because there aren't much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula. So Insidous borrows many of its ideas from other Horror films one comes to mind is 1982 film  Poltergeist  but here we have a family of 5 Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl. after a slow build up a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems !! soon after weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house !! A simple story that as i said was done before however I thought it was done differently here there was a better atmosphere and some elements of the plot stood out as being fresh that made this film unique somehow. As scares goes this was definitely scary there were several moments in the film that gave me goosebumps !! there were also the classic jump out of your seat moments too. Some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the Horror. so the movie does deliver as far as scares are concerned.Acting was superb too all cast involved did a very good job particularly Rose Byrne whom I'm fond of after watching her in the excellent TV show  Damages . Patrick Wilson was also good here.the atmosphere was creepy the director managed to catch nice footage of the house and other elements of the film. So in summary get ready and grab your loved ones and go catch this movie this Friday it entertains. very enjoyable and scary and even though it borrows ideas from other Horror films it never imitates it stand out as a new and fresh take on traditional Horror !!".

I was thinking you'd get your exorcism with everything being all happy and good in the end but I honestly was not expecting something that complex. I'll come out and say it The outline of the movie was not that original but what the writers did with the traditional ghost story was amazing. They twisted it to make it not so much about the ghosts but about what was going on to the family in the house. How they were taking it.The effects were great for this type of movie which really only require a slamming door or a random person standing in. And I also thought the actors did a great job. I particularly liked Patrick Wilson playing the father that doesn't want to have any part of the hokuspokus ghost stories but is sort of pulled into it against his will. The best part It was genuinely scary. There is virtually no gore because it's not needed to build the creepiness of the plot. It sort of builds and is intense right from the get go. I'm a major scary movie veteran and I was truly scared which doesn't happen often. I highly recommend this movie to anyone up for a good scare. If you aren't an experienced scary movie watcher this is a good starter. And trust me you will check all the closets and doors when you get home from the theater.".

The movie starts out much the same way as the movie Paranormal Activity a family in a house doing regular things. After a while some weird stuff starts to happen and one of their kids have an accident. So far so good. Then the kid falls into a coma. This is where the movie starts to go in the wrong direction. Two nerdy looking guys come in to the house with some instruments to take measurements of whats going on. To me it seemed like these two guys should really have played in some nerdy comedy and not a intented horror movie. However they call in reinforcements  an old lady who figures out that the kid is really skilled in astral projection and the problem is that he has floated away and got lost in the astral realm. After this all sorts of really silly looking ghosts and demons start showing up especially the one with a red face. To resolve this the father astral projection as well to look for his son fistfighting his way trough ghosts and demons.When I look back at what I have written here it seems like a really funny concept  material for a humorhorror movie. However it's not. It tries to be convincing but instead it becomes embarrassing annoying and completely unconvincing with its mixture of newage elements drama and fistfights with demons and ghosts.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Wan best known as one of the initial creators of the 'Saw' series returns to the duo with 'Saw' cocreator Leigh Whannel who also stars with a new ghost story starring Patrick Wilson 'Watchmen' and Rose Byrne 'Get Him to the Greek'.Josh Wilson and Renai Byrne think they have it all a beautiful new home three lovely children. . . and a gang of unruly ghosts causing torment around them. Unfortunately after Dalton one of their sons is knocked unconscious and falls into a coma things take a supernatural turn for the worst. To save Dalton Josh and Renai call on a ghosthunting team Leigh Whannell Angus Sampson and a psychic Lin Shaye to investigate the paranormal presence within the house and put a stop to it before their son's soul is lost to the further.Due to recent trends within the horror genre haunted house flicks have been rather few  far between. However a few recent solid entries have been more than worthwhile including 'El Orfanato' and the 'Paranormal Activity' films. James Wan thankfully adds this quality haunt film to the short list of recent successes. His film however does something different than other ghost stories It's funny. While it doesn't go as overthetop with its humour as a film like 'Drag Me to Hell' it does blend enough laughs throughout to greatly enhance the entertainment value of the overall film making it feel like a classicstyle dark house flick. If only Vincent Price could've been around to perfect that feeling. Technically the film is quite impressive especially for the reported 1 million budget which is unsurprising after what Wan  Whannell did with the 1.2 million they had for the original 'Saw.' The highest levels of the film come from those elements that don't need a massive budget the direction cinematography and writing. These really were what set the film above what by anyone else would have been a straighttovideoquality forgotten film. Another solid element that makes the film a step above most at its level comes from the cast especially the work by genre veterans Barbara Hershey 'The Entity' and Lin Shaye 'Dead End'. Their acting added a muchappreciated level of depth to the fun of the film. Of all the many positive aspects of 'Insidious' however perhaps the most attractive is the simplest It's actually pretty damn scary. While it doesn't contain the slowburn creeps and chills of 'Paranormal Activity' and the like it does contain some of the most well executed and well timed scares in a long time. Though the quantity of scares tapers off throughout the final act of the film the first twothirds of the film contain more than enough to satisfy any fan of the haunted house subgenre.Overall 'Insidious' manages to be as expected by Wan's previous work an entertaining  original ride. It has enough humour  horror to satisfy any filmgoer without focusing too heavily on one angle to make the other side feel awkward. One hope Do not let the PG13 rating shy you away. It actually contains more content worthy of an Rrating than 'Paranormal Activity' did.Final Verdict 7.510. Highly recommended.AP3".

And also does anyone agree with me when I say the music was absolutely outrageous and over the top. Thats what I meant when I said they were trying too hard to scare the audience. Without the music this movie would be totally hopeless.Not to mention they copied probably 3 to to 4 different movies. You got Poltergeist with the kid getting lost in some other world and the dad goes in to save him. You got Dead Silence with the smiling doll lookalike people. And you have all those exorcism movies with the demons and the devil thrown in there as well. Also did anyone notice that the music was extremely similar to that of The Exorcist? Total copycat movie.You get nothing new in this unoriginal and highly overrated movie. I would recommend this film to those who like cheesy teen horror flicks and like to be scared by stupid popout moments. To me it was a very overhyped movie that will probably be forgotten within the next year. I wouldn't waste my money. And if your still interested in this pathetic excuse of a horror movie I would wait to rent it on DVD. Overall it was a Hot Mess! Stay Away!My Rating 010".

The only downside to the film is that a few aspects of the third act should have been toned down a bit and left to the imagination. Overall though Insidious is a great creepy film.

	schema:reviewBody " out of Judging by the anticlimactic advertisements you'd think just why? There's an evil child film almost every year and what separates one from the rest? You have every right to think so but not with Insidious. Trust me when I say it. Insidious is an entirely different beast. One that actually resonates with scares and intrigue. One that relies on character development and a script to hold it together. This isn't a one trick pony it's a well made film with some solid production values thrown in as a bonus. If you don't have a film to see this weekend make sure you make it this one.Insidious revolves around the perfect couple. Beautiful kids. A new home. It's all smooth sailing until Dalton is in a supposed coma but the actual reality is that he's haunted. What will Dalton's family do to stop this entity?First of all many complain that the second act bogs down the film and is inferior to its first half. I wholeheartedly disagree. I think as a whole the film is just fine. Yes there's a drastic tonal shift midway but that doesn't detract from the experience. The first half plays a typical haunted house flick except it's actually scary and the suspense is well built. Then the second half is like a cross between Poltergeist House of Wax and a little of Beetlejuice sprinkled in for good measure. Furthermore the performances while nothing to write home about are pretty decent to say the least. The two leading protagonists do their job and Dalton is pretty solid given what he had to work with. Moreover the script is very inventive and has multiple twists and turns. Yes this isn't the most unique screenplay but it still stands on its own and is actually quite effective.To top it off the production is just very beautiful. This movie is very easy on the eyes when it comes to cinematography and location. Now the question everyone is dying to hear. Is it scary? I'd say yes but don't get too carried away. If you walk in thinking your going to have nightmares or if you're going to see Rosie O' Donnell chances are you'll be a little disappointed. However if you're going in expecting a creepy thriller that just happens to have a few intense moments you'll be in for a fun night out. Also I love the nostalgic factor this movie has. It feels as though it was made in the 80's. Old school horror strikes back!With a restraint heavy PG13 rating and a middleoftheroad concept Insidious isn't looking too pretty. However looks can be deceiving. This is one movie that doesn't mess around and doesn't play it safe either. I can easily say I will be revisiting this film from time to time just because it's so fun. You'll laugh you'll jump you'll be entertained. This is what a fun night out should be like. Get your large popcorn and soda and sit along with the crowd. Be prepared for a good time.".

Yes this isn't the most unique screenplay but it still stands on its own and is actually quite effective.To top it off the production is just very beautiful. This movie is very easy on the eyes when it comes to cinematography and location. Now the question everyone is dying to hear. Is it scary? I'd say yes but don't get too carried away. If you walk in thinking your going to have nightmares or if you're going to see Rosie O' Donnell chances are you'll be a little disappointed. However if you're going in expecting a creepy thriller that just happens to have a few intense moments you'll be in for a fun night out. Also I love the nostalgic factor this movie has. It feels as though it was made in the 80's. Old school horror strikes back!With a restraint heavy PG13 rating and a middleoftheroad concept Insidious isn't looking too pretty. However looks can be deceiving. This is one movie that doesn't mess around and doesn't play it safe either. I can easily say I will be revisiting this film from time to time just because it's so fun. You'll laugh you'll jump you'll be entertained. This is what a fun night out should be like. Get your large popcorn and soda and sit along with the crowd. Be prepared for a good time.";

To be fair the poster artwork is pristine whoever was responsible for the poster definitely did a brilliant job. The boy standing in front of the house with the red shirt and demonic eyes looks amazing.I put the movie in started playing it and seriously prepared myself.I am not going to dump on anyone else's review. This will be straight forward. The small portable intercom that conveniently picks up audio from another area has been done before people instead of aliens it's a demon Signs.The woman being a piano player in general has been done before also instead of a haunted house it's a haunted boy The Orphanage.And oh yes oh yes...the premise of a child being abducted by evil spirits that ultimately encompasses one of the parents having to cross the boundaries into the other world to rescue them in case you forgot or are not aware was already thoroughly covered in a spectacular 1982 Steven Spielberg film called Poltergeist instead of a little girl it's a little boy. They even managed to steal the idea of the outside help who enter and examine their spooky home. Two men and one woman. Exactly the same scenario. Except that in Poltergeist the three characters delivered intelligent lines and dynamite performances in Insidious their lines are incredibly flat and their acting particularly the two guys could rival any performance from a Japanese Godzilla film.Now aside from the fact that this movie rips off from everything in sight I'll focus on the level of the scare meter. The scares are equal to a fairgrounds haunted house. They involve a character dressed in very cheap makeup to go RRRAAARRR!!! right after the Director yells action and then of course adding in post production a loud piece of music. That's silly filmmaking.I have never said the following words in my whole life but I mean this.........the poster art is misleading. It's so misleading in fact that the poster is more interesting to look at than watching this entire film.I only mentioned a few films that this silly movie steals from but there is actually more.If the storyline had some originality to it and the whole project was more respectfully constructed this could have been a memorable trip.Every OTHER movie I mention here I highly recommend. Signs The Orphanage Poltergeist and of course The Exorcist are all excellent. Insidious is cartoon scares and dull thrills.The following is a MASSIVE spoiler The little boy. Even though you're expecting him to frighten the living hell out of you...he does absolutely nothing?! Reagan in The Exorcist lives up to all the hype watch that instead.I also want to say one more thing if you open the trivia page on this site you'll see that the writer stated at a film festival that he wanted to avoid any movie clichs. I personally found that information to be shockingly hilarious. If you haven't seen this movie yet check out the trivia first...then check the film out. If you're a regular movie goer who knows a ripoff when you see one then the trivia will have you rolling on the floor in laughter!".

	schema:reviewBody "As soon as I heard about the new movie Insidious I said Oh boy this is a MUSTSEE. For as long as I can remember I have been a fan of this genre. I'm not talking about the FreddieJason slashertype films or the tortureamputation sickoflicks but the truly psychological twisters that do a number on your head.This is the story of a young family whose oldest child Dalton after a seemingly minor household accident slips into a mysterious coma that medical science is unable to explain. Doctors and hospitals not being able to do anything for Dalton his parents are forced to take the notquitelivingbutnotquitedead boy home where he lies in his room completely unresponsive. Spectral entities are soon haunting the house or so it seems but when the family moves to a new home the haunting continues hence the tagline It's not the house that's haunted. Turns out little Dalton has entered The Further a sort of netherworld where evil spirits vie to inhabit his body. At some point his grandmother played by Barbara Hershey hires a psychic who sends the boy's father into The Further to search for him and hopefully bring him back via some sort of astral projection or outofbody experience. Insidious did not disappoint. Although highly derivative that is not a bad thing here. It has elements of every one of my favorite ghost stories The Haunting haunted house unexplained noises The Innocents possessed child ghostly apparitions eerie weeping The Others creepy climactic sance Flatliners crossing over into another realm and Carnival of Souls palefaced ghoulies coming to get ya. Very much like the aforementioned The Haunting most of the early scares in Insidious rely on sound lighting and camera angles. Because of the way tension builds up like in Paranormal Activity the sight of a face eerily appearing in a window or a sudden loud noise can make you jump out of your seat. The beginning of the movie is all about suggestion mood and atmosphere and what you don't see which are the elements of the very BEST ghost stories.Special commendation for the excellent editing. As much as you might want to shield your eyes in anticipation and dread while watching this movie you won't want to miss some of the splitsecond spinetingling images.My only complaint is that the last onethird or so of the film was almost overkill. The scares were so relentless toward the conclusion of the story you barely have time to recover from one fright before another is foisted on you. Nevertheless there are some truly frightening images in this movie. I have seen many many such movies and have read even more such novels and I consider myself pretty jaded and not easily frightened but I am a little embarrassed to admit that one scene in particular actually made me scream out loud in the movie theater  a first for me! By film's end my heart was literally pounding. If you are highly suggestible or prone to nightmares do not see this film but if you are truly a fan of a good ghosthaunted house story do not miss Insidious. Got to be one of the scariest movies of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts off with a recap of what happened at the end of the original Maniac Cop and this leads to the police force believing that Matt Cordell drowned and his body got washed away. Well they are wrong as he is back on the streets of New York doing what he does best by seeking revenge on his fellow officers unexpected citizens and on those crooked authorities who framed him. But his not alone on this crusade as he's joined by a jolly serial killer. So it's up to detective Sean McKinney and police psychologist Susan Riley to put a stop to this macabre madness.Maniac Cop 2 is a pearler of a trashy sequel that's just as dark and entertaining like its predecessor maybe more so. Although I probably like the original a tad more. But what makes this one a little more exciting is that it goes for more expansive and quite highly energetic action setpieces. They seem to up the ante and nihilistic violence within each scene that follows in such a rapid pace. We can thank this winning formula to the pairing up again of director William Lustig and writer  producer Larry Cohen who did a really fine job on Maniac Cop. The story by Cohen treads the same path as the original but gladly along the way it adds in some refreshing developments to make it stick out from a usual carboncopy sequel. He puts forward a lot of the focus on the mysterious backstory and the motive behind all of this chaos that leads Cordell doing bad deeds and taking the criminals' side. Also evident in the script is plenty of black humour and sardonic wit that mixes well with the grungy and dry dialogues. Just like the first there is also a social commentary lurking about on how corrupt and weak the decaying justice system is and the foolishness of these higher superiors but all of that is overshadowed by its exuberant and quite meaty stunts. And of course it seems to play the terror of this novel idea more for fun and it works out for that reason alone.Obviously that's the reason for Cordell getting himself a partner. Quite an eccentric and clingy nonstop chatterer was this serial killer who was played superbly by Leo Rossi. Compared with the silent brute sized zombie figure of Matt Cordell that emitted such an eerie tone played by the dominating presence of Robert Z'Dar. They were definitely the odd couple! Robert Davi paints an convincing performance as the hardass detective Sean McKinney who's on the trail of Cordell and Claudia Christian is equally good as police psychologist Susan Riley. Bruce Campbell and Laurene Landon feature again from the first flick to come up with rather small roles on this outing. Michael Lerner is excellent as the slimy Commissioner Edward Doyle and there's some quick scenes with Charles Napier Sam Raimi and Danny Trejo.Director Lustig manages to grab you with some well setup explosive thrills like the terminator style slaughter of a police station and he makes the most out of the very grimy and atmospheric backdrop of New York. The seedy night scenes really creep up on you with what's lurking in the shadows and the lighting composition is handled very well. When the film what's to be creepy the score ranges from a chillingly whisper with the odd chant and whistling tune but when it kicks into gear so does the score with an thumping and quite jarring arrangement. It's not a particularly gory film but there's a big body count and the deaths are extremely violent. The makeup effects are quite superior with Cordell's face looking horrendously hideous and that's a good thing as he looks dead. In all it mostly delivers on the very important staples that's makes this trash enjoyable.This is one amusing sequel that's nearly as good as the original and benefits from keeping the same tone if only going one step bigger in the energy levels.".

	schema:headline " Faintly demented solid second movie in an impressive series...";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's get the obvious comparison section of this review out of the way. Is Maniac Cop 2 as good as the original Maniac Cop? Well no. But it's damn close. And in Terminator 2 fashion while it's not quite as good it adds a lot of fun extras to the Maniac Cop pie. In fact Maniac Cop 2 while not being quite as exciting or fresh as the first movie adds a whole demented spin to things that is wonderful to behold.Vicious zombie psychopath Matt Cordell is back he's bigger he's a lot scarier looking on account of a short sojourn at the bottom of the New York river and man is he mad. Starting his vendetta anew with a few random victims and the man who put him in the river in the first place Jack Forrest played for an alarmingly short period of time by an earnest and confident Bruce Campbell as in the original film.Maniac Cop 2 plays up the 'unstoppable zombie SOB' element of the original turning Cordell into a Voorhees style proper zombie cop as opposed to the disfigured mute from the original but it works well given that he's spent a fair while at the bottom of a river he would have decomposed a bit and given the increased action quotient of this addition to the series it makes sense to have him more openly horrifying as he has to spend a lot of time on screen. Given that the scar makeup in the first movie was by all accounts only really good looking from a distance a fact Lustig knew and exploited by avoiding having his face on screen until right at the end of the movie this new more zombified Cordell is a welcome addition.Again the movie is also convincingly tense and gritty often wringing genuine shocks out of you despite it's restraint and relative lack of gore. That said Maniac Cop 2 is much more violent than Maniac Cop. The latter half of the movie has one of the most exciting and brutal shootouts I've seen in a western film with Cordell tearing through an entire police station's worth of fellow officers. The increased violence could well be a turn off for those who enjoyed the almost bloodless original but it sits well with the movie's 'bigger harder faster' ethos and doesn't wreck the atmosphere.The plot of this first sequel is pretty bonkers. The cast are as convincing as the original cast and the hangover of Bruce Campbell and Larene Landon from the original movie though for god's sake don't get attached to them as otherwise you may get really upset by the film as they don't last too long if you know what I mean makes the film feel like easing into a nice pair of old slippers. New additions Robert Davi and Claudia Christian are both amiable and fun to watch both making interesting new leads. The plot line involving Cordell's return from the supposed grave and eventual teamup with a religious lunatic killer to storm the jail he was convicted in rips along at an awesome pace never dragging making the original seem quite slow and thoughtful in comparison.If I have any minor criticisms of this movie it's only that at times some of it seemed a little too over the top to take entirely seriously. While the original was quite Hitchcockian and more of a whodunnit style plot this is a slasher flick albeit a clever one with a fastpace and impeccable set pieces. While the original would appeal to a variety of audiences this is an out and out horror movie and as such would probably only appeal to horror fans and fans of the original Maniac Cop.That said this is a damn fine horror movie and still knocks almost everything else in the genre I've seen in the last four or five months into a cocked hat. A great movie in it's own right and a worthy addition to the series.".

New additions Robert Davi and Claudia Christian are both amiable and fun to watch both making interesting new leads. The plot line involving Cordell's return from the supposed grave and eventual teamup with a religious lunatic killer to storm the jail he was convicted in rips along at an awesome pace never dragging making the original seem quite slow and thoughtful in comparison.If I have any minor criticisms of this movie it's only that at times some of it seemed a little too over the top to take entirely seriously. While the original was quite Hitchcockian and more of a whodunnit style plot this is a slasher flick albeit a clever one with a fastpace and impeccable set pieces. While the original would appeal to a variety of audiences this is an out and out horror movie and as such would probably only appeal to horror fans and fans of the original Maniac Cop.That said this is a damn fine horror movie and still knocks almost everything else in the genre I've seen in the last four or five months into a cocked hat. A great movie in it's own right and a worthy addition to the series.";

	schema:reviewBody "William Lustig's Maniac Cop 2 is a rare thing  a sequel that surpasses its original. Granted the original Maniac Cop wasn't exactly Shakespeare though it is a hell of fun trashy BMovie so that probably wasn't very hard to do. This directtovideo follow up still holds up well as one of the better Bfilms of the early 90s.We all know the story of how dedicated NYPD officer Matt Cordell became the Maniac Cop after being framed by his superiors and sent off to prison as part of a corruption coverup. His vengeance against those who wronged him served as the plot of the first film and as 2 opens the horribly scarred hulking Cordell still has a few loose ends to tie up. Bruce Campbell and Laurene Landon return briefly from the first film though neither of them survives very long and new characters are brought in to deal with the psychotic officer grizzled NYPD detective Robert D'avi of the James Bond flick License to Kill and police psychologist Claudia Christian who went on to Babylon 5 as well as lots of other genre TVfilm. The ante is upped this time because the Maniac Cop has hooked up with a partner for this second installment Leo Rossi of Halloween II fame a serial killer who's been stalking strippers and prostitutes on New York's seedy streets. Cordell shoots up NYPD Headquarters in a hilariously over the top shootoutmassacre that simply has to be seen to be believed before he and Rossi along with a few other criminals freed from police custody head for the prison where Cordell first met his fate to take care of the inmates there who were responsible for his beatingcomadeath in part 1.OK so the plot is ridiculous and was probably written on a cocktail napkin. That doesn't take away from the fact that Maniac Cop 2 works beautifully both as an action flick and a horrorslasher movie. Lustig puts the pedal to the medal virtually from the first scene and doesn't let up through one bloodbath after another. Car crashes shootouts throat impalings explosions  whatever your taste in carnage Maniac Cop 2 will have a scene that satisfies.The slightly larger budget when compared to the first MC goround allows for nastier makeup on the Cordell character who by this time is basically a hulking undead Jason Voorhees type in a cop uniform better set pieces and improved stunts and pyrotechnics. Say what you want about Maniac Cop 2 but you can't say it's a boring movie.Fans of the MC series have long acknowledged that this second film is the highlight of the series. Sadly the only DVD available in the U.S. went out of print almost as quickly as it appeared and it was in fullscreen besides  arrrgh! but if you can get hold of a copy Maniac Cop 2 is a worthy night's viewing for action freaks and fans of coprelated carnage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Z'Dar returns as the super cop turned maniac cop Matt Cordell in this surprisingly good sequel to the surprisingly good 1988 horrorthriller Maniac Cop. This time however he's not alone in his fight against the police force as he's found an accomplice the local serial killer. This movie is probably the quintessential latenight video rental in the late 80's to early 90's  not only is it pure Bgrade schlock rubbish but it's a sequel to pure Bgrade schlock rubbish and you don't get much more Bmovie than that! except maybe a second sequel of course.The directing and writingproducing team of William Lustig and Larry Cohen return to helm this movie and do a good job as they did in the first. The acting in this film isn't good in fact certain scenes are downright embarrassing but you don't go into a sequel to an 80's schlock fest expecting great acting so it's forgivable. The majority of the cast from the first film met grisly ends but the two survivors Bmovie god Bruce Campbell and Laurene Landon reprise their roles. Unfortunately however their roles in the movie are little more than cameo appearances Bruce Campbell in particular is not at his charismatic best. In The Evil Dead films and a lot of his small cameos in bigger films Bruce approaches his roles with great heart and gusto and you can really tell that he's enjoying himself but here I was getting the impression that he couldn't be bothered. I got this impression somewhat with Bruce's performance the first film too. Of course his role in the Maniac Cop films is nothing like the Ash that we all know and love but Bmovie fans have come to expect a certain kind of performance from Bruce and that wasn't what he gave in the first movie. Naturally his mere presence is enough to make a film a must see though. Laurene Landon enjoys herself a bit more and gets to use the greatest melee weapon in the history of movies the chainsaw. The chainsaw is such a brilliant weapon it almost takes on a life of it's own. Any movie that utilises the chainsaw commands your respect even if it only gets a brief appearance as it does in this movie. The only other thing that returns from the first is the incredible tagline 'You have the right to remain silent...forever' which is quite simply one of the best taglines ever written.The rest of the cast is new to the series. Robert Davi who is a very good actor takes over Bruce Campbell as the new leading man. Davi portrays his character a hardbitten New York with a gruff voice and no messing persona brilliantly and very much looks the part. Also new is Claudia Christian who pretty much does what Laurene Landon did in the first film and Leo Rossi enters the fold as Matt Cordell's newfound friend who also happens to enjoy strangling strippers. Also watch out for blinkandyou'llmissit cameos from Danny Trejo and Sam Raimi.Just like in the first film a foreboding New York atmosphere is created which lends the film a creepy and distinct atmosphere particularly in the nighttime scenes. Also like the first film the sequel features several instances of lovely black humour portrayed best by Maniac Cop saving a man from a parking ticket and then taking the traffic officer away...literally on the back of his crane truck. The film also doesn't let up for a second it stays entertaining for the duration and the action comes thick and fast which ensures that the film stays entertaining. There is also a theme of justice and it's pitfalls which is heavily referred to at several points in the movie. Of course this point is lost somewhat under the violent gun battles but the fact that the movie is actually trying to convey a point is admirable from a film that you wouldn't expect any kind of meaning from.Overall Maniac Cop 2 is a lovely piece of Bgrade cinema. As a technical project it's pretty worthless but it's very entertaining and fans of this sort of film will find lots to like about it. As a fan of the original this sequel satisfied me and therefore I recommend this to anyone that is also a fan of the original.".

Bill Lustig does a terrific job with directing from the cult writer Larry Cohen script. Robert Davi is Fantastic as hardboiled Dectecive Sean Mckinneyhe makes me believe the unbelievable in a horror genre film. Watch his scenes with therapist would'nt be surprised if Sopranos was'nt influenced by this character trait as these films have a cult following Bruce Campbell has a cameo and is cool as you will see some fun casting choices throughout. the action is very well done and first rate only criticism is makeup on monster could have been much better although not bad by all means..fun film I highly recommend just to see Davi also number 3 where he reprises his role as McKinney ..".

	schema:reviewBody "The massive maniac cop has returned to the New York streets again this time with more taste for his fellow brothers and sisters in blue. After Jack Forrest Bruce Campbell and Teresa Mallory Laurene Landon defeat Matt Cordell Robert Z'Dar by drowning him in the river they think all is well. They're sent to Dr. Susan Riley Claudia Christian to prove their sanity and return to the force but before they're reinstated Jack is murdered and the force finally realizes they must accept the fact of Cordell's return and find a way to stop his murderous rampage all the while trying to put a stop to a serial killer who specializes in murdering strippers.After seeing the terrific original for the first time I decided to check out the sequels the first being Maniac Cop 2 1990 followed by Maniac Cop 3 Badge of Silence 1993. First things first however with the 2. Unlike many horror series the Maniac Cop trilogy maintains the same writing  directing team throughout all three installments. That's probably why it seems that the quality is maintained throughout as well. The everlikable William Lustig Maniac which reflected some of its sleaziness here and Larry Cohen It's Alive make a great team and it shows here and in their other projects like Uncle Sam 1997. Regardless of how entertaining this sequel is however it's not quite as good as the first which is to be expected 99 of the time. It's not the writing or the direction that makes it come up short. Both of those are just about equal to the first as they're by the same guys. It's not the story which is fairly cool. The teaming up of the murderers was something I've not really seen all that much before this. It's not even the acting which is as acceptable as any standard 80s slasher. No it's none of those things. What hurts Maniac Cop 2 the most. . . is a huge lack of The Bruce. Killing off Mr. Campbell one of the best actors of the horror business only fifteen or so minutes into the film is not a way to keep your fanbase happy. Bruce is a legend of the genre since his terrific showing in Sam Raimi's who made a brief appearance in the first Maniac Cop Evil Dead and to take him out so early was not so fun. Regardless the rest of the film was fun even without The Bruce. It was gritty violent and full of all the elements a horror fan could want boobs blood and big murderous giants. Highly recommended for fans of the first or anyone looking for a bloody good time.Obligatory horror elementsSexNudity As the serial killer loves to hack up hot strippers there's quite a bit of nudity throughout.ScaresSuspense Some good jump scares and there's a thrilling car scene but it's not as scary as the first.Mystery We know there's a secret to Cordell or else the story wouldn't be any different than the first but it's not really 'mystery.'  Final verdict 7.510. How did you know? AP3".

Cordell want's justice in his own warped and twisted way and that's to have his name cleared and those in the police department and NYC political hierarchy who set him up and had him convicted and sent to Sing Sing to be brought before the bar of justice.It's hard to be critical of the rampaging Maniac Cop Matt Cordell since he does have a reason for his actions even though a lot of the people that he murders in the film had nothing to do with his being sent to prison an innocent man. The movie brings out unlike the first Maniac Cop that Cordell was getting too close to exposing like another Frank Serpico corruption in the police and Mayors office.

At the same time Cordell executes a relentless vendetta against the nasty criminals who attacked him in prison.There's a monsterlike on the loose on the streets of NY and a Police Inspector Robert Davi and the police psychiatrist  Claudia Christian  set out in chasing him at whatever cost .This B movie contains shocks  violence  horror  chills  high bodycount and a lot of blood and guts . This is a grim gory and disturbing slasher sleace thriller with actionpacked entertainment and amusement .Although may be a little bit cheesy  the movie is full of action  including car chases pursuits and car leaps. Highlights of the movie are the creepy and eerie appearances by the terrible police officer who pulls off astonishing murders  including slashing and bloody shots in cold blood . Stars Robert ZDar who played the Maniac cop actually worked as a cop . Here Laurene Landon and Bruce Campbell have secondary intervention  in fact Bruce admitted that he only played the movie because he needed money as well as work  and that the picture was not any good .The original film was directed by William Lusting with Bruce Campbell Laurene Landon  Tom Atkins.

And Maniac cop 3 Badge of silence  this third one was a regrettably average entry in the series and also directed by William Lusting with Robert Davi  Paul Gleason Doug Savant  Robert Foster Julius Harris. And in production Maniac cop 2018 written by Larry Cohen . I recommended the movie Bruce Campbell fans and people who enjoy low budget pictures . The motion picture written by Larry Cohen was professionally directed by William Lusting the film is dedicated to the memory of Joe Spinell  Lusting's friend. This was the first of various cinematic collaborations with fellow maverick independient director Larry Cohen .

In fact this is one of Lustig's most impressivelooking and pacy movies blessed with a wealth of violent mayhem right from the offset which is a lot more entertaining than many of the socalled slasher movies being released at the time. Gore explosions naked strippers shootings and an ensemble cast help to make this film the best in the shortlived series and a solid entry for genre fans. Okay so the story is predictable and barely links together a string of setpieces and said setpieces are also familiar the police station massacre is almost a direct reprisal from the first movie but with better action but it's all done with style thanks to Lustig and is never less than watchable.Three actors reprise their roles from the original movie first up is the hulking Robert Z'Dar as the madman of the title looking more zombielike than ever this time around  he might as well be Jason from one of the later Friday the 13th movies in a uniform. Also back are Bruce Campbell the evergreat genre stalwart and Laurene Landon the two survivors of the original movie. The new hero this time is Robert Davi as a tough nothing new there good guy for a change with female support from Claudia Christian as a police psychologist. Michael Lerner offers strong support as Davi's corrupt boss and there are minor roles for Charles Napier Danny Trejo before he achieved fame as the vampiric bartender in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and even Sam Raimi in a cameo as a reporter. Also pretty good is Leo Rossi playing the depraved serial killer Turkell although his character is more stupid than scary.The acting is strong enough to carry the film throughout and even in some of the weaker moments you always know there's going to be a shooting a carchase or a fight in a few moments to relieve the tension. All of the action is wellcrafted and prolific making this movie of an action film than a horror when it comes down to it. Particularly good is the finale a pyromaniac's dream which makes excellent use of a couple of fireproof suits as the burning Cordell goes on a rampage of revenge against the prisoners who originally killed him in the shower all those years back. Never have burning people looked so good. Then there's an explosive conclusion although Lustig can't resist to put in a jokey and rather predictable epilogue which promises more mayhem from the uniformed zombie. MANIAC COP 2  perfect fare for an actionhorror junkie with undemanding tastes and one of Lustig's best.".

It may lack the freshness of the first movie but it delivers its seedy B movie thrills with great skill. It's extremely well paced and never ever boring. It begins with a reedited recap of the climax from Maniac Cop 1 and soon gets down to business with your standardissue convenience store confrontation. The stunts are very impressive and the cast is just littered with familiar faces who approach Larry Cohens' story with squarejawed conviction.Matt Cordell Robert Z'Dar naturally has survived and goes on to commit a new series of murders. Following his trail are a detective played by a coolerthancool Robert Davi Licence to Kill and a foxy police psychiatrist played by Claudia Christian The Hidden. Also on the loose is a serial killer of strippers named Turkell. Turkell is a chatty high energy guy who provides Cordell with a place to stay. The authorities represented by Michael Lerners' police commissioner still don't want the truth about Cordell to get out. And everything climaxes with an atmospheric showdown at Sing Sing where Cordell had spent his jail time.The cast also includes Clarence Williams III as an inmate facing death Charles Napier as a talk show host Robert Earl Jones father of James Earl Jones as a news vendor Cohen repertory player James Dixon as a range officer Danny Trejo in one of his frequent prestardom jailbird parts Frank Pesce as a strip club MC and Sam Raimi doing the cameo thing as a newscaster. Fans of Maniac Cop 1 will note with pleasure the presence of returnees Bruce Campbell and super sexy Laurene Landon no matter if their characters are treated in a typical slasher sequel fashion. Rossi is the standout in a role that would have gone to Joe Spinell had Spinell not passed away. The movie is dedicated to the late actor.The script overall isn't as good this time around but William Lustigs' direction is energetic and his movie can boast two major highlights a police station massacre that outdoes the similar scene in The Terminator for sheer viciousness and a sequence with the imperiled Christian handcuffed to a runaway car. Location work  in Times Square and other places  is excellent. Cordell is even more of a zombie this time around and his makeup is appropriately more ghoulish.A worthy viewing for horror and action fans.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a replay of the last few minutes from the original the camera moves across a scrap yard full of wrecked police cars as the credits roll eventually the camera stops on the front of a car and it's lights turn on the engine starts and it speeds away. It's Christmas in New York decorations are everywhere a man holds up a all night convenience store. However the maniac cop Officer Matt Cordell Robert Z'Dar is not dead and makes an appearance he kills the store clerk leaving the robber to be shot by the real N.Y. police when they arrive for a crime he didn't commit. Jack Forrest Bruce Campbell and Teresa Mallory Laurene Landon the two survivors from the original are ordered to see a N.Y.P.D. psychologist Susan Riley Claudia Christian by their boss following the events of the original. Their story that Matt Cordell is still alive seems unbelievable but Susan is kind of spooked by their claims. Before long more innocent New Yorkers are killed it soon becomes clear Jack and Teresa may not be as crazy as Commissioner Edward Doyle Micheal Learner who tries to cover the killings up had hoped. Susan teams up with Detective Sean McKinney Robert Davi who dresses in a long Columbo type coat and an Indiana Jones style fedora and convinces him Cordell is responsible. Meanwhile Cordell has befriended the slimy unlikeable Times Square serial killer Steve Turkell Leo Rossi who prays on strippers. It's up to McKinney and Susan to overcome the corruption lies and cover ups to unearth the truth as the undead Cordell continues to carries out a brutal revenge on those who made him what he is.Again directed by William Lustig this is a terrific and worthy sequel to the original. He directs some great action sequences here an exciting car chase through New York with a taxi on it's steel rims sparks flying everywhere he also throws in a couple more chases one involving Susan who is hand cuffed to the steering wheel of a runaway car from the outside she hangs on to the side of the car for her life with other cars and walls whizzing past. And a final chase toward the end where Cordell and Turkell steals a police van and start to ram the pursuing police cars off the road each sequence impressively handled by Lustig. The effects and stunt work are convincing Cordell walking around at the end his entire body engulfed in flames and a police station shootoutmassacre that's very similar to a sequence in James Cameron's The Terminator being another couple of standout scenes worth mentioning. There is lots of violence but not much blood and gore but whats there is fine. There is a bit of nudity as well as we visit some sleazy New York strip club. Written by Larry Cohen like the original he delivers another great highly entertaining script. It's extremely well paced it never gets boring and gives just enough screen time to the characters to develop without ever becoming dull. Mostly this time Cohen concentrates his script on Cordell's revenge and justice rather than just him mindlessly killing innocent victims. My only problem in this area is the ending which seemed rushed and is similar to the original in that it leaves the door wide open for yet another sequel which was made but comes nowhere near this and the original. And there's a silly scene in which Mallory tries to protect herself with a chainsaw Cordell stops the saw by gabbing it while it's still running I'm sorry but you can't stop a chainsaw by grabbing it it would have sliced his hand in two and I don't care how strong he is! Performances are good although Bruce Campbell and Laurene Landon reprise their roles from the original it's no more than a cameo appearance. Talking of cameos SpiderMan director Sam Raimi is in there somewhere too. Robert Davi looking cool in his fedora is a likable hero. A fantastic sequel fans of the original will love and horroraction fans in general should watch as soon as possible. I thought it was a fantastic film with much to enjoy. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this movie is not as great as the first movie that got released 2 years earlier it still is a more than worthy sequel that is simply good fun to watch. The story is not as solid and tense or mysterious as the movie. In the first movie it's still being kept somewhat of a mystery who or what the killer exactly is. In this movie that of course is not the case anymore. It sort of gives the Cordell character even more room to just randomly kill a whole bunch of people though his anger gets still aimed toward the police force.But they even threw in another serial killer this time. Guess it's not entirely necessary but it at the same time also prevents the movie from being a typical slasher flick with a standard story.It's a direct sequel to the first movie and it basically takes place the next day or so after the events of the first movie. It also features Bruce Campbell and Laurene Landon who were the main leads in the previous movie. The leads in this movie are however still being played by some different actors I guess to avoid to making this movie a rehash of the first one. Robert Davi and Claudia Christian are the new leads this time. Of course Robert Z'Dar is also back again as Matt Cordell. He's still an awesome main villain. It is true though that Robert Davi and Claudia Christian get somewhat pushed to the background due to the movie its focus. So the movie is perhaps lacking a good real main 'hero'.It's not really necessary to watch the first movie. This movie on its one can be perfectly watched as a standalone one also not in the least due to the extensive use of flashback sequences containing scenes from the first movie explaining all of the events prior to what happened in this movie its story and even explains Cordell history pretty much all over again.Bascily what makes this movie mostly so perfectly watchable is the fact that it's being fun. It's not as serious as the standard slasherflick and it also features some good action once more which was one of the most surprising things about the first movie as well. It's also directed by the same director William Lustig again who also went on and direct the third movie in the series.A good and fun sequel to the great first movie!710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Finally the station house massacre is a great lowbudget homage toripoff of The Terminator's similar scene.Anyway I finally got to see the original a couple of years later and found it a great disappointment. But then I saw Dr Phibes Rises Again first and then missed the high camp element when I later caught the original Abominable Dr. Phibes.In an interview about a decade ago Lustig talked about casting Z'Dar. Lustig had seen the massive actor in The Night Stalker and was totally creeped out by him. Lustig recalled he was actually scared to death during the early stages of their first meeting.Amazing that they chose Z'Dar of all people to replace Roddy Piper when they did the sequel to Hell Comes to Frogtown!".

I think to fully appreciate the more intelligent war films you almost have to know the battle in detail going in. The movie uses dialogue to try and explain whats happening but its extremely hard to conceptualize without the aid of graphics. I'm not saying you won't enjoy this film without a firm grasp of the battle details only that you will enjoy it much more if you are able to do a little reading beforehand. Either way see it. I am truly amazed by the depth of feeling all these guys were able to put into this project. Daniels and Berenger in particular give Oscar caliber performances. A total home run.".

From the first time I saw it it exemplified a personal theory that women until very recently rarely see men at their very finest and that is unfortunately often obviously not alwaysin battle. The courage commitment and humanity that this movie portrays on both sides of the conflict moves me to tears every time and the humanity is key. I don't know enough about the battle to point out any glaring historical inaccuracies but the acting was exemplary across the board with Jeff Daniels outstanding. The battle at Little Round Top is one of the finest movie scenes I've witnessed. I particularly like the expressions of respect and awe on the faces of Chamberlin's men when he tells them to fix bayonets. What's striking is that there was no good choice there was a clear and compelling objective in a much bigger picture and this schoolteacher rose to the challenge and his men went with him. This movie conveys a lotthrough the long philosophical discourses and the actionabout how people behave when they are inextricably joined with other people for a cause that they don't fully understand charged with a responsibility that no individual should bear and with the desire mainly to return to the way things were before. It conveys a lot about true leadership and sacrifice. It conveys that individual choices and motivations always impact others sometimes on huge scales. Guys I don't know if you can convince your wivesgirlfriends to cuddle up with this film but I would make the attempt there are obviously very ugly things that people did to each other in this and any conflict but if I ever got a sense of the nobility of men and their push in this world it was from this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been reading all the other comments pro  con with great interest and I just have to add my voice to the pro side for this ambitious and stirring epic. Gettysburg is indeed one of my all time top 10 movies. I was especially curious to see it on initial theatrical release because of the casting of Martin Sheen as Lee were I to cast a civil war movie the name Martin Sheen would NEVER have entered my mind as an appropriate performer for this makeorbreak role. To my astonishment Sheen was MAGNIFICENT in his portrayal of Lee in appearance demeanor and aura of command Sheen COMPLETELY sold me. A stunning performance from an unexpected casting choice. I agree that Gods  Generals would have benefited from Sheen's recasting though Duvall did his best with the more limited part he was given.Yeah I agree that the script tended to a lot of bloviation and speechifying by the principals. I do think we need to make allowance for the fact that in this pretechnological 19th century era portrayed people DID communicate in ways that seem artificial and awkward by our standards. This was a time when oratory whether in churches politics or general discourse was valued both as communication and entertainment. So even if the dialogue got a bit overblown I was more than willing to cut the production some slack. The beards were a problem for me also especially poor Tom Berenger's. Still he like ALL the lead actors transcended the limitations and delivered what resonated for me as a credible interpretation of the time and situation. MANY details of the movie can be nitpicked and of course those determined to hate Gettysburg can always find a reason rational or not. I was BLOWN AWAY by the quality and passion of this movie from my first theatrical viewing and it was one of the very first DVD's I purchased. After multiple viewings all 4 hours I'm still impressed and grateful that Ted Turner had the desire and ambition to tackle such a BIG project that would be sniped at from all corners for eternity. My goodwill extends to the much weaker but still defensible Gods and Generals if they go ahead and produce The Last Full Measure I promise I'll be first in line at the movie theater AND preorder the DVD! 10 out of 10!".

From Little Round Top to Seminary Ridge you see the events where they actually occurred 140 years ago. It is a singular achievement and Ted Turner deserves credit for making it happen.Two characters dominate the film Jeff Daniels in one of his finest performances is a likable totally believable Col.

Chamberlain and Longstreet provide the film it's focus as honorable men attempting to fulfill their duty while the carnage builds around each of them. Other memorable performances include Sam Elliott in a brief but memorable cameo as Brig. Gen.

Robert Duvall who assumed the role in GODS AND GENERALS would be far more credible as Lee.The sheer numbers of the battle are staggering over 150000 combatants with 53000 dead more in a single threeday engagement than were lost during the entire war in Vietnam. The armies of actors extras and recreators could not nearly match those numbers yet the film effectively conveys the immensity of the conflict. The tactical errors Lee's decision on the third day of battle to order Pickett's suicidal charge into the Union guns Meade's decision drawing the fury of President Lincoln to allow the Southern survivors to return home without further slaughter while a humane gesture probably lengthening the war are presented within the context of of the overall conflict providing the viewer with justification for their decisions.Director Ronald F.

The prologue makes the objectives of the two armies clear and the 'updates' in the form of dialogue between the commanders mean the viewer doesn't lose sight of the course of events. The battle scenes capture the terrible beauty of combat conveying terror claustrophobia and violence without being too horrific.More important the film makes the most of the remarkably rich characters who took part. My only hope is that Col. Chamberlain was as intelligent humane and courageous in life as Jeff Daniels's performance. This is just one example and there are many men one would like to know more about as a result of seeing this.The one question I was left with came from Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee. I know Lee had been unwell before the battle but Martin Sheen seems strangely remote from events with a glazed look in his eye and highpitched 'other worldly' voice. Is this fair and accurate? At least Lee has the moral courage to say It's all my fault when he sees the result of Pickett's Charge. I don't remember Douglas Haig saying that after the first day on the Somme in 1916.".

	schema:headline " Not the best but a great representation of the epic battle of the Civil War";
	schema:reviewBody "All I hear is people griping about how long this film is.  That's not the point.  The point is it represents what is considered by historians to be the most important battle of the American Civil War.I will admit that the length of the film kinda takes away from it but it is nonetheless good. Save a few historical gaffes eg. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine at Picket's Charge  in reality they were being held in reserve near the Round Tops with the rest of the V Corps this film is very realistic using thousands of professional reenactors to fight the battle scenes which adds to it.Many battles and side notes were left out eg. Vincent was mortally wounded on Little Round Top or did they mention this I don't remember but that is okay given the film focuses on Joshua L. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine who saved the day at Little Round Top on July 2. Skirmishes at the Herr Tavern McPherson's Hill Little Round Top and Picket's Charge were all the fighting I remember.  But again this doesn't really take anything away. The sweep and grandeur is helped by the superb cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum and great acting on the part of Tom Berenger Longstreet Martin Sheen Lee Jeff Daniels Chamberlain C. Thomas Howell Tom Chamberlain Sam Elliot Buford and the rest of the superb cast.  A standout is the late Richard Jordan  as Lewis Armistead the brigade commander in Picket's division who was killed leading his troops over the top against Union artillery. The battle scenes are excellent Picket's Charge in real time is superb but the furious battle for Little Round Top is one of the most desperate battle scenes ever filmed.  You can feel the fear and tension of the 20th Maine as the 44th Alabama I believe this is correct charges up the hill again and again.  When Chamberlain and his men finally sweep their opponents off the hill? I think that it may have been good to portray the charging Confederates as well since they had many interesting stories among them e.g. the commander of the 44th William Oates had a brother John who had been ill with a fever and refused to stay behind and was mortally wounded in the carnage and the heroics of such people as Vincent himself and Patrick O'Rourke who led his New York regiment in a counterattack that saved Vincent's right flank and was killed in the charge are neglected but I'm not complaining. Despite the length and a few overdramatic speeches this is a great movie. Seven out of ten.".

	onyx:emotionText "All I hear is people griping about how long this film is.  That's not the point.  The point is it represents what is considered by historians to be the most important battle of the American Civil War.I will admit that the length of the film kinda takes away from it but it is nonetheless good. Save a few historical gaffes eg. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine at Picket's Charge  in reality they were being held in reserve near the Round Tops with the rest of the V Corps this film is very realistic using thousands of professional reenactors to fight the battle scenes which adds to it.Many battles and side notes were left out eg. Vincent was mortally wounded on Little Round Top or did they mention this I don't remember but that is okay given the film focuses on Joshua L. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine who saved the day at Little Round Top on July 2. Skirmishes at the Herr Tavern McPherson's Hill Little Round Top and Picket's Charge were all the fighting I remember.  But again this doesn't really take anything away.

	schema:headline " Vivid well worth seeing faithful to bookheartbreaking ending";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie picks up steam as it goes along  leading to its wrenching end as did the battle.  The performance of Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead must be singled out for praise  his anguish was very moving. I'd loved the actor in The Friends of Eddie Coyle and what a job he does. It helps that he's given the best lines in the movie. Martin Sheen as Robt. E. Lee is not the first name that would come to mind  but I think he gave a fine performance  his accent was entrancing. Sam Elliott is perfectly chosen as and wonderfully played the western General John Buford. I also think Jeff Daniels was absolutely wonderful  conveying so well the different manner of someone who until a year before had been a civilian professor not a colonel. Unfortunately although I'm generally a fan of Tom Berenger I wasn't particularly moved by any scene he was in  he kind of walks through it.The movie is written so well  and its pace just fine. There are so many interesting scenes touching on many different aspects of life and war  from the nature of man and race to the paradox of a general loving his army yet having to sacrifice it. Jordan brought home so well the closeness of the senior officers to those on the other side. I loved how well they showed the varied purposes for fighting of the different armies and the occasional reference to a perceived resentment by the Union soldiers over what they saw as Confederate pretensions to higher social class. They're so arrogant etc.. The music is first rate  and definitely enhances the drama. The depiction seems quite authentic. Some niggling criticisms aside from the map at the start of the movie there is none. Maps would definitely have helped to undeerstand the overall picture. People commonly refer to directions from the norht from the west etc. or we must flank them to the right and it's hard to understand if you haven't read about the battle.The scene with the runaway slave is too abbreviated from the book  it doesn't have much impact in the movie. Kevin Conway's dialogue and accent was a bit over the top and the English military attache was rather clicheed.For all that General Hancock is referenced we see very little of him.We see the diatribe by General Trimble against General Ewell  but without seeing anything of that battle or Ewell ever it just hangs there  rather than being part of any continuous story. In the book Ewell's and Early's conduct is more discussed  including a wonderful scene by the two with Lee. If they weren't going to discuss that side of the battle they should have left Trimble's wellplayed trembling anger out of the story  it doesn't belong in this movie.Gen. Longstreet is the star of the book and movie  yet I never sensed from Berenger the great brooding quality and he wasn't given any reference to the fact that his thre children had just died that he has throughout the battle  according to the book. Similarly Gen. Lee's health his heart and headaches etc. is a constant factor  not shown in the movie.Despite the criticisms this is a wonderfully done movie  from a Pulitzer Prize winning book. It's long  but quite clear and very deeply moving. I defy anyone to see the last 12 hour and not have tears in their eyes. I'd very strongly recommend this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know the Civil War is a very 'american' thing so i hope folks won't mind me poking my British nose onto the board. I got Gettysburg from Blockbuster on 2 video tapes  watched it in 1 go though I gather it was made for tv in 2 instalments. Utterly watchable and yes very moving especially when you consider it was actually filmed on the very ground where so many brave men fought more than 140 years ago. Just imagine what those soldiers would've made of it? I wonder if they realised their struggle would become part of history? From what I know of the Civil War the battle and command decisions were faithfully recreated with none of the banal subplots ridiculous love interests and fictionalised scenes so beloved of Hollywood. It was also wonderful to see the massed infantry composed of real human beings without a hint of CGI. Pickett's Charge was incredibly poignant especially as 'we' know what the outcome will be. I noted there isn't a single actress in the film. Apologies to all ladies out there but that's the way it really was. ALL the actors gave fine performances particularly the always great Tom Berenger as General Longstreet. I could feel the strain of 'command' every time he was on screen. I've always felt Robert E Lee was the finest general the USA ever produced. Such a tragic irony he ended up fighting against it. By the way Lee was originally offered command of the Union army but declined out of loyalty to his beloved Virginia. That's the way many americans felt back then. They saw their nationality as their State. Martin Sheen gave a 1st class performance though I personally wish the role had gone to a taller and sorry Martin more distinguised actor. Lee was an intellectual and a gentleman. His troops followed him from respect and love whereas Grant's soldiers were motivated by respect and fear. A subtle difference but important. There are faults with this film. Firstly I was slightly irritated it keeps alive the myth that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves. A nice idea but untrue. Slavery was an obscenity but that wasn't why the war was fought. It was fought to either preserve or end the Union depending on which side a person was. By the way Abraham Lincoln  US Grant both came from slaveowning families! Another fault with this film is the almost complete abscence of blood 'gore' and real suffering. All the hundreds of extras look remarkably fit and healthy. In actual fact both sides but particularly the Confederacy suffered appaling squalor hunger disease and misery. There were no medics back then no morphine no helicopter casevacs just the slim chance of an illtrained  probably drunk surgeon turning up with a dirty saw and a bottle of whisky for anaesthetic. Vast numbers of injured men died from infected wounds or were simply left where they fell. I wished the film had shown a bit more of the 'down side' to war. And then there were the beards. Oh God. Anyone who's seen the women at the stoning in Monty Python's Life of Brian will know what I mean. Most high scholl drama prop boxes contain more convincing false beards than the ridiculous items Berenger  Sheen were wearing. Martin Sheen looked like a mall Santa  Tom Berenger's was just surreal. Anyway. The strengths of this film far outweigh its faults. I remember seeing a US Army newsreel shot in the 1930s which filmed the Civil War 75th anniversary reunion. A small number of very elderly veterans from both sides gathered in friendship. It's such a shame so many fine men died in this dreadful conflict.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning  Somewhat of a spoiler on historical points.As a civil war buff I can tell you that this is the best movie ever made of the civil war perhaps the best war movie of all time and possibly one of the best movies of all time.  I find it enjoyable to rewatch frequently.The movie is surprisingly historically accurate.  I have read over two hundred books on the civil war and I can tell you with at least a little authority that the three main characters in the movie deserve their treatment.The first character is Tom Berenger giving a superb portrayal of Lieutenant General James Pete Longstreet a Confederate corps commander.  For the benefit of those who are not that familiar with civil war history the monumental battle of Gettysburg occurred just past the halfway point of the war.  Significantly it occurred after the death of CSA Lieutenant General Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson.  Longstreet graduated to General Lee's most trusted lieutenant.  The movie accurately portrays the tug of wills between Longstreet and Lee.  It is historical fact that Longstreet argued against invasion of the North agreeing to it only after getting some vague assurance from Lee that the battle would be defensively fought.  It is fact that Longstreet argued for an attack around the Union's left flank if there was to be an attack at all.  Finally it is undeniable fact that Longstreet argued with Lee so vehemently against the final failed attack that he later wrote that he thought he had stepped over the military line and would be relieved of command.  I don't see how Berenger could have done a better job and I am still upset that he received no Academy Award recognition.  I would imagine that Americans from the South are a little uncomfortable about Longstreet being right and the supposedly lovable Lee being wrong.  But history is history.  I should mention that Longstreet is my favorite Confederate Officer.Martin Sheen does only a fairish job of portraying General Robert E. Lee. He seems to have only one facial expression that of pain and worry. Perhaps that is understandable considering that Gettysburg was such a Confederate disaster but I believe it was overdone.  What I do find interesting is that historians are coming more and more to the realization that Lee was not such a great general and perhaps not even a very good one. Looking at this movie unbiasedly you can't help but get that impression yourself.Jeff Daniels playing the character of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain does a job that is every bit as good as Berenger's portrayal of Longstreet. Chamberlain was very much the Union hero as portrayed in this movie so Northern Americans may especially like this movie.  Chamberlain did in fact win the Congressional Medal of Honor for his performance during the Battle of Gettysburg.  A nonregular military man a non West Point graduate Chamberlain went on to great glory even after Gettysburg.  Promoted all the way up to Major twostar General Chamberlain was more than with Grant at the final surrender of Lee at Appomattox Court House as pointed out by another reviewer.  He was given the singular honor of officially receiving the surrender and parole of Confederate troops three days after Lee's negotiated surrender and well after Lieutenant General Grant had left for Washington.  He also won recognition for his dramatic salute to the defeated Confederate soldiers that both Union and Confederate people of the time appreciated.The movie is beautifully choreographed with thousands of extras many most or perhaps even all being professional reenactors. It gave the movie a realism lacking in many other war movies.  The pathos of some of the Officers was palpable and made one sad whether of Union or Confederate sympathy.  The musical score was memorable.  I give it a ten out of ten and I for one enjoyed the length of the movie which is admittedly long at just over four hours.Rent this movie.  You will learn a great deal of American history and have a good time doing so.".

	schema:headline " Gettysburg and Reenactors";
	schema:reviewBody "I just want to respond to the criticism of this movie's use of Civil War reenactors as extras. Yes the average reenactor is a heck of lot older and fatter than was the average Civil War soldier. Reenactors are great at dressing as Civil War soldiers but most of them don't LOOK anything like Civil War soldiers who were very young men reduced to sinew and bone from physical exertion and poor diet. Also reenactors are not professional actors or stunt men which is very evident in this movie. In some scenes you can actually see some of them staring into the camera while everyone else is looking off in another direction. Also their embarrassing attempts to recreate handtohand combat during the finale of Pickett's Charge are just pathetic to watch. Not to mention the melodramatic deaths and the guys grinning like Cheshire Cats while they're supposed to be acting as in fear of their lives.However there is NO way Gettysburg could have been made without reenactors. In order to give the movie's battle scenes an epic look it needed several thousand extras and this film didn't have anyway near the budget to afford professional extras or travel overseas to rentout a small European army as Hollywood films used do to. Heck the production company couldn't even afford a decent makeup department which is obvious from those awful fake looking beards let alone hire hundreds of professional extras costume them and train them. Reenactors despite their faults made this movie possible by working for free and by bringing their own uniforms equipment knowledge of Civil War tactics and enthusiasm for this project. It was either use the services of reenactors or no movie about the battle of Gettysburg was going to be made.While Gettysburg could not have been made without reenactors I do feel director Ronald Maxwell could have done a better job of filming around some of the more ridiculous looking ones. Instead he almost seems to revel in showing off the fattest and oldest of the bunch the first Confederate soldier with a speaking part is a man over 60 yrs old who had to be at least 300lbs! Now how can anyone believe that this man marched 20 miles a day in June heat while carrying a 50lb pack? Supposedly Maxwell has learned from his mistakes. While he is justifiably proud of Gettysburg he was not deaf to the guffaws at all those chubby Rebs and geriatric Yanks. Thus for the upcoming Gods and Generals his casting directors were ordered to be much choosier in deciding which reenactors will be in that movie. In other words they were ordered to cull out the fatbodies and oldsters.Despite being a big fan of this movie I can recognize the weaknesses of using reenactors as extras in a period war film. However anyone who applauds the fact that Gettysburg was ever made must also commend the dedication of those reenactors who made its creation possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie years ago on TNT and I thought very well of it.  I thought it to be a bit long but other than that it was a very good movie with an excellent cast.  After visiting the actual battlefield in early June I suggest to you anyone that has a chance to do so it is a great experience my interest was renewed.  Sitting on top of the little round top and looking down and around the hill I could envision the 20th Maine.  Looking over the grounds where Pickett's Charge took place I could hear the canon's thunder and the bullets flying by.This movie captures the essence of the battle and it has to be long in order to do so.  The torment of the Generals was more than apparent throughout the movie.  The emotions run deep and the actors did a very good job of conveying them.  The soundtrack complemented the movie a 100 and gave the right accents at the right moments.  The cinematography was awesome and accurate since a lot was filmed on location.  The acting is great and the reenactors should also be praised for their participation.If you watch this movie and criticize its historical inaccuracies you will miss the point.  It does the best job it can to give you the feel and overview of the entire battle.  You will be crying at some point for all the men lost in vain in the civil war. The most terrible kind of war in which brothers relatives or friends face each other with the intend to kill each other.  You will also realize the heavy burden of the officers leading their men to a battle where their death is most surely waiting.Above all the film will tell us how insane we are as a human race.  We organize ourselves and develop weapons in order to mass destruct each other. Over 50000 men died in three days how many mothers wives and families were destroyed as a consequence is something for all of us to think about. One thing is certain it is a very high price to pay for any cause no matter how sacred' or right' this cause may be.Look at me I am mumbling on with my emotions and thoughts that have emanated from the movie.  Watch the movie for all its shortcomings it is still right up there with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.".

I would probably appreciate this movie even more if I did know more about that horrible conflict. Being familiar with all the small towns surrounding Gettsyburg wouldn't hurt.The movie is wellacted nicely filmed and has some memorable scenes. My only complaints are that some of the action scenes go on too long and I didn't appreciate the plug for Darwin's evolutionary theories which had no place in this film. However this is a Turner Pictures film and the Turner is outspoken atheist Ted Turner it's no surprise we get this thrown in our faces.Otherwise they stuck to the war story. It was interesting how they portrayed Robert E. Lee. They make him look a little stupid in his strategy but also gave him a compassionate look and you couldn't help but feel sorry for the man. Actually all the officers on both sides were portrayed fairly as nothing but good and brave men.Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain had the best role and came off looking the best. It may be Daniels' best work ever too. Martin Sheen was outstanding as Lee. Kudos to Tom Berenger Lt. Gen. James Longstreet and Richard Jordan Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead for their performances too.It's a quality show filmed on the Gettysburg sites too. Although there are a few long fight scenes this is not a bloody film. Languagewise this probably holds the record for the most usage of the word damn but that's it profanitywise.I wouldn't let the length of this movie prohibit you from watching it. You can always break it up into segments over a couple of days.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very interesting take on the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 which is unfortunately marred by its excessive length well over four hours which could easily have been cut by at least an hour if unnecessary marching scenes were cut out. I timed one point in the movie when a full six minutes went by showing nothing but troops marching. This was absolutely tedious!There isn't much drama involved in this. How can there be? Everyone knows the Battle of Gettysburg we all know that the North won and serious students of the Civil War know most of the military manoeuvres that were used as well as the fates of the major combatants. So it was up to the director Ronald F. Maxwell and the various actors to give us something of a unique spin to hold our attention through the long story. For the most part they were successful.I was quite intrigued by Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Robert E. Lee. Lee comes across almost in a mystical way  a man of vision and courage and yet also very human. The debates between Lee and General James Longstreet played by Tom Berenger over strategy were realistic and the fact that Longstreet was proved for the most part to be right demonstrate the fact that Lee  while a great General  was subject to human failings as well. Sheen portrays a Lee who is coming to terms with his hero status among his troops but also shows him subtly uncomfortable with it.Also interesting was the constant hearkening back to the prewar relationship between Union general Winfield Hancock Brian Mallon and Confederate General Lewis Armistead Richard Jordan. Good friends before the war almost brothers as both describe the relationship they now find themselves on opposite sides of this great battle wanting to see each other because they are friends and yet not wanting to see each other as enemies. Tears well up in both as they speak to fellow officers about the relationship. A believable portrayal of how many Americans must have felt in this conflict which divided friends and families.Most interesting of all though was the portrayal of General Joshua Chamberlain by Jeff Daniels the colonel of the 20th Maine Infantry. I was only vaguely familiar with Chamberlain when I first saw this movie and was motivated by it to become more familiar with a truly fascinating individual. Hardly a classic soldier he was a university professor of English and Religion back in Maine Chamberlain displays a solid grasp of tactics and comes across as the great Northern hero in this account of Gettysburg.So there are a lot of good things in this movie. Don't let the length of over four hours put you off. Although there are a few tedious scenes such as the marching scene I described earlier it's worth hanging in through them to get a very realistic and largely historically accurate picture of perhaps the greatest battle of the US Civil War.610".

I admit some scenes were a bit drawn out but so were the yoda scenes in star wars but do people hate star wars because there are a few less than exciting scenes in the movie? No!!!!!!! We watch them once to get their jist and then fastforward them. The casting and acting were great. Too many overhead shots on picket's charge? They were trying to give people an idea of just how many people were involved in this battle you can say 15 000 but when you see it it amazes you that they could all do this in such uniformity. The special effects were descent. I hate movies with so much OBVIOUSLY computergenerated graphics some is ok but when half the movie is computers it takes away from it. The score was EXCELLENT. This is one of my all time favorite movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Gettysburg you will know everything about the battle. Where the armies marched who attacked where the fighting took place etc. Facts are very precise. You will also find out how the chain of command works from the highest general to the men fighting of the front row. Anybody interested in military history has plenty to learn and won't feel the 4 hours of the movie. One of the good points of the screenplay is that it keeps coming on the discussions between general Lee and lieutenant general Longstreet  what those two officers decided is indeed a main point. Those who are not fond of strategy will perhaps appreciate very spectacular combat scenes like the assault on Little Round Top or the charge of the Pickett division. They may also like the performances of the actors. Martin Sheen Tom Berenger Sam Elliott Jeff Daniels... All are very believable Civil War officers. They don't just act they also managed to have a physical aspect close to the historical characters. In the end there are only two reproaches to be made to Gettysburg. The first is about the music  sometimes there is too much of it. The second is about the speech of colonel Chamberlain to the mutinous soldiers from Maine. I don't really know how officers cheered troops reluctant to fight. But this speech looks like a clich when you hear it. Those two drawbacks are very minor fortunately. The movie is anyway very good  it is not up to anybody to keep interest going for 4 hours.".

The supporting cast is no less great in their roles which really carries the film.The battle scenes are some of the most stirring ever seen on film and my father still cannot watch the Pickett's Charge segment without tearing up. The accompanying music throughout the movie also lends to what is quite possibly one of the top ten movies of all time.I highly recommend this movie to everyone historywar buff or not.

The movie could not have been made without the reenactors and for the most part they do an outstanding job.

As a result you just don't know how much else was made up or bent to fit.Also the movie doesn't have any sense of proportion.  The coverage of the first day focused on a valiant defense by one group but there's barely a hint that any other men are doing more than composing their next oratory endeavor.Definitely a film for Americans to watch if they want to remake their history into something even more epic than it already is.

They secured close to five hours of screen time to cover just a few days an opportunity to go from the epic trajectory the closed saga to the openended momentathand.And isn't this as much as anything else what captivates about the Civil War? At so many junctures things could have gone wildly different. Staying on Gettysburg what if Ewell had taken the high ground on that first day? There is a rich story the one jotted in so much Civil War literature and yet at every point indeterminate horizons suggest parallel universes to ponder. But how to exemplify this as cinematic horizon?A striking moment early in the film is where Lee with his aides is startled to hear artillery in the distance what Lee doesn't know yet is that Southern troops a few miles ahead have run into Union cavalry and the battle has started. Lee turns and asks whose artillery is that.So here's a war where the commanding general has no way of knowing and has to wait for someone to ride all the way there to find out and ride all the way back to report. Can you imagine the eternity of waiting? Of just hearing sounds of war but not knowing just what it means? But this would require a wholly different film one that goes where the historian can't with his pen and captures confused humans for whom there is no 'Battle of Gettysburg' yet and all that noise beyond the trees is not yet decisive fate.I dream about a Gettysburg film that conveys the density of destiny not with speechifying but with spatial density. That isn't full of rousing music over senseless war. That explores the rich possibilities of sound and space concealment and presence one that is as gruelling to watch as it must have been for a young Union boy staring at the woods for hours waiting for rebels to materialize. This is too palatable. Too educative.".

	schema:reviewBody "Abraham's Valley may be the most extraordinary achievement of Portuguese cinema which confirms that Manoel de Oliveira is among the world's greatest filmmakers capable of creating an unmistakably personal style and sensibility while depicting the human condition. I agree with the first comment which pointed out that one cannot speak of a direct adaptation of Flaubert's novel but it should also be mentioned that de Oliveira  comparable to Robert Bresson and his film versions of Dostoyevsky's works  conveys the theme into his very own microcosm and leaves the source material behind while at the same time maintaining key elements of the narrative and the ambivalence of the main character. The rigid and formal aestheticism which de Oliveira had been developing throughout his long career doesn't require camera movements and stands out due to a brilliant sense for composition that actually seems to owe a lot to the staging techniques of early silent cinema as well as the eclectic rigours of C. T. Dreyer and StraubHuillet. The few times the camera moves it creates an amazing effect on the viewer as if de Oliveira were reinventing the effect.The antique interior decorations and the spellbinding landscape of the Douro valley reshape the overall baroque but vital feel of a film which is constantly guided by an omniscient voice over that funds Flaubert's Emma and the one played by Leonor Silveira. Abraham Valley is in my opinion one of the most beautiful and authentic masterpieces of recent decades but since the critical world doesn't seem to give much credit to Portuguese cinema in general aside those coproductions which feature international stars the viewer might be lucky enough to catch this film during a retrospective at a cinematheque.".

It's the story of an intelligent and sensitive young woman brought up in the frame of the society of mid20th century northern Portugal in an atmosphere of bigotry and social stagnation who marries a man she does not love and whose life has no way out. The plot develops itself in old rural mansions under the eyes of a silent witness the deafanddumb servant Ritinha who sees everything and understands everything without speaking or intervening by any means but forming with Ema the main character a strong union of love and mutual understanding. The visual images develop themselves in a slow poetic movement which is Oliveira's favourite. The scenery however is beautifully located in the Portuguese river Douro one of the most beautiful rivers in the world.".

This is a good film to fall asleep and then watch it sleeping. The process in which the narrative is constructed is very similar to other great Oliveira's masterpieces. As a film that you can watch sleeping I do not pretend to make my statement as cynical as some would guess.

You might remember him as the block of wood who won out over the monkey in King Kong. He must have gained some talent as he aged he's much more handsome at this point and has an effortless charm reminiscent of Clark Gable. Roland Young plays his rival.

She had worked with both before Menjou in Morocco and Grant in Blonde Venus. She liked Menjou and sad to say MGM wouldn't make him available. At the time she and Cary Grant did not get along all that well he played the other man in Blonde Venus. But in the interim he had gotten superstardom so Dietrich thought that Grant might prove to be a good screen partner now. Alas that screen team was never to be.Marlene and her maid Theresa Harris arrive in New Orleans where from the outset it's made plain to the viewer that Dietrich is out to hook a rich fish from the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. The one she looks to land is rich and fussy Roland Young and she does bait a trap for him. But a roistering sea captain played by Bruce Cabot spoils it all for her though eventually Young falls for her as expected.Now if you can't figure out who she winds up with there's something terribly wrong with you.Cabot does give a strong performance as the captain I'm sure he was a rougher type than Cary Grant would have been. Of course as was usual with Marlene and her leading man the obligatory affair was had. But she also said she found Cabot to be something of a boor and dropped him quickly.Theresa Harris had a very interesting and unusual role for a black actress of the time.

She's nobody's fool in this film and even gets a love interest of sorts in Young's driver Clarence Muse.The film did get an Oscar nomination for Best ArtInterior Direction and the sets were grand.

	schema:headline " Marlene Dietrich and Rene Clair...ooh la la!";
	schema:reviewBody "You see a wedding dress floating in the ocean and the story begins of how it came to be there. Marlene Dietrich lives basically upon the kindness and generosity of men. She sets her sights on Roland Young from Topper who has scads of money. She also has a particular habit of fainting which she uses to her advantage whenever it serves her purpose or whenever she doesn't know else to get out of a particular situation. Roland starts to pursue her but doesn't realize he was already picked from the beginning. She tries to be hard to get but just enough to get what she wants.Enter Bruce Cabot who of course meets her in such a way as to antagonize her without them actually seeing each other. When her plans get mixed up with Roland and her reputation gets compromised by a rumor she resorts to drastic measures.I had never seen this and loved it obviously by my rating. Marlene and Bruce's chemistry its use of time and place the imagery and colors of the clothes of the time and its expressive grand music made for the most perfect 80 minutes spent on a movie in a long time.Featuring a slew of recognizable faces including Mischa Auer Andy Devine Franklin Pangborn Melville Cooper Laura Hope Crews Aunt Pittypat from Gone with the Wind Anne Revere Oscar winner for National Velvet as the mother and Eddie Quillan this is one movie not to be missed.Eddie Quillan? You don't know him? Sure you do. You've seen him. You just didn't know it. He was a prolific supporting actor in movies in bit parts like this one and also made memorable appearances in 50s and 60s TV shows like The Addams Family. His most famous role was probably that in The Grapes of Wrath. Directed by Rene Clair who also made Le Million which I reviewed and A Nous La Liberte some say that is his masterpiece but I have yet to see but will this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!".

	onyx:emotionText "You see a wedding dress floating in the ocean and the story begins of how it came to be there. Marlene Dietrich lives basically upon the kindness and generosity of men. She sets her sights on Roland Young from Topper who has scads of money. She also has a particular habit of fainting which she uses to her advantage whenever it serves her purpose or whenever she doesn't know else to get out of a particular situation. Roland starts to pursue her but doesn't realize he was already picked from the beginning. She tries to be hard to get but just enough to get what she wants.Enter Bruce Cabot who of course meets her in such a way as to antagonize her without them actually seeing each other. When her plans get mixed up with Roland and her reputation gets compromised by a rumor she resorts to drastic measures.I had never seen this and loved it obviously by my rating. Marlene and Bruce's chemistry its use of time and place the imagery and colors of the clothes of the time and its expressive grand music made for the most perfect 80 minutes spent on a movie in a long time.Featuring a slew of recognizable faces including Mischa Auer Andy Devine Franklin Pangborn Melville Cooper Laura Hope Crews Aunt Pittypat from Gone with the Wind Anne Revere Oscar winner for National Velvet as the mother and Eddie Quillan this is one movie not to be missed.Eddie Quillan? You don't know him? Sure you do. You've seen him. You just didn't know it. He was a prolific supporting actor in movies in bit parts like this one and also made memorable appearances in 50s and 60s TV shows like The Addams Family. His most famous role was probably that in The Grapes of Wrath. Directed by Rene Clair who also made Le Million which I reviewed and A Nous La Liberte some say that is his masterpiece but I have yet to see but will this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!";

	schema:reviewBody "French director Rene Clair went to Hollywood to direct German Marlene Dietrich in this role where she played a conartist known as the Countess andor Lili. The story is set in New Orleans in the 1800s and has a fabulous art direction with costumes and set designs that are first rate. The problem with this film is really in the writing. It never holds up to me. While I love the cast Dietrich is supported by a first rate cast and crew of Hollywood's golden age of cinema where even character parts were done brilliantly. I enjoyed the relationship between the Countess and her African American maid Clementine in the film as her friend and confidante. The countess has too many suitors much like any Marlene Dietrich film. The one suitor is a poor sailor with a pet monkey and the other is Giraud an older wealthy but unattractive man. In this film the Countess is expected to get married like all women are expected to do in this day and age. The film begins with a mystery of a wedding dress found in the Mississippi River. There are plenty of light hearted moments as well. Still this film is fine to watch.".

A Dietrich vehicle that has some amusing scenes at the beginning with potential suitor Bruce Cabot Catour resembling a Clark Gable type.As always Dietrich just glows star quality. Roland Young Giraud plays his part well as a wealthy interested party and I also thought Anne Revere Giraud's sister and Melville Cooper Giraud's brotherinlaw put in amusing convincing performances.As for the other characters unfortunately we get comedy sailors that include Andy clear your throat Devine 1st Sailor. Not funny. The better comedy comes from a surprising source  Mischa Auer Zolotov. For a change Mischa Auer doesn't miss the mark  he's funny in his role the only time I can remember him successfully doing this and Franklin Pangborn Bellows as Auer's European companion has that kind of face that screams comedy. He reminds me of one of my Portuguese cousins  she looks just like him.It's a fluffy film that is completely unbelievable but entertains while it is going.

As a result it's a very good romanticcomedy that is worth a look.Marlene plays a golddiggeryou know a woman who is out to snag a rich husband and romance is at best secondary. When she meets older and very ordinary looking short rich guy Roland Young she instantly pretends to be in love with him. At about the same time she also meets a rugged ship's captain Bruce Cabot. You can tell that sparks are flying between them but she resists because he isn't rich and so she ardently pursues Young throughout most of the film.However all this is thrown for a loop when a couple foreigners see Marlene and recognize her as a good time girl they'd met in St. Petersburg Russia. So in order to convince Young that she is as sweet and innocent as she's pretended to be she invents the notion that this is a cousin. But when he isn't totally convinced Marlene begins to play both roles. This is EXACTLY the sort of funny situations this movie desperately needed to inject some life into it.

However as the party progresses violent shakes and explosions herald the arrival of an unknown creature which begins its rampage by throwing the head of the Statue of Liberty down into a street.

	schema:headline " Terrible storytelling horrible cinematography poor CGI Cloverfield is overhyped and overdone";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.I didn't like this clichd film. I believe it is a flawed exercise about character perspective and documented realism. However the special effects were poor but some of them passable the editing kept an appropriate rhythm the performances were regular with the clear exception of T.J. Miller who played the obnoxious camera man Hud. He did an awful job.My main dislikes with this film were the camera movement and the argument overall.First the camera moves excessively all time. Even during the party sequence all the scenes are horribly captured. Hud wasn't running from a monster then was he? I get the filmmaker's intention but I felt more nauseated than afraid because they went too far with their movement. The moment I dissociated myself from the movie and started feeling trapped inside a really expensive handycam I knew the original intention had gotten lost. In that respect the Blair Witch Project which I also didn't like but for other reasons is superior by far. Its technical proposal does help convey a profound emotional impact whereas Cloverfield's camera trembling doesn't. Consequently the characters on Cloverfield remain mostly aloof which really makes some silly elements in the plot to stand out.SPOILERS START NOW That brings me to my second main dislike the argument. Were they joking? I don't even mean the monster. It's a monster movie so I won't even go there. Everyone goes to save Beth the romantic interest of Rob who is beyond logical salvation. Sure Rob's friends try to stop him from going to his certain death but they all end up joining him anyway ! Consequently Beth becomes more of a cheap plot device than a character.But I mean Marlena joined them? From what we know of her she wouldn't. That's character inconsistency right there. So let's assume she had her psychological reasons to do it. She's after all supposedly human and complex. But throughout her time on the screen nothing happens to shed any light as to why she is with them. So there's no depth to her. No need for her expect to save Hud's life once.Also the love story between Rob and Beth rests so much in what some people say of them and a few lines between the wretched lovers that it becomes shallow and boring. Sure some say he's been in love with her forever and they do share a wonderful day at Columbus Circle and Coney Island. Of course she has got to be the love of his life. I'm not cynical and I actually enjoy romantic themes but this was an insult. I mean the whole story rests so much on this supposed doomed love that it ought to have been better explored. The performances were so flat in this category that they didn't help either. Again the love story turned into yet another sort of plot device.When the friends rescue Beth from her building she is severely injured and yet she can walk and even run. At the end when they arrive to the evacuation area despite her bleeding injury Beth is not the first one to climb into the helicopter. In fact she has to wait for another helicopter to take her out because the soldiers offer the only seat to Lily who is physically well. It is ridiculous. Obviously the real reason the filmmakers did that is so that the lovers Rob and Beth could remain together until the end. Have I said plot device before? Cheap and trashy plot device? And there's more much more rubbish like that throughout the film. SPOILERS HAVE ENDED. Also the fact that Hud was filming everything even in the party almost every private moment is ludicrous. The filmmaker's choice of the handycam as the true narrator is too limited so he naturally had to use it to an unbelievable degree. The consequence is that the purpose of capturing a sense of realism is defeated and Cloverfield ends up being an absurdly unrealistic movie in its own monsterdestroyingNewYorkmovie context.In Cloverfield the filmmakers ask you to accept too many things just as they tell you they are. However the movie consistently fails to provide you with valid reasons for doing so. They keep forcing on you a story of the poorest quality. It's almost offensive.Weak screenplays do that. And when they do one at least expects something in return whether a feeling or a memorable moment. Something that would justify the torture. Unfortunately with Cloverfield one ends up emptyhanded jerky camera movements aside.I don't recommend this film at all especially if you value the use of a tripod or the meaning of storytelling. In any case if you're going to see it please don't expect anything great and try not to eat or drink liquids for a couple of hours before and while watching it. In all honesty it can make you feel physically as well as mentally nauseated.".

I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.Simply put the film is an amazingly visceral experience. It's studio logo production logo film. No credits whatsoever which just adds to the overall immediacy of it. If you've been following it to any degree whatsoever you know that it's shot entirely with handheld cameras. The characters also run. A lot. So immediately I think this will be a love hate experience. My own reaction to it was that it again added to the immersion and I didn't find it to be really distracting at all. Many people I saw it with said they couldn't even watch the screen at times so buyer beware. It also will anger those who need all the details and need to have every loose end tied up or even a majority of them. The entire film is the tape found after the events of the film are over. That's it. There is no set up and no holdyourhandforyou resolution or really much of one at all. It's unconventional and I enjoyed the ending TREMENDOUSLY. I definitely have to applaud the decision to not simply make a cookie cutter action film that is easy to watch. I think it will be interesting to watch how it does at the box office though.After that...I feel like there isn't much that can be said about the acting and that should be a credit to it. It absolutely feels like you are experiencing this with the characters who feel more or less exactly like real people. After leaving the theater I was on edge for a good deal of time as I tried to shake that level of immersion. The film is also surprisingly humorous and I would say that our crowd laughed more than they screamed although the screams were definitely there.Cloverfield definitely will not be everybody's cup of tea but if you're already excited about it I have no doubt that you'll be satisfied. It was a relatively unique experience and again I want to applaud the decision to make it in that manner.Definitely recommended 810".

While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare. Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 911 inflicted on New York much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 911 and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!".

Not just silly actually the way 911like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic nonevent struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 911 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live' shaky camerawork in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry but really all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch ripoff. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at as a viewer I felt insulted.

If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music then stay for the credits during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled Roar!

	schema:reviewBody "I will admit the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However it's hard to have this curiosity no matter how intriguing the monster is when the script is so tired its in a coma.Yes the monster is cool. No the stupid handheld camera gimmick didn't bother me. Yes the special effects are great and at times I did find myself in awe of the spectacle on the screen as it does seem real but the movie itself is so so so dumb. At any moment I felt comfortable to leave to use the restroom as I knew exactly what I was going to miss. The plot was a paint by numbers and I would have loved even a touch of Bob Ross to fill the blanks but no originality whatsoever.First they steal the overdone Hollywood bit about love. Dude if you love her tell her. Response I can't tell her unless a mutant alienocean creature tries to expunge the city only then will I try and make my move. Why have this? Why not make the story the monster? Really who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.Second they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. Let's try night vision on the camera. And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons ones we can't see coming which is why I think those monsters were blind. Cloverfield does none of this. It's a where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie he's not funny just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was That's terrible when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by That's terrible too when we see when of its younglings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter That's terrible cubed before he was engorged upon. Stupid stupid stupid.Fourth we have the killervillainmonster has one last leap. Yes we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. We killed him Hud proclaims just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary why? Oh it's not scary and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. Fifth they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever because King should always have chapters taken out and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise they may actually need to give the characters some arc have some purposeful shots of the monster maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and uhoh give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T2 Jurassic Park Men in Black those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant filmmaking. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook trite clichd not smart overdone not scary bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2 but pretty darn close.".

Why not make the story the monster? Really who cares about these characters? Who cares about Rob's job in Japan? It's flimsy? Why have it? The beginning clearly leads on that the camera is found which means they all die. Standard operation of introducing characters that we shouldn't care about.Second they decide to steal a scene from a much better monster movie The Descent. Let's try night vision on the camera. And this is in no way as scary as the movie that did it better. The Descent works better in every faction of story telling. It forces claustrophobia as it whispers the insanity and the entire film works as a metaphor for diving deep into the darkness of one's existence and summoning demons ones we can't see coming which is why I think those monsters were blind. Cloverfield does none of this. It's a where can we run to next? saga. A 'B' movie. A well shot 'B' movie. Third we have the comic relief one liner guy holding the camera. But in true fashion of a bad movie he's not funny just annoying. A few people in my viewing clapped when he was eaten. I love LOST. I think it's the best show on TV but the writer here has proved that being a great psychological writer for the little screen does not translate to comedy. Bad Robot productions should hire one guy with a sense of humor. They may need him at some point. Hud's pinnacle of wit was That's terrible when he gets a good shot of the monster. Followed closely by That's terrible too when we see when of its younglings a few seconds later. Brilliant... improv? I can only guess the script consisted of locations and not so much dialogue since this boner had most of the words in the movie words that seemed spontaneously driven from someone wait listed at community college. Horrible. I'm surprised he didn't utter That's terrible cubed before he was engorged upon. Stupid stupid stupid.Fourth we have the killervillainmonster has one last leap. Yes we knew the helicopter was going down since they find the camera in Central Park. We killed him Hud proclaims just before the monster elevates and slaps the helicopter to the ground. This is scary why? Oh it's not scary and I find the idea of a thing like this really existing more logical than any of those bozos surviving the crash in the park. Fifth they've stolen from every Stephen King novel ever because King should always have chapters taken out and this movie should have been an hour long. Do we really need to see them walk up 57 flights of stairs and then back down and then bank up and then and then and then and then.... yes we do. Otherwise they don't have enough for a feature length movie. So trite and boring and not fascinating. Which is why the gimmick of a hand held camera was needed. Otherwise they may actually need to give the characters some arc have some purposeful shots of the monster maybe create a reason for what it is and why it's there and uhoh give it some originality. For anyone who thinks this movie is original it is probably because you are under 24 and either naive to creativity or just haven't seen any worthwhile movies. I wanted to like this I did I really did. It just wasn't good. I can respect it as I respect all movies that are made. It was well crafted and edited and the effects were amazing but so what? All movies now have great effects. The Fantastic Four movies are not good but their effects rock. War of the Worlds was awful but I thought those things really came out of the ground. Effects and production don't make a movie. Not anymore. T2 Jurassic Park Men in Black those movies were pioneers to FX being a character along with brilliant filmmaking. Now it is expected. Since it is expected there I expect more from the story. This isn't it. If I were trapped in hell and I had a choice to watch either Cloverfiled or One Miss Call over and over I'd pick One Miss Call. At least its badness is funny which gives it some merit. Cloverfield is just bad. Textook trite clichd not smart overdone not scary bad. Not as bad as Mission Impossible 2 but pretty darn close.";

I would also like to know if Manhattan was supposedly completely destroyed by the monster and military how was the video recovered from Central Park. Some closure on that would have made the film much more enjoyable.Don't waste your time or money. Innovative but predictable nauseating and unbelievable.";

	schema:reviewBody "There were two interesting things about seeing this movie unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be raw footage. The acting was lacking at best the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot which it might have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.But even the worst visual movies can have a deeper meaning right? So what about this one? There are obvious 911 referencessimilarities for instance it was an attack on NYC. The imagery of terrified people running through the streets from the dust clouds of a collapsed building would conjure thoughts of 911 in even the most dim witted person. But as much as you pick this one apart there wasn't any purpose beyond using it as an implement to regurgitate fear. No this movie isn't some sort of pompous social commentary on the American dreamlifestylepeoplewhatever. It's actually quite empty as far as metaphormeaning goes. But honestly it's not like people would expect that from a monster movie anyway right? Although it was the connection this movie shared with 911 that brings me to my first interesting point. Almost every time a tragedy of this proportion occurs there are countless stories books movies or any other medium that reference it however vaguely for decades to come. For example look at postNagasakiHiroshima Japan. I'd be curious to see the list of movies that depict the mass destruction of Tokyo via atomic or nuclear bomb. Not to mention the other Japanese movies that center around the general ruining of cities... mostly by a few specific gigantic monsters... which will remain unnamed. The second interesting thing happened to be something which I've never witnessed in a movie theater before. It made it worth paying the ten dollars for a ticket wasting an hour and half of my life and enduring a headache the camera work gave me. As the ending credits started and the lights slowly came back on the audience unanimously started trashtalking the movie. There was booing from all corners of the theater someone seated behind me said harshly this movie sucked! and the girl who was with him asked him what did you drag me to?? Their reactions were fairly amusing and undoubtedly the best part of the whole movie experience. All in all there were a couple of really cool visuals in the movie... Unfortunately this alone isn't worth the price of the movie not even the price of the DVD not even the price of the DVD once it goes into the shitty 3.99 movie bin at best buy. Either stay clear of this one or if your curiosity gets the best of you find a pirated version for free.SPOILER Oh and before I forget. For all the reported realism in this movie I'd like someone to explain to me exactly how a plastic video tape survives the tens of millions of degrees caused by the blast of a nuclear bomb......But now I'm just being nit picky.".

Not only was it hard to watch because of the home video concept of filming but it was horrible.The Alien monster was like a giant praying mantis with babies that fell off itself and attacked people. I can deal with that but the fact that bombs and tanks had no effect against it is ridiculous.The only highlight in the entire movie was the guy behind the camera and his funny one liners. The movie was a hour and twentyfive minutes long and ended with no questions being answered. You could not enjoy the action or suspense because the camera was never still or clear. I have loved J.J Abrams' work in the past but this is something he should not have put his name on.Luckily I used free passes for entry and I did not have to pay for tickets otherwise I would have demanded my money back. Don't believe any other comments that this was an intense thrilling movie because it was not. The monster was ridiculous and laughable.The love stories between 3 different couple was dull and more high schoolish. Not what one would think a Vice Pres. of a company would have and when one of the love interests died the main character's brother it was like Oh Well. The injury suffered by Beth a rebar through the chest is not something that one would get up from and then run around. And apparently if you get bit by the small ones you spontaneously combust.All I can say is just plain bad don't waste your money. Burning your ten dollars would be just as painful but the bright thing about that would be that it would only last about a minute.".

I'm sure many viewers this weekend are going to not know anything about the movie just know that it's called Cloverfield and it was produced by JJ Abrams. I would think the movie wouldn't be as enthralling for someone who doesn't know much about it compared to someone who has been following message board posts for months but I don't think it should matter.So let's begin. Cloverfield. The general plot of the movie is a homemade movie about a mans going away party that turns into a first person action thriller about a monster terrorizing the city. Well I'm intrigued. I have been waiting for this movie for awhile since nothing exciting has come out recently. Everyone talking about the movie only made it more anticipated so going into it I had high expectations. To be completely honest I am satisfied. Shocked? Cloverfield is a movie like nothing I've seen before. I am sure this movie is based upon a few other films but I haven't seen them. First of all no it is not Godzilla. Second I didn't get a chance to see Blair Witch Project so the first person thing was new to me. I know I know. This however is what Made this movie what it is. It made you feel like you were in the action on the streets running in fear alongside the citizens. It was freakin' sweet.The action was intense I expected nothing less from JJ. Once the movie got into motion with the city earthquake everything from then on was thrilling. I sat in the seat shaking in anticipation like I was sitting outside in the 20 degree weather butterflies in my stomach for more than half the film. Awesome. The other part that was great was the sound and sights. It really felt like you were standing next to the soldiers shooting at the monster. And last but not least the comedy... no seriously. There were many funny parts thanks to the cameraman. Oh My God you know Superman too? Geez I'm feeling a connection... have you heard of Garfield?. Classic.Overall a solid solid 9. Maybe a little high but I thought the movie was amazing whether or not the ending was satisfying. No I'm not telling you how it ends! To me it was good though because it ended the film on a good note... yet kept the suspense and questions flowing. Also no monster tips from me... I want you to be awaiting its face. Very good work except on the title... what does Cloverfield have to do with it?90 minute flick so why not. ActionThriller fans will love it so go see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Veit Harlands non propaganda films. Honest accurate autobiography of the creators of the pocket watch. It's more honest than his next film that he was possibly shooting simultaneously or planning which would be released in 1940 Judd Suss.The problem is that Kristine Soderbaum is mismatched as the inventors wife. He's too old for her.The love scene's are laughable and unbelievable.Rejected from the inventors affectionsshe turn to his assistant that I thought was his son.The beginning scene shows Him and his assistant on a ship during a storm. The men on the ship are racing around because of the fear the ship going to sink. They threaten him but then they all jump the ship. Heinrch jumps at the end holding the globe to float on.

It's more honest than his next film that he was possibly shooting simultaneously or planning which would be released in 1940 Judd Suss.The problem is that Kristine Soderbaum is mismatched as the inventors wife. He's too old for her.The love scene's are laughable and unbelievable.Rejected from the inventors affectionsshe turn to his assistant that I thought was his son.The beginning scene shows Him and his assistant on a ship during a storm. The men on the ship are racing around because of the fear the ship going to sink. They threaten him but then they all jump the ship. Heinrch jumps at the end holding the globe to float on. All of a sudden the scene jumps to the next scene and they have already been rescued.The assistant is cleaning a gun ant it goes off hitting Hein and injuring him.

	schema:reviewBody "Today The Creature From the Black Lagoon is considered a classic. The film itself has become a cliche for the maninarubbersuit monster movie and the gillman is now included in the pantheon of classic movie monsters along with Dracula Frankenstein and the Wolfman.I was a teenager when I first saw this SciFiHorror gem on television in 1965the film was already ten years old by thenand I loved it. Surprisinglyeven after a decade of watching technically sophisticated stateoftheart unbelievably realistic prosthetic animatronic and computergenerated movie monsterstoday's teenagers still love the old rubber prototype of all swamp monsters The Creature From the Black Lagoon. This is especially true of teenage boys. Why? Perhaps every adolescent male can relate to the film's star the Creature is horny inarticulate moody misunderstood not pleasant to look at and is unbelievably awkward with girls the ultimate teenage geek. We all remember this classic scene in the movie the film's beautiful heroine Julie Adams decides to take a dip unaware that the Creature is swimming below her. The image is archetypal  the powerful masculine and the overtly seductive feminine beautifully juxtaposed in a stylized sexual union. Then from the murky bottom of his lagoon the Creature leeringly watches Adams as she performs an erotic underwater ballet and he knows that for the moment he can only look not touch. Is the scaly one shy and insecure? Or does he simply have a Catholic upbringing? Indeed much of the film's imagery lends itself to Freudian interpretation.OK so it's not exactly Beauty and the Beast the Creature's passion is purely primal and elemental. But still the fact that he restrains himself satisfying his carnal curiosity with a simple caressing of Julie's ankles and then retreats back to the gloomy bottom of his underwater sanctum to secretly watch her react in bewilderment suggests he may be more human than he appears. But alas as any good Freudian will tell you repression often leads to disfunction. And later in the film in a brief but beautifully filmed underwater scene the Creature savagely drags the tantalizing Playboy centerfold down into the Freudian depths to his subterranean grotto perhaps to hide her under his bed...where his mom can't find her. I apologize for the metaphor. It's getting stale I know.The Creature From the Black Lagoon was directed by Jack Arnold The Incredible Shrinking Man who from 1952 to 1960 directed a series of fantasyhorror films for Universal Studios including Revenge of the Creature this film's sequel. Arnold would certainly object to us reading too much symbolism in his gillman but the Creature may not have achieved such enduring status in monstermythology if not for the fears and anxieties of the moviegoing audience of the '50s. Arnold's dramatic use of the Creature succeeds of course by exploiting the human fear of the unseen threat lurking below a very primal deeply embedded in the human subconscious and one that's been ruthlessly exploited by filmmakers in countless horror films. But Arnold's beast may also represent a more intellectualized fear. In the 1950s and beyond the threat of nuclear annihilation was very real and like the creature in Shelly's Frankenstein Arnold's lagoon creature represents an elemental force of nature that once discovered and awakened by science even wellintentioned science cannot be controlled perhaps like the newly tapped but untamed power of the atom. Or and this may sound like apostasy in one of John's pretentious sophistical overintellectualized movie reviews in which I've constantly and digressively wandered into the Freudian morass perhaps the Creature is not a mataphor for teenage angst forbidden knowledge or coldwar anxiety. Perhaps the Creature is nothing more than a guy in a scary rubber suit chasing a pretty girl around a movie soundstage. But where's the fun in that?The Creature From the Black Lagoon is still fun to watch. Actors Richard Carlson the sophmoric but nobleminded paleozoologist and Richard Denning the ambitious financier play off each other well. And Julie Adams is simply gorgeous in her custommade swimsuit. Also the beautiful albeit black  white underwater photography by James C. Haven is appropriately surreal as the men begin their search and descend into the black depths of the lagoon they intermittently twirl and hover amidst penetrating shafts of sunlight from above and as the camera pans the peaceful bottomlandscape of the lagoon the gillman suddenly springs from clouds of disturbed sediment thrashing through curtains of shimmering air bubbles and drifting weeds determined and unstoppable in his persuit of the human intruders. But one of the best things about the movie is the music. Some of the themeswritten by Henry Mancini and Herman Steinare quite beautiful for example as the expedition slowly makes its way up the dark Amazon an ensemble of gentle woodwinds can be heard a soft subliminal prelude that lets us know we are entering another world a primeval world. And who can forget the Creature's signature themethe brassy bombastic threenote progression of DA DA DAAAAA!whenever Creech appeared on the screen?Of course the best thing in the film is...the Creature. Jack Arnold suggested that the design of the gillman suit be based on the graceful form of the Motion Picture Academy's Oscar statuette. Really! The suit was designed and brilliantly crafted by makeup artist Bud Westmore and there were two versions one suit for filming on land and another for filming underwater. On land the gillman was played by Ben Chapman. Olympic swimmer Ricou Browning wore the gillman suit in the underwater scenes. The dry suit that Chapman wore was beautifully colored with iridescent greens and blues and mottled with many other marine hues. The wet suit worn by Browning was a bright yellow the marine hues chosen for the dry suit photographed too dark when filming underwater.Yeah I really love this movie. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's just one geek relating to another. You see in the final reel neither of us got the girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike other scifi flicks from the 1950s Creature From The Black Lagoon is not a film to laugh at. It's better made. Just by the title we know there's a monster lurking about. Yet for the film's first 24 minutes we don't actually see it only one of its claws. And that holding back of the monster's appearance fosters suspense and mystery. In addition the film's BW cinematography is good for its time with lots of credible underwater shots. And while the dialogue does contain lots of exposition the film at least tries to educate viewers.There's nothing complex about the story. A scientific crew heads for the Amazon to do an archaeological dig after a large fossil is found. The crew ends up at the Black Lagoon a place of serenity with its still waters surrounded by palm trees and the sounds of monkeys and exotic birds. Through much of the film the peaceful setting together with soothing background music actually makes for a rather relaxing movie. Even when we see the monster it seems lonely and hardly threatening as it glides gracefully through its watery home.I suspect that the film's popularity when it was first released relates to the creature's distinctive appearance with those moving gills and those bulging dark eyes. And of course back in those days the film was made for 3D viewing a novelty then that made the monster seem more real. Today the film has an eversoslight environmental theme given that at least one of the scientists prefers that the monster not be harmed and given that humans obviously are encroaching into its habitat.Because so much of the plot takes place underwater and therefore lacks dialogue and given a runtime of only about 78 minutes there really isn't that much to this movie. But what there is of it is interesting for its historical significance as a precursor to later scifi films and for a monster that's not only photogenic but also alone and arguably lonely in a world that has passed it by after eons of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of few truly great creature films THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a surprisingly effective horror film concerning a scientific expedition up the Amazon to investigate an unusual fossil findbut instead of fossils the crew members encounter an underwater creature of considerable intelligence that is bent on their destruction.The script is a bit dated by modern standards but the cast particularly Julie Adams is effective and the creature is easily one of Universal Studio's most memorable creations. And seen today in standard black and white the film is quite enjoyable. But it doesn't hold a candle to the original 3D format which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s. Simply stated BLACK LAGOON's cinematography was probably the best of all 3D movies to date. As with most 3D films there is plenty of coming at you cinematography and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and whitebut in addition to these the film used 3D in a remarkably subtle way virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3D and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.I remain disappointed that the 3D version of BLACK LAGOONnot to mention such other 3D films as HOUSE OF WAX IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and DIAL M FOR MURDERhas never been released in 3D format on video or disk instead we must make do with such bottombudget 3D flicks as THE MASK CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON and the like. Admittedly the impact of the format is lessened by the small screen and demands some careful color adjusting and the effect requires the use of 3D glassesbut it is a shame that we must settle for ghosts of the originals when we could easily have the originals instead. In 3D format BLACK LAGOON would easily be a tenstar film.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

But it doesn't hold a candle to the original 3D format which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s. Simply stated BLACK LAGOON's cinematography was probably the best of all 3D movies to date. As with most 3D films there is plenty of coming at you cinematography and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and whitebut in addition to these the film used 3D in a remarkably subtle way virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3D and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.I remain disappointed that the 3D version of BLACK LAGOONnot to mention such other 3D films as HOUSE OF WAX IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE and DIAL M FOR MURDERhas never been released in 3D format on video or disk instead we must make do with such bottombudget 3D flicks as THE MASK CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON and the like. Admittedly the impact of the format is lessened by the small screen and demands some careful color adjusting and the effect requires the use of 3D glassesbut it is a shame that we must settle for ghosts of the originals when we could easily have the originals instead. In 3D format BLACK LAGOON would easily be a tenstar film.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

	schema:reviewBody "Out of Universal Pictures Creature from the Black Lagoon is directed by Jack Arnold and stars Richard Carlson Julia Adams Richard Denning Antonio Moreno and Whit Bissell. The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning for the underwater scenes. The cinematography is by William E. Snyder and the score is composed by a trio of men Henry Mancini Hans J. Salter  Herman Stein. The story sees a scientific expedition at the top end of the Amazon encounter a Devonian Period amphibious creature. As the creature starts to defend its turf by attacking members of the expedition in fighting begins to take a hold as the men argue about the best course of action to take. Should it be killed or should it be captured for scientific research? Either way they need to act fast as the creature has taken a fancy to Kay the sole female member of the expedition group.One of the better creature features that surfaced in the 1950s Creature from the Black Lagoon was one of the film's made as part of the 3D craze that filtered out of Hollywood in 53  54. However unlike many of those film's that were made in the format over those two years this one has rightly managed to break away from its gimmicky beginnings to become regarded as a genre classic. There are many reasons why it is still well regarded and taken in appreciatively by newcomers.The story of course is nothing new the old beauty  the beast theme can be traced back to the daddy himself King Kong. But much like Kong Arnold's movie thrives within the endearing story by getting the audience to sympathise with the titular creature. He is after all only defending his territory he was happy wallowing down in the depths remaining undiscovered for many a moon. That he is fascinated by the considerable beauty of Kay Lawrence Adams sexy and gorgeous is no crime either. The amount of sympathy garnered for GillMan is helped enormously by the illogical actions of the humans who in turn go diving and swimming where legend has it men get eaten! This coupled with their bickering about pro science or trophy hunting makes it easy to side with the amphibious one.It also helps that the film is pretty brisk and only runs for 80 minutes there's no sags or pointless filler. Too many similar film's of its ilk labour until the monster shows up and all hell then breaks loose. But under Arnold's It Came From Outer SpaceThe Incredible Shrinking Man astute direction atmosphere and unease is built up by ominous talk and sightings of the Black Lagoonand only initial glimpses of the creature's scaly webbed claw accompanied by the attention grabbing theme music. And when the creature finally reveals itself it doesn't disappoint for its an impressive creation. A halfmanhalffish creature covered in scales resplendent with gills and with cold dark featureless eyes. It also has great characteristics with a distinctive swimming style in the water and a lumbering Frankenstein thing going on when on the land. A definitive monster that would be merchandised for ever after.There's also technical accomplishments away from the creature itself notably with the memorable underwater photography by Snyder who uses a portable camera to flow with the swimming sequences while his shadow and light work down in the depths is memorably mood enhancing. The three tiered score is also one of the best to feature in a B movie schlocker three different composers three different emotional strands nice. Then there's of course the definitive sequence the sexy underwater flirting as GillMan swims below the shapely form of Kay beguiled by her it's love at first sight. He's not the only one beguiled we all are as was Steven Spileberg who would homage the more dramatic part of the sequence in his opening for Jaws 21 years later. Whilst last but not least it should be mentioned that there are little asides to ecological issues in the piece something Arnold was want to do. Two sequels would follow Arnold would return for Revenge Of The Creature in 1955 and then the John Sherwood directed The Creature Walks Among Us would round off the trilogy in 1956.It's the original that still holds up today. 810".

The most lovable monster movies were made during this decade and Creature from the Black Lagoon belongs to the absolute top ! My father keeps asking me why I show so much interest in movies that were made before even HE was born. Well...how could you not be in love with this era ??? Every single monster movie from this period gives me the shivers. They're just great. Creature from the Black Lagoon is part of the great Universal collection. It's almost half a century old but it still hasn't lost a single bit of magic and the impression that it makes on people is still amazing. Like I said...one of the best. Dr. Carl Maia is on a scientific expedition somewhere deep in the jungle near the Amazone river. He and his team find a fossil of something that appears to be a manfish. The thing is a hand with gills. To find the rest of this extraordinary body he seeks help and finds it by other respected scientists Dr.David Reed Dr. Mark Williams and Kay Lawrence. Together the travel to the place where Dr. Maia found the fossil. It seems that his crew got killed and it looks like they're about to find much more than just a fossil ! There still is a living fishcreature living in the legendary Black Lagoon. Soon the scientific expedition changes into a battle to come out alive of the Black Lagoon The location of the Black Lagoon really is one of the most breathtaking settings I've ever seen. The images of the wild unknown jungle and the horrible noises of the animals makes you feel like your in the jungle yourself. The acting performances are outstanding and there's even a little room for comedy in this film. The character of Lucas  captain of the ship Rita breaks the tension from time to time by saying very funny things. The actress who plays Kay is one of the most beautiful woman who ever came on the black and white screen...heck even the creature seems to think so ! Her name is Julie Adams and she played in a lot of good oldfashioned westerns like The man from the Alamo I recommend you check her out...you won't regret it. The Creature from the Black Lagoon was directed by Jack Arnold. This guy certainly knows what he's doing. He's also the one who gave us Tarantula another great 50's monster film worth checking out. This film received 2 sequels. I haven't seen the second one  the Creature walks among us  but I can surely recommend the first sequel which was also directed by Arnold. Revenge of the Creature only came out one year after the original and lives up to it. The only think that got lost was the tense atmosphere.".

Together the travel to the place where Dr. Maia found the fossil. It seems that his crew got killed and it looks like they're about to find much more than just a fossil ! There still is a living fishcreature living in the legendary Black Lagoon. Soon the scientific expedition changes into a battle to come out alive of the Black Lagoon The location of the Black Lagoon really is one of the most breathtaking settings I've ever seen. The images of the wild unknown jungle and the horrible noises of the animals makes you feel like your in the jungle yourself. The acting performances are outstanding and there's even a little room for comedy in this film. The character of Lucas  captain of the ship Rita breaks the tension from time to time by saying very funny things. The actress who plays Kay is one of the most beautiful woman who ever came on the black and white screen...heck even the creature seems to think so ! Her name is Julie Adams and she played in a lot of good oldfashioned westerns like The man from the Alamo I recommend you check her out...you won't regret it. The Creature from the Black Lagoon was directed by Jack Arnold. This guy certainly knows what he's doing. He's also the one who gave us Tarantula another great 50's monster film worth checking out. This film received 2 sequels. I haven't seen the second one  the Creature walks among us  but I can surely recommend the first sequel which was also directed by Arnold. Revenge of the Creature only came out one year after the original and lives up to it. The only think that got lost was the tense atmosphere.";

The Gill Man is a thinking being but still a monster who remembers the injuries done him by man and seeks retribution.  If the scientists had left him alone he'd have left them alone. They were the invaders.And thank goodness that they didn't have a scene of the kidnapped Julia making friends with the now peaceful Gill Man to show his human side only to have the heroes show up and kill him.  She was taken as bait to lure the humans into the Gill Man's lair.It spawned two sequels yes there were sequels even back then and both are good in their own right they just didn't achieve what the original did all the way around.

The audience don't get a full view of the Gill Man until relatively late in to the running time so the film plays along with the audience by giving glimpses of the monster via a webbed hand . In some ways the structure and feel of the film resembles that of James Whale's version of FRANKENSTEIN where the brooding menace of the monster hangs over the film even though it hasn't been properly introduced . All this is helped by music that can be dismissed as being a cheap trick scare tactic but it is nevertheless very good It's also a film that makes good use of underwater photography that must have been very difficult for the production team and yet they pull it off very well . THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON also seems to have inspired the marketing behind a certain film from 1975 directed by Steven Spielberg featuring a shark as a woman swims unaware that a monster is a few short feet away from her and the whole film gives an excellent sense of suspense sadly lacking in Hollywood movies nowadays THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is one of these movies you remember watching on TV one night many years ago and as the years go by can be easily dismissed as a silly monster B movie but after seeing it again I was genuinely impressed by it all the way from use of music to make up and deserves a status befitting of a classic horror film".

Sure it's just a rubber suit but it's a good looking rubber suit I love the updated look Stan Winston's crew did for The Monster Squad. The story is rather simplistic. An archaeological dig uncovers the skeletal remains of a creature who may be a missing link in the evolutionary chain from the time when creatures came out of the water to walk upon land.

After a few failed attempts to capture the Gillman the surviving members decide to flee the area. They might be done with the Creature but the Creature isn't done with them. He's blocked the only exit from the lagoon and has his eye set on the lovely Julie Adams. It becomes a basic story of survival at that point.

	schema:reviewBody "In South America ecologist Antonio Moreno as Carl Maia leads an expedition he is startled to find a webbed but humanlike hand protruding from a rock. Mr. Moreno snaps the fossil from the rock and brings it to ichthyologist Richard Carlson as David Reed for examination. Mr. Carlson is intrigued by the hand and wants to find more of the Creature's remains. Carlson is also enamored with bushyeyed beauty Julie Adams as Kay Lawrence but so is Carlson's wealthy colleague Richard Denning as Mark Williams. The group decide to boat the Amazon and find the Creature Created by Milicent Patrick with Jack Kevan and Chris Mueller the Creature from the Black Lagoon or GillMan made a big splash at the box office. Much of the time the film displays a rushed lowbudget quality and it was made for viewing in 3D glasses. Still the movie entertains. The Creature is conceptually quite interesting and he has a great look. More importantly the title character has personality. Mainly this is due to his obvious attraction to Ms. Adams' character.

	onyx:emotionText "In South America ecologist Antonio Moreno as Carl Maia leads an expedition he is startled to find a webbed but humanlike hand protruding from a rock. Mr. Moreno snaps the fossil from the rock and brings it to ichthyologist Richard Carlson as David Reed for examination. Mr. Carlson is intrigued by the hand and wants to find more of the Creature's remains. Carlson is also enamored with bushyeyed beauty Julie Adams as Kay Lawrence but so is Carlson's wealthy colleague Richard Denning as Mark Williams. The group decide to boat the Amazon and find the Creature Created by Milicent Patrick with Jack Kevan and Chris Mueller the Creature from the Black Lagoon or GillMan made a big splash at the box office. Much of the time the film displays a rushed lowbudget quality and it was made for viewing in 3D glasses. Still the movie entertains. The Creature is conceptually quite interesting and he has a great look. More importantly the title character has personality. Mainly this is due to his obvious attraction to Ms. Adams' character.

The story revolves around the search for the remainder of a fossil from some sort of gillman that apparently lived in the Devonian era. Of course the expedition discovers that gillman is still alive and quite capable of wreaking havoc! I thought this lacked a bit of the atmosphere that Universal's earlier stuff had in abundance but the story was pretty good and although there were a couple too many speeches from scientist David Reed played by Richard Carlson the performances from a largely unfamiliar to me although I think I remember seeing Whit Bissell in a Star Trek episode cast were not bad. Director Jack Arnold did a pretty good job throughout of building suspense there are a lot of scenes in which you expect something to happen and nothing does. The whole monster falls for beautiful girl in this case played by the admittedly lovely Julie Adams is perhaps a bit clich in this type of movie and I did find it passing strange that the creature who lives in this environment and should be perfectly adapted for it didn't seem to swim any better than the scientists who were after it!

Nestor Paiva playing Lucas the boat captain was great all the way through the film and Richard Denning playing Mark Williams put in a fine performance. Whit Bissel playing Dr. Thompson was believable and Julia Adams playing Kay Lawrence wasn't bad. Antonio Moreno playing Carl Maia was soso. I thought the stunt men and divers playing the creature stole the show. The scene of the clawed hand coming through the tent in the Amazon was phony and so was the clawed hand coming in the porthole of the boat menacing Dr. Thompson. I counted 12 costume changes for Julia Adams from the time they got to the Amazon to the end of the movie if you count one being when she took off her top and dove in the water off the boat when they were in the Amazon. The bat in the cave was phony and when the creature picked up David Reed was pretty phony but most of the rest of the work the stunt men did of the creature throughout the film was believable. I thought Henry Mancini did a great job with the music in this film. The scenes of the creature grabbing Mark Williams under the water and dragging him down was very believable and the music by Henry Mancini during this was pretty good. I believed the struggle that the stuntman playing Mark Williams made. I've watched this movie probably near 100 times because my girlfriend is in love with it and every time I ask which VCR tape to put in the VCR she says Creature from the Black Lagoon or just The Creature. I'll keep watching this movie with my girlfriend because the underwater scenes are great and it's just a fun film. There's nothing scary about this film as far as I'm concerned. I always feel a little amorous when Julia Adams playing Kay Lawrence takes off her shirt and reveals a great body and a sexy swimsuit. I'd have to rate this movie pretty high because it's enjoyable.".

	schema:headline " As satisfying as the best classic novels shame about that touch of political revisionism";
	schema:reviewBody "All in all I loved Bertolucci's 1900. By the end of it I watched the uncut 318 minute version and it was an effortless engrossing never overlong experience I found myself feeling as satisfied as someone who's just finished reading one of those wonderful very long classic novels. There are however some major flaws not just in narrative structure but also in content and this is why I've given it just a 910. It's rather disjointed and all over the place like a huge gangly foal rather than a harmoniouslyformed horse. However I don't agree with one accusation I heard that was leveled at it regarding its change of tone. In my view it was unavoidable and appropriate when dealing with a historic period going from the beginning of the 20th century to the rise to power of Mussolini 1922 and finally to the culmination of fullblown Fascist oppression. The change of tone in the film perfectly captured the profound and shocking changes that swept over Italy as if bitten by something that had made it go mad. My main problem with the film however was of content rather than structure the oversimplification of its politics not to mention the inaccuracy in the way it portrays the reasons for the rise of Fascism. These smack of just a little too much historical revisionism even for a tendentially leftwing person like me. But then 1900 was made in the 70s smack bang in the middle of a decade in which the Italian left wing had a strong hold on the country's artistic and cultural institutions. After decades of poverty ignorance and forced silence these institutions voiced their views with a more earnest tone than they would have had if they'd never been repressed. Pasolini Bertolucci Moravia and several others producing art during the 50s70s in Italy are a prime example of this kind of voice. Inevitably it was tinged with a political agenda  it couldn't have been otherwise as political freedom was a new toy and everyone was so keen to play with it. Bertolucci's film would have us believe that the rich landowners represented here by the Berlinghieri  Robert De Niro's character's family were responsible alone for sponsoring the Fascists. Keen to maintain the country in an archaic state of feudalism with the poor ignorant multitudes working their estates as semislaves they encouraged or turned a blind eye to the violent cruelty of the blackshirts. They employed them as guard dogs as De Niro's character Alfredo refers to Attila Donald Sutherland's Fascist bully character at one point giving them official charges as managers of their estates and oppressors of any sign of rebellion etc. Though this has effectively happened a more objective historic version will take into account that for Fascism to spread so rapidly and so well it must have had some hold on the common people too. Just consider that the rich landowners were a tiny tiny minority of the population and not all were sympathetic to Mussolini  originally a Socialist himself. The rich often supported the monarchy andor church instead and Mussolini aspired to a lay state not a religious one. It was indeed so many of the common men and women of Italy who responded well to the young Mussolini who was neither particularly cultured nor a member of the elite yet was a charismatic gogetter who could speak to the crowds in a way that made sense to them for the first time ever. The landowners and aristocrats decadent and totally out of touch from reality as Bertolucci's film shows so well had no idea how to relate to the masses. In contrast Mussolini wanted to harness the energy of the multitudes giving them a sense of worth for the first time ever. What a cruel irony this turned out to be for all those people! What Bertolucci's film is successful at putting across is the fact that neutrality turning a blind eye to and staying passive to Fascism was in itself responsible for allowing it to thrive. SPOILERS Alfredo does nothing to stop Attila and his stooges beat Olmo Grard Depardieu's character to a bloody mess despite the fact he knew that Olmo was innocent of having killed the child at the wedding party. This scene is so effective in creating a sense of frustration in the viewer. Watching that scene it comes naturally to ask oneself Why didn't anyone do anything to stop it? EXACTLY! END OF SPOILERS. Regarding the accusation leveled at the uncut version of the film containing pornographic sequences I thought pornography's sole purpose was to titillate and arouse. Do any scenes in this movie try to achieve this? Most certainly not! Naked human bodies can be representative of so much more than just sex. They are not just about the degree of their ability to arouse or otherwise but also about a whole other spectrum of human states and feelings. Strength vulnerability tenderness compassion closeness distance receptiveness and whatever else is sometimes just not possible to express in so many lines of dialogue. Why shouldn't a sexual encounter  even one featuring genitals in view  speak volumes about so many other aspects of men and women's humanity? I could write so much more about this movie! Though not as mesmerisingly beautiful to look at as Bertolucci's 1970 film Il Conformista it is none the less a testament to Vittorio Storaro's genius photography once again. I will probably be watching this movie many more times and discovering more layers more beauty and even more imperfections which is all worthwhile when confronted with such amazing material. Whoever's been comparing 1900's portrayal of Fascism with the way it was dealt with in Il Conformista isn't being entirely fair the latter takes a far more intellectual approach after all Fascism was a multifaceted phenomenon and is a less ambitious film anyway therefore less likely to fail.".

However I don't agree with one accusation I heard that was leveled at it regarding its change of tone. In my view it was unavoidable and appropriate when dealing with a historic period going from the beginning of the 20th century to the rise to power of Mussolini 1922 and finally to the culmination of fullblown Fascist oppression. The change of tone in the film perfectly captured the profound and shocking changes that swept over Italy as if bitten by something that had made it go mad. My main problem with the film however was of content rather than structure the oversimplification of its politics not to mention the inaccuracy in the way it portrays the reasons for the rise of Fascism. These smack of just a little too much historical revisionism even for a tendentially leftwing person like me. But then 1900 was made in the 70s smack bang in the middle of a decade in which the Italian left wing had a strong hold on the country's artistic and cultural institutions. After decades of poverty ignorance and forced silence these institutions voiced their views with a more earnest tone than they would have had if they'd never been repressed. Pasolini Bertolucci Moravia and several others producing art during the 50s70s in Italy are a prime example of this kind of voice. Inevitably it was tinged with a political agenda  it couldn't have been otherwise as political freedom was a new toy and everyone was so keen to play with it. Bertolucci's film would have us believe that the rich landowners represented here by the Berlinghieri  Robert De Niro's character's family were responsible alone for sponsoring the Fascists. Keen to maintain the country in an archaic state of feudalism with the poor ignorant multitudes working their estates as semislaves they encouraged or turned a blind eye to the violent cruelty of the blackshirts. They employed them as guard dogs as De Niro's character Alfredo refers to Attila Donald Sutherland's Fascist bully character at one point giving them official charges as managers of their estates and oppressors of any sign of rebellion etc. Though this has effectively happened a more objective historic version will take into account that for Fascism to spread so rapidly and so well it must have had some hold on the common people too. Just consider that the rich landowners were a tiny tiny minority of the population and not all were sympathetic to Mussolini  originally a Socialist himself. The rich often supported the monarchy andor church instead and Mussolini aspired to a lay state not a religious one. It was indeed so many of the common men and women of Italy who responded well to the young Mussolini who was neither particularly cultured nor a member of the elite yet was a charismatic gogetter who could speak to the crowds in a way that made sense to them for the first time ever. The landowners and aristocrats decadent and totally out of touch from reality as Bertolucci's film shows so well had no idea how to relate to the masses. In contrast Mussolini wanted to harness the energy of the multitudes giving them a sense of worth for the first time ever. What a cruel irony this turned out to be for all those people! What Bertolucci's film is successful at putting across is the fact that neutrality turning a blind eye to and staying passive to Fascism was in itself responsible for allowing it to thrive. SPOILERS Alfredo does nothing to stop Attila and his stooges beat Olmo Grard Depardieu's character to a bloody mess despite the fact he knew that Olmo was innocent of having killed the child at the wedding party. This scene is so effective in creating a sense of frustration in the viewer. Watching that scene it comes naturally to ask oneself Why didn't anyone do anything to stop it? EXACTLY! END OF SPOILERS. Regarding the accusation leveled at the uncut version of the film containing pornographic sequences I thought pornography's sole purpose was to titillate and arouse. Do any scenes in this movie try to achieve this? Most certainly not! Naked human bodies can be representative of so much more than just sex. They are not just about the degree of their ability to arouse or otherwise but also about a whole other spectrum of human states and feelings. Strength vulnerability tenderness compassion closeness distance receptiveness and whatever else is sometimes just not possible to express in so many lines of dialogue. Why shouldn't a sexual encounter  even one featuring genitals in view  speak volumes about so many other aspects of men and women's humanity? I could write so much more about this movie! Though not as mesmerisingly beautiful to look at as Bertolucci's 1970 film Il Conformista it is none the less a testament to Vittorio Storaro's genius photography once again. I will probably be watching this movie many more times and discovering more layers more beauty and even more imperfections which is all worthwhile when confronted with such amazing material. Whoever's been comparing 1900's portrayal of Fascism with the way it was dealt with in Il Conformista isn't being entirely fair the latter takes a far more intellectual approach after all Fascism was a multifaceted phenomenon and is a less ambitious film anyway therefore less likely to fail.";

	schema:reviewBody "1900 follows the lives of two friends although sometimes they seem more like enemies! born on the same day in a beautiful part of Italy. Olmo is born a bastard to peasant farmers and Alfredo is the son of a wealthy businessman. We watch their lives unfold with vivid cinematography and lush visuals of the exceptionally beautiful countryside. The movie jumps forward to the end of World War 1 and Olmo returns home after fighting. And essentially the film follows the exploits of the two protagonists as they deal with love friendship money death and the evils of war.The film unfolds like a finely crafted book taking its time to tell its story.Unfortunately the version that I watched was horrendously dubbed. It was so bad my brother couldn't continue watching. I tried to look past this major fault as I started to love the film's story and visuals and it does get better but I'd be extremely disappointed to find out a subtitled version doesn't exist. And to make matters worse it was also a Pan  Scan version. This doesn't bother me too much if I'm watching say 'Mrs. Doubtfire' but 1900 is definitely a widescreen movie. Some scenes were practically ruined as characters are framed to the extreme right or left. For example at the beginning where Olmo lays on the train line I couldn't see him in the wide shot! I couldn't see what was going on. Terrible! And the version I watched came in at about 4 hours and 35 minutes. So it was a cut version and this is blindingly obvious. The cuts are dreadful. This has to be some of the worst editing I have ever seen in my whole movie viewing life.But for all these problems easily solvable problems that have nothing to do with the movie itself unless the dub is the original I fell in love with this movie. I didn't really notice the hours passing by the story and the characters suck you into their world and don't let go until the final credits roll. And even then they are stuck in your head along with the more memorable scenes. I couldn't help but be reminded of my own childhood even when the scenes had no context to my memories. For instance the simple setting of workers ploughing a field bought back memories of playing in a big dirt mound in our backyard as a child or beautifully lit scenes at sunset I could almost feel the warmth. These memories made me feel really good and whether it was intended or not to remind the audience of their childhoods the film certainly had this wondrous effect on me.I was quite shocked with some of the scenes in this film especially the rape scene. While there is no sex shown at all at least in this version the crying eyes say more than any words or images could. You should be warned this film has some pretty graphic violence and contains a few explicit sex scenes. But the sex scenes are refreshingly realistic as opposed to Hollywood's fraudulent version of sex.The acting is for the most part admirably handled. Robert De Niro is convincing as the rich son with a poor peasant as his best friend. This role could have descended into clich but De Niro steers it clear of any such event. Towards the end of the film De Niro's performance is terrific. It's remarkable that in the same year that this was made De Niro played a certain Travis Bickle in the seminal 'Taxi Driver.' 1976 was certainly De Niro's year! Gerard Depardieu is wonderful as Olmo. I have never seen a movie of Depardieu's where he was young and I must say he was very handsome in his day! His performance elicits emotion without settling for sentimentality. The supporting cast do a good job. Burt Lancaster is both charming and divine yet in one scene I was quite uncomfortable as to where it was going to lead. But he portrays this without the clich of a dirtyoldman' but rather a lonely man who may not remember where the line of decency may now lie. Donald Sutherland is disgusting beyond description. No not his acting but the character he plays. I haven't seen too many of Sutherland's films unfortunately off the top of my head I can only recall 'Fallen' but I'm keen to see more of his work as his acting here is top notch. And the hunchback sorry can't remember his name is delightfully endearing. Only some small characters have questionable acting talents but in a film with so many bit parts this may well be expected.The word 'epic' seems to imply greatly to this film. While the scope and size of the film is epic the film relies heavily on the lives of the main protagonists. In a way this is an intimate epic if such a thing could exist.This is an excellent film that is highly recommended for people interested in Italian history the landscape of Italy and beautifully crafted films. This particular version is recommended to people interested in gaining evidence that Pan  Scan is the work of Satan and that dubbing should be a sin.If you enjoyed the films Schindler's List' and La Vita  Bella' then I'm sure you'll get something out of this film.You shouldn't be turned off by the long running time of this film you get so engrossed with the story the time just flies by. This is certainly an underrated classic treated poorly by some versions.1010 If in widescreen uncut and subtitled. 910 If Pan  Scan cut and dubbed.But as I have to give one overall score I'd have to say 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "19001976 begins with the defeat of the fascist regime in Italy by the allies.  The film then flashes back to 1900 with the birth of Alfredo and Olmo who belong to different social classes.  It follows the lives of the grandfathers as well as the growth of their two grandchildren.  Alfredo and Olmo becomes friends as young boys.Alfredo is someone who prefers to hang out with Olmo's social class then his own.  Alfredo's grandfather kills himself and Olmo's grandfather dies of old age.  Olmo joins the military and returns at the end of World War 1. A new helping hand is hired by Alfredo's father named Attila who later becomes a member of the Fascist party.Alfredo goes off adventures with his new wife Ada and the Fascist regime's battles with the Socialist becomes worse.  Alfredo and Olmo develops a lovehate relationship and Olmo exiles from his home town to avoid being caught by the blackcoats.  The film then returns to the year of 1945. 19001976 finishes in 1976 with Alfredo and Olmo as grandfather figures.19001976 does a good job in taking a narrative look at the first fifty years of the 20th Century.  The film begins during the period of a new age. The film follows the early rise of the Socialist Party in Northern Italy. It describes the struggle between landowners and socialist supporters.This movie also is good at showing the rise and fall of the landowning class.  19001976 contains a scene which describes how the Fascist Party came into being in Italy.  The landowners are the ones who planted the seeds of fascism and helped it grow to almost all powerful proportions.  The film begins with birth progresses through life and ends in death.1900 is controvsial in its full uncut frame of 312minutes.  There were many scenes deemed to be offensive that were cut from the motion picture.  One such scene is the menage a trois with Alfredo NeveStevania Casini and Olmo.  Another controvsial sequence is the rape and graphic murdertorture of a young boy at the hands of the fascist Attila.The art direction is beautifully filmed with a historic touch of Northern Italy.  The filmmakers presents Italy during the early to mid 20th Century as a country whose identity is always changing.  The motion picture gives the viewer an idea of what it might have been like in Italy during the first half of the last Century.  The actors give a realistic performance and behave like the people of that era.19001976 is comparable to Bertolucci's award winning movie The Last Emperor1987.  Both take a look at middle aged men and flashback to their childhood days.  Both Alfredo and Pu Yi are Puppets of the system as they have no real authority to behold and are just figure heads.  Finally Alfredo and Pu Yi are part of a power structure that falls apart before they are able to establish themselves as strong and powerful leaders.Bernardo Bertolucci gives another excellent directorial performance. Vittorio Storaro does a brilliant job as the director of photography. Gerald Depardieu gives one of his top performances as Olmothis is when he was slender and before he became known for his olfish looks.  Robert De Niro's performance as Alfredo is widely overlooked by his chilling portrayal of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver1976.Bertolucci did back to back films with two of the greatest actors in film historyMarlon BrandoLast Tango in Paris and Robert De Niro1900. Donald Sutherland is purely evil as the hatable Attila.  The make up effects were done by the man who did the effects for Let Sleeping Corpse Lie1974 and would later provide some of the most gory effects for most of Lucio Fulci's films during the late 1970'searly 1980'sGiannetto De Rossi. 19001976 is a perfect movie to view together with The Last Emperor1987.".

Alfredo's grandfather kills himself and Olmo's grandfather dies of old age.  Olmo joins the military and returns at the end of World War 1. A new helping hand is hired by Alfredo's father named Attila who later becomes a member of the Fascist party.Alfredo goes off adventures with his new wife Ada and the Fascist regime's battles with the Socialist becomes worse.  Alfredo and Olmo develops a lovehate relationship and Olmo exiles from his home town to avoid being caught by the blackcoats.  The film then returns to the year of 1945. 19001976 finishes in 1976 with Alfredo and Olmo as grandfather figures.19001976 does a good job in taking a narrative look at the first fifty years of the 20th Century.  The film begins during the period of a new age. The film follows the early rise of the Socialist Party in Northern Italy. It describes the struggle between landowners and socialist supporters.This movie also is good at showing the rise and fall of the landowning class.  19001976 contains a scene which describes how the Fascist Party came into being in Italy.  The landowners are the ones who planted the seeds of fascism and helped it grow to almost all powerful proportions.  The film begins with birth progresses through life and ends in death.1900 is controvsial in its full uncut frame of 312minutes.  There were many scenes deemed to be offensive that were cut from the motion picture.  One such scene is the menage a trois with Alfredo NeveStevania Casini and Olmo.  Another controvsial sequence is the rape and graphic murdertorture of a young boy at the hands of the fascist Attila.The art direction is beautifully filmed with a historic touch of Northern Italy.  The filmmakers presents Italy during the early to mid 20th Century as a country whose identity is always changing.  The motion picture gives the viewer an idea of what it might have been like in Italy during the first half of the last Century.  The actors give a realistic performance and behave like the people of that era.19001976 is comparable to Bertolucci's award winning movie The Last Emperor1987.  Both take a look at middle aged men and flashback to their childhood days.  Both Alfredo and Pu Yi are Puppets of the system as they have no real authority to behold and are just figure heads.  Finally Alfredo and Pu Yi are part of a power structure that falls apart before they are able to establish themselves as strong and powerful leaders.Bernardo Bertolucci gives another excellent directorial performance. Vittorio Storaro does a brilliant job as the director of photography. Gerald Depardieu gives one of his top performances as Olmothis is when he was slender and before he became known for his olfish looks.  Robert De Niro's performance as Alfredo is widely overlooked by his chilling portrayal of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver1976.Bertolucci did back to back films with two of the greatest actors in film historyMarlon BrandoLast Tango in Paris and Robert De Niro1900. Donald Sutherland is purely evil as the hatable Attila.  The make up effects were done by the man who did the effects for Let Sleeping Corpse Lie1974 and would later provide some of the most gory effects for most of Lucio Fulci's films during the late 1970'searly 1980'sGiannetto De Rossi. 19001976 is a perfect movie to view together with The Last Emperor1987.";

	schema:reviewBody "An epic about Italian political history of the first half of the 20th Century detailing the lives of two men born on the same day. Olmo played by Gerard Depardieu as an adult is the bastard child of peasants and is raised to be a socialist. Alfredo Robert De Niro is the son of a wealthy family and will someday become lord and master of all the peasants on his land. He's a pleasant man not cruel like his father but he won't go out of his way to help those below him in status including Olmo who is his closest friend and companion. It's a huge film and very sloppy. I would guess it would be very sloppy even in its original version the English language version is an hour shorter at least. My biggest problem with the film is the character of Olmo. As a child played by Roberto Maccanti he exhibits daring and independence. As an adult he seems like a sponge and he kind of drops out of the last third of the picture it seemed to me. My interest dropped in the character because first the character does not seem to follow from childhood to adulthood and second Depardieu gives a dull performance. He's handsome but in the kind of way that makes you forget that he even exists. Maccanti as young Olmo leaves a much bigger impression. My second biggest problem with the film is the treatment of politics. It's no secret where Bertolucci's sympathy lies with the communists. That's fine by me and it's good that he has Alfredo not as the villain but as a man who turns his back and continues to live his life as a wealthy man. But there are Fascists in the film and they are lead by Donald Sutherland. Sutherland is so evil in this film it becomes amusing. He'll do anything to get what he wants including killing old women children and he even headbutts a cat! I have no real problem with showing the Italian Fascists as evil but this is cartoonishly evil. Sutherland's character's name Attila. No sht! On the other hand I cannot help but admit that Donald Sutherland has all the most memorable scenes in the film. He may be more or less one dimensional but I'll never forget his wicked grin and I'll never forget the splattered blood on his forehead from that cat! Robert De Niro does a lot with his role which is the most complex in the film probably. His performance here matches his best work. Alfredo's wife is played by Dominique Sanda. She also gives an exceptional performance although her character could have been and might have been in the full version better developed. While I have some major problems with the overall substance of the film there's no doubt there's a genius at work here. Several actually. Bertolucci's direction is as good as it ever was and his ambition seems at least for a while peerless. He may have had several better films but this is as much a peak in his direction as Last Tango in Paris or The Conformist. Helping him achieve greatness far beyond what should have resulted are Vittorio Storaro providing gorgeous sweeping photography and Ennio Moricone ever the trooper with another exceptional musical score. 1900 despite heavy flaws is indeed a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Novecento is the Gone With The Wind of Italian cinema with enough American stars and one French one to make sure of its international market. It has the epic feel of Gone With The Wind you can also compare it to any number of films based on Edna Ferber novels. It begins at the beginning of the 20th century in Northern Italy with the birth of two boys on the same day. One is the grandson of the local Padrone Burt Lancaster who grows up to be Robert DeNiro. The second is the illegitimate grandson of the head man among the workers on Lancaster's estate Sterling Hayden and the boy grows up to be Gerard Depardieu. This had to be Northern Italy or no one would have believed Gerard's baby blues in Sicily or Calabria.Despite the difference in class which Americans have trouble comprehending but as Marlon Brando said in The Young Lions mean a great deal in Europe the boys grow up to be friends. But it's not only politics that pushes them apart it's the love of Dominique Sanda. She marries DeNiro but he can't believe she's not get a yen for Depardieu.Like Gone With The Wind with the Civil War and Reconstruction Novecento is set in the period from 1900 to 1945 which were tumultuous years for Italy. Until 1870 Italy was a geographical expression not a country until the Pope surrendered sovereignty of the Papal States. Like Germany which also united at the same time it now wanted to be recognized as a leading power Italy even got into the colonial game in Africa. Unlike every other European power it met defeat at Adowa when trying to takeover Ethiopia. That too had a major impact on the Italian psyche something Bernard Bertolucci curiously enough did not mention.He concentrated on the age old grievances of peasants against the landlords and the internal problems it was bringing Italy. Abusive landlords and the peasants they controlled a feudal system that was badly out of date in the industrial age which came to Italy a bit late but there in time to throw a lot of peasants off the land and make socialists and communists of them. The gentry the growing middle class the church responded in kind with its own counterrevolution Fascism. In fact the film's villain is Donald Sutherland as a Fascist overseer that DeNiro hires and who basically takes over running the estate and politics of the locality. This is one of Sutherland's best screen performances he will chill you to the bone with his cruelty and arrogance. He's essentially a thug who's been given political power.Running a close second is Laura Betti as DeNiro's sister who marries Sutherland and becomes a true believer in the Fascist cause. At least she sees the peasant discontent and believes Fascism will protect her privileged position. The original running time of this epic is over five hours and really should have been a miniseries. Maybe in that format we'll see the director's cut some day. It's still a powerful piece of film telling the epic story of a country for almost half a century.".

It was released during the height of the disco period when the moviegoing public wanted to see Saturday Night Fever and not a politically charged film. There would have been a different result if the film had been released ten years earlier but even that possibility is doubtful. The film is unabashedly leftist and proudly exposes the virtues of Marxism so much so it has been called the Marxist Gone With the Wind. Finally the historical issues portrayed in the film while familiar to European watchers are totally unknown to American moviegoers who never had much interest in history anyway. Still with all of these drawbacks its was on its release and remains widely popular in just about every other country in the world and a film of incredible beauty. I watched the 2DVD release years after first viewing this movie in Europe when it was first released. Little did I know I was watching the European uncut five hour plus version which was not available in the United States. The 2dvd version loses little of the effect and Bertolucci does not hide his political sympathies. Some may believe that the political message detracts from the film. Far from it. Its message is more relevant today than when it was first released. Burt Lancaster and Robert de Niro took reduced fees for acting in the movie they believed in the vision so much. De Niro made this movie immediately following Godfather II and could have demanded a higher fee but didn't.Other reviews have taken exception to the candid depictions to the coming of age scenes and the scenes depicting the killing of animals. While this may offend PETA sensibilities and as difficult it is to see the slaughtering of the pig  or any animal  there was a point to this part of the movie. One of the purposes of this movie Bertolucci says in the bonus features is to remind modern day Italians where they came from. He states that the Italian viewer watching this film in the 70's was only one or two generations away from the lifestyle reflected in the movie. It is faithfully recording everyday life of Italian peasantry a practice which lives on today in villages in Southern Europe. Nothing was wasted because they could not afford to waste anything.Folks this is not postmodern urban life in America. American viewers in the early stages of the 21st Century may be farther removed from the practice of slaughtering livestock and scrounging for a meager existence but as the day laborers in 1990 lived but I can assure you that there was a day when that was precisely how Americans lived. It is how people lived their lives until very recently for hundreds and hundreds of years.American viewers should be more disturbed on seeing how fascism took hold in preWWII Italy. It is a reminder how it can happen here or anywhere but ... It Can't Happen Here ....As difficult as these scenes are to watch Bertolucci's 1900 is actually a rather accurate reflection of political trends in Southern Europe in general and Pre and MidWWII Italy and Greece in particular and an accurate depiction of post WWI Italy.A particularly accurate account is the scene late in the movie when after the war and after the trial of Berlingheri partisans come moving in notifying the mob that a new government was installed and requested everyone turn in their firearms which they did. Roughly the same postWWII events occurred in Greece.Whatever one may be the political predispositions of anyone viewing 1900 Bertolucci has created a film of great and exquisite beauty with a powerful message as relevant today as when it was released.

Veterans Burt Lancaster and Sterling Hayden play their grandfathers Dominique Sanda is the woman they both love and Donald Sutherland inhabits the cartoonish character of Attila their Fascist nemesis with trademark fisheyed malice and depravity.

Veterans Burt Lancaster and Sterling Hayden play their grandfathers Dominique Sanda is the woman they both love and Donald Sutherland inhabits the cartoonish character of Attila their Fascist nemesis with trademark fisheyed malice and depravity. Gorgeous cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and a gentle evocative score by Ennio Morricone lend this disjointed story more appeal and dramatic clarity than it might otherwise merit. If the simplistic politics at the end leaves you cold there will have hopefully been enough vivid and touching scenes along the way to make it worthwhile.";

I am capable of sitting through long films and have done so with The Green Mile Once Upon a Time in America THe Godfather Trilogy and Titanic. However 5 hours simply seemed too long. Having watched both Acts of the film running about 2 12 hours each separately to ensure I wouldn't get hasty I still ended up being disappointed.I won't get into the plot too deeply purely because that is not what the films problem is. Simplified it is about fascism and socialism. The biggest problem is the film runs far too long. As mentioned before I am able to sit and watch a film if it holds my attention and constantly keeps me engaged as those mentioned films did brilliantly. This film doesn't and in my opinion runs at least 2 hours too long. The problem is there are so many pointless scenes and subplots that are often forgotten and add virtually nothing to the story that they really could and should have been cut out. In particular I found the scenes of the leads at a younger age outstayed their welcome and should have been greatly shortened. Many others throughout follow a similar trend. Another reason the film should have been shortened is that it really is telling a simple story that doesn't require such a huge length of time to tell it. In the final hour I was getting incredibly agitated and felt the story was deliberately dragging on for the sake of it. When the credits finally rolled I felt cheated and very unsatisfied.Despite these heavy flaws there are things that make the film slightly worth watching. First of all are the decent performances turned in by most of the cast. DeNiro Deprardieu Sutherland and most of the others are fine with Sutherland making his character an incredibly evil and unlikable person. DeNiro was the main actor who attracted me to this film and it seems to be a largely forgotten role of his. Although its not one of his best performances he really is brave and committed here as he features in two pornographic sequences that I can't imagine too many wellknown actors are willing to engage in.The best aspect of the film is the Vittorio Stanto's wonderful Cinematography that makes the most of the Italian countryside and many other wonderful landscapes. Ennio Morricone's score is fairly good also.Several scenes work well but unfortunately I was put off by the sheer amount of pointless ones that made the film as long as it was.I would recommend seeing this film only for the performances and cinematography. I would also recommend finding a much shorter cut because I believe it may be much better if it was between 2 and 3 hours or even less.Overall I give the film a generous 610".

They're the best of enemies growing up during the early part of the twentieth century. They share their dreams their fears and even their women. Alfredo grows into his lifestyle quite nicely while Olmo becomes a revolutionary fighting the Fascists embodied by cruel farm foreman Donald Sutherland as the aptly named Attila. It's brutal horrifying tragic and extremely well made with breathtaking cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and a jarring sometimes perverse score by Ennio Morricone. There are scenes in this film that are very unsettling. DeNiro is excellent capturing the passive disengaged wealthy class that allowed Mussolini and his blackshirts to run amok. Better still is Depardieu offering up the most passionate rebel on screen since Spartacus!The large supporting cast include Dominque Sanda Stefania Casini Alida Valli and as Olmo's fire breathing grandfather Sterling Hayden. Burt Lancaster plays the tragic very tragic patriarch of Alfredo's wealthy family. His cameo is truly memorable. Be wary of cut versions of the film...there are many out there. The 315 minute version is surely one of the best films to ever come out of Italy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fourseason saga of impotent gentry lusty communists perverse fascists and dead animals at 315 minutes NOVECENTO is not exactly bloated but not quite interesting enough to justify its immense running time. There is simply not enough event to fill five hours. It's Bertolucci's HEAVEN'S GATE the selfindulgent monster a director gets away with once in his career just after a stunning success like Cimino's DEER HUNTER or in this case LAST TANGO. But every third scene is just beautiful  intensely acted lusciously filmed passionately directed.What's interesting is that this simplified vision of Italian history as portrayed in 50 years of exploitation dissipation and failed revolution on a country estate doesn't look or feel particularly Italian. This isn't because it's populated by French and American leads  Sterling Hayden for instance is utterly convincing as a Bolognese peasant. And it's not the direction per se as there are flashes of neorealism and occasional moments of genuine Roman hysteria here including most of the last hour. But its universal themes methodical pace and visual style make this movie less an Italian drama than a generically European soap opera. As paean to the land it is Dutch lit like a Vermeer and composed like a Rembrandt as political polemic it's Russian with Gerard Depardieu declaiming Marxism into the camera as if he's standing in front of the Winter Palace as romance it's French if anything though Flaubert's disillusioned housewives were never this bland.There are many singularities about NOVECENTO. It's certainly the only picture to feature the penises of not merely Depardieu and Robert De Niro but Sterling Hayden it's probably the last movie to represent cocaine as a harmless diversion I hope it's the sole film to feature a horse anus massaged until it deposits a load into someone's hands. Most impressively to my knowledge it's the single movie to capture the whole breadth of Donald Sutherland's talent. He is charming funny drunken sadistic swaggering boorish pathetic scary and obsequious. It is a rare film role and an even rarer supporting turn that allows an actor so much room it is an uncommon actor indeed who can fill it.The same cannot be said of Depardieu's character who unfortunately has only one face to make in the whole thing nor De Niro's work which is as unconvincing here as he was electrifying the same year in TAXI DRIVER. This performance ranks with his most uninspired late 90s shtick. Dominique Sanda Laura Betti and Alida Valli are outrageously good in their limited roles as are Hayden Lancaster and a variety of Italian nationals. But the script wholly degenerates as the film wears on taking an unhappy turn from pastoral eloquence to symbolist rhetoric. By the end nobody's got anything worth doing except Sutherland and then he's dead and we've got twenty more minutes of tired verite speechifying. But it looks absolutely great all the way through. Though his obvious influences are so various and often so pretty Vittorio Storaro's most striking images here are of things dead and dying a hat crowned with gigged squirming frogs shot ducks twisting and drowning in a canal a fleeing fascist impaled by farm implements. Not to mention the butchered hogs and raped women and children.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have no problem with lengthy movies and many of my favorites are over three hours. However the longer a movie is the more it risks losing its focus and that's the problem with 1900. It is not boring but it goes and on jumping between characters ideas etc and about halfway through you realize This narrative isn't really going anywhere. It's just unfolding in random directions. Yes I know that the point of the story is to show the rise of Fascism and Socialism in Italy and I've heard people say that you appreciate the movie more if you are Italian. I'm not though I do love history and politically am a Socialist so I should sympathize with this movie though it provides no real history lesson other than The only reason for the rise of Fascism was Donald Sutherland's sadism and the only reason for rise of Socialism was that landowners were very mean. Furthermore the movie is shot in the spaghetti western style an Italian production with English speaking lead roles. This means that most of the supporting characters are dubbed into English but MAN is it some blatant dubbing that has a jarring effect! Thanks to DVDs I can switch over to the Italian audio track but then I'll have to put up with DeNiro and Lancaster being dubbed. Ugh! I don't get why this style of filmmaking became popular because you have to put up with awful dubbing either way.The movie begins with a lengthy childhood sequence that could have been reduced to 15 minutes without hurting the story much. Bertolucci is interested in establishing settings and characterizations but doesn't know what to do after creating them. We see a worker protest by cutting off his ear. It's a visually arresting scene but it goes nowhere. It was nice to see character actor Sterling Hayden play a memorable role but it's a superfluous character who does nothing except exist as an obvious parallel to Burt Lancaster's character. Now you might say Oh you're nitpicking. Every movie to some extent has superfluous characters. Yes but the longer the movie is the more obvious it becomes that they are superfluous. But my biggest gripe with the childhood sequence is that it focuses on two kids with dubbed voices that are OBVIOUSLY not their own and that speak out of sync with their mouth movements.The rest of the first half of the film continues with various sequences andor character vignettes that are often visually striking or get attention but are not really cohesive. We get a scene with an epileptic prostitute and a woman pretending to be blind. There's no real reason for either except that they are eccentric sequences. What exactly is wrong with Ada and why does she engage in what is borderline psychotic behavior when we first meet her? No reason is given.The second half however becomes dominated by the two villains and they are two of the HAMMIEST villains I've ever seen in a movie. It isn't enough that Sutherland's character is a Fascist he must also be a sadistic demented constantly sneering pedophile who is so obviously mentally unbalanced that he would never get a job in real life. His lover though these characters are portrayed so cartoonishly evil that it's tough to imagine them being capable of love is Regina who constantly cackles like a witch. And in case it's still not clear that she's evil she is sexually deviant as well and harbors feelings for her cousin who in one scene appears to be pleasuring her in the woods why he is participating in this scene is not really explored. These two characters go from scene to scene killing a kid here killing an old lady there no real point just to show that Fascism is bad. There is a fun scene where Attila is pelted with manure though it goes on too long and thank you Bertolucci for that random closeup of a horse's rectum! I sure needed to see that. At the movie's climax these two are chased in a witch hunt. Bertolucci goes out of his way to humiliate and degrade his villains as much as he can literally dragging them through the mud and while this scene is somewhat satisfying its impact is diminished by how long it goes on just like countless previous scenes in 1900.Well this review is getting long but what can you expect from a movie that tries to cover too much? so I will sum it up it would be a much better movie if it focused more on DeNiro and Depardieu's characters and their friendship and lost a lot of the excess baggage. Sometimes you'll get obvious plot devices a drifter randomly showing up to confess to a crime he didn't do just so that Depardieu can get off the hook at times there is no plot and most of the time you'll find yourself thinking This scene would be so much more effective if it wasn't bogged down by so much excess.Here is a YouTube video I made making fun of the movie httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vI4BxQ5ydMM".

	schema:reviewBody "Powerful words for me to hear having bought and watched this movie here in China...It is unusually interesting to read the reviews of professional film critics about Bernardo Bertolucci's wildly ambitious 1900 which in my opinion stumbles in no small part because it resembles too much some of Bertolucci's other films notably of the bizarre European sex drama variety. I have a secret theory that any legitimate film that portrays graphic sexual acts has sort of a glass ceiling a level of quality that it can't surpass no matter how spectacular the rest of the film is. That like the graphic pigslaughtering scene is simply bad taste. 1900 is no exception and the saddest thing is that the rest of the film is not even very good it's just really long. In fact at just over five hours it's one of the longest films I've ever seen second only to Stephen King's 6hour The Stand which was made for TV anyway. In all of the professional reviews I've read I've noticed some unusually interesting examinations of what went wrong with Bertolucci's much anticipated epic film and yet not one of them seems to have the nerve to come out and say what is so obviously the problem. And unfortunately the horrendously bad taste doesn't end at the literally pornographic nudity. I can't think of any legitimate reason why we should have to watch a pig being butchered and then sliced in half or and this one truly blew my mind see a man massage a horse's anus with his bare hands and then gleefully catch the steaming excrement in his hands. And to make matters worse Bertolucci in one of the short documentaries on the DVD rerelease of the film made the shocking claim that I thought it was very innocent at the time. It could very easily be said that he had no grip on reality when he made the film. Much of it is truly sickening.And the characterization is no different. Donald Sutherland is one of my favorite actors and Bertolucci managed to coax a ridiculously cartoonish and offensive performance out of him. He is of course a Fascist blackshirt a bad guy and we are most certainly not allowed to forget that. He has frightening devilishly toothy grin a cold killers stare and he wears a skull and crossbones on his shirt. He also by the way wantonly kills kittens and children. I only wish I could say that I was just being dramatic when I say that...The film tells the story of an era not of its main characters but it tells that story through the lives of the characters. DeNiro plays Alfredo Berlighieri the son of a wealthy landowner and best friend of Olmo Dalco Gerard Depardieu a the son of a peasant who works for Alfredo's father. The scenes of their childhood are alternately fascinating and revolting as we learn of their friendship despite their different backgrounds and yet are forced to sit through scenes of them as 12 or 13 year old boys examining and comparing their penises. There is no need for something like this in any film in any country at any time. Ever. From here on respectable members of the audience may find it difficult to forgive this perverse nonsense and objectively enjoy the rest of the film. I also love the weakness of the characterization in the film. There is a scene early in the film where Olmo's father gives him a rousing speech about going off to join the military and maybe even learn to obey and take a wife but never forget that he comes from peasants and just to make sure everyone in the audience has figured out that this is not a family of nobility Olmo walks his dirty bare feet across a lengthy and crowded dinner table as his father gives him the speech. No one seems to mind.From a technical standpoint the film is a total belligerent disaster. Everything is dubbed over so no one's voice matches their facial movements which are in turn exaggerated by the actors so they can try to more easily match up the dialogue later. It rarely ever works and so their voices and the ambient sound is totally off from beginning to end. The photography on the other hand is brilliant but as Ebert suggested it comes across almost like an apology for the narrative mess of the rest of the film.Most interesting is that Bertolucci managed to make such an incompetent film with such stupendously talented actors as Gerard Depardieu Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland. Sutherland's character is so cartoonish that it's nearly impossible to take anything about his performance seriously but DeNiro and Depardieu are both outstanding in their roles which are mirror images of each other in more ways than one. Unfortunately as becomes completely obvious in the film's closing scene Bertolucci just had no idea what to do with them. 1900 is not a complete failure but it is as close as I've ever seen a film this big come to being one. It is not a successful or even a respectable effort but it is definitely an ARDUOUS effort kind of like sitting through the whole movie...".

No character is really developed despite the over 5 hour run time and one of them the Padrone DeNiro's wife may be the single most annoying character ever set in a movie.Speaking of DeNiro roughly 80 of his dialogue sounds like he doesn't really even care what he's saying. Poor Donald Sutherland was given the diabolical Attila role. It's pretty much a one note performance of evil and stupidity from beginning to end. Scenes are in the film which serve no purpose other than to bore the audience to tears or in my case make me cry from laughing. After a young boy is killed the guests at a wedding run around in the scene immediately following as if they were in a Keystone cops movie. One of the lead characters is named Olmo which was the basis for another film years later called St. Olmo's Fire. Oh wait I meant he was the basis for a stupid Muppet on Sesame Street. There's a scene where a character gets his face stuffed with horse manure. That experience is very similar to watching this film. 1900 is simply another 1970's catastrophe along the lines of Heaven's Gate.".

	schema:headline " The 20th Century in Five Hours";
	schema:reviewBody "Bernardo Bertolucci's Novecento has five hours and fifteen minutes and before we know it this historical epic ends and we're left craving for more. That's the ultimate grace of Bertolucci's masterpiece one never feels the movie's length it flows and involves us so hypnotically in its story that we lose sense of time. The story is so finely constructed the actors so good the cinematography so breathtaking the music so exciting that one curses the unavoidable moment when the credits roll down the screen.Released in 1976 Novecento is as the title says it a story of Italy in the 20th century from its beginning to the year of its release. Known in the USA as 1900 I chose the Italian title because this one misleading. The action starts the year Italian composer Verdi dies so it's actually 1901 Bertolucci knows the Gregorian calendar unlike the majority who believe in pop culture. Two children are born Alfredo and Olmo the first the heir of the Berlinghieri estate and fortune the second the bastard offspring of Alfredo's father and a peasant woman from the Dalco clan. They grow together and their lives although going in different ways many times continue to intertwine throughout the decades from the aftermath of WWI to the rise of Fascism in Italy to the liberation of Italy in 1945 they're always together until their old age.Novecento is effectively about the organisation of the labour rights movement in Italy and its clashes with Fascism. Olmo Grard Depardieu returned from the WWI sees communism as a way of uniting the peasants in the struggle for better wages and more rights and end the hunger and humiliations perpetuated by the padrones the bosses.Parallel to the labour rights movement's organisation is the rise of fascism embodied by Attila Mellanchini Donald Sutherland the Berlinghieri forearm who organizes the local Black Shirts. In the middle of this struggle is Alfredo Robert DeNiro a bon vivant who only seeks pleasure and finds love in Ada Dominique Sanda an avantgarde woman who fascinates him with her sense of modernity. Unwilling kept away from the war thanks to his father's money Alfredo sees Olmo's return as good news until politics and his inevitable fate of becoming the new padrone get in the way not to mention his inability to stand up to Attila.The film is shot in four sections each one employing a different color palette to represent each station of the year. So the first part Olmo and Alfredo's birth and childhood is bathed in bright summer colors the WWI's aftermath is filmed with autumnal browns. The Fascist reign is grey and drenched in winter rains and only Italy's liberation gives the movie its bright early colors with the coming of springtime. This is one of the greatest achievements of Vittorio Storaro a director of cinematography who never ceases to amaze me. He's lent his talent to many good movies over his legendary career Apocalypse Now The Conformist The Bird with the Crystal Plumage Reds but I've never loved the look of one of his movies so much except perhaps in an earlier much neglected Bertolucci movie called The Spider's Stratagem. Each shot could be a painting.The actors are also excellent here especially the veterans Burt Lancaster who plays Alfredo's grandfather also named Alfredo and Sterling Hayden who plays Leo the patriarch of the Dalco family. They're in the movie for about an hour but their performances are amazing enough to leave an impression especially Hayden's.As much as this movie is about fascism and communism it's also about class differences and class clashes and this is shown in the three Berlinghieri generations. Grandfather Alfredo and Leo have a relationship based on respect and codependence. His son Giovanni brings technology and consequently unemployment to his lands as well as the violent Attila to keep the workers in order and also ends many of the ancestral rights the workers had. His despotic rule marks the beginning of the peasants' consciousness that change is necessary. Giovanni's brother Ottavio is his opposite preferring to travel and enjoy life much like his nephew. Finally Alfredo simply doesn't care pursuing selfgratification and allowing Attila to gain power and impose a reign of terror in his lands with the help of Alfredo's cousin Regina Laura Betti.Donald Sutherland has always had a gift for playing villains but he set a bar too high even for himself to surpass when he played Attila the sadistic Black Shirt who crushes kittens to make philosophical points about communism molests children and kills helpless old people. Fans of Sutherland who wish to see him at his darkest and most intimidating mustn't miss this film.DeNiro Sanda Betti and Depardieu are also very good with Depardieu outshining DeNiro only because he has a more demanding and visible role. Sanda is also good even if her role is to be basically annoying most of the time. Betti makes a great demonic pair with Sutherland. DeNiro today the most famous of the actors who worked in this film delivers one of his typically good performances but he doesn't reinvent himself like in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. This is Depardieu's film.Also worthy of note is Ennio Morricone's score containing many of his most uplifting compositions. Bertolucci made this film to inflame hearts and rouse consciousnesses to make viewers leave the cinemas anxious to change society and make the world a better fairer place so Morricone's music works perfectly with the images. And even if Bertolucci's goal ultimately failed the movie is so well crafted its grandiose finale should leave viewers pretty upbeat and hopeful.No review of Novecento can do the movie justice. It's a work of art it must be watched.".

It is far more than a movie it is a poem and one of the greatest works of art in cinematic history.";

My 2 main problems with 1900 were 1 the story or rather its political bias. During 5 hours you are presented to a piece of political perspective which would be more to the point in an old Walt Disney cartoon Fascists are a minority of bad ugly pervert and eyesrolling murderers how they came to power in Italy appears to be mystery by the way. Landowners are obviously decadent lazy with a hint of sexual impotence. Communists are hardworking beautiful saintlike beings  their political aim appear to peacefully sing the International while toiling in the fields. Apparently Mr Bertolucci learned his XXth Century history in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. 2 the soundtrack is awful. Apparently all actors are postsynced so that de Niro's voice can be heard in the English version but it doesn't look like he was actually saying his lines while the film was shot Depardieu in the french version etc... Besides the music of Morricone I'm sorry to have to disagree with some of my fellow IMDb reviewers is quite bad.After a couple of hours and despite the temptation to call it a day I watched the rest of the movie hesitating between consternation and plain hilarity.

	schema:reviewBody "My title sums it up really well modesty be damned. I would give this film an award for having the best potential. What could be better than a film written and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci scored by Ennio Morricone photographed by Vittorio Storaro using the acting talents of Robert DeNiro Gerard Depardieu Dominique Sanda Burt Lancaster and Donald Sutherland for a whole 315 minutes? Apparently a lot. Novecento which I refuse to call 1900 because none of it actually takes place during that actual year usually has the same critique moments of true brilliance with other stuff thrown in. My favorite review used the metaphor of a delicious pasta salad with chunks of Velveeta thrown in.Truly this films really does look delicious at first. My mouth was watering at least. This is the stuff dreams are made of or so I hoped. For starters it was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci who is one of my favorite directors and maybe even my favorite. He had come from making two masterpieces The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris. Ennio Morricone well need I say more? The same goes for Vittorio Storaro whom I consider to be the greatest color cinematographer. The cast is made up of international greats. Did I mention it was a whole 315 minutes?During the first four hours of so this movie was really something special. Yeah there were a few of those chunks of Velveeta thrown in but they were heavily outweighed. I'm glad to say that the pacing was excellent. Then the ending came around and I had to ask my self What went wrong?Let me start by stating what did not go wrong. The score for one did not go wrong. The cinematography was great as always. Some of the main performances such as those by Burt Lancaster and Gerard Depardieu were really good. I hate to admit it but I really blame Bernardo Bertolucci. Don't get me wrong this man is a genius. I'm just sad that he had to mess up his first epic. While Bertolucci's masterful touch is felt throughout most of the film he just got carried away. This film is drunk in politics. His masterpiece The Conformist is very balanced in its politics both consist mainly of antifascism and maybe a little procommunism. Most of the chunks of Velveeta are the bits of politics thrown haphazardly into the film.There are also some of the characters the villains are so hammy and fascist Robert DeNiro puts on a frankly bad performance and the peasants seem kind of cheesy at times although they're perfectly fine throughout most of the movie.In the end I would still give this a positive rating. If some of the political junk wasn't thrown in we could have ourselves a masterpiece. Unfortunately movies cost too much to have final drafts so we have to live with what it is. Personally I am perfectly fine with that but it makes me sad to think of what could have been. Oh Bertolucci if you hadn't made such good films before I don't know how I could forgive you....".

Mark Dacascos is a stand out in a film bursting with a rich variety of contrasting fighting styles and weapons. This is BloodSport with weapons and a LOT more blood!!! it even boasts a cocky large Yankee competitor like Bloodsport!. The action is somewhat brutal and in the original cut very little is left to the imagination when it comes to the gory wounding and killing blows which I feel is as it should be!. Dacascos as Kenshiro in particular brings a restraint and elegance to his role as a Yakuza swordsman intent on perfecting his craft at the expense of his opponents and their limbs! in the arena  only drawing his sword upon his infliction of a lightning fast maiming or killing blow.Yes this film does not boast polished storytelling or compelling characterisation but it does provide a unique and entertaining addition to the martial arts genre and stands alone as an ultraviolent tournamentstyle actioner with a talented cast of martial artists.And for this at least we should recognise it's value!!!".

They managed to throw in a lot of different fighting styles from many places and it was really interesting. Several of the styles were new to me. Another great thing is the introduction of Marc Dacascos into the world of martial arts movies. He's a great fighter and here he made a convincing and extremely evil villain. The fight scenes in this movie are good and they're also extremely brutal even more brutal than Shootfighter. If you like martial arts action you'll definitely like this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "American Samurai fits into a genre of cinema that enjoyed far to short lived a success that being the underground martial arts death tournament film. Films like this enjoyed a great boom in the eighties and early nineties and arguably were the influences for the modern fighting tournament games such as Street Fighter 2 and the like.  Some other films of this genre are Ring of Steel Best of the Best 2 Blood Fist 2 and perhaps one of the last of these magnificent creatures to appear in theater John Claude VanDam's The Quest... unless of course you count the more recent Fight Club which you shouldn't because it's not about underground martial arts guys that fight but just normal guys and that isn't the main plot of the film anyway really.  As evident from the title this film also belongs to the school of sticking the word American in front of stuff  IE  American Ninja's 1 through 4 American Ronin and American Cyborg.  this usually means you have an instant classic on your hands.  Anyway what really makes the film shine is the cast of characters.  American Samurai offers more weird fighters than any other film of the genre that I have yet seen.  If nothing else it would make a great video game.  I will attempt to catalogue the assortment of fighters in the style of a badly translated Nintendo instruction booklet.The American Samurai  A warrior of much honor though American trained by master Samurai in Mountains of Japan.  Master of Sword and peaceful of heart but strong to win. Entered tournament to reclaim family sword from evil brother.His Yakuza Samurai Brother  Adoptive brother of American Samurai and son of Master Samurai.  Strong fighter but gangster with no honor or mercy too.The Bowie Knife Cowboy  American fighter fast with knife although quite stupid.  Fights in tournament for much cash prizes and honor.African Master of the Quarter Staff  Not much known about this fighter. likes to strike poses with his staff weapon.Pirate Swordsman  A much feared prate from the coast of far off lands. Wears eye patch but is still dangerous.The Deadly Braid  Much like fighter in Best of the Best 2 he fights with sharp implement tied to his long braid of hair.  Born in China he possess much fighting spirit.Chinese Axe Spear Guy  Second warrior from china and master of martial arts axe spear technique.  Fast warrior but uses much energy in attacks.Conan the Barbarian Guy  Former stunt man of lame 80's European sword and sorcerycaveman movie genre gone renegade.  Now looks for new career wielding broadsword for money and glory in tournament.Nordic Viking Berserker Type  Crazy Horned warrior from Sweden. Attacks fierce with axe.Weirdass Klingon Sword Looking Thing Wielding Guy  Warrior killed by Evil Yakuza Brother.  Fought with weirdass star trek alien weapon things.I know there wear a few guys I've forgotten too.  Oh yeah this film also features John Fujioka playing the Japanese martial arts master who raises and trains our hero upon finding him stranded in his infancy.  This is the exact same role he played in American Ninja.  I only play old Japanese Guys that find American babies and raise them to be martial arts masters.  Now that's over specific type casting if you ask me.  Anyway the film is also peppered with blindfolded swordsman training sequences lots of crazy fighting and flash backs to really bad wise old sensei advice.  In short this movie rocks.  There should be more films like this.  I'd comment on the film's success at creating one of the most awkward romantic subplots ever but I think I've run out of space.  See it yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie when I was in 8th grade. A friend invited me and a couple of friends to his house after school to see American Samurai on video. The movie lacked of some elements like acting and editing but we all agree on one thing the movie had impressive sword fighting scenes. The movie was release by the time the fighting Games where at there higher point. It follows a sequence of low budget films related to competition fighting in the eighties and early nineties like Bloodsport Kickboxing Shootfighter and American Ninja. The story begins when an American couple and there son are traveling on a privet plane that crashes nearby an isolated part of Japan. An old Japanese swords man finds the boy that is the only survivor and takes him as his own and trains him in the Samurai ways. A few years later his other son Kenjiro played by Mark Dacascos joins the Yakuza mafia and is disowned by his father. Kenjiro steals the family Katana so he can use it in gladiatorial fights that take place in a Turkish arena. Andrew Collins played by David Bradley is set to find the sword of his adopted father. On his way he meets with Janet played by Valarie Trapp and falls in love with her. Janet is kidnapped by Kenjiro and forces Andrew to fight in the arena. Soon Andrew is faced against fearless fighters from around the world and that the fights are to the death. The only way to survive is by using his Samurai techniques. Mark Dacascos performance as the villain is great and the fighting scenes are phenomenal. The concept of armed combat is what really made this film unique at the time. So if you want to see a classic martial arts movie this you will definitely enjoy.".

As well as recycle elements from their past hit BLOODSPORT including a big burly guy with a beard as one of the contestants! It's clear the movie was cut for an R rating given how some wounds and killings are not shown as clearly as you would think but the editing also shows signs of production problems. One lengthy scene seems to have been cut in half with the subsequent half played much later in the movie. There is also awkward narration and a very long sex scene where you never see the faces of the lovers furthering the suspicion of frantic efforts to patch together the movie. The production values are pretty good and Firstenberg does deliver the goods with the fight sequences which are expertly choreographed. He doesn't do well with the actors however having Dacascos overact at times and Bradley giving yet another uncharismatic performance.".

However if you really want to enjoy this movie don't get the US VHS version because it is heavily cut. The UK VHS although it is PAL has only 1 second missing and it's a part where a man pulls out a knife in a disco. The reason they cut this out is to prevent kids from imitating this yeah I know it sounds funny. However EVERYTHING else has been left intact. Since it is PAL you would have to convert it to NTSC but it is much much better than watching the heavily edited US tape.The French DVD titled American Samourai is completely uncut and also has the one second missing from the UK tape. The bad thing is that this french DVD does not have English sound only french.Anyway this movie is an excellent martial arts movie!".

Unlike the characters in that series of movies some of the people in this actually do seem to know martial arts. Kind of a cross between a genuine fu flick like a Jet Li movie and typical American crap.The rest of the plot is......ah who cares its a samurai movie doesn't matter. PUnlike American Ninja this movie doesn't have 2 guys taking on dozens of ninja masters that can be knocked out with one punch this has more of a realistic one on one style and it is a challenge for the combatants. Much like Blood Sport.What it does have going for it it the interesting fighters in the last 45 minutes of the movie the first half of the movie is just filler to make an excuse for all of the fighting at the end so skip it.The fighters at the end look like they were pulled straight from an early 90's 2D arcade fighting game. That is the high point of this flick.The low point and I mean VERY low point is the last fight scene. Both of the samurai are wearing the same black and white outfit no other colors. If you look close during the last fight though you can clearly see red streamers coming from out of the frame they reused footage from one of the earlier fight scenes to add length to the last fight and it looks SOOOOOOOO cheesy. Also the actors don't know  a damn thing about sword fighting they just clang them together for 5 minutes that coupled with the reused footage makes it a nonclimax.Since 45 minutes of this movie is solid fighting with fighters that actually do know how to use their weapons the very last scene isn't as important.You can do worse then this any American Ninja above 2 for example.Not really good or really terrible.510 when compared to other Funinja movies would score higher if the last fight scene was done well.".

It wouldn't have been that obvious if it wasn't for the fact that the main character kept changing uniforms every 5 seconds the guy he kept fighting changed as well and for the horrible dubbing they did to make the previous scenes fit.Avoid this movie at all cost.

	schema:reviewBody "After a plane crash in the Japanese mountains a baby named Andrew  the lone survivor  is adopted by a samurai master John Fujioka. Andrew trains in the ways of the samurai alongside the samurai's own son Kenjiro. Grown up Andrew David Bradley is bestowed the family sword an act that angers the now Yakuza Kenjiro Mark Dacascos. Years later Andrew works as a journalist and the sword is stolen from him. He and his photographer Janet Valarie Trapp head to Turkey to investigate a sword killing of a Sheik. Naturally this means they are kidnapped and Andrew is forced to enter a deadly martialarts tournament where the reigning champion is Kenjiro. One of the last of the Cannon productions you can see them grasping at anything to make them money as this is basically a violent remake of their last hit BLOODSPORT 1988. You get all of the same stuff right down to the bearded American fighter friend but minus all the plot that the Van Damme film had. This is actually the first Bradley film I've seen and he does quite well in the lead. Of course anyone would look good opposite the bugeyed performance by Dacascos as the villain. Man he is hilariously bad. I'm glad he kept working as he is a talented martial artist but thank goodness someone told him to turn it down in his future roles. Director Sam Firstenberg delivers solid action and if you are going to see the film make sure to seek out the unrated version as the US version removes a lot of the violence. Yes there is gore on display bullet removal arm severing beheading that seems to be more befitting of a horror movie from that era.".

	onyx:emotionText "After a plane crash in the Japanese mountains a baby named Andrew  the lone survivor  is adopted by a samurai master John Fujioka. Andrew trains in the ways of the samurai alongside the samurai's own son Kenjiro. Grown up Andrew David Bradley is bestowed the family sword an act that angers the now Yakuza Kenjiro Mark Dacascos. Years later Andrew works as a journalist and the sword is stolen from him. He and his photographer Janet Valarie Trapp head to Turkey to investigate a sword killing of a Sheik. Naturally this means they are kidnapped and Andrew is forced to enter a deadly martialarts tournament where the reigning champion is Kenjiro. One of the last of the Cannon productions you can see them grasping at anything to make them money as this is basically a violent remake of their last hit BLOODSPORT 1988. You get all of the same stuff right down to the bearded American fighter friend but minus all the plot that the Van Damme film had. This is actually the first Bradley film I've seen and he does quite well in the lead. Of course anyone would look good opposite the bugeyed performance by Dacascos as the villain. Man he is hilariously bad. I'm glad he kept working as he is a talented martial artist but thank goodness someone told him to turn it down in his future roles. Director Sam Firstenberg delivers solid action and if you are going to see the film make sure to seek out the unrated version as the US version removes a lot of the violence. Yes there is gore on display bullet removal arm severing beheading that seems to be more befitting of a horror movie from that era.";

I watched this video as part of my research on a new director Tony Szeto. I was amazed by the fight scenes that involved Mark Dacascos Kenjiro and Tony Szeto PhanXu. Even with the dismal fight between Dacascos and a hopeless Bradely Drew the closeups reveal a telling red flag V obviously the closeups of the previous fight between Dacascos and Szeto. Realize that barring the slow motion all fighting was done in real time. That is there was no motion speedup as often used in Hong Kong kungfu films. I don't know about the rumors that they used actual weapons blunted of course but I have an article from an Israeli newspaper that says one of the actors were injured by a weapon while shooting one of the fight scenes. With Brotherhood of the Wolf 2002 it is surely only a matter of time before Dacascos hits the Alist in Hollywood. But with the knowledge that much of the martial arts choreography was done by Tony Szeto I'm looking forward to seeing his directorial debut in DragonBlade 2003 which apparently will be packed full of martial arts weaponry.".

After reaching the highest levels of Samurai school Master Sanga bestows upon him the treasured family sword. However his son from birth Kenjiro Sanga Dacascos feels anger betrayal and resentment about that fact. So much so he joins the Yakuza. Later on Drew becomes a reporter in L.A.

So now the two halfbrothers must face off in the ultimate duel to the death the honor of the Samurai vs. the evil of the Yakuza. Who will slice and dice their way to the truth? In American Ninjas 3 4 and 5 David Bradley was the American Ninja. Now he's the American Samurai. We know Cannon recycles plot ideas all the time but come on. A transparent word change from one wellknown aspect of Japanese culture to another is pretty obvious. But what this movie really is is practically a remake of Bloodsport. Even the back of the DVD touts the fact that It's Bloodsport with blades! There's even an amazing facsimile of the Donald Gibb character in Harrison Ryon. But there are plenty of meatheads with weapons on display and many of them seem to take on wellknown personas. For example there's a guy who's strongly reminiscent of Conan the Barbarian 1982 and Harrison resembles Indiana Jones and his name is Harrison...coincidence?. The situation is sort of a cross between Ring of Steel 1994 Best of the Best 2 1993 and Bloodsport 1988.Dacascos puts in an energetic performance as the angry brother and Trapp is decent as your classic reporter who bickers with Collins and then inevitably falls in love with him. She even calls him Samurai Hunk. Ugh. But a lesserknown fan favorite gets a pretty decent slice of the action here  Ron Vreeken of Hurricane Smith 1992 Rage and Honor II 1993 Deathfight 1994 and Under the Gun 1995 fame. He looks extrameatheady and we mean that as a compliment ? but then again it's hard not to when you wear a wrestling singlet for the entirety of the movie and you have long blonde hair. But it is nice of the Arena captors to provide their fighters with their own weight room.Sadly American Samurai is the victim of overlyPC editing. By that we mean in days gone by during the death and dismemberment scenes which are undoubtedly the highlights they would either show the blood or perhaps gore or release the movie in two versions cut or uncut. In the PC 90's they just released a jaggedly cut version. The Swedish DVD is uncut but extremely hard to find. It's a real shame. In the DVD era American fans should be given what they want. There's no excuse for it and the only cuts we should be seeing are the ones administered by David Bradley and Ron Vreeken! Perhaps interestingly American Samurai is an alternate title for Paper Bullets 2000 and American Samurai 2 is what the Jerry Trimble outing Live By the Fist 1993 is called in Germany. It all gets very confusing but all you really need to remember is that this American Samurai is yet another underground fighting movie that is okay not bad but could have used a tad bit more originality.For more action insanity please visit www.comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember this film as a kid because it used to come on the TV station USA about 6 times a year from around 94 to 98. Thought about it recently for some random reason and bought a copy pretty cheap online.American Samurai came out sort of at the tail end of the martial arts arena fighter craze and in my opinion and fallows the usual story line where a martial artist's insert wife brother mother sister child teacher student pet dog pet fish is seriously injured or killed by some scary psychopathic guy who also is a martial artist either in the ring or out enters arena combat and then gets revenge. But there's a few twists.This time however Doug Bradley is going after a sword stolen by Mark Dacascos' thugs who happens to be the son of his guardian who trained them both to be samurai. The first 30 minutes of the film is the usual bull crap with terrible and seemingly pointless dialogue and is fallowed up on by some really good action sequences. This movie is a lot different than your average arena fighter. The combatants employ the use of blades and the body count is much much higher and it's much darker in my opinion than other movies in the genre like Mortal Kombat and Kickboxer.On paper it sounds pretty awesome but it's marred by the use of hokey arena fighters one is dressed up like Conan the Barbarian for example and bad editing. There was one scene of monologue in the film that featured a combatant that had just been killed 30 seconds earlier. The acting is bad but it's better than the likes of Bloodsport im not dissing Bloodsport just making a valid statement.The best parts of the film in my personal opinion are Mark Dacascos and the ending itself. Mark does overact but gives a fine performance for his first film and the ending resolves on a bittersweet and abrupt note that left a lot of loose ends for a sequel that to my knowledge was never made.After growing up and seeing this movie again I have to say that I still like it. But it's very flawed due to bad directing editing and it's definitely dated now. It's worth seeing and I think that a good director could remake this film right and come up with a good product.".

The acting is bad but it's better than the likes of Bloodsport im not dissing Bloodsport just making a valid statement.The best parts of the film in my personal opinion are Mark Dacascos and the ending itself. Mark does overact but gives a fine performance for his first film and the ending resolves on a bittersweet and abrupt note that left a lot of loose ends for a sequel that to my knowledge was never made.After growing up and seeing this movie again I have to say that I still like it. But it's very flawed due to bad directing editing and it's definitely dated now. It's worth seeing and I think that a good director could remake this film right and come up with a good product.";

	schema:headline " If only more people had the guts to make films like this....";
	schema:reviewBody "I really wish that there were more movies like Henry out there. Most people still don't realize just HOW controversial this film was when it was made. The MPAA wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. McNaughton fought for 4 years to get an R rating but no dice. And since he didn't want the X and there was no NC17 rating at the time it was finally released with no rating in 1990. And why? I've seen films with MORE violence in them...Romero's Day of the Dead leaps to mind. But it's not the violence in this film that makes it so disturbing. It's the way the material is handled. And this is what the film's detractors obviously can't appreciate.Henry doesn't bother with any type of morality...it neither glorifies nor denounces Henry's actions. It simply observes. It places those actions before us and says there it is...you deal with it...you sort it out. People who don't like this film often say that there's no character development...no discernible plot line...etc. etc. Those people should stop throwing around film school terms. This is one movie that doesn't present events in a movie reality...it shows us things as they are in the real world. Character development means showing you enough of the characters in 90120 minutes to make you feel as if you've known them forever. How often do you spend 90 minutes with a real person and know that much about them...or feel that you can seriously identify with them? It's just a conceit of filmmaking. Same with plot lines. Does life have a plot line? Not at all. Life is an endless succession of things happening. Some seem important andor entertaining...some don't. Henry in its attempt to realistically portray the life of a serial killer does not need a plot line...in fact it benefits from having only a very loose plot line. Much like a homicidal version of The Catcher in the Rye this film seems much like a lot of things that happened as opposed to a carefully constructed fictitious story...which make it seems all the more real...and all the more disturbing.Henry is disturbing on many levels. Firstly it feels very real. Too real perhaps. Nothing is slicked up...nothing seems counterfeit or contrived. The entire thing is so utterly plausible that it chills you to the bone. Secondly the complete lack of police involvement is equally disturbing. The only time you see a police car in this film it's driving past in the background as Henry is cruising the streets. It drives past...and that's it. And Henry isn't scared...nor is he even aware apparently. He has nothing to hide. He knows the police won't connect his crimes to one another...and they certainly won't connect them to him. So what has he to fear?And finally the setting of Chicago makes the film more disturbing for me as I'm somewhat familiar with that city and can spot some locales in the film that I recognize. In fact a friend of mine who lives in Chicago told me that the first time he watched Henry he and a friend rented it and sat down in his friend's apartment to watch it. It was about halfway through that they realized that the apartment they were sitting in was the same one used as Henry's apartment in the film. All I can say is...I'd never use that bath tub again.All in all I truly wish that more directors had the guts to make films like Henry. Honestly I can't think of one film that's comparable. There simply aren't any films out there that are anything like this. This is truly one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. After seeing Happiness I guess that Henry probably got knocked down to Number Two on that list. But Second Most Disturbing Film Of AllTime is still a damn fine achievement in my opinion.If you want to see an accurate and appallingly realistic portrayal of what the life of a serial killer must be like definitely give Henry a viewing. Make up your own mind from there.Oh and a final note...one reviewer stated concretely that his biggest problem with the film was that serial killers work alone. This is of course not always the case. The real life counterparts to Henry and Otis Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole DID kill together as did Bianchi and Buono the infamous Hillside Stranglers. Those are not the only such instances...but they're certainly the bestknown. Therefore the overly broad generalization that serial killers work alone is no real attack on the realism of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I had the chance to see HENRY 2 I wasn't really sure if I had seen the first one because so much time has passed since its release and the commotion it caused back in '86. Now having had the chance to see the 20th Anniversary Edition from Dark Sky Films I'm not so sure that I didn't remember it as much as I didn't WANT to remember...John McNaughton presented the indie world with his calling card via this film and simultaneously raised the bar for what realism is in these kinds of horror movies. And where the true horror lies is the way in which it deconstructs and deglamorizes the image that Hollywood has created for serial killers. This is not a chronicle of a superintelligent monster like Hannibal Lecter or even the channeled virtuosity of a noble murderer like Dexter Morgan. This could be anybody you walked past down the street yesterday or saw at the stop light on the way home from work. And make no mistake about it...he works at a job pays rent and buys groceries like anybody else. And if you happen to catch yourself alone with him at the wrong time the next time anyone will ever see you again is at the morgue. Count on it.Based loosely on the exploits of multiple murderer Henry Lee Lucas HENRY was the breakout role for Michael Rooker SLITHER and together with costars Tom Towles as his dimwitted sidekick Otis and Tracy Arnold as Otis' emotionally blasted sister Becky they paint a documentarystyle picture under McNaughton's guidance of how some people living on the fringes of society behave. This doesn't necessarily mean that they're wildeyed foamingatthemouthcrazy and therein lies the scariest part of all. These are the kind of bluecollar saltoftheearth types that you might dismiss without giving a second thought...but the time might come when you do so at your own peril.From the opening frames of the movie you know you're in territory that's far removed from the usual slasher film. Henry is seen doing mundane everyday things  buying cigarettes finishing lunch at a local diner  and juxtaposed with those scenes are absolutely horrific shots of dead mutilated bodies as the sounds of how they died careen and crash underneath the discordant music along the soundtrack. Sorry kids but this isn't THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. In that picture as within this one a time and place is firmly established. But if you don't live in Texas part of you can sort of remove yourself from the horror that wants to seep into your subconscious and stay there.With HENRY it becomes obvious that the locale is somewhere in metropolitan Chicago but the urban landscape is familiar enough that it could be Atlanta Detroit Boston New York anywhere. It could be the city where YOU live now.And by writing the characters and the events they're involved in with a totally detached nonjudgmental eye McNaughton and writing partner Richard Fire reveal a horror more numbing and penetrating than a thousand Freddy Kruegers or Michael Myers. There are people in the world who actually do these kinds of things and they're out there NOW...and it's only by the grace of providence or some cosmic lottery that we've won that we don't ever run into these people...or that some of us unfortunately do.Enough has already been written about the remarkable performances of all the actors involved so the only thing I can add is that if you've never seen HENRY you need to watch it all the way through at least once. I can safely say that you will see why horror is the way it is today and how so many filmmakers have misinterpreted what director McNaughton was saying with HENRY.With the searing images still fresh in my mind I can only say this...I feel like I need to take about a hundred hot showers and none of it will ever wash away how nasty and horrible it made me feel. Which I believe is exactly what the makers of this film were trying to accomplish.I sincerely hope that once you've seen this you would feel the same. And I would be really worried about anybody who doesn't or worse who said they enjoyed it.".

	schema:headline " Harrowing and real.";
	schema:reviewBody "The real Henry Lee Lucas had one of the worst childhoods that I have ever had the misfortune of reading about. Growing up in Texas he lived with a family that was totally dysfunctional. He grew up in a shack that had nothing more than a dirt floor. The father being a legless alcoholic literally as well as figuratively. The mother worked as a prostitute. Henry was also forced into sexual activity with her clients. They forced him to dress as a girl and then would proceed to have sex with him. He was a child that grew up being raped.  He then grew up with such an intense rage that he became a serial killer. Are we surprised? Now I am not trying to justify his behaviour. Rather I am pointing out the fact that these people do not just fall out of the sky. There is no such thing as an inexplicable evil. That is the person is just evil because they are. Yes there seems to be some genetic evidence  for psychopaths. However the majority do not become killers. The ones who become killers are made. If you are truly interested in what makes a psychopath I suggest you read 'Not Guilty by reason of Insanity ' by Dorothy Otnow Lewis. Serial killers are often portrayed as being like Hannibal Lecter. Smart and talented creatures that have suddenly lost their moral code. The truth is most are a psychological mess. Losers that are full of conflicting emotions. There is also strong evidence to suggest that these people are made by a specific form of brain damage. Basically when you combine trauma in childhood and frontal lobe brain damage you end up with Henry.  This movie is what happens when people are treated in an utterly horrific way. Michael Rooker is excellent as a psychopath who seems normal but deep down harbours a psychotic rage against society. He and Otis travel around killing. Why? Why not? The pointlessness of their lives is perfectly captured. People complain about the lack of plot. I think it perfectly captures the plot. It shows the emptiness of these characters. In fact Henry and Otis feel nothing unless they are killing. The emotional side of the characters has been like killed off by previous abuses against them. They are not unlike the living dead. Even when Otis's sister shows some affection towards Henry he cannot reciprocate. He can't relate to people he can only get off on torture and death. Yeah this is shocking. But it is also incredibly sad.  Here in New Zealand there are many shocking drunk driving ads that they play to try and get people to stop this behaviour. I feel that this movie is like that. The movie is an ad for psychopaths who they are and the dysfunctional psychological world that they inhabit. It is a film that honestly looks at these kinds of people. This certainly does not glorify these people which is a criticism that has been levelled at the 'Silence of the Lambs' series. This is why I think it shocks people. The serial killer kills for visceral physical pleasure. As Ted Bundy stated 'I killed because I wanted to.' Maybe this is where the film falls down. That the characters motivations are not explained well enough. But either way the viewer is given a shockingly realistic interpretation of a serial killers world. Obviously this is a film that was made on a budget! But this just adds to the bleakness. In fact Chicago looks dirty grimy and not like somewhere that you would visit. The performances of the rest of the cast are pretty average if not bad. So the film has some definite flaws. The exploitation factor is there. But then I think of films like Baise Moi and this film has nothing on that!  Overall I think this is an objective look at a world that those of us who come from normal backgrounds will find horrific. A world that we prefer would never exist but however does exist. Maybe one day as our society matures these people will cease to exist. Stories like these will become completely fictional. I really hope for that day. 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "A flat disturbing film almost documentary in scope which trawls the depths of the human condition. 'Henry' is not surprisingly often slated as a violent exploitation film bundled together at Film Fairs with the Italian cannibal flicks of the 70's.Make no mistake though this is a highly commendable piece of moviemaking which tackles the subject of serial killers with the same noholdsbarred approach which 'M' did way back in 1931. By referencing the early Fritz Lang classic I am intentionally comparing 'Henry' favourably with it. I would also say that Henry Rooker's performance is on a par with Peter Lorre's.The film develops like a threehanded play revolving around Henry's flat which he shares with former prisonmate Otis. The trio is made up by Becky the sister of Otis who comes to visit.We are introduced to Henry immediately as a killer and the story does exactly what it says it will in the film's title. We simply follow Henry throughout his daily routine. No mention is given to any police enquiries and Henry is oblivious to any notion of avoiding capture or covering his tracks. Much of the film's power comes from this nonchalant approach whereby if a person doesn't register that something he is doing is wrong then it quickly becomes almost acceptable.Rooker in the title role is totally convincing and gives a chilling performance free from the mannerism clichs which detract from more famous serial killer characters like Hannibal Lector and Norman Bates. I can only think of Kevin Spacey in 'Seven' 1995 giving a similar level of performance for this charactertype.Despite a couple of scenes whose violent content borders on the gratuitous for the most part 'Henry' succeeds by relying on a suffocating atmosphere and it's downbeat characters.Anyone without a sense of desolation at the end of the film must be devoid of their senses.BEST SCENE  Henry and Otis enjoying a night in on the sofa watching their recent homevideo recordings is one of the most disturbing scenes I can remember watching.".

	schema:headline " one of the scariest movies ever made period.";
	schema:reviewBody "With the BWP hype a lot of talk of going around about the scariest movie you've ever seen. Probably because I've seen over a thousand horrorfrightsuspensegore movies I have trouble pinning it down. I can't name the scariest I can name the top 5. As far as nonsupernatural horror goes this movie and Last House on the Left are the scariest movies I've ever seen.I saw this at a film festival and the audience was very very quiet. My friend and I just sat there quietly cowering most of the time. It's just way too realistic. The opening and closing are probably the most frightening and we don't even see Henry killing anyone just the bodies of his victims and their terrified screams in the background echoing. It will give you chills down your spine. The stuff in the movie that scared me wasn't any big jumps or gore just very disturbing creepy moments especially if you knew someone who was been the victim of a homicide as I do. My friend I saw it with worked at the city prosecutors office and heard about plenty of local murder cases and said it rang very very true to life. One of the most chilling scenes is early on when Henry goes to a mall and just sits patiently in the parking lot scanning. The camera looks coldly and calculatedly at different women in the parking lot from Henry's point of view. There are so many shots you almost start to wonder what the point of the scene is until it hits you they are ALL potential victims this is how he looks at women. I have always been careful as a woman whenever I am alone but after seeing the film to this DAY I do not walk to my car alone at the mall without my mace in my hand and I look all around me and never turn my back on anyone. The movie also does not glamorize the killing or violence against women at all.Also it's a good primer on home and personal safety. a good rule Do not EVER let a stranger into your house when you are home alone if you were not expecting him. In fact after I saw this I never open the door when I am home alone and not expecting anyone period. Think I'm paranoid? Watch this movie and see how safe you feel.The plot sounds simple but it's not boring. The movie follows the exploits of Henry a young man who is practically a textbook case of a serial killer male white 30's drifter softspoken shy. Conflict comes when his disgusting nasty inbred cousin Otis Toole stays with him along with his pathetic sister. One night Otis and Henry pick up a couple of prostitutes and are having sex with them in the car. Henry kills both of them sort of offhandedly with no more emotion than you would swat a fly. Otis starts joining him on his exploits. Henry is more sympathetic than Otis however because while Henry does these things because he is sick and doesn't have a choice Otis seems to get off on them and also should know better. Things sorta go downhill from there and the sister complicates things because she is so desperately lonely that Henry starts to look good to her. It culminates in one of the most chilling downbeat endings of all time.After I saw this movie at the festival I was lucky enough to be there when Michael Rooker who plays the title character came out and lectured and did Q  A. When I say lucky I don't mean lucky that I got to meet a celebrity though that was neat. I mean lucky that I was able to have proof immediately afterwards that this was just a movie. If the movie had ended and I just had to get up and go home I probably wouldn't have gotten any sleep for about a week. He was very nice and personable wore glasses and a blazer not at all like his character. The thing I remember most clearly is someone asked him what kind of movies he liked and he replied I don't like horror movies really I like musicals. Everyone laughed for about 5 minutes partially out of relief. BIG relief. See it's just a movie there's the actor right there and haha he's actually very shy and charming and harmless isn't that funny?Even with all of that I still find this one of the most disturbing unsettling movies ever made. You haven't seen a really scary movie until you see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1960 Michael Powell committed professional suicide by directing and producing Peeping Tom a thriller in which a psychopathic murderer photographs his victims at the moment of death.  Denounced as sick and without redeeming social value Peeping Tom vanished from theaters while its director also denounced as sick went on to make only two more films in the next eight years.  Powell's film has gone on to attract an avid cult following and if it hasn't done so already so will Henry  Portrait of a Serial Killer.Loosely based on the real life exploits of Henry Lee Lucas a leering low IQ sicko who became a media star after claiming to have murdered several dozen people some believe Henry was bragging this film takes a gritty realistic approach that creates the impression that we are watching real life unfold.  Director John McNaughton exploits the discomfort the viewer is inclined to feel by presenting a scene in which Henry and his equally vicious former cellmate Otis videotape the rape and murder of one of their victims then play it back for further amusement.  This shocking episode effectively makes the point that those who seek second hand thrills through violent entertainment are almost as guilty as the perpetrators of such deeds.  By casting anonymous nonstars in the leading roles not that he had a choice considering the budget and the repellent subject matter and focusing entirely on the exploits of the killers there are no scenes of police investigating the crimes or peeks into the lives of the victims McNaughton has created a brutal amoral horror film that makes the bloodiest gorefest look benign.  Although the real Henry was apprehended his cinematic counterpart is never even suspected of his crimes and gets off scotfree. Is Henry a film to acclaim or condemn?  It's a difficult question to answer and I for one cannot make a decision.  It is so expertly made that I think McNaughton deserves a round of applause and maybe an Oscar.  But at the end of the video tape of the film that I watched there was a commercial hawking Henry Tshirts 14.98 and posters 7.98.  Both were available through Henry Merchandising and this attempt to turn this all too real murderer into a cult figure deserving of a fan club is despicable.".

If you know that and see this movie you can ask some serious question about how disturbing some of our fellow humans are. This man shows no emotions what so ever. Contact with other people is nearly impossible no mercy not wondering whether his victims have a family or how old they are...no nothing. You wonder if he even IS a human no living creature can be so awful.So if you ask yourself all this during this movie and I assure you will you could say it's an excellent film. The mission of the movie itself has succeeded. The ideal atmosphere is achieved in the movie. Dark melancholic depressing...Director McNaughton really creates world you don't want to live in. Michael Rooker plays the role of his life and puts down one of the best acting performances ever. Sure he's never honored with an Oscar or any other important price for his performance but everyone who sees this movie knows it's true. Actually when I first saw this film at the age of 9  Too young I know I thought this actor was in fact a reallife psycho. Henry talks with the same aggressive tone of voice during the whole movie his eyes seem to shoot fireballs when the camera looks like in them and his appearance makes you want to puke. Actually this film is pure genius for mainly one reason  you don't have sympathy for any of the characters. Most film even is the whole cast play villains there's always one you like. One character you create a sort of band with. In Henry Portrait of a serial Killer you can only feel hate. Hate and disgust for Henry and for his companion Otis. Heck you even start to hate the girl... For being so naive that is.Although many persons are killed and many violence occurs Henry certainly ain't a gore or bloody film. Many things are suggested but not shown and in this case it's actually more or at least as scary as showing the actual murders. That's a quality you don't see in movies very much. Only the old horror movies from the 30's and 40's could do that. And now also Henry can. I advise everyone to see this movie if they haven't already. Not just if you're a fan of horror or thrillers but also if you appreciate good movies in general. Even the most critic movie buffs can only find this film terrific. It was on many many levels a very important film.".

Sure he's never honored with an Oscar or any other important price for his performance but everyone who sees this movie knows it's true. Actually when I first saw this film at the age of 9  Too young I know I thought this actor was in fact a reallife psycho. Henry talks with the same aggressive tone of voice during the whole movie his eyes seem to shoot fireballs when the camera looks like in them and his appearance makes you want to puke. Actually this film is pure genius for mainly one reason  you don't have sympathy for any of the characters. Most film even is the whole cast play villains there's always one you like. One character you create a sort of band with. In Henry Portrait of a serial Killer you can only feel hate. Hate and disgust for Henry and for his companion Otis. Heck you even start to hate the girl... For being so naive that is.Although many persons are killed and many violence occurs Henry certainly ain't a gore or bloody film. Many things are suggested but not shown and in this case it's actually more or at least as scary as showing the actual murders. That's a quality you don't see in movies very much. Only the old horror movies from the 30's and 40's could do that. And now also Henry can. I advise everyone to see this movie if they haven't already. Not just if you're a fan of horror or thrillers but also if you appreciate good movies in general. Even the most critic movie buffs can only find this film terrific. It was on many many levels a very important film.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Henry' is a hard film to sit through plain and simple. It lacks any theatricality to it whatsoever and engages in utmost realism in it's presentation of it's title monster. The fact is that people like Henry have existed without the soundtrack without the dramatic tension and without the stylized body count. 'Henry' isn't interested in creating a film merely for entertainment's sake. 'Henry' isn't really an entertaining film in the traditional sense of the word. It is a well acted and well paced drama about evil.Michael Rooker gives a tremendous performance as the title character. Henry is by far one of the most frightening characters in film and he does so with subtly. Henry is a sad looking fellow. Most of the time he is at a loss for words and with a blank solemn expression on his face. He's the kind of guy you bump into on the street and don't think twice about. Rooker is brilliant in portraying Henry in this restrained fashion. It isn't what we expect that frightens us. Look at Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs' a brilliant performance but it lacks any suspense or fear to it whatsoever. Henry is the antiHannibal. The characters in this world underestimate him until it is too late. Rooker's delivery of the minimalist dialogue is outstanding. Cold blank and with a sad gravel we are intrigued by Henry and yet we don't know what exactly intrigues us about him. This fascination is brilliantly played with in the character of Becky fascinated by Henry to the point where she convinces herself that she loves him. Tragically for her Henry is incapable of love or any humanity.In keeping up with this realistic view director John McNaughton has created a brilliant portrayal of the cold rainy streets of Chicago. The film feels almost like a documentary as the camera work is very static and gritty. I can't think of a better place to set the film than Chicago. It's capable of being a very ugly city and McNaughton's haunting trip into the back alleys and seedy neighborhoods at night is filmed beautifully. We get to comprehend the environment and yet McNaughton doesn't over empathize it.Henry is a brilliant film. Well acted and brilliantly conceived. It isn't an easy film to sit through but often the most challenging works of art aren't. Kudos to Rooker and McNaughton for taking this subject matter with utmost sincerity. Violence is either glorified on one extreme or attacked viciously on another. 'Henry' is an honest look at the capabilities and evil power violence has.".

Other than that this is fun to watch in a sick way. This and the French movie Man Bites Dog are the two movies in my collection I am embarrassed morally speaking to say I own and find fascinating to watch.There are only three main actors in this film Rooker Towles playing fellow killer Otis Toole a real dumbass trashy character and his kid sister Becky Tracy Arnold. All three are extremely interesting.The rest of the people are all victims of those two guys who go on a killing spree that is almost a daily occurrence for a short time. It's absurd but that's the story. It caused quite a star when it was released. It was given a rare NC17 rating.

	schema:reviewBody "For these type of serial killer movies you never need a budget worth millions of dollars to let it work out. Often a shoestring budget work out the best for this type its movies because it contributes to the movie its unpleasant atmosphere. You can say that in these type of movies the amateurism and simplicity all adds to the creativity and overall effectiveness of the movie. The best known example of this is the original first The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from 1978.This movie is far less known and also isn't blessed with such a great title. The title of this movie somewhat sounds something like a based on trueevents TV movie without any graphic images. But don't be fooled for Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is filled with graphic violence and other disturbing moments.The movie feels and breaths an '70's atmosphere. Also the overall style of the movie is very '70's like in a gritty dark and very straightforward type of way. It also of course helps that the movie at times uses 'homevideo' movie in which we get to see the killingsrapes from the perpetrators perspective alone.It isn't a movie that has a true beginning or ending in terms of having a conclusion that puts an end to things. It has instead now got one of the best possible endings thinkable that is shocking unexpected and satisfying even though it doesn't put a definitive end to things.The real story of Henry Lee Lucas is even more shocking and disturbing but also a lot longer and more complicated of course. It's far too much to put in a movie and then prevent it from getting ever overlong or starts repeating itself and remain original. This movie obviously had to make some choices and even decided to not only exclude a lot but also to change and add certain elements which all strengthens the story in this case. The story might seem very simple at first sight now but is's perhaps the very same simplicity that makes the movie so great and let things work out in it so effectively. It makes some great choices with its story and build up that seem simple but are all thought out and constructed cleverly.The movie features the then still unknown Michael Rooker in one of his earliest roles. None of the actors are that impressive within this movie which gives Michael Rooker all the more room to shine in his role. He plays a great two faced character that can be both kind and sort of shy as well as ruthless. He does this very convincingly within the movie.But it are the graphic killings within the movie that makes this a really watchable one. It doesn't show all the killings how they happened but only just a few which makes the impact of them work out all the more and adds to the reason why this movie is regarded by many as one of the most shocking one's.A great and effectively shocking movie within its genre.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Michael Rooker a character based on serial killer Henry Lee Lucas hooks up with his prison friend Otis Tom Towles and his sister Becky Tracy Arnold. Henry teaches Otis how to be a bloodthirsty killer but things go awry when Otis fails to have Henry's level of control and turns his sights on to his own sister.Director John McNaughton was a delivery man for executive producers Malik B. Ali and Waleed B. Ali of Maljack Productions who then had him make some lowbudget Chicagothemed documentaries before offering him 110000 and a 16mm camera to make a horror film without offering any ideas or limitations.The story was brought to McNaughton by his friend Gus who had a videotape of 2020. McNaughton never heard of Henry before and was not even familiar with the term serial killer but felt this had great potential. He had always loved horror films especially Roger Corman's work with AIP and he teamed up with Richard Fire of the Organic Theater the home base of Stuart Gordon where they found Tracy Arnold and Tom Towles. Towles of course would go on to work with McNaughton many more times.Along with the cast McNaughton brought in composer Robert McNaughton no relation who does a fine job adding to the creep factor and the use of samples such as screams was quite innovative for its day. We also get some great street scenes showing Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago near where director McNaughton lived. One home shot at was at the corner of North and Wood in the Wicker Park neighborhood.This film is absolutely amazing. Opening with still frame scenes of death including a murdered hooker who is the most disturbing corpse I have seen since I watched Four Rooms and this precedes that film by a decade. The first scene opens with the unknown victim Orange Socks posed just as in the police photograph only adding to the authenticity.The camera used was of lesser quality than a normal theatrical movie camera giving a more realistic or snuff feel. I can watch heads explode and all sorts of simulated violence without flinching but this really put me in a zone of discomfort. With a repeated viewing this feeling decreases but the grit of Henry is timeless.Likewise there is a later scene where a murder is being filmed on a home video recorder. The actors go to such extremes with the violence that it looks completely plausible  I would be surprised if the victims were not actually injured in the process. This realism is something not often found in horror and really makes this film stand out as a groundbreaking piece of work.Michael Rooker still a novice actor at this point is amazing. He comes across as somehow dumb yet clever unable to read but able to get what he needs. This fits the redneck killer profile of his character and is so convincing you woud think Rooker himself was a little bit dumb or slow if you had not seen him in other roles Mallrats Days of Thunder.The use of largely unknown actors and not very attractive ones at that again added to the realism. Hollywood would try to make the killers ugly but do so by using beautiful people I think Monster proved this. Henry presented us with exactly what we were promised without all the glossy shine. At a screening of Henry in Chicago in August 2008 at Portage Theater director John McNaughton made an appearance but refused to answer questions about the picture. This is a shame McNaughton. Not only is this the film that made you a name but it is legitimately a great picture and possibly your best work. Please don't alienate your fans or deny yourself this great achievement.If you are looking for lots of sex and blood you are probably looking for Murder Set Pieces which is like this but different at the same time  less realism. If you want pure inyourface brutality this is more your style. I give it a complete recommendation and consider it a must see for all horror fans of all ages well those old enough to handle the intensity that is.One last interesting note after some distribution issues this film was part of the reason for the MPAA's creation of NC17 along with Pedro Almodovar's Tie Me Up Tie Me Down. So along with being a great film it also has historical value.".

It's just something that he does. He teaches his roommate the ropes on how to be a good serial killer. Henry becomes disgusted with him when he starts taking too much pleasure in it. This leads to the one gory scene in the movie. It involves a bathtub and a saw. The minute it was over a girl in the audience got up and ran out of the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "Supposedly based on the true life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas played by a turbulent Michael Rooker but in fact is framed on tall stories of the largest fabler in American crime history made even taller by director  scriptwriter John McNaughton who adds his own two cents to the mythology. Henry Lee Lucas admitted to over 600 murders whilst in fact together with his comrade in mayhem Otis Tom Towles are probably culpable but for a fraction of those events. Inspired by the prefabricated musings of a trickster conspiring with police 'to clean up the books' John McNaughton supposedly presents us a portrait of a psychotic mind but essentially remains underwhelmingly vacuous.The hyperbole of Lucas's life story is taken at face value giving a terrifying vision of a pair of two morally incapacitated individuals albeit Henry himself finds a soft spot for Otis's cousin Becky Tracy Arnold. The trio of offbeat uneducated drifters clinch viewer attention with idle chitchat coupled with pending violence boiling just below the surface. Unlike Hanniballike eroticism the serial killers are hollow dead and pitiful which allow for a certain level of affinity with the characters though thankfully never creating a need for compassion. Suitably events are portrayed pretty matter of fact thankfully without the ulterior intellectually deviant underpinnings so predominant in serial killer movies  this murderer isn't a deranged genius just a murderous lost soul.Low key direction with unassuming choreography keeps attention focused on Rooker and Towles which make a oddly disturbing couple believable but at the same time unreal. Rooker especially has a tentative quality of lingering anger and dead eyes which slowly rescinds during contact with the awkwardly naive Arnold. Gifted with the best lines Rooker excels at his portrayal painting an appalling picture of a psycho albeit one that is doubly fictitious hellbent on murder but conscious enough to avoid having a modus operandi.McNaughton does also have some nice touches which add undeniable dread especially with the opening act where murders are not shown but heard menacingly dubbed over pictures of corpses. The strongest point of the movie in true Funny Games style when a tellingly graphic murder of a family is presented as a video tape being watched by the serial killers drawing comparisons between them and viewing watching such gruesome pictures. Disturbing and drastic hard to recommend as anything other than exploitative horror one so vividly criticised by Haneke in Funny Games. Roughly shot and essentially pointless and thoughtless not even having the decency to entertain a story more based on fact and less on delusions. Maybe beforehand knowledge about the actual Henry Lee Lucs detracts away from viewing pleasure as the true life story of his incarceration makes just a much more enticing talking point than the onscreen imaginings presented by the director.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been half an hour since I finished seeing this movie and believe me people I'm still shaking.Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer tells the story of Henry a man with one hobby killing strangers. Played by Michael Rooker his best performance ever and loosely based on notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas this character is pretty much the summit of what a serial killer is about white in his thirties lonelier soft spoken and shy. But however what makes Henry persona so disturbing and interesting is his lack of guilt or remorse. He just kills whoever crosses into his path and moreover he does it in such a ruthless and remorseless wayexpressing no feelings that makes the original Terminator look like Lassie you have to see it yourself.The rest of the main characters are Tom and Becky who are brother and sister. Ottis Henry's sidekick at first is a kind of obnoxious grown up Milhouse since he does whatever Henry says as Milkhouse does with Bart and also since he seems to have homosexual feelings towards Henry In the Simpson it has been implied more than once that Milhouse has homosexual tendencies especially towards Bart. However you have to figure it out by yourself in the case of Henry and Ottis. Nevertheless as the films moves forward Ottis becomes Henry's partner in crime and his lust for blood equals Henry. Becky on the other side is as problematic as Henry since both have been molested when they were kids even though Henry was molested in a crueler way and because of that she finds in Henry her equal and thus falls in love with him.This movie is not for everyone. It's dark bleach depressing melancholic and has an atmosphere of evilness rarely seen in other films. Most of the violence shown on the film is shocking and some scenes are disgusting.Butdon't get me wrong it's not a cheap gorefest either. It is superb filmed and well acted movie and what is surprisingly enough it doesn't condemn nor support it is just the story of a sick twisted and sad human being whose lust for violence and blood makes him able to cope more or less with a world he doesn't understand. If you get easily disturbed and sick whenever you see a scene of violence don't watch it. But if you want to open your mind and to discover the dark side of a human mind I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. As long as you live you won't never forget this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies like Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer really test my assertion that I base my ratings and opinions more on entertainment value than anything else. Was I entertained by Henry? Well not if you're using the traditional definition of the word. I can't imagine that anyone would find the all too realistic handling of the subject matter entertaining. There's a sense of real menace and violence just under the surface of every scene. Henry doesn't come across like a normal Hollywood horror movie where everything feels like fantasy and you know as soon as the lights come on it's over. The horror in Henry goes on long after the movie ends. I generally watch movies for escapist entertainment  and you won't find that here. Watching Henry and Otis go about there daily life including the butchering of innocent unknown victims is like peeking into the mind of an actual serial killer. I'm not sure that's a place any of us want to be. So I can't really use the word entertained to describe the experience of watching Henry. But I was certainly mesmerized. It's almost clich to say but watching Henry is akin to watching a car wreck  it's impossible to look away.Director John McNaughton crafted an incredible film given its almost repugnant content and miniscule budget. The low budget look the pacing and the almost documentary style of the film really go a long way to making Henry effective. Another plus for the film is the acting of the three main characters. Michael Rooker gets most of the acclaim but I think Tracy Arnold and especially Tom Towles give equally strong performances. It's a nice job by three unknowns at least unknown to many people.So in the end I've got to give Henry a rating of 810. It's a powerful shocking raw brutal movie that while often difficult to watch is impossible to ignore or forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to see the film that most approximates the feel of snuff porn Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer could possibly be it. Dirty gritty lowfi sound and image are pasted together in a sickening deluge while the camera focuses intensely on the face of a serial killer. As serial killers go the eponymous Henry is a very good representation of one he's smart he's charismatic and he's completely devoid of remorse.Henry's plot is slim purposefully unresolved and mostly lingers in long takes of relative inaction. In this way the audience is not brought along in a narrative of good vs. evil but is forced to accompany Henry along with his actions often times focusing more on the search for a victim then on the actual killing itself. Meanwhile drama is given through the interactions with Otis Henry's roommate and Becky Otis' sister who has a romantic attraction to Henry. Henry's life is set to context by Otis' and Becky's long history of abuse and degradation to help reflect the worldview that he was brought up in. In this way the movie is unrelentingly uncomfortable and focused on showing the aspect of the world that a typical escapist moviegoer is desperate to avoid. Bad sound quality and washedout imagery enhance this effect by creating nauseous images and discordant themes especially through the key part of the score though admittedly most of the score is unfortunately 80s enough to now come off as rather dated and ridiculous. Also the movie isn't always just violent onscreen but sometimes uses sound as referent to leave many of the killings to the audience's imagination.This movie is typically credited for questioning our cultural fascination with serial killers. I'm not sure if it can entirely be accredited to that because part of what makes serial killers interesting to our culture is the media exposure they get and in this movie Henry not only doesn't get noticed but takes great pains to make sure he doesn't leave a traceable mark upon his victims. Instead the focus is so much more psychological questioning what can drive a person to do these things and even argue logically for them. The interesting part is how openended the discussion becomes via the use of the dialog where Henry tries to explain his past but includes gaping contradictions. Ultimately the true story isn't really the point it's the face portrait that matters.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer Director John McNaughton The Borrower Cast Michael Rooker Tracy Arnold Tom Towles Review There's only a handful of movies out there that you watch them and after wards you are left with this look of shock in your face. Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is one of them. Based on the real life exploits of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas this films achieves a thing rare in todays horror films. It scares you.Henry appears to be a regular guy. He works as an exterminator and lives in a little apartment in Chicago with his roommate Otis. They were both inmates in jail and now that they are both out they decide to live in the same apartment. Things get complicated when Otis's sister Becky decides to move in with them because shes had some problems back home and because of her extreme loneliness she falls in love with Henry. Of course she doesn't know about his part time job as a vicious serial killer.This movie really surprised me. As I watched it I couldn't help but think why the hell I had not seen this before. The reason is the film was made in 1986 and no studios were interested in it because of its graphic and realistic nature. Therefore it went straight to video in 1990. Well it took me a while but I finally got around to watching this film and let me tell you if you haven't seen this film and you call yourself a horror fan well get your ass off your couch and go and get it like right now! Its essential viewing my friends.Now some people might think that this film is all about gore and blood and the murders and yes there's lots of that. But to me what really stood out were the performances. Michael Rooker does an incredible career making performance with Henry. Its strange but the way the character is portrayed he seems almost like a good guy when compared to for example his roommate Otis. Now there's a real scumbag if there ever was one which brings me to another point about this movie. The characters are the lowest scumbags you will ever know! I mean you don't want to meet these guys on the street. And the actor who plays Otis Tom Towles he really out did himself in making his character a real turd of a man. So my hats down to these two actors for doing some of the best acting I've ever seen on a horror movie. I also enjoyed Tracy Arnold playing Becky Otis's sister. Her reactions towards some of the events rang very true specially towards the end.The writers of this film made sure that the tense moments were very effective. And strange thing is that some of the most tense moments have nothing to do with the actual murders being committed. I found the most tense moments were those between Otis and Henrys different personalities clashing or just the fact that you know that these two guys are certified lunatics so you know that any given situation can turn into a real bloodbath every moment in this movie is just right there on the verge of going completely ballistic. So the intensity levels are high here thanks to some great performances and a solid script.But whats a movie about a serial killer without some killings? Some well orchestrated murder set pieces? Well there's plenty of those in this movie since the real life Henry Lee Lucas reportedly killed hundreds of people. So right from the get go in the first scene you get a taste of Henrys work. Interesting thing is the way that the movie chooses to show you some of the killings. The director decided only to show the aftermath of the actual killing. He focuses on the corpse of the victim and then we chillingly hear how it all happened. I found this to be effectively creepy. By the way John McNaughton the director used some really great sound effects to enhance the sequences. There's some gore here too not everything is implied. And when things get gory...they get gory my friends. There's a scene involving a bathtub...wow. You'll see what I mean don't wanna spoil any fun.So basically this is one of those movies that makes you feel really uncomfortable as you watch it but you just cant take your eyes off it. And at the same time you can appreciate how extremely well crafted this motion picture is. One thing is for damn sure you wont feel like your watching the type of horror movie they make today. This is a solidly horrifying film that you wont soon forget.Rating 5 out of 5.".

Well there's plenty of those in this movie since the real life Henry Lee Lucas reportedly killed hundreds of people. So right from the get go in the first scene you get a taste of Henrys work. Interesting thing is the way that the movie chooses to show you some of the killings. The director decided only to show the aftermath of the actual killing. He focuses on the corpse of the victim and then we chillingly hear how it all happened. I found this to be effectively creepy. By the way John McNaughton the director used some really great sound effects to enhance the sequences. There's some gore here too not everything is implied. And when things get gory...they get gory my friends. There's a scene involving a bathtub...wow. You'll see what I mean don't wanna spoil any fun.So basically this is one of those movies that makes you feel really uncomfortable as you watch it but you just cant take your eyes off it. And at the same time you can appreciate how extremely well crafted this motion picture is. One thing is for damn sure you wont feel like your watching the type of horror movie they make today. This is a solidly horrifying film that you wont soon forget.Rating 5 out of 5.";

Yet another fine example of a low budget bringing out the horror within the horror. A story with no moral and no retribution. This is Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer.Michael Rooker will forever haunt your dreams as Henry a character based on serial killer Henry Lee Lucas. Rooker just has that cold merciless look about him perfect for the part. Henry is a drifter. Calm and softspoken actually mildmannered on the outside. Underneath an unspeakable rage with all the fury of hell simmering inside him constantly searching for someone anyone to kill for just a little peace of mind. As he passes through Chicago Henry hooks up with an old friend from prison.Meet Otis Toole played to perfection by Tom Towles a man who was apparently born to play the role of deranged redneck. Otis is the epitome of white trash. Probably more capable of rape than anything that is until Henry gets in his head.Becky Otis's sister is in town for awhile so the bachelors have a little female company which is fine with Otis because he's just lookin' for a little lovin'. Unfortunately for Otis Becky is more in to Henry I guess she prefers the quiet type. Being naive and irritating and having stupid hair is no reason to set such low standards.Before we know it Henry introduces the splendor of coldblooded murder to Otis who is a natural. At times during their little outings Otis comes off even more sadistic than Henry although lacking the intelligence needed to have a successful killing career besides Henry's patience is running thin with this obnoxious redneck plus Becky is all up in his business so it might be a good idea to hit the road soon.They occasionally play Henry on the Independent Film Channel. IFC would kick ass if they played less watereddown independence and more outrageous Bcinema like this. I would recommend the 20th anniversary DVD with the documentary on what actually happened. What actually happened is even more brutal than the Portrait. Like all great horror epics there must be a sequel which must make money. Henry 2 is just OK which now that I think about it would probably qualify the sequel as one of the best horror movies of the 90's considering the 90's and all. No cops no justice no rhyme no reason just evil destroying innocent then moving on. Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is some viledandy horror. For a better serial killer movie than Henry check out... no wait this is it seriously it doesn't get any better than this. 1010".

But when the show breaks for the night police arrest him on suspicion of cheating how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up of their adventures together on the road of vicious encounters with local gangs and of Latika the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible quizzes.

She's the female trophy who exists to either be corrupted by Salim or saved from the slums by Jamal's undying love.Directed by Danny Boyle Slumdog Millionaire tells a familiar rags to riches tale. Its first act consists of several brief anecdotes Boyle fetishizing the Dharavi slums portraying poverty as a carnival of colours and souldeadening action. Shot with the same oversaturation and handheld work that made the slums of City of God and The Constant Gardener problematic Boyle treats poverty as a MTV video.Of course it's not all fun and games. Mothers die eyes are gorged out and child traffickers run rampant but the film glosses over such matters using them instead for tactical shocks and easy jolts. The reason these scenes despite their inherent darkness seem so trite is because Boyle tries to have it both ways. Millionaire regardless of its social probing is essentially a fantasy. It's a Cinderella story our heroes rising above the slums by the sheer force of love and destiny brought together on the set of a television game show the power of pop culture lifting their dirty bodies from the filth and grime of Dharavi.We're expected to believe that children are harvested and abused yet we're also expected to believe in magical happy endings where everything works out. Boyle wants the gravitas of a child watching his mother murdered but he also wants the expired movie clichs central to a Disney love story.Toward the end of the film a gangster cuts Latika's face with a knife. The resultant scar epitomizes Millionaire. On the surface we think we're looking at something real something violent. But look closer and see how carefully placed and artfully directed that scar is. It's a single clean cut perfectly framing the actress's face. It's not an ugly scar. It doesn't protrude or ruin her symmetry. In no way does it obscure her beauty. So while the initial impression is one of shock or even sympathy the fraud is that it's carefully designed to be pretty. To be easy on the eyes and head. Contrast this with the Indian kids in 2004's Red Light Kids or with how the prostitutes are treated in Unforgiven. It's not pretty when a woman is cut up. Boyle's film is one where he's not being honest about the situation and the responsibility is on the audience not to think twice. Worse still is the film's reliance on destiny. What engenders Boyle's happy ending is the underdog's pure heroism an egotistical lottery mentality a belief in destiny and the prodigal brother's heroic martyrdom. Indeed Salim exists solely to do the dirty work of killing the bad guys so as not to interfere with the moral purity of Jamal. At the same time it's hard to believe that anything really matters when everything in the film is simply working according to destiny. Apparently it's destined that all the other slum dwellers who can't get onto a TV game show continue to live a life of poverty.The film ends with all of rural India celebrating Jamal's victory as though it were their own triumph. The fact that one of their own has become rich elicits an outburst of joy. And this is the film's ideology anybody can rise out of misery if they are pure of heart and chosen by fate. Jamal is plucked arbitrarily out of the masses as a symbol. He is a celebration of the culture of the dice the casino the lucky ticket.And so the film ends with a happily ever after. Our boy and girl embrace before the film erupts into a happy song and dance routine. It's all quite silly. But perhaps Danny Boyle is being ironic deconstructing the fantasy image and poking fun at Bollywood's avoidance of truth? Or am I watching too much Altman? With this view mind I gave the film another look. How straight is Boyle playing things? Consider this the film travels from the reality of poverty to the artificial world of TV sets Bollywood shenanigans and big money. The narrative then selfdestructs essentially becoming a thoughtless Bollywood dance movie. Brilliant still the film ends with the line D It is written an allusion to fate but also implying perhaps that the story is itself fabricated a screenplay and so profoundly false. Better yet the entire film is told from the point of view of Jamal who we know is an imaginative boy and fan of movies. Is it possible that Jamal like Spacey in The Usual Suspects has just narrated a cosy lie to us solely to avoid being punished by the police? After all Jamal is a known con artist and the plot is too unbelievable too manufactured to be true. The characters are too cardboard too stereotype too comic book. The love story is too insensible and contrived. Is it possible that Jamal has scammed the quiz program and that the film is a scam on the audience? But no Boyle does not seem to go down this route. There's no irony here no questioning of artificiality and little inclination that Boyle believes his picture to be anything more than a straight fantasy.

It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period and for anyone who hears this buzz they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut in the words of director Danny Boyle at the Toronto International Film Festival the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit and above all it belongs to Boyle who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman with contributions from M.I.A. perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive especially coming from the younger cast almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal Skins' Dev Patel is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize and so Jamal having grown up on the streets of Mumbai cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother Salim and a girl Latika who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate righteousness greed and even urban sprawl. Above all however it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one but as seen through his eyes it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.".

I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny sad thrilling basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter.

Leaving that aside I have eight other objections to the film. 1 The director seems to RELISH showing violence. Some of it like the policetorture is quite needless. And why was the boy arrested in the first place? On what charge? Was it realistic? 2 How can a boy growing up in slums speak such accented English? Even if one assumes that the language he actually uses to communicate with the gameshow host and the police officer is Hindi granting the director the creative license to use a language better suited for international audiences there are 2 instances where it is stretched too far a when the boy becomes a 'guide' for foreign tourists at the Taj Mahal  b when he becomes a substituteoperator at the callcentre. 3 When the boy uses his 'lifeline' during the gameshow his friend discovers that she has forgotten her mobile and has to run back for it. This is plain Bollywood masala! Did the director HAVE to make it so melodramatic? 4 How did the boy know who invented the revolver just by watching his brother use it? How does his friend know about Benjamin Franklin? 5 Darshan Do Ghanshyam is NOT written by Surdas. It is written by Gopal Singh Nepali for the movie Narsi Bhagat 1957. This song is also credited as traditional and originally written by 15th century poet Narsi Mehta whose life that film is based on. 6 After winning the gameshow the boy sits on the railway platform and nobody recognizes him! Considering the popularity of the show is that realistic? 7 Two glaring omissions To qualify for the show one has to answer several GK questions over phone or Internet. Even after making it to the show a contestant can reach the hotseat only after fastest finger first. All this is conveniently forgotten in the film. 8 And of course the greatest flaw in the storyline programmes like 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' and 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' are NOT telecast live. As a result the entire structure of the film becomes unrealistic. For a film that boasts of being realistic such a flaw cannot be overlooked.Anyone else wants to say this is a great film despite all these flaws?".

Can you imagine any of the characters doing ANYTHING outside the bubble of this plot? Can you say anything meaningful about the characters in the film that don't revolve around plot necessitudes? No?

OK then watch Forrest Gump or Mamma Mia. Because they're far more warm and generous than this antisocial individualistic film. The icing on the cake came at the climax of the film when all the people of Mumbai watch Dev Patel win the show.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's yet another extremely overrated film from 2008 catered specifically to awards and little else. Color me unimpressed.While it's not as dire as Benjamin Button or as erroneous as The Dark Knight Slumdog is certainly not a good film. It's not technically bad either. It simply exists. It's a movie you watch rather than experience.I am literally in a state of shock these days at all the films masquerading as highclass or even art when they are riddled with so many fundamental mistakes. Screen writing 101...they get that stuff wrong! Not the hard stuff the simple stuff. How? I am baffled.Slumdog's story relies damn near entirely on coincidence which is a hugely detrimental factor when attempting to create audience sympathy. I didn't feel for the kid on the show. I wasn't given a reason to. If that were me on that show I would have never been asked questions that I just so happened to know the answers to by chance. This kid just so happens to know the answer to the questions he is asked and little else. He lucked out! I did not sympathize with him I envied him! I simply could not put myself in that situation due to it's complete insanity and lack of realism.The search for the girl is introduced rather late and before then there isn't much to root for in this story. So essentially you can begin watching this film at that point and completely understand the plot and miss nothing of importance.The fact that the kid had one question left was not properly communicated to the audience which diluted the suspense of the situation.The fragmented nature of the story doesn't make it easy to understand the narrative even when the concept alone creates the plot beats for you. This film seems to go out of it's way to make things extracomplex as though it's trying to cover up something that's lacking...Another thing that jumped out and bothered me...there are plenty of scenes that simply have nothing to do with the kid on the game show...or scenes that take far too long to get to the necessary bits of info that we need. It plods around for quite some time as if it's trying to make up for something that's lacking...I also do not enjoy the newage pointlessly overstylistic directing style employed here. It was distracting perhaps to cover up something that's lacking...When something anything is not right you look at the fundamentals. This is true in everything from football to filmmaking. Without knowing or by simply ignoring the fundamentals you end up with horrendously flawed films such as this The Dark Knight and Benjamin Button.

	onyx:emotionText "Here's yet another extremely overrated film from 2008 catered specifically to awards and little else. Color me unimpressed.While it's not as dire as Benjamin Button or as erroneous as The Dark Knight Slumdog is certainly not a good film. It's not technically bad either. It simply exists. It's a movie you watch rather than experience.I am literally in a state of shock these days at all the films masquerading as highclass or even art when they are riddled with so many fundamental mistakes. Screen writing 101...they get that stuff wrong! Not the hard stuff the simple stuff. How? I am baffled.Slumdog's story relies damn near entirely on coincidence which is a hugely detrimental factor when attempting to create audience sympathy. I didn't feel for the kid on the show. I wasn't given a reason to. If that were me on that show I would have never been asked questions that I just so happened to know the answers to by chance. This kid just so happens to know the answer to the questions he is asked and little else. He lucked out! I did not sympathize with him I envied him!

This movie is easily one of the best of 2008 I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story clich. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.To summarize the deep and perfectly delivered message of this movie you don't have to be a genius to know the answers in life sometimes life is just writtenwhether you call it fate or destiny. This movie I'm sure will find its place amongst the great love movie's like The Princess Bride Casablanca and Titanic. Some people I know have problems over the fact that this movie takes place in India but if you just for one moment let go of that and watch this movie you will instantly find out just how amazing this movie is.Even though I am writing this review now in November I hope that you will read this review when the film comes out officially in January and go out and see it. BECAUSE WHETHER YOU GO INTO THAT THEATER ALONE WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND OR NOT YOU WILL WALK OUT OF THAT THEATER INSPIRED ENCOURAGED HOPEFUL BUT MOST OF ALL IN LOVE WITH THIS FILM.For my closing statement I need to mention that recently this film got an undeserving R rating but this is one movie you should not be ashamed to have your parents take you to see.

	schema:reviewBody "Because he's full frontal nude! This was not a good movie. Simple as that.Starting from the first scene my whole enthusiasm was drained off when I saw the cops torturing a guy for doing good in a competition. My mind was boggled. Has there ever been a more ludicrous more absurd opening in the history of cinema? I mean who shows their script utterly sucks in the very first moments? Even bad action movies don't do that. It felt like a punch. You thought it was gonna be good because of all those Oscars eh? Here you go! POW!The following sequences where we witness our characters' past were far from being sincere real or authentic. I can't believe people compare this to City of God. It felt so... amateurish. Danny Boyle has totally lost his edge. There was nothing impressive. I don't know how to quite put it right but there was this We're so happy to be making this film! feeling all over the movie and it especially didn't work well for the supposed dramatic moments. They were not real not new not original. A little bit of Oliver Twist and some bad humor. Nothing memorable.And the show... Ah the show... A vulgar cheating lying conniving bully of a TV show host? Where do they find these ideas? You can't just suspect a competitor of cheating and send him off to be electrocuted! In a place where a TV show like that is being made these kinda stuff just cannot happen. This is a fact. Nobody can say anything to make it okay. That was the one most stupid character idea ever to be realized on screen.And they even told about their suspicions to the press without so much as trying to frame him with some lie like they found something on him. How disreputable is that for the show? And is it so incomprehensible to think that maybe he just knew the answers? Doctors professors can't go where he went. my a!!! As if the questions were prepared for geniuses... The first half was all about India and they even had questions with humorous answers that like the cop said a 5 year old could answer. This was very cleverly written to legitimize people's suspicions of the cheating thing but instead it made the lead guy look like a borderline idiot. And didn't the host think that maybe the guy could make a complaint or at least talk to the press? Was he gonna cover it up with his strong ties to the police and threaten the media? He's a TV personality for god's sake! Not a made man! Oh god it was so absurd.And has nobody warned the writer about the perfect chronology between the events in the guys life and the contents of the questions angle was way too off? Too forced? You gotta be a bit more subtle when you're dealing with stuff like destiny since you're trying to make a real movie. Either go crazy and say In my movie's universe these things are normal. like Woody Allen does or make it a bit more realistic and reasonable like it was in the movie Crash. This was just lame childish BAD writing. Oh and the lead character must have had such a brain they should kill the guy and study it. He remembers everything! If our brains stored information like that... Man I don't even what would happen! And the ending. The perfectly thought out ending where the easiest question in the world comes as the last question just to tie it all up with a notsomeaningful memory from his childhood. So cheap. The chaotic brother who just can't decide what to be suddenly goes paladin and he very quickly brings a solution to the girl's problems and sets her free and even handles the communication problem between the lovers just so that they can have the conclusion talk that will wrap the movie up. So cheap. And he kills the boss who very conveniently enters the room first. come on man... why would a crime boss enter a room like a deer when he knows there's something suspicious going on? And the third act is done! Writing is that easy guys. And you can even get an Oscar for it.David Fincher must have been so annoyed... When you can't even trust the Academy what's the point of the whole awards concept? Please let's stop this craze of cheering for bad movies just because of their hype! First the Dark Knight and now this. Teenagers go ape over horrific stuff like Twilight. What is going on? I don't think I can handle another one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The editing digital cinematography and Danny Boyle's direction with codirector Loveleen Tandan create a fascinating aesthetic which is perfect for the material. However barely anyone among the vast minority of people and critics who didn't care for this massively acclaimed film is complaining about the film's technical virtues however so how about all that contrived sappy melodrama? To my surprise Slumdog Millionaire is very tasteful in almost every respect. The romance scenes are either beautifully understated most of the scenes with them as childrenyoung teenagers and a couple after that or fantasy melodrama like much of the stuff near the end of the film although the actual final precredit shot itself is again a tender and beautiful moment. I have no issues with the fantasy melodrama however because most of the film is done in that tone. Even the very realistic and brutally truetolife scenes involving the raids of Muslim sections of the slums by Hindus and the luring of children to a life of begging on the streets for gangsters and criminals in exchange for accommodation and food are done in a manner that is both tastefully evocative of reality while fitting in tone with much of the rest of the film which has a more hopeful tone. It sounds improbable but that's what the screenwriter and directors achieve here. The film doesn't strive for 'gritty realism' but everything in the film yes everything is perfectly evocative of reality. The trouble with 'gritty realism' is that it often is gritty and hopeless in a way life rarely is to most of us and is actually laughable if done wrong. Jamal's flashbacks to the begging end in misery but before that we get the happiness and relief of slum life that these children felt. The raid is unrelentingly horrifying but it is a haunting memory rather than something the film dwells on without stopping. The film also gives us scenes of comedic escapism which are still within the realm of plausibility as well. If you don't know the general plot by now here it is Jamal is a boy from the slums of Mumbai who has reached the final question on Who Wants to be a Millionaire against all odds. The film through a plot device I won't reveal even though it's only a mild spoiler reveals the sources of Jamal's knowledge of the answers to each question except for the ones he doesn't know and guesses atuses the lifelines for through flashbacks to him throughout his childhood and teenage years. Here enter the accusations of the film's supposedly 'hilarious' 'impossible' and 'dumb' contrivances. There's no way a chai wala knows the answers to those questions and it's too convenient that he happens to have experienced something suitable for all those answers. I beg to differ. With a life like Jamal's which is believe it or not being led right now by many children in India I should hope that he gained at least that much knowledge. He didn't actually know the answers to every question and on a game of both luck and knowledge it's entirely plausible to me that Jamal's game could actually happen. The only huge contrivance is the nature of the very last question and what happens when it's asked but by then the movie had me in its grasp and the ploy worked. The fact that every member of the cast is absolutely excellent including the child actors doesn't hurt either. It sounds odd but Slumdog Millionaire seemed to me like it found a way to combine a realist look at India and according to the Indian person with whom I attended the film it is absolutely spoton in almost every regard and certainly doesn't contradict anything I saw during my short visit to India and a romantic melodrama. The end result with the screenplay that combines the drama comedy and thriller genres to great effect is both an aesthetic triumph and unlikely as it sounds a crowdpleasing masterpiece. Also the music is brilliant both the original score by the legendary A.R. Rahman and the excellent choices made when it comes to the pop music included in the film though that is to be expected from a Danny Boyle film. As for those moaning about the love story perhaps you have not found that person yet get back to me when you do.".

It is this twisted deliberate attempt to glorify the ugly side of the Indian underbelly again which does exist to some extent for the maker's own selfish gains is just not acceptable.

	schema:headline " A stunning achievement The best film of the year and one of the most exhilarating filmgoing experiences";
	schema:reviewBody "I won't see a better more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. If Academy voters have any sense they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and transformed it into a gritty realistic powerful and at times gutwrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely if ever seen in mainstream movies a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like Slumdog Millionaire are rare. They are things of beauty works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with Millions 2004 which also coincidentally was about a young boy and money and now with Slumdog Millionaire. This is Boyle's masterpiece  a stunningly original piece of filmmaking.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film usually an independent movie that comes along takes everyone by surprise then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2002 Little Miss Sunshine 2006  though I did not care much for it  and Juno 2007 are such films. But frankly those films can't hold a candle to Slumdog Millionaire.What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense! Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG13. Slumdog Millionaire should never have received an R rating. This film should be mandatory viewing for young people especially those in industrialized nations. Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi instead is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And yet thanks of Boyle true ingenuity he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment  and I shan't spoil it for anyone but you will know it when you see it  that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasifather figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal playing with confidence bringing a wonderful swagger to his role as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And of course there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.Slumdog Millionaire is I suppose a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship gratitude love betrayal poverty and hope. It makes you laugh weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace yet none of the cinematic flair  and there is plenty  seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does including the Bollywood touches makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral genuine crowdpleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful knowing you've just seen something very special.Slumdog Millionaire is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is without any doubt one of the ten best films of the decade.".

I think at some point I went for the game show host since he was apparently paying the game money out his own pocket? and was obviously the victim of a swindle much like myself.Come on people don't instantly become of interest or garner sympathy just because they had a rough time. It takes a believable backdrop a solid script and character development to achieve this. This picture fails terribly on all these counts and does so rather conspicuously much like a cartoon or a parody. Oh this was a realistic portrait of a typical slum in Bombay? They must have recently painted and vacuumed the place then.Heavy handed and utterly contrived situations furthered my annoyance as the movie turned into an inconceivable question and answer game where queue back sequences in perfect chronological alignment conveniently allowed the main lead to be able to rush through the game show never showing the proper emotion or physical reaction such a tense situation surely would bring. No wonder the comic book villain cops didn't buy the lead's explanation that he simply knew all the answers. Our poor lead is beaten and tortured as the morally bankrupt cops try to force out a confession. But after a few weepy lifetime tales the cop miraculously turns from foe to friend acting like the father one never had. Please give us a break.And what was up with these kids being able to speak perfect English all of a sudden? Since when is the WWTBAM show broadcasted live? Since when do you only need to answer 6 questions in this quiz and what in God's name is so glorious or symbolic about being shot to death in a bathtub full of money? Why is it that nowadays films with a story line that would really only be suitable for young children with its simplistic and utterly unrealistic plot points seem so fit to gather so much general acclaim from a mature audience? I know people are easy to manipulate with these sorts of rags to riches claptrap but surely this level of schmaltz and insultingly lame and predictable story progression would open up a few eyes here and there?I guess that the better the movies come the worse they actually are.".

	schema:reviewBody "Slumdog Millionaire the best film of 2008 by far I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net. I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released. There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film. We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film after reading a summary on what it was about I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good. But we have these unknown young actors Dev Peitel Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them. All in all this film is a love story. Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together. Even though I saw the film a while back I still remember it like I saw it yesterday.A title card is presented Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A He cheated B He's lucky C He's a genius D It is written. Jamal is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? hosted by Prem Kumar in which he was on the show and won 20000000 rupees about US500000. Jamal then explains that while at least the question about Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was very simple he knew the answers of most questions by chance because of things that happened in his life. This is conveyed in a series of flashbacks documenting the details of his childhood. This includes scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's autograph the death of his mother during the Hindu antiMuslim violence rekindling the memory of the 1993 antiMuslim attacks in Mumbai by Hindu nationalists in the slums and how he and his brother Salim befriend Latika. The children are eventually discovered by Maman while they live in the trash heaps. Maman is a gangster who collects street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money. Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman's operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded. Salim protects his brother and the three children try to escape but only Salim and Jamal are able to do so. Latika is recaptured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price. The brothers eke out a living traveling on top of trains selling goods pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal and picking pockets. Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika. When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel the brothers attempt to rescue her but Maman intrudes and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman. Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed a rival crime lord. Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes accepting her fate with Salim. Years later Jamal has a position at a call center. When he is asked to cover for a coworker for a couple of minutes he searches the database for Salim and Latika. He gets in touch with Salim who has become a highranking lieutenant in Javed's organization. Jamal confronts a regretful Salim on tense terms. Salim invites Jamal to live with him and after following Salem he sees Latika living there. He talks his way in as the new chef and tries to convince Latika to leave. She tries to discourage him but on the first day that Jamal waits at the train station Latika attempts to escape with him but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men. One of the men then slashes her cheek with a knife scarring her as Salim drives off leaving Jamal with the onlooking crowd. Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house. In another attempt to find Latika Jamal tries out for the popular game show because he knows that she will be watching.I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD it's a terrific uplifting movie that just captures your heart and makes you feel good. I couldn't believe that people were just complaining about the ending dance sequence it was a TERRIFIC way to end it to see everything that Jamal went through and that dance just makes you feel happy because you can tell the joy of him having his Latika in his arms. It was a beautiful ending and makes you extremely joyful. The story is brutal funny sad original and beautiful. Danny Boyle I knew that this director had something special when he made the horror film 28 Days Later but who knew he could pull of such an uplifting beautifully made film? He picked the perfect actors made the film wonderfully and the whole crew seemed to enjoy making this together. Who wouldn't? It was a pleasure to watch on the screen and if you haven't seen this film in the theater buy it when it comes on DVD it's one of the most terrific experiences I've had watching a film. We haven't had a film like Slumdog Millionaire and it's one of my new favorite films of all time.1010".

Its a good film but I don't know whether too many people have told me how great it is or is it not that great and people are simply reacting to the exotic nature of the film either way it didn't blow my skirt up.This is the story of Jamal who is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees in India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Certain this lower class kid must be cheating he's in the police station where some extreme methods are being employed to find out how he's cheating. Insisting that he is not cheating Jamal recounts his life's story with appropriate pauses to explain how he knows the answers.Far from what I expected I didn't expect the level of violence this is a good little film. Its the sort of thing where luck or is it fate allows you enough information to get ahead. Its the sort of thing designed to make you feel good.As I said I'm not in love with the film. I like it but I'm not in love with it. Perhaps its a little too cute at times The kid in the poop and it didn't help that the romance vital to much of the later part of the film didn't feel right to me.As an exercise in filmmaking its a masterful achievement blending a variety of styles into something uniquely its own. Danny Boyle is quite simply one of the best filmmakers working today one need only look at the last four films he's directed to see the range he has. Its a dizzying great looking great sounding film that makes even the squalor of India seem magical. I wish more directors had Boyle's abilities.That said the film didn't click with me. I respect the people who've fallen in love with the film enough to give the film a second go down the line. but for now Its a good film that I don't think is one of the best of the year.For those like me who didn't realize this was as violent as it it be warned There are shootings clubbings torture people set on fire and nastiness to children. Its not a film for kids though reviews I've seen made it seem so".

Perhaps its a little too cute at times The kid in the poop and it didn't help that the romance vital to much of the later part of the film didn't feel right to me.As an exercise in filmmaking its a masterful achievement blending a variety of styles into something uniquely its own. Danny Boyle is quite simply one of the best filmmakers working today one need only look at the last four films he's directed to see the range he has. Its a dizzying great looking great sounding film that makes even the squalor of India seem magical. I wish more directors had Boyle's abilities.That said the film didn't click with me. I respect the people who've fallen in love with the film enough to give the film a second go down the line. but for now Its a good film that I don't think is one of the best of the year.For those like me who didn't realize this was as violent as it it be warned There are shootings clubbings torture people set on fire and nastiness to children. Its not a film for kids though reviews I've seen made it seem so";

Well what's wrong with Slumdog Millionaire? Maybe I shouldn't have read anything about it before watching  but as it won so many Oscars it's hard not to find out anything about it. So the storyline was clear  some poor boy from the Mumbai slums gets the opportunity to win a lot of money. And the movie somehow has to point out how it is actually possible for somebody who dropped out of school as a child to know all these answers.Well the acting is fine and you really get to know the main character. It's hard not to like him. The music's good the antagonists are as bad as you'd wish them to be. So it's about the plot. Slumdog Millionaire is a modernday Indian fairytale. Everything works out for Jamal. Don't get me wrong that's all right  Jamal has the amount of luck of an action movie hero be it in Die Hard or in Taken. But they normally aren't rewarded any Oscars.The Academy Awards Jury seemingly longs for happy endings. But this one got so many Oscars because it's a movie that gives you a good feeling. From rags to riches and besides finding the girl of your dreams  all of this happening in India with its social problems. Some of those Oscars are symbolic for the message you might want to receive from the movie. Everyone can be a winner. But that's cinema. A reallife Die Hard wouldn't have had an happy ending. It's fiction and you gotta accept it. Maybe some people don't wanna accept that and thus rate Slumdog Millionaire this good.For me it's nothing but a pretty enjoyable drama. But an overrated one.".

My main gripe with this film was that the plot mechanisms were very contrived in many cases incredibly predictable.By the time we got to the second flashback the scene was pretty much set. There will be some horrific disaster or injustice and then there will be some miraculous turn of events to contrast with the evil. This formula was repeated again and again I suppose the thinking was that this was an analogue of the Indian experience itself. I thought that it was simply clumsy and selfserving.Another annoyance was the injection of Western arrogance into the film for example the three musketeers scene which of course was just a contrivance to set up the dramatic final question. Two Indian children whose mother had just been brutally murdered who had just seen a man burned to death in front of them would be prattling on about the characters in an Alexandre Dumas novel? Really? What in the world was this director thinking? Did he really think that anyone could watch this scene with a straight face? The subplot with Salim as a gangster was quite unbelievable and discontinuous with the rest of the film. This could have been a good concept for a different film where this plot could have be more fully developed but it did not fit well in this movie. Another contrivance and one that did not work well I thought it was very awkward.With that being said there is still enough entertainment value to rate this film 6 stars. It was worth the matine price that I paid but I am not certain it would have been worth full admission.Best Movie of the year? Spare me. That outcome simply shows how meaningless the Oscars have become.".

As others have pointed out this film is part of a continuing trend of the Oscars trying to shove mediocre movies down our throats. It is as though the intentions of this movie were good enough to make it a great movie.First off this movie asks way too much of its audience as far as suspension of belief. This is fine with a scifi or horror movies but for a highly touted Oscar winner that claims to be a gritty drama portraying an often ignored part of a big society it really goes overboard. The coincidences that you are asked to accept are just beyond human comprehension. I used to watch the American version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and to suggest that an uneducated homeless guy could win because just about every question is related to something obscure that happened a long time ago in his life and which he happens to conveniently remember is just ludicrous. Please the coincidence of the little kid in God Rama custom was just laughable and when movie critics decide they hate a movie this is the kind of stuff they pounce on but in this case a clear example of complete amateurism is ignored.And don't get me started about the TV host character. He blatantly belittles the contestant about being poor again and again and again with no subtlety whatsoever just straight out laughs in his face while millions watch on TV. He is part of a collective that makes taking this film seriously completely impossible.Somewhere between 20 to 30 minutes into this movie you realize how the rest of the movie is going to go. Those who you think will end up together do. The characters you expect to die do. The only thing that kept my interest was the notion that since this was a critically acclaimed movie and a foreign movie they would not cop out and do a Hollywood ending. I guess I was wrong. And maybe it's an Indian tradition but what was the deal with ending the movie with a completely irrelevant dance number??? I know they did something similar in There's Something About Mary but that was a comedy!! Can you imagine a dance number at the end of Crash?Another thing that bugged me was the so called love story. It was a big part of the second half of the movie and it just destroyed any sliver of credibility the plot still had at that point. The main character suffers from what I like to call Hugh Grant Syndrome. This is when a movie gives us a male character who has a nonsensical and self deprecating obsession with a woman who obviously doesn't like him and even goes out of her way to hurt him just to show him how much she's not into him but then the guy against all logic persist and eventually wins her. These movies have the audacity to asks us to see these stalker unhealthy relationships as romantic and endearing when any adult with half a brain knows that women like this or any person for that matter don't change over night and that the relationship is already doomed. The girl in this movie except briefly when they were playing around as kids never showed the same level or type of interest that the guy does through out the last half! She always followed whatever would allow her to survive. The only time she actually seems to want to be with him as much as he does with her is when he has fame and money. This is supposed to be romantic?I decided to see this movie despite the obvious red flag that this was hyped by the Oscars because I wanted to see something different something that would give me more insight into what I regard as a fascinating culture. In spite of the great cinematography and look of the film all I got was a bunch of Western stereotypes wrapped in a silly and substandard plot. This was the best movie of 2008?!?! Really?!?! I thought The Wrestler was a better movie and it wasn't even nominated!!!! Only the Hollywood elites don't see the big disconnect between their taste in movies and that of movie fans. In a move that reeks of desperation they are adding more nominees to the Oscars categories in an attempt to keep the ceremonies' ratings from going down the toilet even more. They don't get it it's not about quantity it's about quality or in this case lack of quality.".

He also said that there may be some final tweaking of the film prior to Toronto.In the discussion after the film Boyle strongly recommended three Indian made films Satya Company and Black Friday.

This film features the world's most illustrious stuntmen and many current working stuntmen profiled through interviews and clips that showcase their work.

	schema:reviewBody "Red Trousers ROCKS!  This documentary by Robin Shou and Tai Seng's maiden voyage into production is totally absorbing shocking and suprisingly funny.  The entire length of the film is filled with ohhs and ewws and ahhhs from the audience.  It's a real tribute to the guys who think wearing padding for a stunt means you ain't got no balls.  Hollywood stunts and all their special effects are childs play compared to what they do in Hong Kong.  Also the interviews of stunt vets such as Sammo Hung Ridley Tsui and the children at the Peking art schools are so touching and shows what these people have sacrificed in the name of their art.  The short film within is to facilitate examples within the documentary...very effective so don't try to follow the story too much. Just watch short movie within and remember how it was crafted. These men were definitely born with an extra alpha gene.  One stuntman said The first thing I think when I walk into any building in that I'm going to have to jump out of it.  Another stuntman was tricked into falling onto a cement floor instead of a mattress for a more realistic reaction.  Go check this film out if you can it's so worth it. Unfortunately it's only playing for 1 day in New York but it's showing around the country and I bet the DVD will be out soon.".

It really should be seen on the big screen since no DVD will ever be able to capture the same experience of the theater.

I don't know how they can do those crazy stunts! It's really cool the stuntmen had Robin do this movie because they don't get much credit  not according to the film anyway. In Hong Kong you are just expected to do it and if not you someone else. Those guys bust up their bodies and for not much money. My favorite though is Lost Time the movie where Robin Evan is in a fantastic world of martial arts and magic and legend and Forest Devils. Won't explain that part  go see the movie it'a winner!

Not only was Red Trousers uniquely made combining movie and documentary but to refer to it as eyeopening is compeletly underselling it.  The stuntmen in Hong Kong should be each be given an award for their dedication to an artform that is in every sense being digitalized everywhere else in this world.  I checked out the Red Trousers website and was sad to see that the film is only in limited release throughout the country...however if you are one of the lucky millions living in the big cities nationwide make sure you see it.  This visually spectacular stunning gem of a documentary deserves much much more recognition.  The one part I liked the best besides the absolutely breathtaking bonebreaking sequences were the interviews with children at various martial arts schools in China.  The onetrack focus many of these young children possess toward their goal and the torturous training methods really goes to show how easy kids in the U.S. have it.  During his interview Sammo Hung star of Martial Law and hundreds of HK flicks stated that during his childhood in those operamartial arts schools he had to do a one and a half hour handstand every morning before he was even allowed to brush his teeth.  Congratulations to Tai Seng and Robin Shou for doing a great job presenting to us the fantastic world of stuntmanship.".

I really enjoyed watching this it is very interesting to see what Stuntmen are going through when movies are made.I have to say that it doesn't look like a very fun job to do its very dangerous but I guess if you are a kind of person for extreme sport you can do something like this I have to admit that the only reason I've watched this movie is because of Robin Shou and I'm glad that I got to watch it it's very interesting to see how a movie is being made and what has to be done to get great stunts... After all a good movie is all about good stunts and special effects.";

These are all legitimate questions but this is not what the film is about. The film is about the passion of these stunt men. They take pride in creating the stunts that no ordinary person can even imagine. They are determined to make their families proud of their achievements. And if they come across always happy it's because they love what they do even knowing the risks. This is who they are and it is what they do. They are STUNTMEN.If you want the questions about the medics and the compensations answered then you probably are not a fan of the old Shaw brothers' movies and all of the Jackie Chan movies because this is how Hong Kong films are made.

Oh sure everyone interviewed here claims to absolutely love it but the docu never asks any of the hard questions such as1 When they're injured who pays the hospital bills? Answer No one. The injured stuntman is simply SOL. 2 When they fall during a stunt where are the doctors to rush in to save their life if necessary? Answer There are none. If they die they die. 3 Why are stuntment treated like cheap prop? Answer I wish I knew.Now you may look at the questions above and dismiss it but remember that while YOU the audience demands bigger and better stunts these poor saps have to actually do them and when a stunt misfires their lives are at stake. Does knowing that really make watching all those Hong Kong movies better? If so then good for you  you don't give a crud about these guys so how nice for you. Me I'd prefer to know that at least the stuntmen in Hollywood movies have doctors on location in case they get hurt and if they do get hurt they'll be taken care off. But hey that's just me.This could have been a serious real documentary but instead it just looks like a big advertisement for Shou's movie which we see a lot of in the film. No big questions no hard questions are asked. It's all fawning over Hong Kong stuntmen.In journalism they call this a fluff piece. It's certainly no documentary that's for sure.".

Here we see real immigrants both legal and illegal being used rather cynically by companies whose business plan includes hiring the most downtrodden and fearful and handtomouth in our country paying them the lowest possible wages giving them absolutely no benefits whatsoever and thereby winning contracts to provide custodial and other services over companies that pay a fair and living wage plus benefits to primarily unionized employees who are American citizens. You know this really happens. It does. The best remedy for the situation is certainly a matter for debate but no matter what your political slant or position on labor unions and illegal immigrants you will most definitely find food for thought herein.OTOH if you are also one of the drooling legions of newbie Adrien Brody fangirls you will find even more food for thought.  Brody is painfully cute in this moviea piquant mixuture of earnest funny sincere sweet and fiery topped off with a kinghell case of bedhead'.The three central players are Pilar Padilla as idealistic illegal immigrant Maya her overburdened sister Rosa played by Elipidia Carillo and Brody as Sam Shapiro an organizer and activist for the cause.  No fairy tale this movie though a few of the cast are reasonably goodlooking.  The cast many of whom really are janitors and custodians are as real as it gets.  You can see a lifetime of hard labor and long hours in their faces and the slump to their shoulders.I really grew to like these struggling janitors and maids. None of them were typesthey were all real people and their conflicts and concerns were illuminated very well despite limited screen time being available to each. By treating these characters with respect and making them fullyfleshed out it made the passion of the organizers for this particular cause more understandable and not just as sometimes seems the case in some portrayals a matter of someone who is bored or spoiled or has some sort of guiltcomplex trying to find their identity and using dogooderism as a means to that end.  Through coming out from the shadows and joining the great and messy American experience of organized dissent you could practically see some of these characters changing into Americans' before your eyes no matter what their official papers might say.  Thinking like Americans standing up for their rights making their voices heard. That's how it's supposed to workisn't it?  Isn't it?If there are caricatures in this movie then those would be some of the building administrators but their screen time is so limited and they are usually so surprised and besieged by Sam Shapiro's stunts and protests that their lack of articulate or sympathetic response seems realistic enough to me. But the one thing that stands out is more than anything else is the absolutely natural acting style. Nobody really seems to be acting in this movie. It's as if there was a very unobtrusive documentary maker following these folks around. The movie is however wellpaced between scenes which are rousing or charming and those which are raw and painful.Although this movie is not a love story or romance per se Adrien's character does get some action in it. In fact in one amusing scene he is literally hauled into a janitor's closet by an enterprising female smart girl!! and snogged silly. One can but applaud that sort of enterprise and initiative on the part of a recent arrival to this great country of ours. That's the kind of cando immigrant spirit that made this country great and if I were there I would be sure to tell her how much I admired that quality in her when I visited her in the hospital to apologize for having accidentally whacked her out of the way with a longhandled mop.But it can't all be funny and cute and indeed in this same section of the movie is a scene of such raw emotion harsh language honesty and truth between the two Mexican sisters that I cannot say I have ever seen anything like it. Even Ebert said in his review that it's the kind of scene that would win an Oscar if the Academy ever saw movies like this which of course they don't.The ending is both feelgood triumphant and bittersweet. I think that such an ending was very much in keeping with the tone and overall realism of this movieyes some things changed for the better but for people like these not everyone gets that happy ending and lives happily ever after. At least not right away.There's real passion here on the part of everyone involved and it feels genuine not manipulative.  It's a pleasure to see a movie with good quality production values and excellent acting which was made for a reason not just to make money.".

Even Ebert said in his review that it's the kind of scene that would win an Oscar if the Academy ever saw movies like this which of course they don't.The ending is both feelgood triumphant and bittersweet. I think that such an ending was very much in keeping with the tone and overall realism of this movieyes some things changed for the better but for people like these not everyone gets that happy ending and lives happily ever after. At least not right away.There's real passion here on the part of everyone involved and it feels genuine not manipulative.  It's a pleasure to see a movie with good quality production values and excellent acting which was made for a reason not just to make money.";

The authenticity with which this story is told is astounding showing a deep respect for those who in search of a way to make an honest living subject themselves to countless humiliations and are relegated to live outside the margins of mainstream America.Kudos to the writers!! This is the first time I have ever seen an American film in which the dialogue in Spanish was written by someone who actually speaks the language and can grasp the nuances and feeling of the language so perfectly.  Richard Hicks is to be commended for casting both Elpidia Carrillo and Pilar Padilla in the roles of Rosa and Maya respectively. They deliver their dialogue especially in Spanish with an emotion and passion that is rarely seen on the Hollywood silver screen.  Needless to say Bread and Roses is now on my list of musthavefilms to add to my DVD library.".

Most of these immigrants land in dayworker situations and low pay and yet Los Angeles would collapse without them.  This film concentrates on the downtown office area  owned and occupied by the elite of Los Angeles establishment  and where many undocumented workers toil under conditions that are far less than that suggested by international Human Rights standards.This was a polished nonHollywoodcapabilityfilm but yet intimately Los Angeles.  I listened to an interview yesterday on KPFK with Laverty and learned that funding was elsewhere  Europe I recall  not 'Hollywood'.  And Laverty is from Scotland.  One would never guess that the film was actually on the lowbudget scale when compared with Hollywood's pleasure to spend big dollars.I also learned that the film was made in 30days hence the vibrant interaction of all cast members and energetic direction by Loach and is in release this week with 30 prints in Los Angeles and 300 nationwide USA. Sounds like some symmetry there and potential Lottery pick permutations.My only reservation is that the story is highly political in an undercurrent nature and may frighten an extensive audience  unless the viewers just take the courage to go watch and enjoy.  The film will do the rest.  The viewer will leave with more than the cost of a matinee price ticket.I also suggest that in an upcoming meeting between Vicente Fox President of Mexico and George W.

I saw Bread and Roses at the Denver Film Festival thinking it was going to be a dry lecturing documentary.  Instead it was a nuanced and complex dramatic depiction of powerful and engaging characters.  It is rare to find such a politically charged film that is made so effective by presenting very human characters struggling with the contradictions of everyday life.  It allows us to appreciate the tough choices we all make in conditions not of our own choosingit allows us to explore issues outside of the kneejerk judgments of good guybad guy and appreciate the very human responses to often inhuman circumstances we all participate in creating. The acting is generally very good especially for a low budget production but the main character's older sister delivers a monologue on her struggles with deprivation that still chills me to the bone even though I saw it months ago.  Sorry for leaving out the details but this is one film whose details you'll want to discover for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this film is about a dreary topic labor organizing and workers struggling for a living wage. Yes it is political in taking the point of view of the workers. Yes the heroes are janitors some of whom are illegal immigrants. These might be reasons why you might be turned off by the movie. BUT if these are your reasons to refuse to see it or give the movie a bad review then you are only judging this film with your HEAD not your HEART or your GUT. I agreewith the reviewer who said that if you are not totally moved by the relationship of Maya and Rosa and what happens to them and the other workers you need apulse check.First of all the movie the characters and the conflicts ARE complex but the complexity is complicated and sometimes very subtle just like in real life.Just because it doesn't show you the life of the mean boss played brilliantly by comedian George Lopez whose humor about being Mexican in America is assharp as Chris Rock's about being Black in America outside of his work doesn't mean that he is onedimensional. It's not hard to understand why he would be such an asshole at work towards other brown people who are immigrants like him or perhaps his parents or grandparents he does speak Spanish but it's not clear whether he himself is an immigrant. Think about it! This is a guy who has probably sucked a lot of ass himself to get where he isa brown manager in a large American corporation working in one of the largest buildings in downtown L.A. Don't you think he's got a lot at stake himself to keep his job? Is he going to let a bunch of unruly janitors working under his thumb threaten his position as king of the hill of working colored people? Isn't he ultimately just as vulnerable as the janitors themselves?the coporation probably sees him as a dime adozen too if he doesn't do his jobwhich is to protect the corporation. Of course he's going to be ruthless and therefore onedimensional in this environment. As for the other corporate workers lawyers etc.they are ambushed by the workers in an environment where they expect them to be invisible and meek. I don't think it would be realistic for them to have any other initial response than shock and disbelief. This would also come across as one dimensional forthose who are only interested in seeing the other side get some sort of equal play.This is NOT a simplistic illegal immigrantassaint andtotallytriumphant hero movie. Maya IS punished at the end for robbing a gas station and is deported on a bus to Tijuana. The INS officer tells her she is lucky to get off so lightly and indeed she is. Her sister Rosa does have to whore her way to the U.S. and is a traitor to her fellow workers. Maya comes across as young and impulsive andmorally a little questionable at times she steals to help her friend get his scholarship which is what she is. It's both what makes her charming andvulnerable. Her Mexican immigrant boyfriend accuses her of ditching him forthe labor organizer Sam played by Adrien Brody because he's white and she denies it a little too vehemently. I found that Adrien Brody was a far less powerful presence in the film than the actors who played the workers. His zeal as a labor organizer was legitimately questionedby Maya who asks him what does he have at stake as a college educated worker whose 22000 organizer salary is still almost double that of the janitors and who doesn't have to support extended relatives like they do? And his supervisor in the union also becomes upset that his riskyconfrontational antics will jeopardize the union and wants him to back off the entire fight. That scene displays enough of the intraunion politics to show that unions themselves are imperfect crusader agentsthey also pick and choosebattles often choosing the ones that they think they can win. And self righteousness is probably an easy trap to fall into for union organizers when the odds against their victories are so high they gotta find some reason to continue this hard work!I agree that the scenes of Sam confronting the building manager and theending where the corporation all of a sudden bows down and decides to settlew the striking workers and reinstate all of them are unrealistic and less than convincing. But on the whole this a movie that punches you in the gut hasgood humorous moments and good pacing and characters that make you careabout them IF you are open to it and pay attention to subtleties that are there.".

	schema:headline " Maya has a knack for making strangers";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Ken Loach describes in the film Bread and roses the struggle of an American trade union in order to improve the working conditions of the janitors. And they are actually victorious since finally the firm gives in to their demands. So on the surface Bread and roses is another homage to the search for freedom and justice. Joke to make this review more attractive a lawyer who assists a client in a law suit calls him Justice has prevailed! The client replies So we have lost the case? Loach is like that. Although his films always concern the socially deprived the personal shortcomings of the main characters dominate the social injustice. This makes his films rather gloomy since the viewer finds it hard to identify with the characters. Bread and roses fits particularly well in this scheme of Loach. Although probably the Justice for janitors campaign was not as glorious as its reputation Bread and roses really sketches an unfavorable image. The main character Maya is selfcentred and almost devoid of morals. She has a knack for making strangers immediately. When she enters the USA from Mexico as an illegal immigrant she and her sister Rosa even cheat on the human traffickers. Maya accepts a job offer in a public house but she soon gets into a fight with customers. Then she wants to work as a cleaning woman just like her sister Rosa. The husband of Rosa is unemployed he suffers from diabetes and has never paid for health care insurance. Rosa is a former prostitute who is still in the habit. She does not even know who is the father of her children so apparently she economizes on contraceptives. If here Loach mocks at her I find it a bit morbid. In her cleaning work Maya retains her lax attitude. Just one detail she uses the stationery of the clients of her cleaning firm to write her personal letters. Hard work never killed anybody but why take the chance? Her colleagues are industrious. Maya complains that they do anything for the money. However it must be admitted that her employer is harsh. For instance he does not pay for health care. So the firm has low costs and ousts the unionized competitors from the market. Obviously the union dislikes this. Therefore one of her organizers instigates the workers of the cleaners firm including Maya and harasses its clients. He does not shun aggressive methods like disturbance of the domestic peace. Maya who always loves to complain agitates for the union. At the same time she robs an employee of a gas station who tries to help her. She is indeed a prime candidate for natural deselection. In the end she is arrested. The state offers her a lawyer free of charge but she asks for a witness for the defence joke. Maya is expelled to Mexico without imprisonment. Incidentally it strikes me that Loach imputes a hatred of the American society to the illegal immigrants in his film. So how should Bread and roses be rated? The quality of Loach films lies in their excellence in showing the room for social improvements. But personally I prefer films that show at least a glimpse of human kindness and decency.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a white person I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects white privilege which puts me at an advantage. I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group.  Peggy McIntoshEconomics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man.  Henry HazlittBread and Roses was director Ken Loach's first feature to be set and filmed? in the United States. The film was funded by small European financiers and received limited distribution in the US. Though Loach waters down his narrative for Hollywood audiences  the film's fairly conventional plotwise  his customary mix of political sermonising and urgent neorealism what he calls socioeconomic realism an offshoot of socialist realism remains absolutely abhorrent to most moviegoers. For this he remains marginalised. Its title alluding to a 1912 textile mill strikes in Massachusetts Bread and Roses revolves around a workers' strike in a nonunion office building in downtown Los Angeles the home of Hollywood. Much of the film revolves around impoverished office workers and Latino immigrants who struggle for decent wages to keep their families together and to fight against their ethnic and professional invisibility. Sounds familiar? Loach has been making such films for decades but this is one of his best. He skirts around most Coroporations vs Little Guys clichs and focuses instead on the ways in which underclasses prey upon themselves and how such bickering serves only to bolster exploitation. Corporate executives and limousine liberals who pick up humanitarian awards while relying on custodial firms who pay less than minimum wage remain off camera alluded to but never seen. Loach's cast is primarily composed of nonactors but some famous faces turn up. Adrien Brody plays a young union organiser named Sham Shapiro and exudes a nice mix of likability scruffy dissidence and intolerable smugness his character selfrighteously mouthing union maxims from the safety of suburbia. He organises the workers helps them unionize but they take all the risks and his sheltered financially stable lifestyle is far removed from their squalor. Brody's the son of the great Sylvia Plachy photographer artist leftwinger and radical. Comedian George Lopez also turns up. He essentially plays a supervisor of janitors a monstrous spawn of capitalism and Latino machismo who protects his position by ruthlessly enacting the will of the bosses cultural and familial ties be damned. And then there's veteran actress Elpidia Carrillo who plays a burntout Mexican woman who betrays the unions. A volcanic last act revelation in which she spells out for her righteously indignant little sister why she did what she did is particularly mind blowing. Here the actress summons a powerful blend of tearinducing pain and fury. Her revelation hammers home the point of the film the point of many of Loach's films and a point which Bertolt Brecht famously laid out almost a century ago in The Threepenny Opera First comes food then comes morality. Brecht's statement encapsulates a range of human behaviours primarily two which operate as a sort of doublehelix or feedback loop man ignores immorality because he fears of losing what he has and man ignores morality when he has nothing. Somewhat unique for this type of film Loach's immigrants are not portrayed as some ubiquitous exotic mass but full characters with diverging very individual views some indifferent some selfcentred some politically informed and indifferent or selfcentred for diametrically opposed reasons and some engaged in political activity back in Mexico. They are not naive pawns led by Brody who in another director's hands may have developed into a white saviour. Brody's gang are real savvy and have their own deeply embedded and often conflicting modes of survival. For all its cathartic fury for all its nods to 1920s Soviet Cinema with its marching militants placard pumping Eisensteinian ideals and collective heroes Loach's last act is ultimately pessimistic. Our heroes are shipped back to Mexico and we're suspicious of even what little has been won. Loach like John Sayles is too much of a small thinker to navigate his way out of the problems his films deal with. And while his brand of cinema is necessary there is a feeling that as Theodor Adorno once showed though art represents a resistance to the violence of conformist thinking nonconformity itself wasted away long ago became insipid became consumer goods. Art can no longer be a refuge for truth Adorno believed in the long term it will merely represent a flight into illusion even if it does have a dialectic force. Still Loach at least encourages some engagement with a prevalent form of cultural metapathy which is not just traditional apathy but a pathological indifference in which all manners of misconduct from stolen elections to benign policies which actively court illegal immigrants can happen without the batting of an eyelid.8.510  Worth one viewing. Makes a good companionpiece to Salt of the Earth and My Name is Joe.".

The rhythm of the scenes is stuttering like poor improv or early rehearsals. Sam shows up at big sister Rosa's house and immediately launches into a prounion speech like he has known these people for a while. The cleaning company boss is a pantomime villain. There is some kind of spurious romance triangle that never really develops and a few socalled comedy scenes to ease the intended sense of tragedy except the whole thing is so uninvolving that it hardly matters.As much as Laverty cannot characterise beyond twonote archetypes Loach appears unable to manage shot flow. The camera seems merely plonked down in front of the actors  there is not one frame where the composition seems planned never mind memorable.Kes is a masterpiece. But since then I have sat through Riff Raff Land and Freedom Sweet Sixteen My Name is Joe Carla's Song Ae Fond Kiss... and come away underwhelmed each and every time. The themes are ohso earnest the politics very correct the focus on the underrepresented marginalised and disenfranchised laudable in the extreme. It just never seems cinematic. Does Loach ask himself Why is this topic better as a fiction feature than a documentary? If he does I cannot imagine what the answer is.My father was a car factory shop steward so I grew up with these issues in my living room. I come from a Glasgow workingclass background so I am empathetic to many of Laverty's chosen arenas. But the bottom line is I just don't find myself entertained or edified by any of these films. Watching Bread and Roses I didn't laugh and I didn't cry. And it was clearly going after both reactions.Loach does get some great performances at times e.g. Peter Mullen in My Name is Joe and here Pilar Padilla as the lead and Elpidia Carrillo as her longsuffering elder sister Rosa bring a touch of authentic rawness to the subject.

He just did not have the feel for class in America or the American labor movement  or should I say what remains of it. I found film very simplistic  though granted the issue at stake for these abused janitors were simple as opposed to say autoworkers or airline personnel who are forced to balance their needs and security against the overall survival of their industries. Spunky Norma Rae managed to unionize her plant but I would have to doubt the plant would still be open if they filmed a sequel! Also politics America and labor aside the film was very anticlimactic.

Based on the case I was expecting something along the line of typical American scifi.

I've been to so many movies where the audience is not actually participating it's being attacked.

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be one of the best science fiction movies ever produced. Not because it's filled with geewhiz gizmos or creepy aliens it isn't but because it actually gives you something to think about besides I wonder how much they spent on that shot. When I was a kid I used to love reading scifi because it stimulated my imagination but as I grew up especially once Star Wars came out I found that it was harder and harder to find anything remotely resembling imagination or mystery in the genre.Well this movie has restored my faith in what is possible to achieve under the guise of scifi obviously it's older than Star Wars but I didn't see it until years later when I had basically written off the whole idea of science fiction movies. I saw it 1015 years ago when it was rereleased in the USA and liked it then but seeing it again recently has convinced me that this is an alltime classic. As I said it actually stimulates thought rare enough in most scifi movies but on top of that it has a real and profound emotional impact that's far beyond what you find in most dramas let alone kid stuff like scifi. If this movie is intended to be an answer to 2001 I'm not convinced that it is the main contrast is that Solaris concerns itself with real human emotions whereas the most interesting character in 2001 is the computer. For those who complain that it's boring just go see something else. You'll obviously never get it. If the opening shot of water and plant life didn't tip you off to the fact that this movie is intentionally paced a little bit more deliberately than say Buckaroo Banzai then you should go out and try to get some sort of clue before watching this movie. It's not boring... it's SLOW. It's meant to be slow. Some of the scenes exist solely to set a mood not to advance the plot. If you can't handle that then this isn't the movie or you. But if you're able to sit still for 3 hours without squirming and if you're able to enjoy a movie without having every idea spelled out in giant neon letters then you just might like Solaris and find that it haunts you for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films are intellectually challenging. Some films need to be thought about afterward. Some films deserve to be rewatched. Solyaris might be among those films as it is in the same time challenging intriguing and scary. Countless reviews have been written on Solyaris needless to say lots of them present a feasible explanation for the film. I am proposing my explanation of Solyaris. Not in the details but in the principle. I don't pretend to understand Mr. Tarkovsky better than others I just think this movie deserves to be understood and I hope my view of this film if not exact will help others understand it and why not appreciate it. Often and wrongly presented as Mr. Tarkovsky answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey Solyaris was undeniably an answer from at the time the USRR to the western World and his cinema emissary Mr. Stanley Kubrick. Even if Mr. Tarkovsky was in awe at the technical achievement that 2001 A Space Odyssey represented in 1968 he was nonetheless in disagreement with Mr. Kubrick's view of Mankind quest for Truth integrating too much Technology and not enough Humanity. As a result Solyaris might very well be the most humanist science fiction story ever put on film. Stanislaw Lem's novel provided Mr. Tarkovsky with an opportunity to propose his view on this universal and infinite quest for Truth. Mr. Tarkovsky's goal was also to transcend the genre of science fiction as per him a director can not limit himself to a genre. This is one of the many reasons why Solyaris is a difficult film as the audience's references to the sci fi genre are drastically shaken. Right from the beginning we understand that the story is not going to be an easy one to grasp the cosmonaut Kris Kelvin receives the mission to reach the space station orbiting the intriguing Solyaris an ocean like planet. His prerogative is to investigate strange events occurring on the orbital station from where the remaining scientists are observing this ocean. One of them Dr. Gibarian has committed suicide and the other two remaining Dr. Snouth and Sartorius are haunting by visions coming straight from their respective past. Soon Kelvin understands that the planet is an intelligent being and is materializing these memories. But when he is confronting with the recreation of his deceased wife Hari his belief and certitude start to be shaken and never will be recoveredthe problem is ours too As Professor Messenger said in the first chapter the protagonists of the films are probing the very frontier of human knowledge but is it proper to artificially establish a knowledge frontier? By thinking it we are limiting our concept of infinity of Man's knowledge and therefore we forbid ourselves to comprehend events beyond that frontier. In that perspective the risk is not technological failure but the failure of our mind. The consequence is a profoundly childish but nonetheless human reaction an attempt to destroy that which we aren't capable of understanding in short the planet Solyaris. The appearance of the guest Hari created by the Solyaris Ocean reflects on the overall dynamic. Since Kris Kelvin does not understand the reason and the possibility of Hari's presence on the station he wants to get rid of her by sending her away in a rocket. But when a recreated Hari reappears during the following evening provoking Kelvin's introspection she by her very presence forces Kelvin to face Truth about himself. However in the same time she allows Redemption. Often left aside the notion of True Love as a medium for Redemption of the Soul is a theme very much anchored in Solyaris. Guest Hari is clearly not Kris Kelvin wife rather a subconscious projection of his own needs of her. Dr. Sartorius's experiment has proved that appearing Guests on the station are made of neutrinos elements stabilized by Solyaris force field. However as Hary developed memories she appears as the most human being among the crew. The cybernetic expert Dr. Snouth is trapped in his incomprehension of Solyaris the astrobiologist Sartorius is obsessed by his quest for Knowledge not understanding that pursuing knowledge for the sake of knowledge is indeed vain. The physiologist Gibarian can't reconcile grief and false resurrection. As per Kelvin he seems to be in denial eventually considering Hary as an opportunity to heal his soul. Stripped of Memories and understanding the impact on the crew and their so called Human Soul also because of her genuine Love for Kelvin Hari chooses to commit suicide as if fatality was inherent to human Destiny. By this very act of sacrifice and ultimate Love she gives birth to her soul. At the end of the movie and through one of the most enigmatic zoom in in history of cinema we understand that an island has formed on the surface of Solyaris. We see Kelvin reconciling with his Past as if the Planet will allow him a second chance a chance to be Human With the film Solyaris Tarkovsky seems to whisper in our ears that Humanity is not bound to a place but to an act. The planet Solyaris creates from dreams and memories and is strangely echoing Men's creations process eg. Kelvin father's Will of rebuilding his childhood house as per his memory. The film embarks us in the Search for Ultimate Truth but if this Truth is beyond our comprehension it might be because we are searching in the wrong place. Maybe Truth is hidden inside our very self. If so then finding it is confronting our very Soul. So in essence if a Soul has been given to us then maybe our existence only make sense in retrieving it. In Voyage in Time an autobiographical documentary Andrei Tarkovsky said he viewed Solyaris as unsuccessful. Allow me to disagree.".

	schema:headline " There's something about this movie I just can't put my finger on it...";
	schema:reviewBody "The thing that generally stands out most about this movie is that it is long. Very long. And Russian. Very Russian.It raises a lot of interesting questions about the nature of humanity conscience love etc. which honestly I'd never thought to ask before and don't care enough to answer now that they HAVE been asked. Will Shame really save humanity? Who knows? Maybe. How will it do that? Haven't a clue. Now what's for lunch? That's not to say I didn't like the movie. I did. It's very beautifully shot such that I think it would be worth purchasing even if I never sit through the whole thing again just so that I can have scenes like City of the Future on hand as a reference for my own filmmaking endeavors.Speaking of which City of the Future is a very long scene consisting entirely of one character driving through the streets of Japan. It's supposed to look like well a city of the future but to modern American audiences it won't very much. It just looks like a guy driving his car through a series of tunnels and past a series of skyscrapers as day turns gradually into night. It goes on for five minutes.But here's the thing the paradox of this film It didn't bother me that there is a five minute sequence consisting of nothing but shots of traffic. In fact I loved it. It's an amazing scene really quite beautiful in its own way. And a lot of the film is like that. It's slow and confusing but still it's never boring. Even once Kelvin gets aboard the Space Station wherein 90 of the decor looks exactly the same. It's still fascinating to look at.And the weird thing is I can't figure out why. I mean when I tried to watch 2001 another very long beautifully shot movie set largely in space... I was bored literally to tears in the first 10 minutes and had to shut it off. No offense to fans of the film I realize how incredibly crass I am for failing to recognize the genius of 2001. It's something I will just have to come to terms with on my own. But for some reason while watching Solaris even when absolutely nothing was happening I could not tear my eyes away. I have the strangest feeling that if I were indeed to watch the movie againwithout the subtitlesit could become one of my alltime favorites.I don't know if I can recommend this film to others or not because I have no idea if anyone else will share my sentiments. I don't know who will understand it and who won't or who will even think it's worth trying to understand. There are of course some people who absolutely love it and probably even some who understand it or think they do because... well it's a classic and a movie doesn't become a classic if nobody likes or understands it. But there are probably just as many people who hate it because... well it's a threehour Russian movie.At any rate though I think it's at least worth a look. If you find it boring slow incomprehensible whatever... just turn it off. No big deal. But on the other hand if you find yourself inexplicably compelled to keep watching unwilling or unable to tear yourself away for a single frame... well then you're welcome.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my favourite film and possibly the best film ever made. It's impossible to put into words what I feel about this beautiful poem. Certainly it is uniquely brilliant artistically and seems to be different every time you view it the dynamics and emotions of the characters shifting hypnotically. It has the feel of a painting in a gallery and the photography is almost expressionist. It really has to be viewed at the cinema only.There was a very clever ad campaign to this film stating it was the Russian 2001. So us ten year olds went to see it thinking we were going to see a special effects extravaganza and instead we saw what seemed as a child interminable shots of lilly's and weeds. It went over our heads but I never forgot the score and its haunting melancholia. Apparently Tarkovsky had a bad time making this film and fell out with his cinematographer. Stanislav Lem also disliked the way Tarkovsky changed the book's theme of optimism in exploring space to one of scepticism in the film. Tarkovsky felt that finally what mattered was the theme of love that is doing moral good in the universe love of family or country or the place of one's birth. The beginning of one's journey which one always returns to in one's mind which was evocatively shown in the film's climax by the lake surely one of the great movie moments ever and terribly moving. His ultimate concern was the question of a man's soul which he is unable to deal with while striving for technological betterment. Ultimately he hoped man would reach a stage where he would solely be able to explore his spirituality.I think with all this polemic Tarkovsky missed the fact that this film works as a beautiful love story. If you could turn the clock back there would be no moral life. But in giving Kelvin a second chance to find a greater truth Tarkovsky also allows us a rare glimpse of love's majesty before it is sullied. The scenes where Kelvin begs Khari's forgiveness and levitates in her arms are the film's great triumphs. His use of Bach is also unforgettable. Unfairly accused of being pofaced there is also a lot of wise humour in this film if you care to look for it.This film inexplicably does not appear on many if any all time great lists. It does have some SciFi nonsense of the day about bombarding the ocean with radiation whatever that's supposed to do but does not prevent this film being one of the great masterpieces of cinema. Recently Time Out or Sight and Sound did a survey of the all time top 20 directors and Tarkovsky did not appear but Woody Allen did! There ain't no justice.".

There's a huge difference between the two. Boring movies Daredevil and Attack of the Clones for instance make you fall asleep good slow movies make you think. If you are a kind of person that comes to movie theater just to see some blood and guts on the screen while chewing on buttery popcorn popcorn eaters are probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to going to the movies here in the US  there's always some guy sitting right next to you eating it so loud that you can't hear a darn thing... this is not a movie for you. And as for those of you who don't fall into that category  well you also have to be in the right mood for it. If you are constantly thinking about something important that you have to do or if there is a lot of people making a lot of noise around you  don't watch it you're still going to like it but you'll lose a lot. You have to concentrate on the movie it should be the only thing on your mind. Just sit back and... no not enjoy. Think. Then you'll enjoy it.I am not going to restate the entire plot of the movie for a lot of people have already done it. Instead I'm going to try to give you a few clues about some confusing moments in the movie. Yes SPOILERS if that's what you want to call them.1 Oh that boring boring boring car ride scene. Attention popcorn lovers  this is not 21st century Moscow in fact it's never mentioned where the Earth part of the movie takes place  it can be Japan as well.... This is not supposed to give you the insight of what the future is like. It is there for one simple reason  to show you that the astronaut in the car as well as all other characters in the movie has got nowhere to go. It's all just an endless road.2 Seaweed  it just stands for nature Earth as the characters know it. It's there for a reason too not just to bore the hell out of you.3The final scene  Kris is not on Earth. He's on Solaris. He himself is a part of the planet's giant thinking Ocean now just like Harey was.Once again  forget about this movie if you like action the most. Go watch Daredevil or wait till the new Matrix comes out. For all others  watch it it's a sure 1010.".

	schema:headline " The least successful of all Tarkovsky's works.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a great admirer of Tarkovsky's cinema having discovered films like Mirror Ivan's Childhood and the Sacrifice a few years ago and been seduced by the poetry of his imagery the power of his themes and the depth of his writing. In the entire lexicon of 20th century cinema he is largely unsurpassed in terms of vision philosophy and ideology and easily ranks alongside other genius filmmakers such as Bergman Kieslowski and Wong KarWai. When we think of his mostastounding works like Andrei Rublev Mirror Nostalgia etc we think of deep metaphorical angst internal and external drama and an intense dedication to his character and an exploration of the world that they inhabit. With these factors largely absent in Solaris aka Solyaris one can only come to the conclusion that this is without a doubt Tarkovsky's least successful film.Now I'm aware that this may be something of a controversial opinion with many hailing Solaris to be amongst the greatest films ever made however I'm merely stating my personal view of the film as both a fan of Tarkovsky and as a fan of world cinema in general. I've also seen this film four times and on each subsequent viewing I've failed to find anything new or invigorating about it besides those gorgeous and reflective first few scenes on earth. The rest of it hardly feels like a Tarkovsky film at all but rather some clinical postmodern attempt to reimagine Kubrick's watershedwork 2001 A Space Odyssey only with a more rigid narrative. This for me is Tarkovsky's first mistake. You see what has always set Tarkovsky apart from his peers is his use of narrative which in his world doesn't so much unfold but rather bloom like a flower with each petal offering a new interpretation of the events for us to follow. This film has a more classical approach to narrative... sure there are a few moments of quiet reflection and a nice metaphorical use of memories and recorded emotions but unlike his two masterpieces that would bookend Solaris there is simply no conflict between the internal guilt depression love loss and the external ghosts memories illusions ideologies of the script. Plus there is no multilayered character history like the kind we would see in the later film Nostalgia and much more disappointingly there are no real games being played with the narrative.Solaris is as straight as Tarkovsky's cinema gets even down to the use of cinematography which here seems clumsy forced and amateurish... a real disappointment after the elegant compositions and visual exploration of time and space found in his most enthralling works think about that scene with the burning house in Mirror or those closing black and white moments from Stalker then compare them to the realisation of the spacestation here. It isn't quite the ponderous and enigmatic work of cinematic tedium that some have labelled it  as it does offer is a fair amount of tension atmosphere and granddesign  but at the same time it's not the lifealtering work that Tarkovsky is capable of and the original book unarguably is!!. I blame this on two factors firstly Tarkovsky seems to have remained faithful to the overall narrative flow of Lem's great book creating a clear beginning middle and end that dreams and nightmares can then invade... however he has subsequently missed the point of the book and jettisoned many important moments and details that would have clarified the proceedings. Because of this the film comes across as muddled and at times highly detached something that is not helped by the lack of emotion and feeling demonstrated by the performers.The other problem is Tarkovsky's lack of understanding when it comes to the sciencefiction genre which by design is geared around storytelling something that Tarkovsky has regularly shown little interest in. He also strains to visually overemphasise the workings of the space station with lots of closeups and cutaways which simplifies Tarkovsky's usually grand poetic vision and is a real waste of the cinemascope process that the filmmaker was here using it would be the last time he would work in cinemascope with subsequent films employing the more traditional 1.661 academy ratio. Still Tarkovsky would reattempt science fiction several years later with his great film Stalker a deeply existential trawl through the remains of a postapocalyptic city and one man's damaged soul. Stalker succeeds over Solaris because the director could internalise the sciencefiction elements and transform the story from technical exploration into the notion of personal redemption. Lem's book is more evasive in terms of the character's intentions and diverts his emphasis onto the plot  rightly so for a novel  which has seemingly forced Tarkovsky to compromise his trademark style.If you're adamant about watching Solaris then by all means do so... but don't feel obliged to proclaim it a masterpiece when in comparison with the filmmaker's other works it clearly isn't. I don't mean to sound quite so arrogant about it but this film for me really doesn't standout as anything wholly lifeaffirming in the way that other Tarkovsky films can be. It just seems to lack the emotional impact of Mirror and Nostalgia or the human element so prevalent in Ivan's Childhood and The Sacrifice. It also lacks the epic quality of the vast historic piece Andrei Rublev which pretty muchdefined Tarkovsky's cinematic style...which is perhaps why Tarkovsky himself considered it the least successful of all his films. Really if you're looking for an introduction to Tarkovsky's work that might just succeed in changing your life then try Mirror Nostalgia or the epic Andrei Rublev.".

	schema:headline " Scifi romance at its very best";
	schema:reviewBody "If I could rate Solaris not the 2002 American one! on my own scale I would give it 1000 out of ten!It is the doomed scifi romance which gets to me and frankly makes my lip quiver. Solaris the sentient ocean sends Kris a simulacrum of his dead wife Hari but the longer she and her subsequent copies companion him the closer she gets to being his former wife resurrected. There is this poignant scene where they have this conversation about how he has got on after his wife's suicide almost as if they were having the normal conversation of couples but in this case in the most strangest and tragic of contexts. What is now almost perfectly his dead wife is asking her husband how he has got on after she killed herself. But this is no ghost. What started out as an alien experiment to contact mankind is turning into one man's formerly dead but now living wife with whom he has begun to fall in love all over again. The most moving magical and surreal romanticism is at work.It took Andrei Tarkovskiy to achieve this. Americans or in the case of Stanley Kubrick Canadians can produce scifilms of epic production qualities but they are often schmaltsy or with Kubrick clinical. Natascha McElphone was severely beautiful in the American version but could not begin to project the soulfulness of the glorious Slavic actually Ukrainian beauty Natalya Bondarchuk. Donatis Banionis Lithuanian wears a marvellous deadpan existential angst throughout the film. This film although based on the novel of Polish scifi writer Stanislaw Lem sports almost how Leo Tolstoy would have written a scifi screenplay. This is an absolutely classic scifi film with a beating humanalien heart. As far as I am concerned the American 2002 Solaris is stuck on the launchpad while the Russian version soared into the infinite.".

	schema:headline " One of the most interesting hypnotic pieces of science fiction ever made.";
	schema:reviewBody "Solaris works on the level of dreams and nightmares not always making perfect sense after awakening but very believable within the timeframe it occurs. Directorcoscreenwriter Andrei Tarkovsky creates a lengthy 40odd minute prologue on earth that is not in the book by Stanislaw Lem but feels organic to the story nevertheless. And it establishes the kind of cynical man Kris Kelvin played in layers by Donatas Banionis is before he goes to the Solaris station. Which orbits a planet with a living sentient and utterly alien ocean. The ocean was subjected to illegal experiments with xrays and it responded by invading the minds of the space station's crew. Conjuring visitors created by neutrinos from the crew's subconscious. Kris boards the station to find two survivors Snaut and Sartorious. Each are grappling with their own visitors when a confused Kelvin encounters them. But then Kelvin's own visitor appears in the form of his dead wife Hari from 10 yrs. before. And for Kris the lines between realityfantasy humaneinhumane are soon forever blurred. That's the short description of the plot but this is a film that is less about plot and action it's not Star Wars! and more about introspection and the possibility of losing oneself in a illusionary world. The station itself is at times cluttered and dirty and then sterile and surreal. A remarkable production design. The alternating sunlight for different times of day shining through the portholes reminds us of time moving forward even when the characters cannot. The actors are believable all around especially Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari in a performance that suggests an alien intelligence that first mimics and then slowly begins to understand humanity. I also enjoyed Yuri Yarvet as the burntout Professor Snaut. A worldweary tired shell of a man always a bit drunk to some degree. The brief scenes depicting the living sea itself are slightly psychedelic and remind me just a bit of the lighttrip landscapes of 2001. Many have called this film the Soviet 2001 but that's not really a valid comparison. It's like comparing Star Wars and Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind because they're both major scifi films that came out in 1977. It's not a fair comparison. One aspect Solaris DOES have in common with 2001 and it's something I miss in modern scifi is that it takes time to lull you into its world by letting images and moods linger in worlds without time pressure. Solaris also alternates between black and white and color a Tarkovsky trademark to great effect. Especially for daynight or videoviewer transitions. Ultimately the movie is a rich but melancholy examination of the natures of reality and humanity with the alien ocean acting as a mirror we hold to ourselves. It's a film experience that demands and richly rewards repeat viewings but it's NOT for short attention spans. Or for those who like their scifi with straight lines and clearcut solutions and answers. Solaris is about all the messiness and meanings between the lines where humanity truly exists!".

	schema:headline " Russians in Space A ScienceFiction Parable on the Nature of Mankind";
	schema:reviewBody "A nation's image of outer space reflects itself. Jules Verne's moon train was a small wagonlit. American sciencefiction movies stress the gleaming pipes and dials a kind of hifi waterworks. Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris gives us Russian outer space. I say Russian rather than Soviet because this complex and sometimes very beautiful film is about humanity but hardly at all about politics. In any case the space station on the planet Solaris has an absentminded neglect about it that could have come straight out of Dostoyevsky's study. There is a suspicion of rust on the pipes and the furniture would look at home in the Omsk railroad station. One has the feeling that wrappers of halfeaten sausage are lying just out of sight and that a samovar is at work. Outer space is shabbiness lots of tea and urgent philosophical discussions that leave no time for shaving. Nothing that's visible matters very muchexcept for nature shots of a pond of water weeds of a running horseand life's surface are quite unimportant. Because of it the blockish camera work the egglike colors and the general visual poverty are almost irrelevant. What matters is the conversations the problems they raise the faces that reflect them seen blurrily as if at the end of an allnight session. Mr. Tarkovsky who is known here for a truncated version of Andrei Rublev made Solaris from the novel by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. It is sciencefiction in the formal sense of the word in substance it is a parable about the nature of mankind. Set in some future time it is about the voyage of Chris Kelvin to the space station on the planet Solaris. The Academy of Sciences has found no profit in the long studies made of the planet. Chris's mission is to talk with the three scientists at the station and to report on closing it down. The surface of Solaris is something like a sea a great pulsating mass. A previous scientist Burton has come back in severe nervous shock he believes that it may not be a sea but a superior order of consciousness a great brain in fact. Chris a haunted but practical man a missioner of human progress is prepared to order a final experiment a massive infusion of radiation into the sea. Burton now older is horrified. You must not destroy what you don't understand he says. Chris's father a solitary severe man is also appalled. Space is too fragile for your kind he says. The whole long strange trip develops the theme. Mankind with its aggressive expansionism  intellectual as well as materialdestroys more than it finds. Chris is the practical man who by the film's end will be converted. He finds that the space station that summit of technology is a heart of darkness. All three scientists there have been shattered by encountering the mystery of the planet. Solaris is in fact a great consciousness. Thought is made reality there including the deepest thoughts of its visitors. One has killed himself leaving behind an obscure message on videotape for Chris. As he explores the decrepit space stationalmost visibly rusted by the presence of a greater realityChris finds the other two. Sartorius who will not accept what he can't understand barricades himself in his laboratory surrounded by dwarfshis thoughts made substance. Snouth more innocent and hopeful drinks a lot but his visitors are children. Chris has arrived with the suicide of his wife Hari on his conscience. Hari begins nevertheless to visit him. She is not an apparition she is a yearning that the Solarian sea has given substance and builtthe other scientists explainof neutrinos. But she becomes more and more human until in an act of abnegation she asks to be destroyed so Chris can return to earth.Put in summary the plot may seem ludicrous. Solaris has its problems. Its rhythm is slow and sometimes is extinguished altogether. The narrative can be difficult to grasp. Finally as the film draws into conclusion the parable seems to unclothe the sense of wonder that Mr. Tarkovsky has created yields to a certain didacticism. All of these drawbacks must be cited provisionally. Solaris whose mystical totally nonmaterialistic character has won it no other favor in the Soviet Union than the permission to exist is on DVD in a severely truncated form. The original was reportedly four hours long a second version shown in Cannes and elsewhere at the time of its release was 2 hours and 47 minutes. The version we are seeing is down to 2 hours and 12 minutes and the distributors who received it that way say they don't know whether Mr. Tarkovsky supervised the cuts before his death. Obviously it is impossible to judge the pace the rhythms and the clarity of a film that is cut nearly in half. It is like a fresco partly eaten away by rising damp. The result must be viewed actively and with some effort. But if it is the result is extraordinary enough to compensate. The film's great metaphorsthe faces of Donatis Banionis as Chris Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari and Yuri Jarvet as Snouthinvolve us totally in the difficult mysteries. Like his Solarian sea Mr. Tarkovsky has made ideas walk breathe and move us.".

There is a suspicion of rust on the pipes and the furniture would look at home in the Omsk railroad station. One has the feeling that wrappers of halfeaten sausage are lying just out of sight and that a samovar is at work. Outer space is shabbiness lots of tea and urgent philosophical discussions that leave no time for shaving. Nothing that's visible matters very muchexcept for nature shots of a pond of water weeds of a running horseand life's surface are quite unimportant. Because of it the blockish camera work the egglike colors and the general visual poverty are almost irrelevant. What matters is the conversations the problems they raise the faces that reflect them seen blurrily as if at the end of an allnight session. Mr. Tarkovsky who is known here for a truncated version of Andrei Rublev made Solaris from the novel by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. It is sciencefiction in the formal sense of the word in substance it is a parable about the nature of mankind. Set in some future time it is about the voyage of Chris Kelvin to the space station on the planet Solaris. The Academy of Sciences has found no profit in the long studies made of the planet. Chris's mission is to talk with the three scientists at the station and to report on closing it down. The surface of Solaris is something like a sea a great pulsating mass. A previous scientist Burton has come back in severe nervous shock he believes that it may not be a sea but a superior order of consciousness a great brain in fact. Chris a haunted but practical man a missioner of human progress is prepared to order a final experiment a massive infusion of radiation into the sea. Burton now older is horrified. You must not destroy what you don't understand he says. Chris's father a solitary severe man is also appalled. Space is too fragile for your kind he says. The whole long strange trip develops the theme. Mankind with its aggressive expansionism  intellectual as well as materialdestroys more than it finds. Chris is the practical man who by the film's end will be converted. He finds that the space station that summit of technology is a heart of darkness. All three scientists there have been shattered by encountering the mystery of the planet. Solaris is in fact a great consciousness. Thought is made reality there including the deepest thoughts of its visitors. One has killed himself leaving behind an obscure message on videotape for Chris. As he explores the decrepit space stationalmost visibly rusted by the presence of a greater realityChris finds the other two. Sartorius who will not accept what he can't understand barricades himself in his laboratory surrounded by dwarfshis thoughts made substance. Snouth more innocent and hopeful drinks a lot but his visitors are children. Chris has arrived with the suicide of his wife Hari on his conscience. Hari begins nevertheless to visit him. She is not an apparition she is a yearning that the Solarian sea has given substance and builtthe other scientists explainof neutrinos. But she becomes more and more human until in an act of abnegation she asks to be destroyed so Chris can return to earth.Put in summary the plot may seem ludicrous. Solaris has its problems. Its rhythm is slow and sometimes is extinguished altogether. The narrative can be difficult to grasp. Finally as the film draws into conclusion the parable seems to unclothe the sense of wonder that Mr. Tarkovsky has created yields to a certain didacticism. All of these drawbacks must be cited provisionally. Solaris whose mystical totally nonmaterialistic character has won it no other favor in the Soviet Union than the permission to exist is on DVD in a severely truncated form. The original was reportedly four hours long a second version shown in Cannes and elsewhere at the time of its release was 2 hours and 47 minutes. The version we are seeing is down to 2 hours and 12 minutes and the distributors who received it that way say they don't know whether Mr. Tarkovsky supervised the cuts before his death. Obviously it is impossible to judge the pace the rhythms and the clarity of a film that is cut nearly in half. It is like a fresco partly eaten away by rising damp. The result must be viewed actively and with some effort. But if it is the result is extraordinary enough to compensate. The film's great metaphorsthe faces of Donatis Banionis as Chris Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari and Yuri Jarvet as Snouthinvolve us totally in the difficult mysteries. Like his Solarian sea Mr. Tarkovsky has made ideas walk breathe and move us.";

Years of Lynch and Kubrick movies have taught me to take the first watch a little easily and to let things come together on their own accord in subsequent viewings.Thus the surface review Solaris is a project. Somewhere in space and time exists an Ocean capitalized which has a manned satellite studying it. Historically this scientific mission has been controversial because not only has it completely failed to progress it actually tends to digress scientific progress and cause the scientists on the duty to sometimes as much as go insane.A psychologist named Kris Kelvin played by somebody whose name I could never hope to pronounce or spell goes to the satellite after one of the remaining three scientists in a station built for 85 kills himself. There he meets Hari his dead exwife. Romance philosophy and the meaning of life ensues revolving around the significant Other this time related as a significant other haha so important to science fiction.This movie is very thick and very Russian.

However if it sounds right up your alley here's the things you can come to expect 1 Beautiful imagery. Absolutely amazing from frame one to last moment.2 Great directing.

	schema:reviewBody "Solaris was my first Tarkovsky movie. I got the Criterion Edition and read the companion booklet first. And I was very sure I was going to like this film. I read reviews here and again was reassured I was going to like it. Some of my most favorite films are slow thinking movies I love Michaelangelo Antonioni's movies Bergman's movies Godard's films and I love 2001 space odyssey. I enjoy the more symbolic expressions of cinema in general. For instance the way Coppola cuts together the sacrifice of the bull with the murder of Kurtz in apocalypse now.So i was very excited and sure that Solaris was going to be great. I watched it and I thought it was terrible. And I am someone who will acknowledge or give respect to a film even if I don't personally enjoy it or am entertained by it but I thought this was bad.1. Color to black and white Later on in the movie the film stock changes to black and white to better illustrate dream sequences... but Tarkovsky is not consistent with this approach because earlier on in the film it changes to black and white for no reason. Am I missing something here? 2. Cheap production their is countless flaws in many different aspects for instance the terrible zoom shots and panning shots look very amateurish. The sound was terrible as well many times there would be no sound effects for obvious things like a car's engine. This film was made after 2001 and its FX aren't even close to being on the same level.3. Too long with too few ideas Being long alone doesn't mean anything really. Tarkovsky gives you plenty of time to understand what the main characters problem is. The character is told for nearly two hours that his wife isn't real and I understand that the drama of the film is created out of the tension of knowing that the relationship doesn't exist and that the main character only wants it to but for two hours! This isn't a mind bending concept that calls for such obsession. I think that the audience understands the problem within a half an hour.4. Bad ending to make matters worse the problem or conflict that arises for two hours of the film is resolved in a very anti climactic way. After he has came to terms with his loss she simply isn't seen again.5. Tarkovsky's failure I don't see any evidence of metaphysical Pudovkin editing techniques. or Igmar Bergman symbolism or even any sort of response to 2001.The few discussions about philosophy and life are pretty stock discussions and aren't really that interesting or in relevance with the plot.The levitation sequence isn't anywhere near as effective as it seems in Tarkovsky's sacrifice.6. Solaris is a SciFi movie... nothing more In comparison to 2001 Tarkovsky's Solaris dwells more in human emotion... that's true but so does Forbidden Planet which I found more similar to Solaris than 2001.I may have been expecting too much or expecting the wrong thing from this film but I was severely disappointed. The surprise ending was not much of a surprise and not very thought provoking. It seemed almost like an ending found on the Twilight Zone.Solaris involves some thought there is a few interesting ideas but its not groundbreaking or a masterpiece and the idea that this film is even considered to be linked to 2001 is silly.7. A few good points having said that i don't mean to bash the entire film. I found the first hour very interesting and engaging. I didn't mind the nature shots. The car scene I thought was one of the best sequences shot edited and scored pieces of the movie though I have no idea what it had to do with the plot. One review on the board suggested that it shows how the astronaut has nowhere to go... okay... so what though? What does it matter? In contrast the nature shots seem to serve importance because Nature will be severely missed by the astronauts. but an astronaut2ndary character driving around in a car because he has nowhere to go? 8. In conclusion The cinematography was cheap the pacing of the film was completely silly. Not once in 2001 is Kubric being slow just for the sake of being slow. there are 3 or 4 minute shots of nothing but spaceships spinning but the FX and cinematography are breathtaking.Solaris is tediously slow and the few ideas and themes that are brought up are spelled out just as clearly as most Kate Winslet movies. And the film is cheap. Tarkovsky obviously didn't have enough money. The movie goes from color to black and white for no reason the sound design is terrible. The acting is pretty shaky and the FX are terrible. There are no real twists or turns in plot the film just doesn't ever take off.Like I said this was my first Tarkovsky film. But I considered it extremely overrated. i read other comments before posting to see if maybe I missed something. one person included clues for viewing Solaris the algae the car the ending all of which I understood pretty matteroffactually after the first viewing.Please if I'm missing something here i would like to know just what everyone likes about this film so I can at least respect it.".

Tonight I noticed how effective and subtle an actress Melanie Griffith can be when she's directed well. She's a real jewel in this film. Sweet sexy smart with a brain for business and a bod for sin. Mike Nichols clearly loved filming her. Her expressions are priceless. Watch for the wonderful scene when Harrison Ford and she are walking to the elevator and he's asking her out. That face of hers as the elevator doors close is just heavenly. That's Mike Nichols craftartistry.Sigourney Weaver also does a masterful job as a twofaced shark business woman. What's so wonderful about her character the writing is that Katherine doesn't have a conscience. She's crafty and slick and manipulative but she's not out to hurt anyone just put herself first. It's too bad if anyone get's in her way. She's not nasty but there is no question that she is the most important person in the universe. It's interesting too how her duplicity is reflected in her wardrobe. Most of the professional women in the movie are dressed in ultraconservative boxy business attire but KatherineSigourney dresses sophisticatedly and elegantly.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Working Girl ten years after its release it's hard not to dismiss it as a dated satire of the corporate world of the 1980's. At the same time that's part of the movie's charm. Even though ten years has made the costumes hair and production design irritating the charm and intelligence of Mike Nichols' Cinderella story still shine through. As does the quality of the performances which are also revealing a decade later. Harrison Ford makes a perfectly likable romantic lead while Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey offer amusingly smarmy comic performances. But the actresses walk away with the movie. Joan Cusack is hilarious in a scenestealing turn as a Staten Island secretary and Sigourney Weaver is great as a shrewd and conniving career woman. The brilliance of Weaver's performance is how slyly and genuinely she plays her villianous character often decieving the audience as she decieves the characters in the movie. And finally there is Melanie Griffith who gave a starisborn performance as the bighaired secretary who falls in love with Ford's merger specialist and smartly climbs her way up the corporate ladder after Weaver stabs her in the back. Griffith earned an Oscar nod for this performance as did Cusack and Weaver for theirs and it's a testament to how funny sexy and wonderful she is in the part that even after numerous flops and odd career moves she's still a wellknown movie star ten years later For an opposite side at this scenario look at Jennifer Beals in Flashdance or Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing both of whom became big stars and then fell off the face of the earth. Nichols' direction is smart as is Kevin Wade's clever screenplay and the light and funny romantic comedy leads up to a surprisingly suspenseful and enormously satisfying climax. Allinall a satisfying and amusing entertainment.".

It has an engaging plot an extremely empathetic heroine a villainous boss a cheatin' boyfriend and a handsome new love interest just stepping into the picture. Get your popcorn ready for the comeuppance story of a lifetime.The tale revolves around a smart secretary named Tess McGill who wants to get ahead in the Big Apple but is beaten down by her nasty boss Katherine who steals her ideas and passes them off as her own. Fortune smiles on Tess when Katherine breaks her leg during a skiing holiday and Tess is able to 'take charge'...that is until her boss who recovers all too quickly returns. Of course there is also a romance brewing here in the form of a handsome investment banker named Jack Trainer who just happens to be her boss's boyfriend.Harrison Ford is his typical dashing magnetic self in the role of Jack Trainer but it is the two ladies that make this movie. Signourey Weaver is absolutely villainous as an employee's 'worst nightmare' boss a lady no not a lady high up the corporate ladder but lacking any semblance of integrity or kindness toward anyone below her in that ladder. You will be itching to see this nasty snob get her comeuppance.Above all Melanie Griffith is brilliant in the role of Tess every viewer's favorite downtrodden secretary. She's a woman with all the intelligence and skills needed to succeed in the corporate world but is ill used by those above her who put her down. Many employees out there will identify with Tess having at some point in their lives been ill treated by a boss whether male or female with at least shades of Katherine. Furthermore Tess will surely gain viewer sympathy regarding her unfortunate experiences with her sleazy live in lover Mick.The scene featuring the Staten Island ferry is beautifully done accompanied as it is by Carly Simon's wonderful Oscar winning song 'Let the River Run'. What an amazing voice! This is really a fantastic fun movie. You can't help but love it.".

Dealing with the harshness of trying to get on in the world of business I found that the film is saying that grit and determination can get you breaks if you have the brains to seize the opportunity be strong and maybe you can prosper now it may not always be the case that such endeavours are rewarded but at least you can say you tried.A never better Melanie Grifith plays Tess McGill with much heart and passion and I'm sure that is in no small part down to the adroit people skills that director Mike Nicholls obviously has. Sigourney Weaver  Joan Cusack are equally impressive with Weaver seeming to relish the role of dastardly boss woman Katharine Parker whilst Harrison Ford is simply spot on as the love interest with the smart business acumen helping Tess in her quest to make it in the often harsh world of business.A film with appeal for both sexes and this particular macho viewer punched the air at the end in appreciation for a fitting finale good work all round here 810.".

This is also the first in a slew of flicks for Joan Cusack's long line of effective supporting girlfriends.Mike Nicholls is a sharp director and succeeds in not only capturing the look of the trapping and tawdriness of the free market explosion but also its unutterably tedious underbelly. Kevin Wade's script is the snappy dramatic and satirical motor at the film's heart to which Nicholls defers. A unimpeachable feelgood movie  although I can't help feeling a sorrow from Nicholls on behalf of his characters who as in Billy Wilder's The Apartment remain trapped even after the happy ending. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Right from the opening burst of Carly Simon's magnificent theme song the audience is taken on a fairytale comedy ride with one workingclass girl and her striving to get ahead in the competitive business world of New York's money market.Tess McGill Melanie Griffiths is a Staten Island Secretary working for a pair of sleazy bosses in an uptown New York shares company.  Never once taking her astute business ideas seriously they set her up with what she thinks is a job opportunity but is really an opportunity for a lecherous colleague a then unknown Kevin Spacey to try and sleep with her. Angry she publicly humiliates them and is fired but a sympathetic Personnel Director Olympia Dukakis puts her to work for a female boss Katherine ParkerSigourney Weaver who works in Mergers and Acquisitions.  Although apparently helpful and sincere Tess discovers her new boss has been stealing some of her ideas and claiming them as her own.  When her boss is injured in a skiing accident Tess takes over her office and sets about putting together a deal with one of her own ideas........The acting is excellent on all fronts in this picture.  Melanie Griffiths imbues her character with an increasingly confident but very genuine charm. Sigourney Weaver is perfect is her stuckup patronising superbitch of a boss.  Harrison Ford is also on form here as the man in both their lives a charming yet almost stuffy man who constantly fears losing his job.  Odd however that he should receive top billing when he only appears about halfway through the film.The three leads are given tremendous support in the form of Joan Cusack as Tess's best friend who fears she is getting left behind in the wave of her friend's ambition.  Other notable players include Nora Dunn as Katherine's snooty colleague and Philip Bosco as an industry tycoon who gets the film's funniest line at the film's satisfying finale.The script by Kevin Wade is excellent with plenty of funny oneliners and doubleentendres.  His portrayal of office life may seem a little bit too romantic at times in spite of the rich business detail with which he imbues it but this a comedy so this is entirely forgivable.The whole movie is wonderfully accentuated by a rousing score.  Carly Simon's theme tune beautifully captures the film's themes of hope ambition and fair play.Enjoyable and exhilarating comedy.".

It's all about the glass ceiling that prevents secretaries ever breaking out of their shitty jobs and getting into the executive ranks and it savours an extra element in showing a female executive guess what? stealing a great idea from her secretary. It gives a horribly clear glimpse of the sectionalised American society workers executives superrich that makes a mockery of the Statue of Liberty past which the working girls sail in the ferry in the opening scene.

It helped that Ford was given a role with some degree of substance though Melanie Griffith clearly outshines him. The omnipresence of Katherine's energy threatening to darken Tess's work even when Katherine is absent is quite remarkable and it's almost frightening how well Sigourney Weaver herself a Yale alumna seemed to understand the territory in which she had to play Katherine.Allinall brilliant work.

	schema:reviewBody "Like Wall Street which came out the previous year Working Girl is set in the world of world of high finance but whereas Wall Street is a satire on greed and corruption it famously invented the phrase greed is good Working Girl a romantic comedy set in a big Wall Street corporation takes a more positive view of the capitalist system.The main character is Tess McGill one of the corporation's employees. Tess works as a secretary but is ambitious to rise higher within the corporate hierarchy especially as she has just turned thirty and has realised that her boss Katharine Parker is slightly younger than her. In reality Sigourney Weaver is eight years older than Melanie Griffith but she looks attractive enough to make this plausible. Tess however is held back by her lack of formal qualifications and by her workingclass origins which are betrayed by her accent by her clothes and most of all by her hairstyle. To say that Tess has Big Hair would be an understatement make that Enormous Hair.At first Tess's relationship with Katharine is a friendly one. Encouraged by her boss Tess even starts suggesting possible deals on behalf of the firm's clients. Things change however when Katharine breaks her leg on a skiing holiday and is forced to take time off work. During Katharine's absence Tess discovers that her boss has stolen one of her ideas involving the takeover of a radio network by a client company and is trying to pass it off as her own. Outraged Tess decides to try a deception of her own. With the aid of a new hairstyle and Katharine's smart business suits she passes herself off as an executive in the firm and tries to put the deal together. Tess can't do much about her Staten Island accent but noone seems to notice. In the process she meets and falls for Jack a handsome executive with the client company who just happens to be Katharine's fianc.I must admit that Melanie Griffith has not always been my favourite actress. Her breathless littlegirl voice served her well as a teenager in films like The Drowning Pool but can sound irritating for a woman in her thirties. Working Girl however is one of her best performances. It deservedly brought her only Oscar nomination. The plot has some similarities with another Griffith film from a few years later Born Yesterday. In both films Griffith plays a workingclass girl who is assumed to be dumb but who proves to be a lot more intelligent and resourceful than anyone gave her credit for.The film also showed us a new facet to Harrison Ford's talents as he played the hero of a romantic comedy for the first time. This was not only his first venture into this particular genre but also probably his best I was never too impressed by his attempt to recreate the Humphrey Bogart role in Sabrina or by Six Days Seven Nights. His steady dependable and decent screen persona however serves him well in Working Girl. Weaver makes a suitably detestable if desirable villainess as the devious Katharine and Joan Cusack gives a good performance as Tess's friend and confidante. There are also some similarities with Pretty Woman another romantic comedy from two years later with a Wall Street background. Neither film might please a strict moralist indeed many moralists took great exception to Pretty Woman on the grounds that the Julia Roberts character is a working girl in the other sense of the term. In the case of this film the moralists would insist that two wrongs do not make a right and ask why Tess is treated as the heroine when she is just as guilty of deception as Katharine is. Such moralists would miss the point of both films which give new twists to old stories. Pretty Woman is a modern dress version of the Cinderella legend about the poor girl who falls in love with a prince. Working Girl casts the heroine in a less passive role one who achieves success through her own efforts rather than through winning the love of a powerful man. The working class girl ends up on top while the Ivy Leagueeducated yuppie is cast as the villainess. It is essentially the Dick Whittington story with a modern setting and a woman in the leading role a poor girl rather than boy making good.I also liked Carly Simon's theme song Let the River Run even though it did not seem to have much connection with the story. 710".

But this being a less radical time the dramas about powerful women tended to be a synthesis of Women's Lib and Reagan era entrepreneurial optimism. This is after all what success meant in that decade. But ofitstime as it is Working Girl is still an entertaining and uplifting picture.Written by Kevin Wade Working Girl is a nice neatlyconstructed story. On a broad level it could be seen a blackandwhite tale of good guys and bad guys. But what saves the characters from appearing onedimensional is that they are written with a great deal of knowing realism. Who hasn't worked for a boss like Sigourney Weaver's character or been cheated on by a jerk like Alec Baldwin's? One thing that keeps Working Girl engaging is that while not an outandout comedy it is often tentatively funny in the way that real life is funny such as Alec Baldwin's futile claim that This isn't what it looks like.The effectiveness of Working Girl often hinges on the way its characters are projected. On paper Tess McGill isn't necessarily sympathetic and neither is Katherine Parker necessarily unpleasant at least not in the first half of the movie. However Melanie Griffith portrays the lead with enough drive to appear credible as a gogetter but all wrapped in a kind of sensitive charm that makes her likable. It's lucky she didn't inherit her mother's steeliness. And Sigourney Weaver manages to convey a smug and patronising manner that is only hinted at in the script but never quite overdoing it so it is still believable that Griffith initially warms to her. Harrison Ford is at his best too moulding the role round his limited range by giving a businessworld version of his usual levelheaded action hero type.If you're a fan of the look of this era Working Girl will be a real treat for the eyes  everything from glorious cityscapes to pouffy dresses. I'm glad director Mike Nichols puts such an emphasis on places and props without loosing sight of the people of course. The changing fashions of the decade are even woven into the movie's themes as Griffith swaps her hairsprayed bouffant and dangly bangles for an elegant simple look. Working Girl is an incredibly 80s movie but it's also the death of 80s extravagance we're witnessing there on screen. Of course she still wears a pair of pink glasses with rims the size of beermats but there you go. 80s extravagance died hard.".

I guess the moral of this story is hang out on enough movie sets with a famous mom and receive an acting career of your own. If I had only known...Harrison Ford puts in a workmanlike performance as the business executive charmed by Melanie's character and her gogetter feminist attitude. Alec Baldwin has a small role as Melanie's scumbag boyfriendfiance. David Duchovny and Ricki Lake also have bit roles.All in all I would expect better out of Mike Nichols who gave us The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and even such original films as Catch22. This movie can't decide if it wants to be feminist propaganda or a romantic comedy and the result is a mess. I guess this is what we get when someone with Nichols' talent is paired up with the writer who gave us such gems as Maid in Manhattan Junior and Meet Joe Black. Don't avoid this movie so much as give it a wide berth.".

David Duchovny and Ricki Lake also have bit roles.All in all I would expect better out of Mike Nichols who gave us The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and even such original films as Catch22. This movie can't decide if it wants to be feminist propaganda or a romantic comedy and the result is a mess. I guess this is what we get when someone with Nichols' talent is paired up with the writer who gave us such gems as Maid in Manhattan Junior and Meet Joe Black. Don't avoid this movie so much as give it a wide berth.";

Having said that 'I Monster' is the most faithful of all adaptations of Stevenson's great novella.  There is a little chronological tinkering with narrative and the setting is moved forward by two decades but the plot and characters are largely Stevenson's.  The error made by most versions of making Jekyll good and Hyde bad is avoided  JekyllMarlowe is from the start morose antisocial sadistic voyeuristic and scientifically dubious. There is no Hollywood loveinterest pucelleputain story to simplify Marlowe's dilemma retaining the claustrophobic homosocial world evoked by Stevenson.  Instead of the usual Victorian codGothic fug the novella's dreamlike modernity is stretched with effective use made of silence and an unnaturally depopulated urban labyrinth.  The transformation scenes usually an excuse for distracting effectsextravaganza are brilliantly subtle here usually offscreen.  The 'revelatory' scene when Blake reveals himself to a friend is done in silhouette which is more evocative and thematically appropriate.  Christopher Lee's patrician adventurousness is effectively contrasted with Peter Cushing's dogged dullness.Of course when I say 'I Monster' is more faithful than most it's still not very faithful at all.  The duality in Stevenson whereby Jekyll and Hyde being the same person is concealed till the end is ignored here.  More pertinently setting the novel in 1906 makes the story seem perversely anachronistic where Victorian ideas and motifs sexual repression duality mad science etc. seem out of place in Edwardian England.  There is a reason for this  Marlowe is a devotee of Freud and Jekyll's attempt to isolate and hence exterminate the essence of evil is given a psychoanalytical spin where the duality is not between respectability and desire but the egosuperego and the Id.This is interesting for two reasons.  Firstly Freud's ideas of the mind are transferred to the body giving resonance to Marlowe's physical changes the animal imagery throughout and the violence he inflicts as well as making more poignant the climactic 'melding' where Marlowe can no longer divorce his dark side at will.  Secondly Freud provides an explanatory framework for the story most notably an Oedipal one.  Blake runs riot with a cane that reminds Marlowe of the one his violent 'respectable' father used the absence of women in his social world his horrifying violence to women and some of the seemingly irrelevant asides the photos that loom in his room like an invading army etc. all suggestively deepen our reaction to Marlowe's plight.This Amicus production is reminiscent of the best Hammers  eg 'The Creeping Flesh'  where the emphasis is less on gore and sensation than suggestion atmosphere or slow menacing camerawork a meaningful use of decor dreamlike sequences elliptical editing rich symbolism. And as with those great Hammers there are some searing setpieces  the opening credits in Marlowe's laboratory with its dead Siamese twin foetuses its caged animals and images of fragmentary body parts Marlowe's first injection and 'selfdiscovery' with the mirror more Freud via Lacan and 'new' point of view the knife tussle at dawn in a narrow lane in a proletarian milieu the voyeuristic scenes in his adopted hotel room with its lowlevel tilted camera the social humiliation when he tries to pick up a prostitute suggesting he hasn't quite overthrown the sensitive superego the trampling of a young girl. Lee usually so authoritarian and calm gets a rare chance to be weak and is excellent his hurt at having to kill his tabby is very moving.  Also excellent is the score ironic and commentating rather than underpinning or atmospheric frequently comic but never  ever  spoofy.".

The character names may have changed but this is still Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Although given the source novel it is unclear why the names of the central character have been changed . Very good acting by Christopher Lee as Dr Marlowe who injects himself with his secret formula and is transformed into Mr Blake . Lee gives one of the best interpretations that the cinema of horror has offered him in a 60year career . Frequent coprotagonist Peter Cushing is topnotch as usual  playing as his colleague and friend . Adequate and atmospheric cinematography  filmed in Shepperton studios  originally in 3D  some clever camera work and choreography that keeps the foreground moving to the right and the background moving left makes this possible. Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Carl Davis . The film was efficiently produced by Max J. Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky from Amicus factory  they were usual producers of terror genre .

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant clever wellacted adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's great The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dramatized by Amicus producer Milton Subotsky I Monster follows the original tale about as closely as any other with some major deviations. The characters in this film are Dr. Marlowe and Mr. Blake?. Maybe they wanted to separate themselves from the original source material as much as possible or perhaps had a Rights issue. At any rate I Monster is a movie that builds and builds as Dr. MarloweChristopher Lee tinkers with this new serum he has created that eliminates one part of the three parts of the brainaccording to Freud. The reaction for each individual is different. For Lee it sheds his formal authoritative persona of its superego which then allows him to act any way he wants without any moral ethical or logical constraints. Lee's transformation is simple effective and strong. He goes from the stiff upper lip to the wicked lecherous carefree smile of a man of no moral code whatsoever. His eyes dance from one thing to another as the strangely effective music of Carl Davis plays a tune of light madness. Lee gives a great performance in this one and makes the film work. Without his skills I Monster would have little else going for it. Yes Peter Cushing is in it. He plays Marlowe's attorney and is as always very solid in his otherwise mundane role. The rest of the cast is really nothing to speak of either. I have always liked Amicus and most of their horror entries from the late 60's and the 70's. They have the Hammer look about them without Hammer production values translated that means that they look like Hammer imitations. Nonetheless they usually have good stories and frequently paired Cushing and Lee together or singly. Subotsky's screenplay is laced with several philosophical layers. Director Stephen Weeks does a solid job behind the camera. For my money I Monster is definitely one of the best screen adaptations of Stevenson's work.".

	schema:headline " The best translation of 'Jekyll  Hyde' from book to film I've ever seen.";
	schema:reviewBody "Most analyse's of Stevenson's famous story 'Dr. Jekyll  Mr. Hyde' mention the psychosexual undercurrents in the story and argue that the book is nothing more than a condemnation of those who seek to slip below the scale of VictorianChristianmorality. While it is true that Jekyll creates his alterego to carry out his baser instincts it is often overlooked that Jekyll's real goal was to let his evil self die out by releasing it so that once he was purged of all remotely evil instincts he would become the perfect man a god. However as everyone knows his experiment did the exact opposite.Using that pointof View that makes this film from Amicus studios the most faithful adaption of DJMH. It attempts grandeur ie. Creating the most faithful adaption ever of the famous novel in 3D no less but ultimately destroys itself in the very area it could have succeeded. But like Jekyll himself through of the results of his experiment the results were indeed interesting.This film had the perfect opportunity to remain faithful to the novel. For those who have not read the book it is actually a mystery that sets itself up as a blackmail thriller only in the last two chapters is it revealed that Jekyll  Hyde are the same man. Now apart from the ending of 'The Empire Strikes Back' this is probably the most wellknown ending in history. So much that nearly all versions have dropped the mystery format altogether and instead substituted a romantic subplot that drives Jekyll insane and follows him from beginning to end. 'I Monster' had the perfect opportunity to reinstitute the original novel's mystery plot It would change the names of Jekyll  Hyde and since the majority of the books characters are never present in film adaptations it wouldn't make audiences suspicious! And it would also keep people from learning the ending by not titling the film with either alterego's name but with a genericbut cooltitle.Seems the perfect way to reuse the original plot without it becoming obvious right? Yes it was the perfect way. But instead the film uses the traditional route of following Jekyll from beginning to end with no mystery. And the intent to film in 3D was dropped. making the film look washed out and dull with hazy characters cast in opposing red  blue filters.Such a waste. But in spite of that this still remains the most faithful adaption of the novel and still adds some new twists. Here Marlowethe Jekyll figure played by Christopher Leetests his serum on animals and patients. The results are amusing A suicidal repressed young woman becomes a nymphomaniac and beds the Doctor a shortfused businessman becomes a whimpering sissy and in a moving scene Marlowe's cat attacks him and he kills it hesitantly. Mention is made of Freud and that gives the film an air of authenticity. The actions of Blakethe Hyde figure also Leeprogress from simple vandalism to murder in a believable pattern. Lee hams it up as Blake and his makeup is minimal but it captures the description of Hyde in the novel as being an ugly but normal man who simply gives the feel of being repulsive and deformed even though he isn't.The film apart from the already mentioned changes and the subplot of MarloweJekyll first experimenting on patients still follows the book quite well other than the climatic ending and elimination of the Carew murder in favor of the murder of a prostitute who mocks Blake. It even includes the infamous 'marked door' the trampling of the little girl and even Utterson's nightmares. All the characters are here Enfield Lanyon the Soho landlady. And all the actors do a great job. Lee is fantastic as Marlowe and even makes us feel some pity for Blake himself!!!! Peter Cushing is the first on screen portrayal of Utterson and he fits the role well particularly the character's 'radiant eyes'. The ending even leaves him in a position almost as tragic as MarloweBlakes.Although very lowkey the film is definitely worth a watch Second only to the Fredric March version'Dr. Jekyll  Sister Hyde' and the Jack Palance film are also good. It may seem slow paced but it accurately matches the aura of despair and spiritual decay. Cushing is always watchable most of the supporting actors are good and Lee gives his secondbest performance after De Richleau in 'The Devil Rides Out'.It's definitely a treat to watch in light of his recent Knighthood. Three cheers for SIR Christopher Lee! I just KNOW that this film will look even better in light of that and the upcoming Keanu Reeves film that I can just feel is going to be a travesty.".

	schema:reviewBody "With this feature Amicus Studios a British production company founded merely to cash in on the huge success of contemporary competitor Hammer though with lower budgets and mainly specializing in anthology films attempted to present its very own adaptation of the legendary and numerously retold novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. However I Monster turned out to be a rather curious movie and I honestly can't say for sure what it was that Amicus wanted to achieve and whether or not they succeeded in their effort. At first I assumed I Monster was going to be only loosely inspired by the classic story since there already are so many reminiscent versions available on the market and even more so because the screenplay changes the names of the protagonist from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde into Dr. Marlowe and Mr. Blake. But then it rapidly becomes obvious that this is actually one of the faithful adaptations of Stevenson's story so that can't be an option. On a slightly offtopic note in case you are looking for an offbeat and extremely loose interpretation of the same story you can turn to the aforementioned Hammer again and check out Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde. Maybe the original mission was to make the very first 3D version of Jekyll and Hyde but that idea got abandoned in a fairly early stage as well and it's only still noticeable in some minor visual and cinematographic details. So basically all that remains is another redundant but nevertheless worthwhile reenactment of a fantastic tale once more pairing two of the greatest horror actors ever Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and competently directed by one of the youngest filmmakers of that time. Stephen Weeks was still in his early twenties in 1971. I bet it must be a truly unique experience to give Lee and Cushing instructions on a film set on that age...Lee and Cushing don't deliver their greatest performances here far from it actually but even at their most mediocre they nonetheless remain a joy to behold. Lee stars as Dr. Marlowe a successful psychiatrist and devoted disciple of Sigmund Freud's theories. He firmly believes that mental illnesses can be caused by the repression of the true human nature which is vile mean and aggressive and that both sides of the personality can easily be separated. He develops a drug experiments on himself and gradually turns into a more relentless and incurable monster after each injection. His friends including Peter Cushing as his attorney want to help Dr. Marlowe but they automatically assume this mysterious Mr. Blake is an entirely different persona. The overall story is commonly known and this version doesn't feature any noteworthy differences. The doctor's transformations  mentally as well as physically  grow more monstrous but the remarkable thing is he is the scariest during the earliest phases! Near the film's climax Christopher Lee looks unrecognizable and heavily deformed but after the first couple of drug dosages he simply puts on a menacing and genuinely unsettling Jokertype of smile. Can you imagine Christopher Lee with a big smile like that? Now THAT is scary stuff!".

From a couple different sources I've read that I Monster may be the most faithful adaptation of Stevenson's book ever put to film. I don't know about that I've never read the book. The biggest change from the book seems to be the names  instead of Jekyl and Hyde we have Marlowe and Blake.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while. Any movie with both Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing is high on my to see list. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. Usually no matter how bad the material may be you can usually count on Lee and Cushing to at least provide some degree of entertainment. Not here. This is the first movie I've ever seen with Cushing that I did not enjoy his performance. He acted as if he knew how bad things were. Much of the movie is an utter bore with everyone just sitting around spouting inane dialogue. I don't mind a slow moving story for example The Mummy 1933 is one of my favorites but this is torture.In I Monster Marlowe is allowed to slowly progress with each injection into a hideous monster. It is a progression into evil. It's a nice touch that I think improves on past versions of the story. But it brings up one of my major complaints about the movie. I do not understand how some of Marlowe's friends failed to realize he was Blake the first time they ran into him. Just ridiculous. The only physical change that Marlowe experienced at first was a grin on his face and messed up hair.Next time I have a desire to see Lee and Cushing together I'll pick something like Horror of Dracula or The Curse of Frankenstein.".

Recently with the Amicus Collection I've discovered some fulllength movies like ASYLUM AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS and THE BEAST MUST DIE. While quite capable I really enjoyed only the first two as the third one seemed a bit outof character for the production company.However as other reviews note I MONSTER has got to be the best retelling of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde ever. If not the best certainly the most faithful to the original story. I really liked the character of Dr. Marlow and the progression of experiments with varying results. The scenes in the gentlemen's club provide a fitting narrative without the need of a narrator.Amicus really defined the horror anthology genre for me. But it is good to see they had some good feature films as well. Next up THEY CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE and THE DEADLY BEES.".

Christopher Lee gives one of his finest acting  performances ever as Doctor Marlowe while Peter Cushing finds himself with an interesting supporting role. Another good surprise is the music usually painful in those cheap horror films from the 70s. Here there is dissonant orchestral music that befits the subject perfectly. The story is treated straightforward which keeps the pace going. The philosophical aspect of the story is present too with many references to Freud's theories on the nature of good and evil.

	schema:headline " If you love Lee  Cushing give it a look.";
	schema:reviewBody "I Monster is a respectable adaptation of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson tale of Jekyll  Hyde albeit with some unconventional touches by screenwriter Milton Subotsky. Sir Christopher Lee stars as Dr. Marlowe a psychiatrist  researcher who experiments with drugs trying to get his patients to release their inhibitions. But when he tests his serum on himself the results are predictable enough. He becomes an unhinged alter ego named Edward Blake who indulges in debauched and nasty acts for their own sake. Meanwhile Marlowes' lawyer Utterson Peter Cushing believes Marlowe and Blake to be two different people and thinks that the Blake character is blackmailing Marlowe.While this slight film doesn't have quite enough style or gravitas to rate as anything more than routine entertainment it's still reasonably well done. Produced by horror greats Amicus its period recreation is decent and its atmosphere likewise effective. Subotsky's touches include having Marlowe be a follower of Freud so there are Freudian overtones and the topic of the role that drugs play  or shouldn't play  in the treatment of patients. It does have the time honored appeal of any story with a Frankenstein type mad doctor twist. The makeup by Harry and Peter Frampton is pretty good but the amount used on Lee is increased bit by bit on screen rather than utilized all at once. The music by Carl Davis is good. As directed by Stephen Weeks a 22 year old budding filmmaker hired by Amicus at Lees' suggestion it's actually not terribly violent  or as sexy as the stuff churned out by Hammer during this period. Much of the budget went towards an unusual 3D process exploiting the Pulfrich effect which explains the camera movement one that wasn't exactly pleasant to film for Lee.As can be expected the consistent professionalism and commitment to character by the two stars makes it all worthwhile. They're ably supported by exemplary actors such as Mike Raven Richard Hurndall George Merritt and Kenneth J. Warren. That's a young Michael Des Barres as the youth who accosts Blake in the alley.Agreeable entertainment overall although the ending is rather abrupt.Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A pretty solid Jekyll and Hyde adaption from Amicus";
	schema:reviewBody "I Monster is a version of Robert Louis Stevenson's 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' made by Amicus Studios who were most famous as the horror anthology specialists of British horror. This is one of their standalone entries. Their bigger contemporaries Hammer Studios had in fact released their own version of the famous novella also in 1971 namely Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde. Even just going by the title of the latter it's obvious that Hammer were going off on a clearly different angle with their adaption. As far as Amicus version is concerned it's seemingly one of the most faithful versions of the story ever made. Interestingly despite the source novella being in the public domain both the title and character names are quite different. But when you see it it's pretty obviously the same story. It's not clear why they chose to do this although it may have been to give the film a slightly fresher feel.The story has a doctor called Marlowe developing a drug that releases his patient's inhibitions for example turning a sexually repressed woman into a nymphomaniac. To further test it he starts taking it himself. It turns him into Mr. Blake an evil man who grows increasingly more physically repulsive the more times he takes a dose. Marlowe is ordinarily a very inhibited and cold man whereas Blake is libidinous and carefree. Needless to say he is also murderous too and soon there is a manhunt on to discover who is responsible for these crimes.Amicus made a fairly commendably earnest adaption here it has to be said. The production benefits from some authentic Victorian England locations and like other costume horrors from Britain from the period its low budget is hidden quite well by the sets and costuming. It also has the two British stalwarts of the genre at its disposal in Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Lee has a fair bit to sink his teeth into in this dual role as MarloweBlake and he puts in a very good performance. Cushing is solid as he ever is but his role is very runofthemill for him really and he doesn't get to do much beyond what we've seen him do umpteen times. Despite being quite faithful to the original source there are some amendments that have been added to make it slightly more modern such as Freudian theory underpinning things or the fact that Marlowe uses an intravenous drug as opposed to drinking a potion. On the whole though like lots of these AmicusHammer period horrors this one is solid more than great. There consequently isn't anything too surprising but if you are a fan of the subgenre then this is certainly a good enough example.".

Soon Dr. Marlowe's friend  lawyer Frederick Utterson Peter Cushing begins to suspect Blake is blackmailing Marlowe but is shocked to discover they are the same person  Marlowe is no longer able to control Blake...This British production was made by Amicus studios who were the main rivals to Hammer Studios during the glory days of the period Anglo horror cycle of the late 60's  70's. Amicus were  still are I suppose best know for their cracking horror anthology films like Dr. Terror's House of Horror 1965 Torture Garden 1967 The House That Dripped Blood 1971 Tales from the Crypt 1972 Asylum 1972 The Vault of Horror 1973 From Beyond the Grave 1974  The Monster Club 1981 all of which are worthwhile watching. An obvious adaptation of the novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson in all but the title  the central character's name which have both been changed for some mysterious reason despite Stevenson's novel even getting an 'Inspired by' opening credit directed by Stephen Weeks apparently because all of the other regular director's used by Amicus turned it down I Monster is a very faithful adaptation of it's source novel  is a pretty decent horror thriller that could have been a classic if it were not for a slightly sedate pace  a general lifeless feel to the direction. The script is solid enough the character's  dialogue are all engaging enough  it tells a good story competently enough but that's my main problem I was never engrossed or excited by it  while it's solid  competent like I said it never goes beyond it. At just under 80 odd minutes I Monster surprisingly drags in a couple of places but it never becomes too boring  the story unfolds at a nice pace although anyone familiar with the Jekyll and Hyde story won't find many surprises here. It's also a mystery that none of Marlowe's friends recognise Blake as the same person I mean he doesn't look that different in all honesty. The psychological aspect of double personalities is touched upon but never goes anywhere significant  I would have liked a little more incident.Originally filmed using the Pulfrich effect to create a 3D experience that apparently uses clever camera movement  choreography to keep the foreground moving right  the background moving left to see the effect you apparently need to wear glasses with the right lens significantly darker than the other. I can't say I tried it or even want to but it's an odd little sidenote  you can see the odd shot that looks as if it was filmed with 3D in mind. I love all these 70's British period horror films  I Monster is no exception with some great Victorian production design sets  costumes. It's all very colourful  well made. There's not much blood gore or horror here to be honest there's a bit of blood when Blake kills a woman but other than that this is disappointingly dry. Legend has it that the money ran out during production  the makers simply had to put together what they had already shot maybe this explains the sub 80 minute running time  the slightly rushed feel of certain scenes that seem to end rather abruptly.Released into UK cinemas in November 1971 this didn't reach US shores until April 1973 filmed here in the UK in Shepperton Studios. The acting is good from a solid cast it's always great to see great actor's such as Christopher Lee  Peter Cushing who manage to turn mundane material into something special. Since we can class I Monster as a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde film I think Christopher Lee has played all the classic monsters including the Frankenstein monster in The Curse of Frankenstein 1957 Dracula in Dracula 1957  the Mummy in The Mummy 1959 which were all made by Hammer to add to his performance as Jekyll and Hyde here.I Monster is almost a great a film slightly lifeless direction  a lack of action doesn't help but the cast  solid script  story help balance it out. A good solid British horror effort from a golden era but I'm not surprised it hasn't gone down as a classic well worth watching none the less.".

	schema:reviewBody "I MONSTER is a British horror movie adaptation of the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stephenson. It was produced by Amicus  who along with its competitors  Hammer and Tigon  dominated the British horror movie industry in the 1960s and early 1970s.Amicus are today best known for their excellent anthology horror movies. But they also made some nonportmanteau movies that were every bit as good  if not better  than their competitors were producing during this period. I MONSTER is a great example of such a movie. Others include THE BEAST MUST DIE and MADHOUSE.I MONSTER is arguably the best adaptation of the movie as one reviewer has already suggested on this site. The only key difference is that the names of the characters have changed from Jekyll and Hyde to Marlowe and Blake. In my humble opinion this magnificent piece of work falls just short of perfect.The plot for those unaware of the story is as follows  a scientist experiments with drugs meant to release inhibitions. He witnesses a series of different effects  one patient behaves like a child and another craves for sexual attention. He decides to further his work by experimenting these drugs on himself. Initially he shows a hint of cruelty preparing to use a scalpel on a mouse. But each time he injects himself he becomes more monstrous both in physical appearance and personality. This leads to murder and blackmail. The split personality theme is the main focus of the story and the movie is consistent with this.The movie expands upon the original story by involving Sigmund Freud. It also removes the hero and villain mentality associated with previous adaptations by presenting the scientist as a curious and dedicated man who simply but gradually loses control of himself. The story revolves predominately around this psychological concept with one man as the focus and the supporting characters merely bystanders who either try to help or become affected in some way by the situation.The reviewer who slated this movie for being a mere rehash of the Hammer Dracula franchise couldn't be more wrong. The characters of Lee and Cushing are actually friends here  not adversaries as was the case in the aforementioned franchise. This movie is not about good versus evil. It is instead a carefully crafted exploration into what causes evil how evil may be a necessary part of human nature how the lines between good and bad can become blurred and how science can have negative as well as positive consequences.Sir Christopher Lee and the late great Peter Cushing  perhaps the top two horror actors Britain has ever known or will ever see  invest every ounce of talent they have in their characters. Their performances here are amongst the best they have done. This movie is definitely one of their best pairings. Christopher Lee's overly ambitious and openminded scientist contrasts perfectly with Peter Cushing's overly cautious and skeptical scientist. One scene they share is particularly moving and this the true testament of their performances here.Mike Raven seems to enjoy himself with a supporting role as yet another scientist. He held my attention in every scene he was in and I also enjoyed his performance in the movie CRUCIBLE OF TERROR a very unfairly maligned movie. He came across as a very professional actor despite the negative comments I have read about him. I was highly surprised to learn that he was in fact a DJ!The producers have clearly used imagination here. As another reviewer has pointed out the movie is not set in the foggy Gothic settings associated with Hammer horror. Instead this Victorian setting looks realistically grim with drunken people prostitutes street thugs rundown pubs and even empty cans lying on the cobbles! There is no sugarcoating here!Direction by Stephen Weeks capitalises on the superbly atmospheric setting excellent usage of camerawork razorsharp editing and the effectiveness of Christopher Lee's Mr. Blake characterisation to utilise some excellent horror. There is hardly any blood or gore here. This is a psychologically twisted situation that makes the viewer wonder who they should care about  Dr. Marlowe or the potential victims of Mr. Blake. The viewer can easily associate with the characters on the streets because Mr. Blake  with his wicked smile  was a truly scary creation  who anyone would quickly want to run away from. At the same time the viewer can also relate to Dr. Marlowe  a scientist with good intentions who struggles to fight this inner demon known as Mr. Blake. Some great humour is also thrown in for good measure helping to add more impact to the shocking moments the details of which I will not spoil. Without revealing much I can say that my favourite scene was the one where Mr. Blake visits a rundown inn to seek accommodation. Watch the movie and you'll soon find out what I mean.I MONSTER has only one flaw I could find  its running time is slightly too short. A few extra scenes could have gone further in exploring Dr. Marlowe's fight with the inner demon in the second half. Instead the second half seemed a little rushed and the ending was both too abrupt and simply too predictable. However these factors do very little to detract from the highly entertaining viewing experience of the movie as a whole.I MONSTER is overall a magnificent movie by Amicus and certainly the best work they produced outside of the anthologies. I especially recommend it for all fans of movies made during the heyday of British horror movies in the 1960s and 1970s. Remember also to check out DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE another excellent Jekyll and Hyde adaptation made by Amicus's rival Hammer just a few months later.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been on a Jekyll and Hyde adaptation kick so I thought I'd give this one a review too. Yes it's really lowbudget but if you are a fan of the novella it has about a 30minute section that follows it very closely  and that I really like.I actually bought this DVD and found out some interesting factoids. First it was originally supposed to be a 3D movie but the budget was cut so there are these weird moments in the movie where Christopher Lee is pointing things at the camera and it comes off as goofy.For me the Jekyll and Hyde benchmark has become FIGHT CLUB. Ultimately that is one of the best adaptations. I like when two actors are used to portray the characters as Stevenson writes them to be two different characters both mentally and physically. One of the funniestgoofiestworse things about this movie though is the transformation. Lee cowers into the shadows then rises as Hyde called Mr. Blake here and simply smiles really big and darts his eyes around. In the book one of the most freeing elements for the characters is that Hyde is virtually unrecognizeable as Jekyll who can be a passenger to his wrongdoings. In this version Lee's transformation from Jekyll here called Marlow to Hyde is comical. A big smile and crazy eyes apparently do the trick!The setting is taken from Victorian England and put into the early Freudianinfluenced 20th century and Marlow is a psychiatrist. This is fine as the Freudian rhetoric fits well with Marlow's attempts to break free from the reserved Victorian frame of mind.Get over the budget concerns and this is a damn decent adaptation.".

These are not complaints  such things enhance the intimacy of what is one of the most faithful and entertaining filmic adaption of RL Stephenson's 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' novella.Two things marred any potential success this may have had upon release. To begin with Stephen Week's production was intended as a 3D release but the process was abandoned midfilming. This lends many scenes a curiously fluid movement which again enhances its uniqueness. Secondly the central character of JekyllHyde was renamed MarloweBlake  although all other supporting characters have names taken from the book. Probably this was due to Amicus' concerns that audience confusion would otherwise arise between their film and Hammer's upcoming 'Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde'.And yet there is a topnotch cast. Peter Cushing joins Lee as Utterson Richard Hurndall as Lanyon Susan Jameson as patient Diane and Mike Raven provides his best horror performance as Enfield. Yet it is Lee as the kind but starchy Dr Marlowe who steals the show. His descent into the initially mischievous Blake with the death's head grin and increasingly macabre sense of frivolity is terrific despite the unconvincing hairpiece. He becomes frightened of the increasing power of his unsightly alterego in a tremendous scene in a leafstrewn park. His earlier blurredfaced attack on a young girl in the street is surprisingly sinister. There is a finely balanced sense of sympathydanger about Blake that is skilfully conveyed and carried through to the violent finale.".

	schema:headline " An essential obscurity for the collector of British horror";
	schema:reviewBody "A thoughtful and intelligent adaptation of the classic Stephenson story also filmed the same year as DR JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE which had Ralph Bates transforming into a woman of all things. I MONSTER is brought to us by the classic pairing of Max J Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky and yes it is indeed an Amicus film although surprisingly not an anthology.While the story is familiar thanks to the aboveaverage cast it always remains believable and in some cases horrifying. I would say that the sole reason this film works is Christopher Lee's acting which although on the outside just seems to be the cold aloof character he always plays actually turns into something else when Lee brings real pathos to the role of the savage degenerate he has become forced by evil to do evil things yet the expression on his face is one of regret and suffering. By far the best sequence in the film is when Lee is snubbed and openly mocked in public for his ugliness by a drunk prostitute and later follows her home then beats her mercilessly to death. There are two victims in this scene and Lee is by far the most tragic of the two.Unfortunately the biggest flaw of the film is the lack of much action. In fact little happens at all apart from Lee walking around experimenting. He doesn't even do any really horrible things except rob and kill a couple of people. This film did get a 12 certificate here in the UK after all so frankly I wasn't expecting much violence. Although it may be boring and familiar at times I MONSTER succeeds thanks to Lee's skilled acting and also three notable supporting actors.The first is Peter Cushing who brings us his typical refined dignity to the film as a doctor associate of Marlowe's a man who is wholly on the side of good just as he had been fifteen years earlier against Lee's Dracula. Although Cushing's role is fairly small it is pivotal nonetheless with his presence setting up the exciting finale which plays something like the end of Dracula with a titanic battle between Cushing and Lee. Okay maybe it is a tad lowerkey than Dracula's ending but effective anyway.Mike Raven turns up in an unintentionally amusing role as a doctor who sits back and occasionally comments on the action his voice is absolutely hilarious as it slides smoothly over the accompanying actors. Raven has been given a lot of stick through the years and it has to be said this is not one of his better roles. Further down the cast list is one Richard Hurndall whom scifi fans will note as the replacement for William Hartnell in 1984's THE FIVE DOCTORS. Hurndall doesn't get to do much but it's good to see him in something else other than DR WHO anyway.I MONSTER is definitely no classic film yet it remains solid entertainment. Interestingly it was filmed in 3D which explains the puzzling camera angles and objects flying at the camera. Perhaps a fuller script with more plot twists and action would have made the film more exciting or more theorising about the balance of good and evil would have made it deeper. Still there are some interesting points made in due course and the film has the classic Gothictype atmosphere so beloved of Hammer it does actually feel a lot like a Hammer film. Not brilliant and definitely flawed yet still an essential obscurity for the collector.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I enjoyed Paul Massie and the Hammer version of the Jekyll and Hyde story The Two Faces Of Dr. Jekyll I admit that this version from Amicus Studios may actually be the better film. I suppose it depends on what you are looking for in your JekyllHyde adaptation. IMonster is pretty subtle for a horror film in its approach to telling the story. The director lets events unfold in an unhurried meticulous way that allows the viewer to gather all the details without ever being sensationalist or lurid. Everything is present  the debate about the true inner nature of man the London surroundings the increasingly violent and degenerate deeds of the good doctor's alter ego and the sad end. I won't say tragic because this doesn't have the feel of a tragedy to me  it feels like a cautionary tale and the protagonist is hardly a hero undone by fate.Here's how good and solid the movie is Marlowe this movie's name for Jekyll doesn't actually inject himself until nearly 30 minutes into the movie and when he does...well you haven't seen unsettling until you've seem posttransformation Christopher Lee puttering around his lab with a huge smile of malicious glee on his face and then picking up a lab mouse with one hand and a scalpel in the other.The copy I saw on YouTube was a bit blurry and smeared but it wasn't bad enough to keep me from noting some really nice camera work costumes and scenery that reinforced and sometimes foreshadowed the developments in the movie...especially the scene in the daffodil laden park when Marlowe's ugly alter ego reasserts itself without the drug. Peter Cushing is a definite 2nd fiddle in this but he's still a class act. And the rest of the cast keeps up nicely especially the actor who play's Lee's mentor.This was a fine fine example of what Amicus could do at its best and would reward the time spent by anyone who has a taste for British horror from previous decades.".

As adaptations of Stevenson's famous work go this is certainly one of the most consistently entertaining thanks to a fun central performance from Lee who revels in the wickedness of Mr Blake a solid supporting turn from Peter Cushing as Marlowe's concerned lawyer Utterson a reasonably faithful script and effective direction from Steven Weeks.I do however have an issue with the fact that none of the characters identify Blake as Marlowe not even those who share his home. Towards the very end as the monster within takes control and Blake becomes truly ugly this is understandable but during the earlier stages where the physical changes are slight and Blake is still easily recognisable as Marlowe it is difficult to swallow. The level of suspension of disbelief required is just a little too high for me to rate the film any higher than 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Milton Subotsky obviously thought Robert Louis Stevenson's story had passed it's Box Office sellby date as he changed the principle character's name to Dr. Marlowe and his evil alterego to Edward Blake and added a Freudian layer to the tale. The result is not always successful but generally watchable and of course will be fondly remembered for featuring the august presences of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.It's Lee who plays the experimenting Doctor and while the buildup to his first change is quite effective once Blake takes to the streets there doesn't seem much for him to do. Poor Mike Raven in having to tell of Blake's ruthless stamping upon a young girl is forced to sound like he's reading from a book. We are then shown this in a dream sequence which is far more convincing.Peter Cushing is on hand to lend his probing of the MarloweBlake conundrum a dignified air and Christopher Lee himself delivers a very good performance as Blake disintegrates into a fiend and wretched specimen. It's interesting that writer Subotsky plays up the pathos element largely when Blake's on screen and keeps Marlowe as a stiff upper lip type most of the way. A very young Steven Weeks directs nicely but he was to make a far better British horror film with 1974's Ghost Story.Sadly the film's 77 minute running time does not exactly fly over  especially during the central section which is rather bland. It has a nicely judged climax though and remains a decent if not great entry in the colossal Jekyll and Hyde corpus. Rouben Mamoulian's 1931 version is still the best version of the tale for this reviewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "A well acted depiction of life in White Rhodesia from the European point of view and a rather disturbing story of an irreconcilable conflict between a good man's justifiable need for revenge and the necessity of upholding the law. Parents and those sensitive to violence should be cautioned that this is an extremely gruesome film with explicit scenes of rape murder torture and mutilation.The film credibly portrays the lives of European settlers determined to remain in their adopted land despite the increasing danger of rebellion. Most of them honestly believe that it is possible to live in peace with the Africans as long as they are willing to accept their civilizing guidance. The rebels are presented as bloodthirsty thugs who terrorize other Africans and have no real program of true revolution other than savage hatred of the White Man. Most of the Africans are more or less loyal to the Whites and are usually shown to be strong honorable and trustworthy although often in a patronizing manner.Christopher Lee is quite good as a police chief determined to prevent vigilante justice when a group of terrorists led by an albino pronounced albeeno in the film witch doctor Horst Frank rape and murder the fiance of a man recently retired from the police force. He James Faulkner along with a couple of equally vengeful African servants of the victim's elderly father Trevor Howard takes off into the bush to find and kill those responsible. These are not evil men out to indiscriminately slaughter Africans but people who feel that there can be no rest for their souls until they spill the blood of The Albino and his crew. Lee sympathizes with their feelings but is firm in his determination to maintain law and order and bring the killers to justice legally. This of course also means hunting down the revenge party causing the settler's militia to mutiny and withdraw from the operation.The pursuit of both the killers and the posse is grim and realistic causing the viewer to actually perceive the stresses and fatigue of the participants. Although somewhat cheaply done subtly racist and overly clipped and trite in spots the film is of great interest from both the historical and moral perspective. I saw it many years ago but unfortunately it like a surprising number of other quality films hasn't been made commercially available on either VHS or DVD.".

These are not evil men out to indiscriminately slaughter Africans but people who feel that there can be no rest for their souls until they spill the blood of The Albino and his crew. Lee sympathizes with their feelings but is firm in his determination to maintain law and order and bring the killers to justice legally. This of course also means hunting down the revenge party causing the settler's militia to mutiny and withdraw from the operation.The pursuit of both the killers and the posse is grim and realistic causing the viewer to actually perceive the stresses and fatigue of the participants. Although somewhat cheaply done subtly racist and overly clipped and trite in spots the film is of great interest from both the historical and moral perspective. I saw it many years ago but unfortunately it like a surprising number of other quality films hasn't been made commercially available on either VHS or DVD.";

The film itself suffers from its only real problem Goslar directed the movie as a mix of revenge thriller in the tradition of the John Boorman classic Deliverance and a tedious social drama that can not succeed in leaving clichs about African natives out of the story. So the film itself becomes a mishmash of entertaining exploitation film and laughably banal social comment. Whenever Goslar goes for the exploitation he succeeds we witness a savage if not that explicit rape and murder some really painful torture and a graphic head shot in Dawn of the Dead tradition only that this film was made two years earlier. Whenever Goslar goes for social comment the movie becomes bothersome because it's not really convincing. The climax on the other hand is a worst case scenario that partially manages to bring the two aspects of the story together. All in all this film is quite interesting for fans of obscure films of the Seventies be it for the actors alone but it's also a good example for a movie that doesn't live up to its potentials.".

Interestingly director Goslar's next feature would be SLAVERS 1978 which not only reunited him with Howard and the forbidding setting but managed to rope in an even better cast Britt Ekland Ron Ely Ray Milland and Cameron Mitchell.

According to IMDb this is in Germanlanguage but of course there are also dubbed versions out there in English and other languages. It runs for 90 minutes which felt way too long already to me as it dragged on many occasions and Lee was not good enough either to really make it work in terms of the forgettable screenplay. The films tries to score a lot through his atmosphere and style but it turns out more desperate than successful. The reason why this is in German is probably director Jrgen Goslar turns 90 next year. It is one of his most known works and he also adapted the Daniel Carney novel for the screen here. Movie buffs will find more semibig names next to Lee in the cast here. I will admit that the plot listed here on IMDb about a police officer taking revenge for a personal tragedy did sound interesting to me but none of this expectations was fulfilled during the watch. I give this one a thumbsdown and recommend it only to the very biggest Christopher Lee fans. Everybody else should skip the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed watching this. First of all it is very good in showing family problems so much to the saddening effect. But the actors do a solid job and through the film there are numerous moments that lighten up the general mood and I think the atmosphere is quite balanced. The ending comes off well.I especially like the soundtrack. The music fits perfectly also when it comes to details. For example there is a scene with Mozart's Little Night Music Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. This music composed back in the 18th century supports the acting in an impressive way. Too bad that the soundtrack loses its quality towards the end. Another con is the structure of the plot there are some flashbacks that seem to be forced to add more tension. It does but it is a tick too artificial.Maybe the average rating of this film is correct maybe I don't see the reasons for which many rated the movie so poorly. But I liked it a lot and I think you will too. Give it a try don't hesitate!".

	schema:headline " the return of the black action hero";
	schema:reviewBody "I did a quick search on the internet to see if my memory served me right and apparently it has. By 1981 the Blaxploitation action film was exhausted.  Although Fred Williamson had made a couple of action films in the mid'80s these don't really count because Williamson can't act and can't direct. The good news was that AfricanAmerican cinema could say farewell to a stereotype the bad news was that Hollywood wanted to find some way to say farewell to AfricanAmerican cinema. The mid'80s were lean years for anyone with darkskin in Hollywood. One of the problems had been that people critical of blaxploitation had missed the fact that Hollywood only does two type of films with any regularity the action film Western SciFi crime etc. and the sitcom domestic comedy. The notion that Hollywood does dramatic or otherwise serious films is a myth Hollywood likes to drag out at the Academy Awards. So if you're not making action films or comedies you're not in Hollywood.By the late '80s it was clear to everyone that African Americans now constituting a sizable portion of regular movie audiences were going to have to be represented on film again. But by then it was also clear that this audience wasn't going to tolerate being relegated to pimp and gang roles at least not completely. For one thing Eddie Murphy had broken the blaxploitation mold in 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop. I don't think anybody realizes that Murphy's roles in these films are a basic blaxploitation stereotypes because Murphy clearly wasn't going to let himself be stereotyped. Murphy's popularity and savvy probably caused more anxiety than the anger of Melvin Van Peebles or Richard Pryor ever had because it was clear that he was there to make money something Hollywood could really understand.At any rate In 1988 the Wayans produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka a knockdown parody of the blaxploitation genre that pretty much assured that it would never raise its afrocovered head again. But it was still clear that African Americans needed a new action hero so enter Action Jackson. The reason why this film is not better remembered as the return of the black action hero is clearly because of the script. This is paintbynumbers formula moviemaking this script has been written and filmed a hundred times and every action star in Hollywood has appeared in some version of it all of the Baldwin brothers in turn Sly Stallone Kirk Russell Seagal Schwarzenegger Brandon Lee  I'm sure the reader can fill in the titles of each actor's version regardless how unmemorable the films may have been. This formula was a kind of riteofpassage for anyone wanting to make action films in the late '80s  early '90s. So why not Carl Weathers?Actually Weathers' performance in this film is quite good. It's hard to come up with a bonebreakingrulebreaking cop who also happens to be suave and savvy think part Dirty Harry part James Bond but Weathers nearly pulls it off. The decision not to play him with a 'blackenglish' accent and with no chip on his shoulder were exactly the qualities needed to leave the whole blaxploitation question away from the film at the time it was made. There are also some important ethnic transgressions here  we first find Vanity as the new mistress of the white badguy whereas it's clear that Sharon stone's character has had a fling with Carl weathers'. Essentially then the film portrays a fantasy Detroit where racism has indeed become a thing of the past that its all but forgotten. If only that were really true! But again that was exactly what was needed to get African Americans back into action films  i.e. back into Hollywood.The direction of the film is fairly tight. The characters are so two dimensional it may not be noticeable but the performances are all pretty solid the whole film is professionally produced and presented. Also two years before everybody in America would discover who Jackie Chan was and that he came from somewhere called Hong Kong there are some terrific stunts in this film. And I noticed that other critics have reported that both Sharon Stone and Vanity get naked in this movie frankly I find such comments tasteless. On the other hand there's no denying the attraction some men will feel for such important examples of women taking proper care of their health.But the main point is the film should be preserved if for now other reason than because it was indeed the return to the mainstream of the strong AfricanAmerican male hero and we still need that in the cinema and always have.".

This is paintbynumbers formula moviemaking this script has been written and filmed a hundred times and every action star in Hollywood has appeared in some version of it all of the Baldwin brothers in turn Sly Stallone Kirk Russell Seagal Schwarzenegger Brandon Lee  I'm sure the reader can fill in the titles of each actor's version regardless how unmemorable the films may have been. This formula was a kind of riteofpassage for anyone wanting to make action films in the late '80s  early '90s. So why not Carl Weathers?Actually Weathers' performance in this film is quite good. It's hard to come up with a bonebreakingrulebreaking cop who also happens to be suave and savvy think part Dirty Harry part James Bond but Weathers nearly pulls it off. The decision not to play him with a 'blackenglish' accent and with no chip on his shoulder were exactly the qualities needed to leave the whole blaxploitation question away from the film at the time it was made. There are also some important ethnic transgressions here  we first find Vanity as the new mistress of the white badguy whereas it's clear that Sharon stone's character has had a fling with Carl weathers'. Essentially then the film portrays a fantasy Detroit where racism has indeed become a thing of the past that its all but forgotten. If only that were really true! But again that was exactly what was needed to get African Americans back into action films  i.e. back into Hollywood.The direction of the film is fairly tight. The characters are so two dimensional it may not be noticeable but the performances are all pretty solid the whole film is professionally produced and presented. Also two years before everybody in America would discover who Jackie Chan was and that he came from somewhere called Hong Kong there are some terrific stunts in this film. And I noticed that other critics have reported that both Sharon Stone and Vanity get naked in this movie frankly I find such comments tasteless. On the other hand there's no denying the attraction some men will feel for such important examples of women taking proper care of their health.But the main point is the film should be preserved if for now other reason than because it was indeed the return to the mainstream of the strong AfricanAmerican male hero and we still need that in the cinema and always have.";

Action Jackson was just one of those movies and I am glad to say that while it is most certainly dumb and as predictable as a parking meter it's just goofy enough to be fun. A lot of people think that when a critic calls a film cheesy they mean it's bad. Not necessarily my naive friends. Everyone likes to eat cheese every now and then right? Heck one of my alltime favorite foods is macaroni and cheese! Sure we all like to pretend that we have refined tastes munching on caviar and other such sophisticated vittles but every now and then we just have to let our hair down and have a nice slice of good American cheese. And trust me folks Action Jackson is just dripping with the stuff. Just look at the plot A former lieutenant known for his hot temper and loose cannon tactics is reduced to a desk job check. He has a bookish superior who likes to play by the rules and refuses to let our hero see some action until he shapes up check. Then suddenly a new case opens up  it seems that the same man who cost Action Jackson's lieutenant position is up to his old tricks but no one suspects him because he's a respected businessman check. Will Action Jackson uncover the villain's dastardly plot save the day get the chick who he at first thought was annoying and get that lucrative lieutenant position back? What do you think?! Come on this is as by the numbers as you can get people. This story has been done hundreds of times and yet here it's still simple dorky fun. Action Jackson is played by the man who trained Sylvesyer Stallone in the original Rocky and Craig Coach T. Nelson himself is the bad guy. And to top it all off VANITY is the romantic love interest! I could not believe it when her named popped up on the screen. Now I own two movies starring this horrible actress Today's feature and the John Stamos spy disaster Never Too Young To Die. What a small world huh? There are explosions car chases groovy 80s tunes and even a hotel manager whose lisp is so obvious that you can't understand a word he says. How can you go wrong? Trust me folks this is not painful in the slightest. Well okay maybe Vanity's two songs can be zipped through via the fast forward button check out her nasty hair! but otherwise Action Jackson is a great Bmovie for those rainy days.".

Leading to big explosions and certain civilian deaths none of which are mentioned again.  People get hit in the face and actually bleed. Happens less on film nowadays than you think.  Cheesy pop music on the soundtrack is justifiable for the fact that it was the 80s the spiritual home of cheesy pop music.  Every character actor in the film is recognisable from another classic film of the era. In the first 10 minutes I saw minor roles filled with actors from Predator Beverly Hills Cop Red Heat Back to the Future and seemingly half of the cast of Die Hard.  We know the big showdown will be a fist fight when we see the Bad Guy training in hand to hand combat.  A good body double can make you think that a 60 year old is a karate machine why don't we ever manage to see his face while he pulling off these athletic moves?  Stunt men are plentiful and disposable and unnecessary CGI is not needed.  Movies were 80 minutes long and had a beginning middle and end.Final Rating  6  10. None of the above things are bad. Action Jackson is not in the same league as Lethal Weapon Die Hard and their peers but it is a solid formula action comedy which proves that Carl Weathers had genuine on screen likability.".

There's the guilty pleasure I have watching Carl Weathers trying to be tough.

Again for some sad reason I find her really alluring. Never mind she's a former crackwhre turned born again evangelical preacher in this movie she's got a sexy little body and a smoky bedroom voice. Nice.Another thing is I always believe Craig T Nelson when he plays a sleaze. Check him out in Devil's Advocate. I can picture him sipping Maker's Mark bourbon while he jacks off to the latest Hustler Barely Legal issue. The guy just creeps me out.And I must say I enjoyed seeing Biff from Back to the Future as the dumb cop. Priceless.For all it's good points though it really is very forgettable fare. Even now having only watched it two days ago I'm struggling to remember the action scenes. I think it was really a misguided attempt to launch Carl Weathers into a leading man career of his own after he did okay jobs in things like Predator ie when his role was MUCH smaller. Sadly when compared to other actioners of the time like Commando Lethal Weapon Die Hard it is a mediocre effort at best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely ludicrous implausible and outrageously unrealistic action film and it's a hell of a lot of fun! Carl Weathers finally had his chance to be the lead star of an action film as a Detroit cop of a distinguished reputation. Problem is he just can't seem to stay out of trouble. Craig T Nelson is a wealthy businessman involved in killing union members of AWA this isn't exactly a crackerjack plot rife with politics worthy of any intellectual investment and Weathers' Action Jackson was responsible for his son's imprisonment. A demotion due to a backlash regarding his work in that case has left Jackson basically in a rather unflattering cop position where his true desire is to be lieutenant again. Meanwhile Nelson's blondeheaded Dellaplane continues to use a group of assassins known as The Invisible Man to get rid of unioneers that stand in his way of orchestrating a coup where he's calling the shots of the AWA behind a man of his choosing. Jackson joins forces with a sexy lounge singing heroine addict she comes along reluctantly but this serves as a wakeup call to her when Dellaplane had a bomb rigged to kill her in her apartment in the hopes of keeping her alive and getting to Dellaplane. The actress formerly known as Vanity wasn't much of a thespian but she does look mighty delish in a skintight lounge dress. She even shows her tits for us. There's no doubt she was a feast for the eyes. This was during that period before Sharon Stone broke out in Basic Instinct and she was still trying to find the actress she'd become. Here she is a looker but her acting leaves much to be desired. It was clear she was hired for her beauty. Her fate is no surprise as her accidental snooping isn't about to make Dellaplane just avoid dealing with any chance of his plans being ruined by Action Jackson.This cast has some 80s faces in it that should amuse action fans. Like Nicholas Worth Darkman as a security guard Branscombe Richmond you guessed it he gets his ass kicked again and Miguel Nunez Friday the 13th Part Five and Shadowzone as thugs in a pool hall as well as Charles Meshack was the big brute Arnie kills in the airplane in Commando Brian Libby the Frankenstein experiment psycho Chuck Norris has to contend with in Silent Rage as a security guard of Nelson's and gravelvoiced Fat Williams as a former boxer pal of Jackson's. Bill Duke of Predator and Commando is Jackson's superior who grows tired of Jackson's wreckage and Robert Davi is a high school friend of Jackson's who gets offed by Dellaplane because he knows too much. Sonny Landham has a small part as a knifewielding drug supplier that Jackson tosses out of the apartment window into another apartment window across the street! Thomas Wilson Back to the Future's antagonist Biff is a cop wanting to achieve Jackson's lofty position in the police force.Want to see Jackson leap a moving taxi without touching it landing on his feet? Want to see Jackson drive a Ferrari up the stairs of a mansion? Want to see Jackson and Vanity leap from a window into the retractable roof of a convertible and get away without even a bruise? This is the kind of action film where the body count couldn't be high enough there isn't a limit on how many cars are destroyed or wreck and no matter how many times you punch the hero he seems to recover without showing any longterm effects. The fact that Nelson is a master martial artist can operate such a criminal enterprise with little resistance from the police and shoot a woman and just dump her body in Jackson's home with no serious ramifications of law enforcement questioning him with any clear provocation tells you all you need to know about what kind of action film this is. This kills brain cells and requests that you forget the notion of looking at the film with any sort of real scrutiny. This is about Weathers and that chiseled athletic action hero physique hurling big bodied bruisers through doors hanging onto moving cars without being slung off despite them going at advanced speeds around curves and hitting other cars in traffic spots encountered and a woman at his side who gives us something to salivate over. Vanity's ability to emote may not be her greatest attribute but her slinky figure sure isn't a liability either. Still it was nice to see Weathers get his own action movie even if he never benefited by a studio push he obviously deserved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carl Weathers displays his winning charm in yet another title role. Weathers IS Detroit cop Jericho Action Jackson  and you know with a nickname like that he doesn't mess around. Evil megalomaniacal auto magnate Peter Dellaplane is killing off AWA Auto Workers Alliance members in order to keep a stranglehold on his alreadyimpressive power. Dellaplane and Jackson have a past as Jackson was demoted after roughing up his son before sending him to prison. Ignoring the fact that his wife is Sharon Stone in her prime years of hotness Dellaplane also has a chick on the side Sydney Vanity who he keeps drugged up with heroin. Sydney and Jackson now must team up to take down Dellaplane before he can frame Jackson for his many murders.Ah the golden 80's. Just take a second to pause and reflect about that magical decade. Back to the review at hand Action Jackson is classic 80's action reminiscent of Arnold vehicles such as Raw Deal 1986. It's wellshot and unusually wellwritten with plenty of clever jokes and dialogue. But the film also has all the action the underground action movies have but this came out in a time when things like this came to the theater and had a moderatetobig budget behind them.Besides the aforementioned Sharon Stone and Vanity Weathers has an impressive cast to back him up Bill Duke as the classic BYC Black Yelling Chief Thomas F. Wilson Biff of Back to the Future 1985 fame as the joketelling uniformed officer Bob Minor as the evil assassin Gamble Nicholas Worth as Dellaplane's butler Al Leong as Dellaplane's chauffeur James Lew as Dellaplane's martial arts instructor Charles Meshack of Fear 1988 fame Sonny Landham and the ubiquitous Branscombe Richmond. It even has fan favorite Robert Davi in a small but important role. Last but not least is the Coach himself Craig T. Nelson looking more diabolical than usual probably because of the hair. We even get to see him do some CraigFu  but does he really think he can beat Action Jackson in a fight? The movie is funny snappy and a great vehicle for Weathers' charisma. But what else would you expect from director Baxley the man behind Stone Cold 1991 and I Come In Peace 1990 among many others? It's a product of a great time for cinema  and it's also filled with great music especially the title song by Madame X which you'll be singing for days. It's pretty tough to dislike this highly entertaining gem.for more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

He's pretty decent though and Ranieri who I'd personally never seen before is actually pretty good. For the record the movie doesn't actually ever give in to its homosexual undercurrents but they do kind of waste a pair of beautiful Euroactresses who seem to only be there to distract from the potentially gay relationship between the male leads. Marisa Mell is pretty much completely wasted as an older married woman the Dallesandro character is sleeping with. Eleanora Giorgi has a bigger part and fullfrontal nude scenes but doesn't have much more to do as Ranieri's love interest. The director is none other than Aldo Lado who was also responsible for Short Night of Glass Dolls Who Saw Her Die? and The Night Train Murders.

This leads him to get paid off but he does meet up with Joe again and after being charmed by Joe's confidence and ambition lets him stay at his apartment.Looks like a bromance is blossoming although the way Joe walks about the place in the nude made me think Joe was wanting to take things a little further. Joe's excuse for the nudity was that he was having some sort of severe headache due to a prior motorcycle race injury and that he just need fresh air. I didn't think Sandro looked that convinced.Joe teaches Sandro how to bag snatch and grift and before you know it the two of them have stolen a bag from Marzia who doesn't have much money but does own a redhot diary that makes Sandro track her down for a date on the pretence that he found her purse. As you can see so far things aren't that grim in this film. Mostly.Some kind of a plot arrives in the form of Joe's casual lover Marisa Mell He even uses motorcycle dialogue while in the sack!. Marisa needs some money shifted out of the country and when Joe finds out how that's to be done he comes up with a plan for one last heist. He also discovers there's a motorcycle race on so he comes up with a plan for one last motorcycle race...Given the lightweight material of the plot Aldo Lado still manages to keep you interested in what's going on because of the chemistry between Joe and Sandro and let's face it the immense amount of homoeroticism between the two. Even when Marzia gets involved with Sandro she wants Joe to join in! As this is a crime flick and not a comedy there is an increasing amount of violence leading up to the end of the film plus motorcycle racing if that's your thing.".

My favorite characters were Spinelli and T.J.he's so cute! They gave me good adventures for my friends and I to to do at recess when we was bored. My favorite episodes were The Experiment and Mama's Girl. These episodes are classics! Unfortunately they don't make anymore new episodes but I still watch reruns on the Disney channel and Toon Disney when I get a chance to. They bring back memories of Elementry school and how I wish I was still there and not in high school!LOL Recess deserves a full 1010 stars!".

Gretchen the smartest kid in the school REGARDLESS of grade.  Gus the mousy new kid.  Vince the school jock.  Spinnelli the toughest girl if not kid in the school.  Mikey the big kid with the soul of a poet.  Each kid has their own unique personality and strength for the record  I was like Gus while in the fourth grade now I'm probably more like Mikey.  Then there are the suppporting players like the Ashleys who act not unlike the title characters in the movie HEATHERS. Randall the school snitch.  The Diggers named Sam and Dave after the famous singing group.  Upsidedown Girl and Swinger Girl.  Office clerk Menlow does this kid EVER go to class?.  Lawson who is constantly on the losing end of any competition with Vince.  And the Kindergarteners who look and act like escapees from Lord of the Flies. Then there are the grownups of the show  The appropriately named Principal Prickly voiced by Dabney Coleman.  Flowerchild teacher Miss Grolke Alyce Beasley of Moonlighting fame.  And last but certainly not least Miss Finster April Winchell the school disciplinarian described as a 200lb. gargoyle in orthopedic shoes.  Watching this show brings back a lot of memories both good and bad.  It's a trip down Memory Lane worth traveling.".

The series first aired as part of the ABC Kids Saturday Morning schedule from 1997 to 2001and from there repeats aired on both the Disney Channel. The success of the series spawned the first of two features. In 2001Disney releasedRecessSchools Out that became a runaway hit in theatrical release. It was followed by a directtovideo second film titled RecessMiracle on Third Street that same year. In 2003a third entitled Recess Taking The Fifth Grade were also directtovideo.

Recess is about a group of six 4th graders trying to face challenges and make it through the course of a school year. There was TJ a born leader who never backed down from a challenge. There was Gretchen a super genius who knew a lot about science and was the brains of TJs plans. THere was Spinelli a tough girl who always would fight with a lot of people. There was Vince who was the athletic sporty kind of guy. Then there was Mikey the sweet poetic kid who always tried to do the right thing. Lastly there was Guss the new kid and who is sort of timid and shy at times. I thought that each episode was entertaining and I liked the stories in each episode. All six of the main characters had great chemistry together although all of them had different personalities they still got along well.In conclusion this was a great show one of Disney's finest too bad Disney doesn't make shows like this anymore ".

Thank goodness for Virgin whenever it's on on Toon Disney mostly I watch it. Recess is funny and smart and just such joy to watch. The animation is great very colourful and smooth and reminds me of Disney when they were making quality shows like Darkwing Duck and Talespin. There are two kinds of categories where theme tunes fall under one that grates on your nerves and one that is irresistibly catchy. The Recess theme tune falls under the latter for it is wonderful. The scripts are funny and witty and the story lines while mostly taking place in one location are original. The characters are engaging enough TJ is quite mischievous yet he is the sort of boy who you can't help warming to. His friends are feisty Spinelli geeky Gus genius Gretchen giant softie Mike and sporty Vince. I have to say Spinelli is my favourite she is like me in some way in the way she behaves. And there is always room for someone to hate in this case Randall.The teachers are great fun too Principal Prickley while strict and clearly doesn't like TJ is still a fun character while Miss Finster is priceless. All in all I love this show I watch it when it is on on Virgin. 1010 Bethany Cox".

When I was around 9 and Animaniacs was going off the Air I quickly turned to Recess to meet my SMC needs. And boy did it meet them. The best thing about recess is the world which is a richly defined and fleshed out as the world in your average fantasy novel. Kindergarteners are a savage Goldingesquire tribe of natives. Similarly named coolgirls dwell in a tirepile clique house. A girl decked out in goggles and a flight jacket spends every moment of recess trying to go over the bar. Fifth and fourth graders are embroiled in a fierce class war. Nerds and injured children retreat to a basement to play d20 games and use strange construction toys. Popular stickers become a form of currency. A shady trenchcoatclad kid doles out contraband goods and a turbanclad boy doles out useless Zen animal proverbs. Ruling over all this chaos is King Bob a SteelyEyed sixth grader with his own secret service.The characters within this world are great as well. The central cast is a group of sixth T.J Detweiler a capwearing mischief maker and schemer is the de facto leader of the group. Mikey Blumberg is a rotund boy with a poet's soul and Robert Goulet's singing voice. Vince LaSalle is a trashtalking competitive athlete. Gretchen Grundler is a bespectacled Renaissance girl. Spinelli is a stockingcappedpigtailed tomboy with a love of prowrestling and a penchant for violence. Finally Gus The New Kid Griswold is a dorky wetbehind the ears transfer student and an army brat. The adventures they get involved in never cease to be fun. As fun as the students are the Teachers are just as delightful. Muriel Finster is a savage dictator ruling over the playground with an iron fist seeming to always be right where T.J and the gang DON'T need her. Miss Grotke the fourthgrade Home Room teacher is a progressive newagey teacher. Finally president Peter Prickley brilliantly and stuffily voiced by veteran character actor Dabney Coleman rounds out the central faculty ineptly attempting to run the school with Finster always trying to pull the strings.For some reason Disney has decided to release more cruddy Dinsey Channel Star albums and DTV sequels of their movies instead of DVDs of this brilliant show. When it comes though I heartily recommend checking it out.".

It embodies just about how all kids probably felt in their time when they had recess. T.J is the leader and quite a looker. He brings the humor and schemes to the show. Spinelli is the tough chick scared of no one and nothing. She brings the strength. Vince is the athlete he always wins. He brings coolness and determination. Gretchen is the genius. The brain she brings the strategic moves of all the plans. Mikey he is the gentle giant. He brings the heart of the operations. And last Gus the nerd the wimp at times. He brings reality and that no matter how small you are you can be heard. But IMDb has said that it was finished in 2001 but on my television I got shows that have appeared in 2003. Theinfo shows the year the episodes appear and I have 2003 so how can it have been finished in 01. But anyway this show is a classic and there can't be a replica. Recess is a show that shows that all things are possible and that you don't have to be an adult or have money and power to make a difference. And also that your true friends are with you no matter what.".

Then the show was on Disney Channel for a time until new shows premiered. Recess was then moved to Toon Disney channel the immortal land for all of the discarded cartoons. Even if Disney Channel is no longer showing the series they from time to time show the movie Recess School's Out during the summer. I like this show because it puts a creative edge on six kids trying to survive the fourth grade. It uses imaginative characters like King Bob the Ashleys and the Diggers. Every episode deals with something that all of us have had to deal with at sometime in our lives whether its trying to fit in or being unable to stand out. This show is especially good for kids to watch for it shows them that they are not the only kids going through these things.".

In this episode young T.J. denounces the other kids' obsession with the latest fad on the playground Monstickers. But when T.J. realizes that Monstickers are being used as a commodity he sells his prized red cap for just a few of them. Rather than immediately spending his measly allotment as the other kids do he decides to work hard to earn more. Eventually T.J. earns enough money to hire other kids to work for him he then becomes a manager and over time builds himself a monopoly. Overwhelmed with avarice he shuns his friends abandoning the things that once mattered to him most. Economics capitalism work ethic greedall subject matters are presented here in a poignant engaging way. It is television at its best.In The Ratings Game another great episode the popular girls assign ratings to their classmates which everyone takes quite seriously. Those with the low ratings allow themselves to be consumed by isolation and depression while those with the high ratings become condescending and supercilious. Divisiveness results in chaos which finally allows the kids to recognize the meaninglessness of the labels that were originally assigned to them. Promoted here is the existentialist viewpoint that regardless of circumstance we all choose our own individual destinies. Few children's shows manage to be quite this poignant and insightful.At the heart of Recess is a strong diverse cast of characters an element of the show that cannot be overlooked. T.J. is a strong leader Spinelli is outgoing Gus is shy and inhibited Gretchen is brainy Vince is athletic and Mikey is creative. It's hard not to find somebody to relate to.Easy to relate to as well are the situations the characters encounter. The subjects of embarrassment chivalry displacement uncertainty and even profanity are dealt with both sensibly and humorously. Frequently in fact Recess manages to be far cleverer than its adultoriented animated counterparts.It's unlikely we'll find a kids' show quite as smart as Recess any time soon. It will certainly be missed.".

For example as our heroes are flying in to make the rescue don't ask a young female soldier asks the Colonel back at the base Do you think they have a chance sir?  to which the Colonel answers Not a chance in hell but they might make it anyway.  Perhaps the only trite line I did not hear was It's an old trick but it just might work.  Maxwell Smart would have been comfortable in this one.";

Daniel Baldwin walks through this looking like he has a perpetual hangover and is way too overweight to be taken seriously as a military pilot. He must have been desperate for work at the time. I once served in the Army Rangers with Tim Abell which is why I kept watching this. While he will never be mistaken for Olivier Tim has made a name for himself as a notable Bactor and he seems to find a lot of work.

	schema:reviewBody "Valeria is valiant in this her second directorial effort. She has tried to represent a person who may be embarrassingly like herself an actress of stage and screen with serious self doubts unmarried on the cusp of forty childless and pushing the limits of her biological clock starring in a play she can't get the hang of one from which the actress in real life was fired. She has enlisted a highly qualified cast including her pal and collaborator Nomie Lvovsky coauthor here Matthieu Amalric Louis Garrel her own mother Marysa Borini as her mother and Louis Garrel's rather awesome grandfather Maurice. Unfortunately the whole effort is a bust not only the playwithinthemovie but the movie itself. Somehow Bruni Tedeschi manages to make her role and the film at the same time both heavyhanded and vague. Marcelline Bruni Tedeschi wants to have a child and prays constantly to the Virgin Mary for help. She might try finding a boyfriend. Instead she's pursued by her annoying nag of a mother who natters on in Italian to a friendthese scenes mildly comic but also rather superfluous and shows such selfdoubt in approaching a play she's to star in Turgenev's 'A Month in the Country' that she can't even say whether she's lefthanded or righthanded when pressed by the annoying director Denis Amalric. People say he's gay why then does he practically try to rape her when she has one of her frequent neurotic fitsthis time over the color of a dressand tries to walk out of the role? Amalric is a remarkable very often compulsively watchable actor. But he can bug you sometimes and his mixture of belligerence and craziness this time only makes him one more French cinematic theatrical clich. Where is Jacque Rivette when we need him? He'd have had a light touch and probably expanded the role of the play and made it a fascinating counterpoint to the other action. Here that possibility of subtle parallels is only gestured at the same bits from the play being repeated over and over. Eventually after rehearsals and the opening Marcelline does walk off just as a performance is supposed to begin. By then it's too late. The screenplay is chronologically misconceived.ric Louis Garrel who plays the young tutor Belyaev who Marcelline's character falls in love with in the play falls in love with her for real. Young Garrel has fun with his small role managing his usual sultriness effortlessly and subtle about his declarations. But they're wasted on Marcelline. Or is it just bad luck that she thinks ric's gotten involved with a younger woman at the end? Maurice Garrel who's usually cast as a dead or dying man these days appears briefly as Marcelline's dead father. There's another dead person or rather a person who never lived Natalia Petrovna the character Marcelline is playing as represented by Valeria Golino. It's hard to see how any of this business fits in because everything has started off on the wrong track.Nomie Lvovsky and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi make an odd contrast certainly not one that is to the benefit of Bruni Tedeschi.The thing is Bruni Tedeschi does come through as wooden just as the characters tell her she is a Swiss lake a former lover called her and Lvovsky has an appealing funkiness a slight comic edge to her. Lvovsky's character Nathalie Marcelline's former acting school classmate and Denis' collaborator in putting on the play is the one who takes over the lead role when Marcelline walks away from it. Nathalie is unfulfilled professionally perhaps matrimonially but she does have a husband and young kids. Then one day she announces she's madly in love with Denis. That's when we're told he's gay. She doesn't care. Neither do we. But what we do care about is that Lvovsky is soulful and appealing. She makes us wonder why Bruni Tedeschi should be at the center of the filmwhich gravitates to Lvovsky every time she's on screen.There's something going on with swimming and music with some pretentious uses of The Marriage of Figaro and some rather peppy use of big band swingand through it all somehow exactly how it's hard to say the hint that a suicide attempt may actually be a new beginning. But that's the end of the moviea freezeframe in midbreaststroke.Frankly everything about this film feels misfired. It starts off on the wrong foot. It makes its points far too heavyhandedly. It's stardirector is unappealing. You want to shake her and point to Louis Garrel and say Go girl he wants you get laid! What does she think the virgin Mary is going to do provide her with a virgin birth too? Some of the other projects Bruni Tedeschi has been associated with have not impressed much. To wit working backwards Ridley Scott's 2006 'A Good Year' not a good film. Nobuhiro Suwa's insufferably boring 2005 'A Perfect Couple''Un couple parfait' Ducastel and Martineau's underwhelming 'Cote d'Azur''Crustacs et coquillages' same year. Whether or not you liked the movie I did not her role in Spielberg's 2005 busy year! 'Munich' was minor. Sheis central to Ozon's pretentious misfired '5x2' 2004. Her rather odd role in Ozon's much better 'Le temps qui reste' is touching in its way.".

	schema:reviewBody "ALL TOGETHER Et si on vivait tous ensemble? is an important French film written and directed by Stphane Robelin that addresses the ever more important question of aging. People are living longer and while that has its benefits it also poses problems not only for the aging population who must learn to cope with their diminishing facilities but also for the families of those who may not be content with their fading importance and individuality. In other words how will we each cope with getting old without loved ones that are willing to hold our hand and be comfortably at our side until the end? Films such as this are being created more frequently The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel form this year also addressed similar issues as The Bucket Plan and other in the recent past. Where ALL TOGETHER differs is in the honest way the feelings and expectations and coping codes are managed with dignity without losing the lightness of comedy.Annie Geraldine Chaplin Jean Guy Bedos are a married couple who live in a home large enough to accommodate others their grandchildren no longer visits a fact the Annie feels could be rectifies by building a swimming pool but Jean objects Claude Claude Berhnard is reaching 75 and since his wife died he has been satisfying his needs with hookers until a heart attack impedes his performance abilities and he must seek pharmacologic enhancement Albert Pierre Richard has Alzheimer's and is increasingly forgetful while his wife Jeanne Jane Fonda is hiding the fact that she has terminal cancer while at the same time planning her own rather lighthearted pink coffin funeral. These five 70ish people have been friends for over forty years. But they are growing old and old age tends to be synonymous with reduced autonomy loss of memory illness retirement home and worst of all separation. One day one of the five friends suggests saying no to isolation and loneliness what if they lived together? How this group of friends with their accompanying old secrets and jealousies interact in the new development of living in Annie and Jean's home  with the added assistance from young ethnology student Dirk Daniel Brhl who happens to be writing a thesis on the aging population  results in many credible tender stories of need and interaction in the 'golden years.'

	schema:reviewBody "Old age is a wreckage Charles de Gaulle once said. A statement which is verified in certain cases for instance if you have to live the very end of your life alone weakened by illness and forsaken by others but should not be considered unavoidable. This is at least the central thesis of this pleasant movie directed by Stphane Robelin his second feature after Real Movie 2004. One of the solutions to this difficult problem lies is the very title of the film Et si on vivait tous ensemble ? What about living all together ? in other words join forces with friends of your age when you are old and support one another so as to make life easier and more enjoyable. This interesting theme is dealt with quite competently and surprisingly so by Stphane Robelin a director in his late thirties more likely to take an interest in the problems adults of his age have to go through than to examine the hardships of the third and fourth ages. Young adults are not forgotten for that matter with the character of Dirk a German ethnologist who has settled down in the Colins' house to study the community formed by the group of old friends notably his difficult relationships with a girl companion who will not accept him as he is . But Robelin concentrates the bulk of his attention on the five old chaps and manages to tell us on the difficulties linked to old age loss of memory illness sex being cut off from one's children and grandchildren the conditions in old people's home the nearness of death etc. without falling into complacent pessimism. Instead he makes the right choice of a dynamic approach to the issue by suggesting a possible solution. And isn't it known for a fact that a light tone just like the Spoonful of Sugar of the song helps the medicine go down is a much more powerful ferment for thought than the spectacle of despair ? As for the way out of old age problems suggested by the film you can find it debatable overoptimistic unrealistic or valid only for too limited a number of people but you cannot deny that it paves the way for fruitful discussions of a major social issue andor selfreflection. The second strong point of the movie is undoubtedly its amazing cast. In what other French comedy indeed can you find brought together so many great international talents as in Et si on vivait tous ensemble ?. The answer is easy  none. For those who love actors seeing Guy Bedos Claude Rich Jane Fonda Geraldine Chaplin Pierre Richard in one of the most poignant roles of his career and Daniel Brhl work together is a real treat. As a conclusion you would be well advised not to skip such a worthwhile effort. Unless you have any objection against a movie that is at the same time wonderfully well acted intelligent funny and moving!".

They decide spontaneously in the spirit of their 60's rebel years to beat the system and live together taking care of each other. A boy hired to walk the dogs turns out to be an ethnologist and he starts observing them in order to determine 'how Europe deals with its elderly'.Every one of the five friends has longings and flaws and the movie keeps from judging them which is quite beautiful. For example one is a womanizer in his last years resorting to the care of prostitutes which is nearly his undoing but never is his behavior portrayed as evil all human flaws are first of all human.Acting always shows tension between vanity and shamelessness. These five actors have reached an age in which the vanity has changed in to its meaning vain. All five give a depth and humor and realism to each role that astounds. Maybe Fonda is the only one that demanded wardrobe approval and is sometimes dressed as a twenty year old. A good film has three things a message a good story and great acting. This one scores high on those three points the message so profound and so topical is never lampooned or annoying. The story is well crafted and keeps the right balance between humor and drama often using two at the same time. An inundation is both comical and tragic. And as mentioned before the acting is great no one is trying to be an Actor or reaching for an Award I assume the must love their characters after the filming.Please see this movie as it makes a profound point on the future of us all how to live how to take care of our last years.

	schema:headline " Average Adaptation of Stendhal's Famed Novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This adaptation of one of Stendhal's most famous novels is solid but not particularly inspiring. The notions of bravery and valour depicted will be anathema to most modern viewers and the acting is often stilted.The cinematography is not particularly strong except in a few action set pieces such as the duel and the gaolbreak sequence.There are a few other nice moments such as the contrasting scene of the prisoner listening to the joyful music by the carolers outside his cell and the film shines a spotlight on the corrupt nature of the Roman Catholic Church and episcopalhierarchical churches in general where bishops are more like politicians than shepherds. Indeed one of the themes of many of Stendhal's works is the notion that the military and the Roman Catholic Church are almost interchangeable. Casting the Church in this light made his writings extremely controversial at the time of their publication.Ultimately though this film is talky and stilted almost reminiscent of the stodgy BBC television literary adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s. Disappointing.".
